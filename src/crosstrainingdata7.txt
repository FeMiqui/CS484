1. 	Love this bath seat! I have been using this daily for my newborn since he was a few weeks old and he is over three months old now. I use it 2 ways: 1) I put this on the bathroom counter next to the sink when I want to wipe his face or give him a quick wipe down and 2) I use this in our regular bathtub when I give him a bath. The slightly angled seat is perfect to support the baby's back/head. The seat design allows me to reach to the back of his neck to wipe the hard-to-reach parts. The sloping seat also enables me to shampoo his hair and give him a bath without another pair of hands to help.The suction cup at the bottom ensures that the seat doesn't budget from either the counter or the big bathtub. My baby feels secure and makes bathtime an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this any parents!	
1. 	My daugter is 6 months and cannot stay in one place for long, but when I put her in this she absolutely loves it. If she gets bored of one thing she moves on to the next and she already seems to know how to make the animal sound effects/classical music work the way she wants it to.The only thing I dislike about this product is that the dragon hand puppet and the seat isn't removable so that I can wash them.	
1. 	I didn't think I needed a mirror for my car but after stressing with a fussing baby I couldn't see while driving I quickly changed my mind! This mirror works great! I have a newer Toyota Camry and it fits around the backseat headrest great. The mirror is a little stiff so it takes a moment to get it to swivel into place but that is good, on bumps it doesn't loose it's adjustment. The size is great too, just right.	
1. 	Unlike many of the reviewers, I exclusively pump--that is, my son only gets breast milk, but I do not nurse him.  I have the hospital grade Medela pump, which is fantastic--I get plenty of milk without nursing, and am even able to pump extra to store.I bought this pump because I've run into trouble a couple times when I was away from the house for longer than expected.  My regular pump has to be plugged in (it does not run on batteries) so it's hard to carry around.  I bought this pump because it is easy to throw into the diaper bag in case of 1) engorgement or 2) needing a bottle while I'm out.Although I'm not a fan of handpumping and have not used other manual pumps, I've found this one easy to use.  Basically it works just like like the hospital grade--and I get just as much milk, just as quickly, with this pump!  The design is so comfortable that I have even pumped while driving home one day when I got stuck in major rush-hour traffic.  Being able to use it left-handed or right-handed is a huge plus.I give it only four stars because the silicon part on the handle has a tendency to get loose and I lose suction in the middle of pumping.Note for Avent bottle users:  You can buy, for about $10.00, a set of adaptors (I bought mine at Buy Buy Baby) that allow you to attach the wide Avent bottles right to this or any of the other similarly styled Medela pumps.	
1. 	I found these small bottles the best way to store breastmilk and you can feed directly from this bottle by simply putting a nipple on or transfer easily to another bottle.  They store well in the freezer and fit easily into our bottle warmer.	
- 1	I am so disappointed.  I don't know if I got a faulty product but these did not stick to any window.  I tried two different cars and they did not stay at all.  Also, the wide frame was twisted from the packaging it came in.  I will not be using these.	
- 1	The product as a whole is ok - we only needed something to hung our own little toys for our baby who was too small to grab anything yet, so anything that had this frame structure was fine. It did serve the purpose, however, the music box was unbearable. It has a very busy series of red and blue flashing lights with equally busy music, and as someone else previously commented, I would worry about it possibly provoking seizures in young infant (and I am a pediatrician). We did try it on briefly on our 3 months old over 2 days, and both times she started crying excessively afterwards and was inconsolable for quite a while. The music is also very much like a video game, fast and annoying, keeps changing every few seconds (one tune starts and abruptly stops after a few seconds, then a completely different tune would begin, right after another, with flashing lights). And even if she liked it, we would go crazy with that kind of music and flashing lights. I seriously wonder who would design something like that for a baby, and was amazed how many people seemed to have like it.We are still using the frame and toys, but ditched the music/light device altogether, which was a shame. I rarely leave reviews on Amazon, but decided to this time as I wish I read a review like this before I bought it.	
1. 	It's freaking waterproof! And it fits a mini crib. It's great, because you can put it under your normal sheets, and then when your baby wets the bed, you can just toss it in the wash. It's easier than having to worry about cleaning the mattress.	
1. 	A friend of mine has this blanket and our 2 boys always want to sit on THAT blanket!! We finally got our own and I'm sooo excited to use it! JJ Cole makes another awesome product! One of the few companies that it is obvious the people who use these products actually test them....MOMS!!!! It is a HUGE 5ft x 5ft. When folded up it's 10 inches tall x 16 inches wide...looks bigger to me than pictured but I still love it- I also LOVE the generous pocket on the outside that the description does not mention! Has a shoulder strap that is removeable and looks very durable. Material blanket is made out of is a water &#34;resistant&#34; material- has wiped clean and easy every time we used my friend's last summer! Cool to sit on too (heat wise) and the patterns are pretty cool too!! This will FOR SURE be my next &#34;go to&#34; baby shower gift!!!	
1. 	My teething son was chewing on his crib rail, and would come away with little flecks of paint all around his mouth, which can't have been healthy.  Now he still chews, but no harm done, to him or to the crib (convertible to a toddler and twin bed that my son will use for a long time.)It was annoying to have to clean the rail with alcohol before sticking the gummy cover to the crib, but overall, it took just a few minutes to install, and the toddler hasn't pulled it off, even though he probably could if he really wanted to.  I bought two packs, but only used one, since he only chewed on the front rail.  I've decided to keep the second roll. If we have a second child, I'll put this on the crib BEFORE baby starts teething.	
1. 	Bought these after reading a review about using them for multiple purposes.  I do not use a diaper without one of these doublers.  They are great for sanitary pads as well, although should be used with some sort of waterproof layer between pad and panties.  I have yet to use them for hot/cold pack.  I will be buying more of these!	
1. 	these work good.  go with the bottle.  stops leaks.  you can pump out a bottle, pop one of these little babies under the screw on rim, grab a spare nipple and you are ready to go!	
1. 	My daughter loves these, especially in the bath.  She is fascinated by the water coming out of the holes in the bottom and never seems to tire of collecting them all around her and putting them in her mouth.  She also splashes the water with them and bangs them together.  TOTALLY worth the $.	
- 1	I bought this and it was perfect for the summer weather and fit comfortably, easy to put on and take off. But don't try to breastfeed or wear it during take off or landing in an airplane unless you take it off completely!!! There is a sharp pointy piece centered on the color coded part of the straps. Run your finger underneathe. That part cut my baby's head and made it bleed during take off, after the flight attendant informed me that flight regulations state that you CANNOT restrain your lap infant during take off or landing. I was not informed of this a month prior when I flew a different airline. So I unlatched the carrier and just let it hang down while I held my infant in my arms. All of a sudden my baby started screaming continuously. I assumed it was from pressure in his ears but he had flown before and didn't cry once. After frustration and tears from him and I both, I took off the carrier completely, stood up and faced him away from me, that was when I discovered the cut with blood. I panicked and immediately started feeling around the seat, my shirt, and anything else that could have possibly cut him. Then I ran my fingers along the part of the carrier that was right at the level of his head when he was screaming and that's when I noticed. They should have a RECALL on this model. Got asked if I wanted another model or refund from the company but not before I bought a different brand.	
- 1	I can't remember how old our daughter was when we got some of these for her snacks. Maybe 9 months. But within minutes she learned she could push into it along the edges, flip it upside down, and shake all the contents out onto the floor or wherever she was. We may as well have given the snacks to her in a cup without a lid.My wife picked up a Munchie Mug (Munchie Mug - The New Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Made in the USA. - BPA Free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top) and this one did the trick! Our daughter can reach her hand into it and pull out a piece of snack or two, but she can't empty the entire contents. Yes, it costs more, but I'm willing to pay more for superior products that actually get the job done.We will still use these Munchkin ones on occasion when the other snack mug is dirty or we can't find it, but we always use them reluctantly. Save yourself a lot of hassle and get the Munchie Mug instead	
1. 	Love this. Low profile enough to easily slide under our table, convenient fold and go feature, cleans easily. Baby likes that he can actually sit at the table next to me while I study or eat, not just in a high chair next to the table. If I want to use it like a traditional high-chair I still can though. Just snap on the tray and use it on its own.	
1. 	We purchased these to secure a large mirror and bookcase to keep our toddler safe.  My husband said these were pretty easy to install (and he's not the handy type) and that they took no time at all.  They are secure to the wall and piece of furniture and I'm confident that the furniture will not topple over when my toddler is pulling and leaning on it.	
1. 	These are the best price on disposable diaper sacks that I've seen anywhere online or in stores. They work great for what they are supposed to do.	
- 1	I purchased this product knowing I will be making my own baby food, and this should be of some assistance in the process. I loved it... it mashes fruits very well, is easy to serve from and clean with a brush. I was going to purchase another one and stumbled upon  the negative reviews. I was horrified when I found out this was made with #7 plastic, and the health risks it poses to my baby. I used it for over two months but have since stopped and WILL NOT be using this to crush my baby's food. I hope in that period of using it my baby wasn't exposed too much to the chemicals contained within to cause any permanent harm. I will rather be safe and use a fork or spoon to crush foods. It's really cute and eye-catching though... Don't be fooled.	
- 1	I was excited to get this item, but it broke  during the first use and the amount of weight was not the issue. It was a bummer.	
- 1	This diaper has a great design and cute prints, but I think the quality is inferior to Grovia and Bumgenius.  A minor issue is that the PUL doesn't feel as nice and quality (which it should for such and expensive product).  I also wish it were more stretchy.  The MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR issue is that the rise snaps kept popping open.  My son was between the small and middle settings, so when the rise opened up while he was wearing it I could see clear through the crotch of the diaper.  This demonstrates very poor quality control and I have heard of others encountering similar issues.  I also found the snaps small and hard to fasten compared to Grovia, Bumgenius, Thirsties, Best Bottom etc.  Hopefully in the future Blueberry will resolve these issues!	
- 1	I was so excited to order this swing. My sister raves about her Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing. I ordered this one instead because it plugged into the wall.When I got it I was very pleased with the colors. It looked so nice and the assembly was pretty quick and easy.However, it would barely swing with the baby in it. Since we already have traditional swing from subsequent children I was really puzzled. The highest swing setting was comparable to the lowest on my other swing. Baby was not happy after being used to faster motion.So I boxed it up and will be returning it tomorrow. So far the return process to amazon has been very smooth and easy. Go Amazon! I choose to get a refund as the replacement would have been the same swing and after reading some of these review it might not have been defective after all. I might have to try out my sisters in person before I decide if I will reorder the Ocean Wonders.	
- 1	This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!	
1. 	OK - my husband used to leave restaraunts when a couple with a baby in a diaper came in, but he doesn't even mind emptying the Diaper Champ at all.  (I know that's mostly because he's responsibile for those diapers now, but it's still a great product!)  We have NEVER noticed a diaper odor anywhere, not even while replacing the bag.Every time one of my husband's friends' wives gets pregnant, my husband buys the guy the Diaper Champ, AND THEY ALL LOVE IT!We have much less diaper odor than my firends with same-age babies have with Diaper Genie.  Also, they say that when you change bags in Diaper Genie, the stench is unbearable.  There isn't a bag-changing smell with Diaper Champ, because the diapers do get some air when the top is flipped to add a diaper.  Aerobic decomposition smells better than anaerobic decomposition, and whatever is going on in there, you smell it when you change bags.We do empty it twice a week (it gets full that often, anyway).It did get stuck a couple of times when it was WAY TOO FULL.  Letting it get too full and leaving it too long may contribute to odor issues, too.Not having to buy special bags saves us lots of time, hassle, and money.I do have one friend who retired hers to the back porch because of odor.  Her daughter was nearly two years old by then, and the contents of her diapers are a lot different from the contents of an infant's diapers.	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
- 1	Being my first experience with breast feeding, I didn't know there are different sizes of flanges.  I bought this one and it was painful to pump.  Luckily a friend was visiting and told me the flange was too small.  So I called AVENT and was told I couldn't buy a different size, they only used a one size fits all breasts model.  When I said, well this will not work for me, the customer service immediately took my information, emailed me a prepaid label to mail the pump back to them.  Once it arrived, they credited me the entire amount of the product.During this same time, I did find another breast pump that had a number of different sizes of flanges (yes, I bought them all to try out)!  To help you, this website gives the sizes:  [...]Overall, the product didn't work for me.  BUT the customer service couldn't have been better!!!	
1. 	They do the job. They're keeping baby's fingers from getting in those darn sockets! I think they're pretty easy to pull out as well.	
- 1	We currently have four of these gates installed in our home. Personally, no one in our home has tripped over the bottom support rail. I don't see how you could unless you drag your feet when you walk. These gates do have a couple of potential downfalls. When you allow them to auto close, it's really loud. Like wake your kid up from her nap at the other end of the house loud. Also, the other day I was a bit aggressive lifting up on one of the gates when I opened it and the screw that holds the top hinge together popped out and the whole gate came up out of the frame. Let me say though, I was trying to open it quickly and jerked the gate up much harder than a person would with normal use. I like that you have to lift the gate to open it. Keeps our smallest child from being able to open it but the older kids can manage it just fine. That lift to open feature is one reason why I wouldn't recommend it for the top of stairs. It would be difficult.Update: February 2013. I was a fan of these gates in the beginning. After a lot of use, they are losing their auto close function. Not that bid of a deal, my hands aren't broken, I can certainly take two seconds to close a baby gate. What I am becoming irritated with is the failure that I wrote about in my initial review. We have now had all four gates come completely off their frames multiple times. Other than the instance I wrote about previously, I am not strong arming these gates, this shouldn't be happening. The problem is that the post on the top of the gate that fits into the frame is made of plastic. The screw that hold said gate post in the frame is metal. The plastic post has cracked on every single gate and the metal screw is popping out, thus allowing the gate to come completely off the frame when opened. The gate comes off, the metal screw goes flying one way, the metal spring goes flying another and I am left on hands and knees looking for these two pieces before the baby finds them and chokes on them. Not impressed.I don't see a way for this to be fixed. We can't uncrack the plastic post, the only way to fix it is to get a new gate. Unless Munchkin can figure out a way to reinforce the plastic post or make it out of a different material, I don't see how this won't happen after time on a replacement.	
- 1	The first pack I bought was great. The second pack was sewn oddly in more of an oval shape (rather than a circle). I didn't think much of it until I washed the second pack and there was an odd ridge/fold/crease on the fleece-side that goes right across the middle! I'm not sure if one of the sides shrank so the two layers aren't even now. It makes the pads nearly unusable because it puts odd pressure on your nipples [thinks of seam on a piece of clothing]. I don't know if I got an odd pack or what. Not sure whether I want to chance it with a third pack to see if the second was a fluke. The first pack is holding up decently, though using lanolin does make for some pilling of the fleece, but it is more of a cosmetic issue (which I don't care about). It doesn't make the pads uncomfortable.These pads do dry well in the dryer. Another brand of reusable pads (all cotton) never feel like they dry all the way.*** Update: These pads definitely are rough once you wash a few times and the fleece pills. :(	
1. 	The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!	
1. 	I have been using this gate for over two years now and it still works great. At some point the auto-close feature stopped working, but I actually prefer it this way as before it would slam closed noisily if you didn't catch it first. It was important to me to have a tall gate as my son has always been 95%+ for height. I've never needed to use the extensions, but I appreciate that it comes with them. My only con is that the bar on the bottom is tall enough that everyone in my family has almost tripped/tripped over it at least once.I'm a little surprised by so many bad reviews as we've never had any problems despite my son being very rough with it at times. He is 4 now and we still use this gate on our bathroom and he hasn't figured out how to open it yet. For comparison, we went through 3 or 4 fridge locks before finding one that he didn't figure out how to open the same day. Maybe we just lucked out..This was the first/only gate I got with a door so I'm not sure how it compares to others, but there are some great reviews that do make comparisons. I don't know how I got through that first year+ stepping over gates all the time, definitely worth the extra $$ to get one with a door.	
1. 	Love this tub.  We tried the puj tub and it was just too awkward in the sink.  This tub provides a good support for our baby, we stopped using the infant insert around 2 months.  There is room for our baby to kick in the tub and good support for her back.  This is the best tub and a great price.	
- 1	We got this for our daughter and took it to the hospital when she was born.  It is cute and you can take the sound box out of the bear, which we did, and attach it by velcro to railings such as the baby bed at the hospital.  It sounds great but it won't stay on.  It lasts for about ten minutes and then it stops, usually right as you or baby are almost asleep, leaving a deafening silence.  Then you have to reach over and bump it to make it come back on, over and over.  Tedious!!  Also, the batteries ran out after less than a week of use and as they dd it just got quieter and quieter. We found much better results for the same price when a friend gave us the Homedics sound maker and projector:Homedics SS-3000 Soundspa Lullaby, WhiteThis not only plugs in, wth NO automatic shut-off, but also has several sound settings as well as beautiful and colorful discs that project wherever you aim the device (wall, sofa back, bassinet cover, etc.).  Our baby has watched it since she was three weeks old. I  highly recommend this instead of the bear!!	
1. 	Like many other reviewers, I had problems with the FrogPod tumbling off the shower wall -- and it's a smooth surface, no grout issues to blame. But after really muscling it onto there, the stick-or-not-to-stick issue disappeared...And it's PRECIOUS! And USEFUL! (And how many failed baby products can you say both about?)Handiness: Pluck off the basket, dump toys in bath, then scoop them up, rinse the works under the faucet and rehang for mildew-less drying. (Frankly, a tumble or two after I first hung it was far less hassling than the suction-cupped toy nets that never seem to consistently suck, just consistently SUCK.)Styling: Adorable! Insanely precious! The FrogPod is for kids, sure, but the design is clean, modern, and simply fun; just try stepping into the shower without smiling at the thing! Having children means having some clutter and some items that fall outside your aesthetic, but the FrogPod both reduces the clutter and does so with a playful design. Would that ALL products for kids could...	
- 1	After all the wonderful reviews for this monitor I was really looking forward to using it.  What a disappointment.  I'm going to have to return it; it simply does not meet our family needs, and here's why:Cons:- Having only one parent monitor is extremely limiting.  So many nights I'll be upstairs in my office and my husband will be downstairs watching TV, or I'll be on the treadmill in the basement, and only one of us is able to hear and see the kids.- The up/down range of motion is somewhat limited.  My old monitor did not have the circular range of motion, but it was very good in terms of up/ down.  Which means, I can keep the monitor up on a shelf or on top of a piece of furniture far away from my 2.5 yr old's curious hands.  This monitor only goes so far up and down, which means, I can't place it too high, or it doesn't show me the full bed or crib.  This is again, very limiting.  In order to see my son's toddler bed, I have to place the camera across the room and at relative waist-level, which means during the day he reaches for it, or sometimes he'll get up at night to see what the green light is all about.  Very frustrating.- The biggest downside to this monitor system is the battery life.  As I mentioned, with only one parent unit, if it goes dead, you're completely without a monitor, and that's what happens EVERY NIGHT!  We charge the battery all day (from 7AM to 9PM), and yet, inevitably, it runs out of juice sometime in the middle of the night when we're sleeping and by morning it's totally dead and turned itself off, so we may as well not have a monitor at all.  What's the point in having a monitor if you can't trust it to stay charged for 8 hours?Pros:  To be fair, there are great qualities to this product, that I should give credit:- The quality of the video is excellent, both the day (in color) and night (infrared/ black and white).  I can clearly see everything in view.- The lateral range of motion with remote capabilities is fantastic.  I can literally see all around the room (almost a complete 360), so even when my son gets out of bed, I can see what he's doing.  I love this feature.- The set-up and use is very easy.  It's intuitive and easy to figure out.All in all, I may have learned to live with only having the one parent unit, but the battery life is not something we can compromise.  We really need a monitor that is reliable and which we can count on to last through the night.	
- 1	It did not fit in the tub. I guess it is made for tile built in tubs, not for standard tubs. I don't have tile walls. It would drip and make puddles where it was not supposed to.	
- 1	this turtle lasted about 6 months and then started getting rusty and went dead, its not well made , but a its great idea which needs to be improved	
- 1	Babies need their own seat with a five point harness car seat to protect them. The Flyebaby Airplane seat is dependent on the seat tray table to hold up your baby. The tray table barely holds up a soda and peanuts.Please listen to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Federal Aviation Administration who both state that the only way to safely transport children is in their own seat, safely restrained in a 5 point FAA approved child safety seat.	
- 1	I just received my sleep sack that I was planning to use for my 3-month-old daughter.  The side seams are badly twisted on both sides, and the sack does not lie flat.  It looks like it was either sewn improperly or washed or dried at high heat.  Other reviewers stated that items made in certain countries were of lesser quality.  The one I received was made in India.  These have gotten such great reviews, and I really don't want to use a polyester sleep sack, so I plan to order another one in the hopes that the next one won't be defective.UPDATE: I just received a second sleep sack after sending the first one back.  I now know that the first sack sent to me had been washed and/or dried improperly and then returned.  It was about half the size of the new replacement, and came with no instructions or tags.  The wool on the inside was also pilly.  The reason the seams were all twisted and wavy was because the garment had shrunk but the seams hadn't.  There was no way it would still fit my baby at two years old.The new one was quite large and laid flat, and came with a pretty mesh bag as well as instructions for use.  Unfortunately my baby hasn't been weaned from swaddling so I haven't gotten any use out of it yet.  I tried putting her down for her nap in the sleep sack and she wouldn't stop crying.  I gave up and swaddled her instead.  I will update this once we're able to wean her from swaddling (hopefully soon).  I will also be very careful about how I wash and dry it, since I know what will happen if I do it wrong.	
- 1	This is great for the first 30-60 days with a new baby, but good for the garbage after that.  It gets moldy fast, and a larger baby will flip right out.  I would say it's likely there is something better, but for the price it's good.	
1. 	out of the box my daughter choose this toy out of all the rest some thing so simple its amazing	
- 1	We bought a Moby for our 8 month old, when she outgrew another sling carrier we had. I was concerned it would be too stretchy to support her 25lbs. At first, it seemed to work out fine for us, but the more I used it with a hip carry and tried to carry her for longer walks, the Moby stretched a little too much for my liking. With the hip carry, I had to keep retying it because it stretched too much.It seems like a great product for newborns and even less heavy older babies. If yours is in the 95%+ or above for weight (ours is 8 months, 24-25lbs and 30.5 inches)I wouldn't recommend it for long-term carrying. I know that it says the Moby will support 35lbs, but it didn't work for 25lbs in our case. Moby makes a very, very expensive woven wrap that will support the weight of even heavy babies, but I'm going with Etsy. There's lots of choices for woven wraps that are $35-$45; they're beautiful and made by baby wearing mamas in the U.S. Happy baby wearing!	
- 1	We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment. That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles. When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack. It has just become more annoying than useful.	
1. 	this fits my graco pack and play like a glove didnt have to adjust anything, its thin enough to maintain a hard surface for my 3mth old to start to push up on and soft enough that he can snuggle for a nap!AND its waterproof backing is a great bonus!12 stars!	
- 1	This is made out of cheap feeling pieces of cardboard. The directions emphasize that your child is not supposed to touch these--and with good reason. I have no doubt that a strong infant could easily destroy these.I agree with another review that except for the clamp, this looks flimsy.I think it makes more sense to buy a mobile unit without worrying that an infant grasping one of the objects on the mobile can destroy it. My 6 1/2 month old grandson has a mobile made by Earlyears where the &#34;clamp&#34; is made of cloth with velcro straps and each of the mobile objects is sturdy enough for him to grab and squeeze them and even teeth on them. Tiny Tots is another excellent mobile maker.Bottom line: This may look nice but it's cheaply made. Buy something that your infant can grow into, i.e., when they get a little older they can grab the mobile and play with it.	
1. 	When it arrived I know I am satisfied with this pillow. It soft & thick. I like the purpose of the belt too. It is added for baby's support & safety. Unfortunately, there is no cover sheet available. Just wipe it with wet cloth & you will be fine.	
1. 	I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.	
1. 	I ordered two (2) set of bottles (two 4oz bottles and two 8oz bottles), each set came with one natural flow cleaning brush in them. So I really didnt need to buy these separately it seems. However, the more the merrier I suppose.... haven't had my baby as yet, so i have not actually used it but it looks okay so far	
- 1	My original review: It doesn't work on most of our doors, but does on my toddler's door (she started climbing out of her crib under 2yo and wreaking havoc in the house at night). We have to really wedge the door shut to close it - but that's fine by me, we can fix the door jamb later, at least she is stuck. Some of the other ones like this hold the door open a few inches and the beauty of this one is that you can have the door totally closed, and when they do open it, it only opens a few inches.Editing to add: three months in, the rubber has lost it stick and slips off the door frame easily if my two year old bumps the door with her hip. She just gives it a shove and walks out :(. Not sure I want to pay to replace it every three months. The peace of mind was priceless, knowing she could not wander the house or worse, get out of the house - but now I'm not sure I'd trust a replacement item not knowing when it might stop working. Ugh, I slept so well with this on her door until it stopped working!!! I'm really glad it was nap time and not nighttime when she decided to sneak down the stairs after freeing herself.	
- 1	I followed the washing instructions to a T and it shrunk. I had tried it on before washing and it was perfect. But after washing the material became softer and stretchier feeling and it is literally pulling up from all sides. I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I hand washed it cold and let it air dry and same thing - it shrunk! Other than that it is the right size for a 18x36 cradle mattress 3 inches thick. I am keeping the 2nd one bc it was cheap and nothing not sure if anything else on the market would be any better.	
- 1	My daughter loves to sip from a straw so I thought this was a perfect inexpensive cup to try.  The problem is that it is not spill proof so it defeats the purpose of being a sippy cup.The second problem is that when washing I pulled the straw out so I could soak it and it was almost impossible to put back in.  I feel like it is cheaply made and really not worth buying.	
- 1	My husband went through a whole ordeal trying to build this and there was one part that we both couldn't figure out. The company was surprised when he emailed them and said that they have started having that part already pre-built together, but since we got the old kind, they would send us the instructions to put it together. The instructions made no sense and our baby was already born and I had already started using a different sofa and had purchased a wooden step stool. I got so used to it (waiting and waiting for the glider to be completed), that I said - forget it, just return it. And we did. Unfortunately, my husband had to de-construct the entire thing - and that was a lot of work because he was practically finished if not for that part - which I think had something to do with the locking mechanism. Anyway, long story - maybe the newer ones are easier to build.	
- 1	First off we have twins. We had one of the older styles, which it appears Playtex has stopped supporting for refills, so we changed to this Diaper Genie Essentials Pail. What a terrible design! Trying to stuff the soiled diaper into this thing you can and at times do get pee and poop on your hands. Why? Because the flawed design forces you to push the soiled diaper between two flexible gates and down into the actual catcher, which means the pressure from the flexible gates compresses the soiled diaper and squeezes the contents out. This system does not, like the previous version, hold or reduce the smell either. My suggestion? If you can find a better solution get it! This solution is NOT worth the stench nor the crap on your hands.	
1. 	I LOVE these Under the Nile fruits and veggies. They are so very adorable and soft. I love that they are made of organic cotton, so they are safe for my daughter to chew on. I can't wait to purchase more for her & will be purchasing the entire fruit tote as a baby shower gift! We chose the banana because we thought it would be easiest for her to grasp at 5 months. The dog got some mud on it and so we just spot washed it and it came out looking just fine. I'm not sure if they can be thrown in the washer. We opted not to since we thought it would take forever for the inside to dry.	
1. 	Happy i bought this play yard. It came on time and was well packed. It was easy to put up and its easy to move around the house. It kep my baby safe while payhing around when she started crawling and it saved me and her nanny time and energy of running around after her. Good invention, will reconmmend to all mums!!	
- 1	I purchased this for my son when he was 1 month old, he is now three months old and still loves it! He will kick his feet, laugh, coo, and just watch it go around. It has been a huge live saver for me. So I can get things done around the house. A definite must have for a fussy baby!!  It does clank as other people have said but that is what helps keep his attention. It is also nice that it goes for 20 minutes!Update. I have had to return it once due to the fact that it would not always spin around. I tried changing the battery but it did not help. Second one works better but must have full batteries or doesn't work consistently. I would choose a different mobile if I could do it over again. I choose this one since I had one like it for my first child but it was made by baby Eisenstein company and it was amazing, that was 9 years ago though.It goes through batteries extremely quickly.	
1. 	My favorite feature is that is not only sways (side to side) but it rocks back and fourth as well. It easily folds up to fit standing up in a small space and the turning mobile is adorable. The only bad thing is that it doiesn't play soothing music for baby but I guess that's what Baby Einstein cd's, videos and dvd's are for.	
1. 	My son loves this changing pad cover!!  He is so happy laying on this!  It's extremely soft and washes well too!  We bought a few of these!	
1. 	These Playtex bottles are great, easy to assemble, clean, and hold while feeding.  The whole bottle comes apart which makes it super easy to clean -- and gives you peace of mind that you're properly sterilizing it for your little one.  I used these same ones with my last child and found they didn't leak like other brands.Downside to this:  If you lose the little vent disc piece that goes in the bottom of the bottle, you can't use it any more (they do provide some extra vent discs, however).  The bottles come apart into five pieces, which is a lot of keep track of, compared to other bottles.The bottle pack comes with five bottles (3 slow flow bottles, and 2 fast for when newborn gets bigger) in the box, making life easier with a newborn when you can't wash dishes right away.  It also comes with two extra nipples which is really helpful.I'm not sure if the VentAire thing really works, but I don't see anything negative in it.	
1. 	The kit came with two sets of adapters to connect directly from the Medela pump to most bottles, the one pair fits Avent (old & new style Natural) bottles perfectly. So much more convenient to pump directly into normal 4/9oz bottles!	
- 1	So while I loved these spoons the first time I used them (after hand-washing them out of the package), once I used them to feed my little one and then cleaned them in the dishwasher, they warped. I thought that it was because I had put the two spoons I used in the utensil rack of my dishwasher (on the bottom shelf), until I used the other two new spoons and put those on the top rack, because they also warped. And not a little, but a LOT. The spoon part (where the food rests) melted, and the handles became twisted and bent. So disappointed because these really worked great otherwise. I am debating whether I should get another set and just hand-wash them, but then I'll have to be vigilant about it (as will my husband) and with a little one, it's hard to remember small details like that.I am also annoyed that it doesn't say on the package that these are hand wash (and no, I don't have a super duty dishwasher, or a heat sterilizing one - in fact, it pretty much doesn't clean my dishes at all - just dries them after I wash them in the sink and put them in there). I would call it a dishdryer instead of a dishwasher at this point. :)	
1. 	It's comfy for my daughter to hang out in.  I like it is a nursing pillow too.  Love the cute pink polka dot pattern.  Love the under $20 price.  Wish it had a removable, washable cover.	
1. 	Product is fine, no complaints, but my toddler is not interested in using it at all.  He is much more interested in using my electric toothbrush...	
- 1	I got these for my 6 month old and they were too tight on his head.  He hated them, kept pulling them off.	
1. 	Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.	
- 1	I thought this sheet would be fine for my pack n play.  I was pretty disappointed when I received this sheet- it is SO thin.  I bought a different one right away and this one is basically shoved in the back of my closet as a spare in case of emergencies.  I would spend a few extra bucks and get a different one!	
1. 	These are by far my favorite dishes for my Twins to eat out of and we have a lot of different bowls.My girls are able to grab more food out of these than any of their other dishes, this is due to the sloped & smooth insides.This does not slide all over their high chair tray, it stays right where I put it.It does not tip as many of their other bowls do.These are easy to clean & I hand wash them. I just un-snap the 2 pieces wash them and snap them back together when they are dry. This is VERY easy but a child would not be able to do it.These also fit together so they take up less space!!These are a little pricy but I figured since it was something we would be using EVERYDAY, several times a day, it was worth getting something that worked great and would not wear out.Several people have complained that their child is able to pick these up & throw them and are dissapointed. Ummmmm, DUH!! If your child is able to pick things up and throw them since this is not glued down, held by some magnetic force, etc. then yes, they will be able to pick it up. That is just common sense. These are just harder to pick up. Try teaching your child some manners, yes, even at 1 year old children can be taught not to do something. If you are having trouble with your child throwing their plate then perhaps you should be looking for a book on teaching your child some manners instead of trying to fix the problem with a bowl!	
1. 	I ordered this for my almost 2 year daughter and it is gorgeous. Much better looking than in the picture.It is sturdy and putting it together was pretty easy. The hardest part was aligning the slats into the holes on both rails at the same time by myself. If I had waited and had somebody help it would've been a cinch. Otherwise it was super easy and didn't take long at all.The crib mattress fit perfectly, nice and snug. The weight limit is 50lbs but I have sat/lain on it and it held up fine although I wouldn't make a habit of it since I am 100lbs over the limit!I would definitely buy this bed again, it looks beautiful in her room.	
1. 	My daughter and I really love these bibs. I wish I would have bought these sooner. They are machine washable and easy to clean. I recommend these to all my friends with kids.	
1. 	This potty stays in our minivan for all trips short and long.  It is highly functional, fits my daughter perfectly (she is 2 1/2yrs old and weighs 29lbs).  I started with placing a plastic grocery bag in the bucket part, along with her unused diapers (since she is fully potty trained now), inside the potty.  This makes all waste fully disposable without having to do any cleanup.  Works like a charm.	
- 1	I was very excited to get this sling.  I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby.  The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc., and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements.  My 2 mo. old dd is very comfortable sitting in it.That said, I would not buy it again.  My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in.  The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting).  The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well.	
- 1	This is by far the worst feeder bag on the market.  It is impossible to clean, unlike the brands where the bag can be removed.  Try the Kid Co. Baby Steps.  The bags can be removed for thorough cleaning which means you can buy new ones if they start to look worn.  Feeders are a great idea to introduce new flavors to babies without the risk of choking.  You can also make cold teethers with frozen breastmilk.  Highly recomended, just not this brand.	
- 1	I ordered this sippy cup for my daughter because it was BPA free.  It now sits in our cupboard, not used because I could never get the plastic taste out of it.I would also caution parents with babies who are just starting to use sippy cups that this is not a great one to start with.  While it may be effective in preventing spills, it also is hard for newbies to get fluids out because they have to suck so hard and they are not used to doing that.	
- 1	Product should clearly state can't be used on a platform bed, or any bed that does not need a box spring.  Rail must clear box spring or lip by a significant amount in order to work. Had to return the item and had to pay a restocking fee. Really Annoying.	
- 1	I got one based on the review last year for about $20. Baby used it while teething, but not like everyday. like other people say, it is a squeaking toy similar to dog toys. Nothing special and i do not think it is worth $20.Update: it was left outside for a couple of weeks. the whole thing became sticky and something was peeled off in some places. the colors disappeared (maybe peeled?) in some places. Does that mean the baby was eating paint/material slowly? not sure. I trashed it.	
- 1	I have been using this in rotation with another cover (and another boppy) for 5 months. With a wash or two, the fabric started to pill. I was disappointed when I opened it because it was so rough and I had hoped it would soften up, but no. It's still rough due to the polyester. Very cute pattern, but I would not recommend.	
1. 	This princess clock is so adorable to hangin my newest granddaughter's room.  Shewill be our newest princess.  Item was receivedon time and worth every penney.	
1. 	This is great for the chillier winter months.  I never use this along with fleece jammies, but with thin cotton jammies this is perfect.  Great way to keep baby warm and not worry about a blanket.	
1. 	The miracle blanket is the only blanket that my son won't escape from when he's swaddled.  Unfortunately the brown and green polka dot pattern faded after one wash.  Functionally it's still fine, but I'm disappointed that it looked like an old blanket before our son even got to use it.	
- 1	BOUGHT THESES FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW AND SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO USE THEM	
- 1	It's not as gorgeous as everyone made it out to be in my opinion.  It's very basic it's thin so don't be fooled it's not thick and it's small.  I sent it back the same day it arrived.  I think I'd rather spend the money on a NookSleep blanket or a Pottery Barn quilt	
1. 	Meh, I was hoping for some great USA made products when I bought these for homemade baby food but I'm a bit disappointed.  The white plastic is flecked with black spots (I'm hoping against hope it isn't little gnats or something - that's what they look like) and two of the four lids are nearly impossible to seal.  They do the job and it is nice to be able to stack them in the freezer, they just aren't as great as I had anticipated.	
- 1	The rings fall off all the time & my infant throws it over the side of his high chair or where ever he is to get rid of it & he likes everything lol!	
1. 	I bought this over a month ago and wanted to make sure I've used it for enough time before I wrote a review. This body pillow is great, despite all the negative reviews. I am a tummy sleeper and this has really helped me to avoid sleeping on my stomach. Also, it gives just the right amount of support to avoid backache and other pregnancy-related aches and pains. I have to say I sleep much better with it than I did before I had a body pillow. My husband has tried it out as well and loves it too. The only downside is it takes up a lot of space on a queen size bed, but the hubby's should understand it's only for a matter of a few, sleep-necessary months :)	
- 1	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic Diaper Depot by Prince Lionheart.	
1. 	This monitor Iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful. First, this monitor comes with 2 receivers - a must for a two-story home. We can hear EVERYTHING including noise from outdoors. The red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can't see without glasses, esp when waking up in the middle of the night, and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud. The nightlight on the monitor with the 15-minute timer is a great feature b/c it doesn't generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb. Our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won't fall back to sleep easily. Therefore, we've used the monitor light. We've had no problems nor complaints with this product.	
- 1	We've been testing bottles with our newborn. Born Free, Medela, Avent, Nuby, etc.This pricey little item is probably the worst bottle we've ever tried. (Though our baby doesn't really complain about it). This is our list of issues:- The flow rate on the newborn nipple is the fastest of any bottle we've tried, it's not even close to a real breast. When I turn it upside down, milk comes rapidly dripping out right away (no, nipple does not appear to be damaged)- It's a nice big nipple, but not really like a breast. It's no better than the Nuby, with perhaps the Nuby being a bit better actually- The volume markings on the side of the bottle are near impossible to read. Add to the fact that you have to fill it while in its sleeve, which adds another translucent layer, you might as well forget about measuring out quantities.- It is near impossible to warm up this thing. You cannot warm it with the sleeve (well, you could, it'd take forever), but you cannot warm it nipple-down without the milk leaking out. You can't warm it nipple-up either, because the stupid petal valve at the other end will leak out the milk too.Did the designers of this bottle ever try USING this thing to feed a real baby?	
- 1	this nasal aspirator is a waste of money, doesnt work for us.Like another reviewer said, I wish I could give this 0 stars.For me the best nasal aspirator is the most simple, a pigeon manual aspirator.If you want an advice, dont waste your money on this! Is a very weak aspirator...	
- 1	I'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS:  Fits snugly on any seat. We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem. Also, easy to clean.  I also like the look of it; simple and clean. I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS: By the time you get the seat cover up, the pants down, the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he's already pee'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs. Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted.  When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side. I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches. I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant. With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say; and not trure.  The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own. They can't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead. There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it.	
1. 	This carrier is the best there is. You get what you pay for, and what you get is:fit--adjusts to fit both me at 5'4 and my hubby at 6'comfort--soft and padded all overease--lightweight, compact, washes easily, packs neatlysafety--well designed to hold a wiggly, heavy babyconvenience--easy to put on and put baby indurability--we've worn and washed this plenty and it's just fineOur baby has loved it since we first strapped him in at 1 1/2 months old; he's 5 months now and loves it just as much. Baby now faces out, watching people and things go by. It does get a bit hot in summer, so dress baby appropriately in a t-shirt or onesie (no jackets or sweaters or jeans). I haven't noiced him getting any hotter than if I carried him around in the car seat/carrier for the same length of time.To put it on and baby inside when you are alone, simply put baby on his back on a bed, then put on the carrier, leaving both sides unclipped and unsnapped; lean over, slide him in, then clip and snap one side; stand up while supporting baby with one hand. Then just snap and clip the other side and you're off. Do this in reverse to take him out at the end, then you don't need two people to do it, as some reviewers have claimed.	
1. 	I loved the idea of carrying my baby around all day while having my hands free to do stuff but I totally underestimated how useful this would be!  I started carrying my daughter around in the Bjorn the second I knew she was over 8 lbs and she spent most of her days in there napping... she was usually asleep in a few minutes!  When she was a month or so old I could start putting her to sleep with the Bjorn and then take her out to nap in her crib without disturbing her.  Now she's just starting to face forward and loves seeing the world from so high.  It's so easy to soothe her like this... bouncing at the knees or wiggling my shoulders is enough to give her the motion she wants and my arms aren't tired after 5 mins!  I completely recommend this... we'll be using it for months still and keeping it for child #2 someday!	
1. 	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent. My Grandson, at 8 months, is completely off the bottle and is taking formula, juice, and water from his sippy cup. We are thrilled.	
1. 	What I like about these pads are the way the don't slip around at all when you lay them down on carpet or flannel sheets.  My daughter has started resisting being changed on her changing table, so I use these pads to change her on differnt floors in our house.  And awhile back when she had a particularly upset stomach and lots of diaper blow-outs we kept her on top of these pads all day, whether she was sleeping in her crib or anywhere.  They worked wonderfully.  They come clean easily and I don't mind that the cotton pills up.  That helps to keep it from shifting on carpeted floors.	
- 1	As I mentioned in the review of the Infant Optics monitor - these cords are the most cheaply made part of the system.  I have had to repair (re-wire) or replace (buying this product) multiples of this cord over a 2 year duration.I would recommend finding an alternative from a different manufacturer if you need a replacement to the original power adapters from the monitor kit.	
1. 	cute but another waste of money. it got dirty and once your child is old enough it is no use. plus if your child get's use to listening to this then they wont be able to sleep without it.	
1. 	This is good with music and light.. most of the other gyms don`t have light..My Son is enjoying being in the playmat. It works well in the tummy time too..Believe your angel will start exploring about rainforest...	
- 1	These are way too expensive and difficult to use if you want to use them for cloth diapering with covers!!  My much easier solution for the cloth diaper covers (have mostly pockets) is to use the extra pocket inserts that I have.  You can purchase inserts separate from pocket diapers, and they're much cheapers than prefolds.  You don't have to deal with folding a prefold and maneuvering it to get the diaper cover on!  The prefolds are super bulky when folded for diapering.These were pretty useless as burp rags too, because we ended up using blankets for more coverage.  My hubby and I are both more comfortable holding baby on our chest instead of shoulder, so we needed move coverage for baby moving around!We ended up using these on our changing table.  It seemed every time I would bother to put an elastic cover on the changing pad, he would soil it!  Then how do you get the cover off with baby still naked on the table!  These prefolds are easy to keep under baby butts and then pull out if they get soiled.  It's easy to slip another one under (or not) so baby's not touching a cold, rough changing pad and so that you can finish diapering!	
- 1	My 3 month old is teething and I really needed something that will be small enough that he can bite into. Although he seem to like the bristles of this thing, it was unfortunately way too big for his mouth. He can barely bite half pf the tip. Also, it seem a bit heavy for him to hold onto as well.	
1. 	More comfy than my Boppy body pillow from 1st pregnancy, but still not the amazing pillow I hoped for. (to be fair, there may not be such a pillow).  Still, a necessity for second half of pregnancy.  I like that it has a removable, washable cover.  Would recommend to a friend, and definitely would recommend over Boppy.	
- 1	We purchased this item for our newborn. It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted a little over 1 month. I rarely write bad reviews, but I thought this product warranted it because of how short these monitors lasted! I'll start with the pros.PROS:1. These monitors have exceptional range. I have the base unit on the third floor and was able to get reception in the cellar as well as across the street in our garage. A++ for range.2. The number of channels to choose from limited the amount of interference static. However no matter what channel we were on our cell phones managed to give annoying static and we were alerted by our baby monitor any time of text message was being sent or when one was coming in.3. There's two of them so you can switch out. The fact that there were two made this product last longer because when the first one no longer had reception we switched to the other on.4. The base unit and the monitors plug in. HOWEVER as another viewer mentioned, plugging your monitor in for more than 12 hours will fry the monitor. So if you forget to unplug your receiver, you've ruined the monitor.CONS:1. It was hard to avoid bursts when the unit was around our cell phones and by around I mean in the adjacent room.2. The pro of having the monitors have an A/C adapter become a con when you can't just leave the units plugged in. And not only can't you leave them plugged in, you destroy the product if you do. Why have an A/C adapter in the first place?!3. The monitors stopped getting reception after only one month of use! And if I'm being accurate each monitor only lasted a few weeks. We just moved on to the second one after the first one died. So while as a whole we were able to use the unit for a little over a month if both monitors had been in use at the same time we wouldn't have had that much time.In my book no matter how great the pros were/are, if the product only works for 1-2 months then the product is worthless. I love fisher-price but these monitors barely deserve one star.	
- 1	its made out of cheap rough towel fabric.its better to put a soft towel on top instead of this thing.thing. i was very disappointed when i opened the package, because of how thin and rough it was. i used once and that was it..i dont like how hard is on babys face.I wish i wouldnt paid 15bucks for that.	
1. 	I just got this bed, put it together.  It's real easy to put together, took me about 40min.  It's rock solid.  The metal frame was a bit confusing, the metal hinges are not to be extended parallel to the frame but are angled upwards, then it all makes sense.  I used a lever to make it all level.  Espresso is a good color also.	
- 1	I bought these for all purpose baby clean up (burp cloths, general baby facial mishaps, etc.). When I removed them from their package I immediately noticed how flimsy they are. They also shed large amounts of lint.  I was afraid to wash them, so decided to simply return them.  I can't imagine using these for their intended purpose! Linty poopy baby butt!	
- 1	Being my first experience with breast feeding, I didn't know there are different sizes of flanges.  I bought this one and it was painful to pump.  Luckily a friend was visiting and told me the flange was too small.  So I called AVENT and was told I couldn't buy a different size, they only used a one size fits all breasts model.  When I said, well this will not work for me, the customer service immediately took my information, emailed me a prepaid label to mail the pump back to them.  Once it arrived, they credited me the entire amount of the product.During this same time, I did find another breast pump that had a number of different sizes of flanges (yes, I bought them all to try out)!  To help you, this website gives the sizes:  [...]Overall, the product didn't work for me.  BUT the customer service couldn't have been better!!!	
- 1	I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem. I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag. However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet. I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle. I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook. I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded. I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.	
1. 	This is great, does the job as you'd expect. It's a little hard to get over her hands, but overall pretty good.	
1. 	As others have mentioned, this set is a little different than the pieces that come with the breast pump, the breast shields are not removable. Not a big deal unless you need a non-standard size breast shield and/or use a hands free bra. I was able to slip the entire piece through my hands free bra (the Simple Wishes Handsfree Breastpump Bra), but not sure all breastpump bras would be compatible due to this issue.Also, this set does not come with tubing.That being said, I had read all the details and reviews, so I was prepared and happy with what I got!	
- 1	Like most other parents, I was happy at finding a warmer at a reasonable price, and this worked well for the first year but then it quit.The organizer caddy was handy.  It attaches to the side of your diaper table or crib with brackets that are included.  Also included are some rubber things that help you adjust the brackets for a smaller widths; for instance, if you are attaching to a table instead of a crib.  The front of the caddy is a zip-up net and inside you can fit about 15-20 diapers.  There are two pockets on each side that I use to keep small bottles of lotion, diaper cream, etc.  The warmer snaps onto the caddy so that it won't fall off the top easily.It also has a tendency to cook the bottom wipes and turn them dark yellow to brown.  It seems this is a problem with most warmers that warm from the bottom.The wipes have a tendency to dry out, but I think that is the case with most warmers.  I usually just add a bit of water every now and them to keep them from doing so (although this particular brand recommends against it, but my current one recommends TO DO it).I was disappointed to find out that there was no warranty when it quit working. I spent the same amount of money on one at Wal-Mart and it has a 5 year warranty - long enough to at least get me through the diaper stage!Specifics:  It is plug-in and not battery operated.  I think most units this size are plug-in.  It fits all size wipes, but does not have the feature for pop up wipes.  And it holds an entire refill size of wipes.  It warms from the bottom, not the top.  It is very easy to open and there is no lock for the lid.  You cannot adjust the temperature.  I think that is the same for most though.	
- 1	I am not really reviewing the quality of the hooter hider but more the functionality. I bought this when my baby was a week old. He is now 14 weeks old and I have NEVER used it. I find it a lot more convenient to nurse wearing a baggy shirt and a blanket. Then I can see his face but it is not noticeable for other people. I think the hooter hider actually draws attention to the fact that you are nursing and it just looks really weird in my opinion. It is also expensive for a piece of fabric that you can totally make yourself. There is nothing very strong in the opening at the top so as others have said you have to hold it open yourself to see your baby. This is a purchase which I regret making.	
1. 	I've had this brush for well over a year and it still looks brand new. It suctions perfectly to the sink. We didn't end up bottle feeding much at all so this brush has been used mostly for dishes. Now, I even use it for pots/pans! I just run it through the dishwasher to clean it. When/if I need a new one, I'll probably get this one, again.	
1. 	Okay, so I'm pretty sure that they could make breast shields out of rainbows and sunshine and I would still hate pumping.  That being said, I did find these shields more comfortable than the hard plastic shields.  I could create a better seal with it around my breast which led me to be able to pump a little more and a little more efficiently.  I was getting an extra ounce or so per pumping session (and considering I would get 2 oz or so with the other breast shields, was a HUGE improvement).  If you are having trouble, I would definitely say give these a try.	
1. 	These bibs are an absolute must have.  If your baby is anything like ours, most of the food will most likely end up on these bibs when they first start on solids.Here's what we love about these bibs:-  Easy to clean (use a wet paper towel to wipe clean)-  Also machine washable-  Fabric is soft yet waterproof, and also very durable-  The bibs are adjustable (there's about a 2 inch long strip of velcro instead of the one size fits all bibs, allows you to keep the bib as tight or loose as you like-  The colorful designs are easily recognizable, so my son knows that when we put these bibs on, it's time to eat	
1. 	these are adorable, gender neutral bibs. i bought cloth bibs before my son started eating bc i was trying to be one step ahead of the game. big mistake. cloth bibs are for drool!! these are for food! they're awesome for traveling too because they dry so quickly! we just took one on our 2 week vacation and it suited us just fine. i won't be buying another kind of bib. BUY THIS	
- 1	Used a total of 2 times (each time it was used for a week when we were travelling).  Basically used this for 2 weeks (and not 2 weeks straight.  there was a space of 2 months between each usage).  After many months of not being used (carefully packed in the zippered bag it came in), I discovered a small hole along one of the seams. Tried using the repair kit it came with; doesn't work.  Contacting Zenoff Products to see if they can do anything about it.Two stars (rather than one star) since when it was working, it was great! My baby slept on it for a few hours while on the plane and was really comfy.  it saved my arm from getting sore since I could put her on the pillow.However, I feel that it is a waste of money since it only had a lifespan of 2 weeks.  the Boppy travel pillow seems like a better product	
1. 	These are so easy to install and easy to use! We got one for each toilet and love them. My daughter (19 mos) goes up to it and tries to play with it sometimes, but she's never even come close to getting it open.	
1. 	fitted co-sleeper sheet, exactly like the one that came with the original bed. no shrinking in wash. shipped fast. will again in other colors.	
- 1	We used this only one night (maybe you need to stick with it longer) for our Houdini boy. At the time, we weighed 8-9 lbs. The neck was WAY too small, even when we used the option to only zip up to the bottom of the snap, and he worked his hands up under his chin in no time and proceeded to struggle so hard he kept hitting himself in the chin. We got this to simplify instead of using a super swaddle/Russian combo, but immediately went back. Worth noting, we also tried the Halo Sleep Sack, and he escaped that every time inside of an hour, no matter what!	
- 1	Color looks great on the webpage; blue and yellow. It arrived grey and yellow.The diaper pad is so small, it would have only covered half my baby. I wanted to use it to cover those dirty changing tables in public. I returned this item in search of a bigger diaper pad.	
1. 	We are potty training our 3rd child so we have tried our share of potty seats.  This is by far our favorite travel potty seat.  It folds small enough I can tuck it into my large purse.  We have never had any problems with this seat.  We even purchased a 2nd one to keep in the car.  Tip: Make sure you lock it all the way open before placing it on the potty to avoid any problems (pinching childs bottom or unstable surface others have complained about).  It seems sturdy and fits all potty's well - but I would never leave my child unattended on it.  Overall a great purchase!	
1. 	I have been using this brand since my daughter was 6 months old and have had no problems with any of the slow, medium, or fast flow nipples. I do hand wash so I think they last longer than if washed in a dishwasher. I have never had them crack or break. they do kinda change color when I used Similac powder formula, not cows milk though.	
1. 	This tub has been so practical. Yes, I leave it in the tub when NOT in use, I wash it before and after, the mesh for newborns are EASY to clean, dry and it has been such a useful tub.. I am glad that I had this apart of my baby shower registry.. Very good for babies, Mommy!	
- 1	They're not very soft. Also, they pilled up in the wash. I didn't like the idea of trying to wipe my baby's bum with pilly cloths. Now I use them as wash cloths in the bathroom.	
- 1	I've used these before and loved them, which is why I ordered more.  The first pack I purchased was from BuyBuy Baby and I didn't have any issues except that we lost them on vacation.  I washed this pack before using and the seam at the top around the front neck of the yellow one tore.  Unfortunately, this was very disappointing.	
1. 	I loved it until it was stolen out of our pickup truck.  I guess it was popular.  It was fast and easy to use.  Great for restaurants.  Cleaner too.  I hate using high chairs.	
- 1	Our breastfed baby isn't interested in these bottles at all. I was pretty disappointed because I wanted to switch over to glass bottles, but he wouldn't go for it. We use the Pura Kiki bottles instead. Wide mouth nipple, no plastic - that works for us. I wrote Lifefactory to find out if they're considering making a wide mouth nipple version and got no response. Will eventually use the one we bought to try out to hold snacks. Bummer.	
- 1	I bought these toilet seat covers because we were going on vacation. They are nice and cover the toilet well. Unfortunately, the tape is USELESS. There are 2 pieces of tape at the front of the cover. However, ALL public toilets have U-shaped seats and there is NO SEAT at the very front. So, there is nothing for the 2 pieces of tape to stick too. So, you can't stick the cover onto the toilet. Also, I don't think you can flush them which is annoying.	
- 1	I was so excited to upgrade to this pump after being really happy with my old pump-in-style (which still works like new after 2 years of heavy use and 2 years of storage--I just wanted one for home and office), so I was disappointed to see that this had so many disadvantages in comparison: the motor on the pump makes a really odd and annoying sound, the bottle attachment didn't fit my glass bottles so they leaked (the pump-in-style's fit fine), and the attachments that help make this a &#34;hands free&#34; pump are so complicated and flimsy they're not worth it. I returned it and just got the new pump-in-style, and I'm so happy with it. Even better than the old model, it's light-weight and less bulky.  And I use it hands-free all the time just by strategically placing the bottles when I pump. In my opinion, this pump was definitely not worth the extra money and I would hate pumping if this was my only idea of what a breast pump was like.	
- 1	The colors on this puzzle stacker are muted. My son was not drawn to it at all. Not as pictured!	
- 1	The Ziploc seal rips away from the sides within a couple uses!! This must not be a problem for all batches of this product (Lots of people love these!) I did my research and thought this product would be the best. I only hand washed them and after the first one broke in less than 1 week, I opened the other 3 as carefully as possible (only to have all the pouches rip the same way). We so wanted these pouches to work, so we could make our own purees and save money on the dozens of pouches we go through each month. Like others with this problem (read the 1 star reviews) the company sent us 4 new pouches, but after 3 of our 4 original pouches broke, I wanted a refund (which they agreed to....after I return the 4 replacement pouches). This product certainly won't hold up over time (which it needs to do to make the $20 cost worth it!) Plus, it's made in China! Come on!	
- 1	This worked great at first but the valve broke after only 2 months. I would not recommend this diaper sprayer!	
1. 	My now 3 month old new grandson is just learning to grab and hold onto things and loves all 5 of these toys when he comes to visit his Nana, which is practically daily.  Thank You they're everything I expected and more.	
1. 	Our baby improve reduce the fussy since we switch to this bottles! Meanwhile, I am so surprise that this company price is much cheaper than in the shop! Good price, Good bottles!	
- 1	This didn't work at ALL for our stove and came off a lot. I was worried it'd fall off into the open oven as I was moving things in/out so I just removed it. I don't think the glue could hold on it when there's heat coming from the oven.	
1. 	Good size,very durable,easy to clean but it's good to buy at least one change pad cover.The only thing I don't like is that the smaller sides of the pad slope down towards the edges so the baby hates to lie down with his head lower than rest of the body.	
1. 	Babies are used to being 'swaddled' in the womb so why wouldn't they want to be when they are born? And, you just can't swaddle the baby like the nurses do at the hospital with just a little blanket. This takes the brains out of everything with easy to place velcro. One thing I recommend is to by them new. I bought a few off of ebay used and the velcro needs to be sticky. They lose their stickiness over time. They are awesome!!!	
- 1	I expected something a little larger than this.  It seemed so small when I took it out of the package that I measured it.  It is NOT 14&#34; x 28&#34; as the package says (the description says 29&#34;, which is even more wrong).  It was barely 14&#34; x 27&#34; (you would have to pull it tight to get it to 27&#34;).  I had to work to get it to tie to the slats properly and I am guessing it should be tight, but it was not as easy as I expected for a standard crib.I understand the point of this--to save sheets because your little one spits up or wets the bed--but they aren't supposed to have pillows in the crib with them and this is pretty fluffy and almost like a thin pillow.  Mine sleep with a pillow as it is, so I'm not overly concerned about it, but mine are over 12 months now also.It doesn't cover much area, so if you are concerned about diaper leaks and you have a baby that is a mover, this one cover isn't going to work.  You would do much better to have a full mattress pad with a second sheet under it (a quick pull off in the night and you are set with a clean sheet).  My babies have been big movers since they were just a few months old, so I would have had a hard time figuring out where to put it when they were smaller (they are big enough now that their middles tend to be pretty close to the middle of the crib most of the time, but I still would need 2 of these to cover the whole possible area).Really, not worth the money as you are better off with an extra mattress pad and sheet (I got all my crib sheets for $2-$3 on clearance and the mattress pads were around $10).  If this small cover isn't in the &#34;leakage&#34; area, you are going to need to change the whole sheet anyway, so you might as well just be prepared.	
- 1	Updated review:I wrote a glowing review of this earlier, below. I am going to leave it, because it was very helpful for nursing. However, I later discovered that it is made of polyurathane which disintegrates over time, breaking down into small particles. The neurotoxin toluene offgases from polyurathane. The manufacturers list some of the hazards of polyurathane on material safety data sheets - they include: possible cardiac arrhythmias, breathlessness, chest discomfort, irritation of mucous membranes, headache, coughing, asthma-like allergic reaction, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, nausea, blurred vision, and reduced pulmonary function. So, even though it worked well, I changed my review to one star because it just isn't worth exposing my little baby to toxic chemicals when he is so young. I ordered the The Nesting Pillow - Organic Nursing Pillow with Washable Slip Cover. I know, I know, it is insanely expensive and not an option for many families. But I wish I would have known ahead of time and I would have found some sort of other option.Old review:I found this to be amazingly helpful with breast feeding. Somehow the boppy has never been at all helpful for me. One of the slight downsides to the Brest Friend (aside from the unfortunate name) is that it is somewhat of a hassle to get on and off, but it is worth it with the help in positioning and making breastfeeding easier. It is not meant to replace positioning your baby with your hands and holding on to him or her while they are feeding (another reviewer wrote that she thought the baby might fall off of this - of course, you should hold on to your baby while he or she is on it). This helps in terms your arms not getting tired, and for first-time moms who are learning how to breast feed it is particularly helpful in the transition during the first few weeks. I strongly recommend this to any new mom who will be breastfeeding.	
1. 	My 8-month old LOVES this toy! The buckets stack both inside each other and on top of one another. Some of them have holes so the water/sand trickle through. I didn't think too much of it until I saw how my child uses this toy - in the bathtub he is exploring the idea of volume and relative size. As a bath toy it can't be beat - doesn't retain water and stink like rubber duckies. They come in handy when rinsing him off too. Who would have thought a simple collection of buckets would be so much fun!UPDATEAt 16 months, my boy still plays with these every time he takes a bath. I have added other toys to his bath repertoire, but he prefers the stacking buckets. He now knows how to stack them and continues to do so repeatedly. It's also funny to see him trying to grab the water that trickles down from the buckets with holes...he still hasn't figured out that water is not solid....	
1. 	I'm happy we bought these bibs.  They're super easy to clean and quick to wipe dry for when you need one right away.  They stay on well and don't irritate either of my kids.  The one issue I have with them is they only catch 90% of the food dripped off my kids' chins.  Occasionally, some yogurt or other liquidy food drips down their chins and onto their necks and eventually onto their shirts.  The other bibs we have (the big mouth, snap version) lie closer to the skin, so they catch everything.  We still love those big mouth bibs, but were really annoyed with how long it takes them to dry after cleaning them off.  I think having a couple of those for liquid foods, plus a couple of these for more solid foods works great.	
1. 	Although I don't understand why bibs need to be gender-specific, I did purchase these for my daughter. They're lightweight but durable, wash clean easily, and catch the food that dribbles from her chin. Pretty much what you look for in a bib.	
1. 	These travel caps are perfect for bottles on the go. We've never had a leak using these bottle caps, and it's our third time around for Dr Brown bottles.	
- 1	My 13 month old loves drinking from cups with straws so I thought these looked perfect.  They were actually the opposite.  She couldn't get any milk out of the cup, and when I tried myself it was ridiculously difficult to use. It also leaked and shot milk up every time we opened the top.  I returned them and will stick with a cup with a simple straw.	
- 1	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.	
- 1	These bibs have a very strong chemical odor.  I do not feel comfortable putting this on my baby.  Babies put everything in their mouths and with this strong of a chemical odor, I can only imagine what these are made of.	
- 1	These bowls do not work, if you press down to suction to a flat surface they almost immediately lose suction. If you are looking for a suction bowl, don't buy this one. I haven't seen/found a suction bowl on the market that works to date.	
1. 	This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the things with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with things to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.	
1. 	I use these for my twin boys primarily after they are done nursing for spit ups. They are very absorbent and wash very well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.	
- 1	This was a total waste of money. It attached strongly, but no matter how I applied it to the drawer, it never &#34;caught&#34; it to keep my little one out of the drawer. I would NOT buy this again. Later, I found the Safety 1st Custom Fit All Purpose Strap, and that has worked like a charm.	
- 1	Not worth the money for us... My son is 10 months and waking around he cried as soon as I put him in it! Maybe if you started young? Very cute. Takes up a lot of space.	
1. 	Love this! Carried all the essential gear to change my little one on the go. Converts any bag into a diaper bag, husband was willing to carry it, detachable and washable pad was a nice feature, great shape to cover flip down diaper stations. Minus one star as I would reverse the net pocket and the zippered pocket, I have a long baby and would rest his head where the zippered pocket is, so I kept the diapers there so it was soft instead of a hard wipes container or ointment. We are more minimalist now so this lives in the car to turn the back of our station wagon into a change station.	
1. 	These nipples worked great for my preemie. He was struggling with the Level 1 nipples - milk would come out the sides of his mouth and he was choking a lot. The preemie nipples let the perfect amount of milk out so that he wasn't overwhelmed.	
- 1	The holes fall out! You can't even move these one inch without the stupid middle holes falling out. Who invented these? They're just awful to use. I ended up duct-taping the circles into the squares. The playmat is super thin and I couldn't use it on a hardwood floor, it is barely soft enough on carpet.	
1. 	These fit wall sockets like a glove and have deterred my sweet &#34;little monkey&#34; from getting into trouble very well!	
- 1	I got this to help my 7mo to eat from the pouch while on the go. 1st try was sweet potato 2end pears. It was a awful mess! The holes are not big enough for the pur&eacute;ed food. Seriously pears wouldn't even squeeze through it! 3rd try peas 4th apples. Same thing the apples backed out and spilt all over me. Each time I've just takin the spoon off. It's a joke.Also doesn't twist open and close Easley. I felt like I was going to bust it. Not to mention I didn't like that you have to put your hands on the spoon part to open it. If I'm out and about and haven't washed my hands I don't want to touch the spoon part that goes in his mouth.	
1. 	My younger son loves to chew on this brush. However, it is not a true baby toothbrush in a sense that you won't be able to move it in his mouth. But with that adjustment to expectations it is a great &#34;chewie&#34;.	
1. 	Excellent product; I thought that it is a little bit too hard but I guess this is how it suppose to be for a newborn	
1. 	Baby sleeps through the night with this!  We have been using Halo's since our baby was born.  The sleepsack recreates a womblike experience for the baby and he also cannot hit or scratch his face with his arms swaddled.  He also has enough room to kick his legs.  The puppy dogs are cute & the material is soft.  Our baby started rolling over, so we had to start putting him in a long-sleeved onesie and leaving arms out.  It is nice to still be able to use the sleep sack for both swaddling arms in & then letting the arms be out after he started rolling over.  This keeps him nice & warm at night especially during cold WI winters.  Good product!	
- 1	Was sent in the wrong color. Was an orange background with green eggs and ham print on it, but not as cute as the green one pictured. It also stated lead safe vs. lead free. When I checked the bumkins website, the current bibs for sale say lead free which makes me think this is an older model and that it may not be to the most updated safety standards despite and another reviewer stating that the lead safe were the newer ones.	
1. 	We have had our baby fence for a year now and it is still in brand new condition (even with a toddler trying to climb it and pull it down daily.  We don't use it as suggested- instead of caging our toddler in- we used it to wrap around our entertainment center to keep his hands away from the TV and the cords.  We also have a split level house with older wrought iron fencing around the stairs and open living room.  We had a very hard time finding anything to put on the iron bars (they were too far apart).  We got plastic ties at Harbor Freight and attached them to this gate- it works fantastically.I would buy this product again in an instant- although a little pricey, it is worth it!	
- 1	I would not buy this swing...unless you use the carseat that fits into it. This swing has not been a hit with our son. We have tried it at different times from his birth to now - four months later. At no stage has he found this a place of comfort. We have used the sounds as a soothing device for him while he is in his room (not in the swing), which has been nice. It may be the angle of the seat or something else that doesn't suit our little man. He won't stay in it very long before throwing a fit even if we put him in there completely happy. However, when we use our Snugride 32 seat in the swing, it works like a charm. He has fallen asleep and stayed asleep in that combination for hours. We bought this swing over others for the interchanging of the seats. I would not make that mistake again.	
1. 	These locks are perfect for the stage of toddlerhood that we're entering.  These locks were easy to install (make sure to predrill holes for the screws so as not to split the wood) and are a durable plastic.  There will certainly come a time when our daughter will be able to figure these out, but for now, they do the trick.  They're also not too cumbersome for adults to use frequently to get into cabinets.	
1. 	This allowed me to forget about having to buy a big winter snowsuit for a new baby.  It was easy to wash, easy to attach to the infant carrier, and warm enough for the baby.  The only downfall is that it should have fabric that can wrap around the top and cover the top of the baby's head for added protection from the elements.  A great invention!	
1. 	This gate/coral was a godsend for when my wife or I had to step out of a room and leave our little guy unattended for a minute or two.  This worked good up until he was maybe 2 or 2 1/2 I can't remember.  This worked great both indoors and outside in the yard.	
1. 	this carrier is sooooo much better than the ergo.  we had been using the ergo since our son was a newborn.  it was definitely not easy to put him in it, but he didn't really mind and seemed to fall asleep in it whenever we used it.  that was for about the first 3 months of his life.  after that, he started hating it and the older he got, the more wiggly he would become as we tried to put him in the ergo.  he would struggle as we tried to load him in the carrier, then cry the whole time he was in it.  also, the ergo made both me and the baby so freakin' hot and sweaty :(  i knew there had to be a better alternative and its the babybjorn mesh carrier!  holy crap this carrier is SO EASY TO USE!  i can pop my son in and out of this thing so quickly.  he doesn't struggle as i put him in or out of this carrier, he doesn't cry in it, and we aren't sweating all over each other - i wish i had this carrier from the very beginning!	
1. 	My mom bought a Miracle Blanket for baby after I told her she continued to break out of a normal swaddle made with a blanket.  After using it once, I went online and bought another!  It is incredible.  Baby stays swaddled ALL night long.  Our baby started sleeping through the night (6 hour stretch) at 2 months.  From about 3 months on, she slept between 10 and 12 hours per night and I swear it is due to the Miracle Blanket!  Her pediatrician said it's unusual for a baby to sleep that long at night - but I think this is the secret, in being able to keep her swaddled all night.  We have just now transitioned her out of swaddling because she is 6 months and getting ready to roll on her stomach.  You will not be disappointed!  The Miracle Blanket is a MIRACLE!!!  We swear by ours and you will, too!!!	
1. 	I just purchased my second Bundle Me and am not disappointed. I did end up purchasing it at a local store that had it on clearance, but aside from that it is the Urban BundleMe in Stealth. The first one we purchased was for my last child and I loved it. The only issue I had with the original was that it collected a lot of lint, but aside from that it worked great on our Graco infant carseat. The BundleMe is easy to get on and off for cleaning. I love that the top part comes unzipped from the rest for when you don't need the extra coverage or for when it is the only part that needs cleaned. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a must have, but it is definitely a plus rather than using blankets that are constantly falling off! I love love love this!	
- 1	I have the Bjorn and like the fit and ease of use, but it KILLS my back after about 10 minutes of toting an 11-lb baby. I had read that the K'tan was more ergonomic. First of all, I ordered &#34;sage green,&#34; which looks like a  nice shade on my screen, but was actually olive drab in real life (as in Army green.) Hideous. I could've gotten past the cosmetic aspect, but the fit was bizarre. I ordered a large based on the sizing chart on the K'tan website. In one carry position (newborn/kangaroo), the fit was loose and my baby flopped out away from my body. In the next carry position (hug, I think), it was too tight and made her fuss and whine. I returned it and am currently trying a Mei Tai, which so far has been the best carrier, although I am not 100% happy with that, either.	
1. 	No other bottle brush cleaned the Avent bottles like this one did.  It is curved at the tip perfectly to fit the curves of the bottles.  The spiral end cleans the inside of the nipples well also without much effort.  Each to hold and lasts a long time.	
1. 	This bib set is really good - waterproof but soft. For the price you get a lot of bibs! The only quibble I have is that you can't put them in the dryer, so I have to take extra time to fish them out of the wash before I transfer clothes to the dryer. I just lay them flat on top of the dryer and they do dry super fast. It's just a little hassle of a step to have to do.	
1. 	I am absolutely appalled that Graco would encourage smoking while walking a baby.  Seriously?  I mean, I know MadMen, PanAm, Playboy Club, etc. are all the rage these days, glorifying that 1960's behaviour, but seriously?  Don't get me wrong... we live in a 1955 Atomic Ranch and LOVE midcentury modern, but there are certain things (smoking, no seat belts, kids riding in the back window, misogyny, etc.) that should definitely be left in the past.Oh, wait... that's a CUP HOLDER?!Seriously, if you even *tried* to put a latte in this cup holder you would immediately scald your baby.  So maybe it actually IS better if you use it as an ashtray.Other than that, great stroller.  Collapses easily and to a good size (easily fits in the way back of the Passat Wagon).  It's pretty stiff (no shocks), but I'd trade the bumpy ride for this smaller size any day (the land yachts I've seen some moms pushing at the park are as ridiculous as the SUV's they rolled up in).  The thick wheels do a fine job of keeping the ride smooth enough, and the swivel function works well.  The cargo space underneath is HUGE, and sturdy, and the cargo walls are high enough to keep things in without issue.Overall I would recommend this stroller, but I sure wish Graco would spring for the extra material to enlarge the dinky little receptacles they claim are drink holders.	
- 1	Highly disappointed that most of the stickers did not stay on the wall. Some did, most didn't. Our walls aren't extremely textured either...so I would suggest going with a different product.	
1. 	Big, but great tub for newborn.  Kept my son, comfy, warm, secure and safe	
1. 	This is a great baby gate and works perfect for what we need. The only issue we have had with it is that after a while of banging it back and forth going up and down stairs, it has started to twist a little.	
1. 	We're expecting our first child this summer, so we're replacing the makeshift gates we've used with our dogs for the past few years. I purchased this one because it was eligible for 20% off through an Amazon Mom sale, and I'm happy with the purchase so far. I installed the gate myself (pregnant and all) in about 15-20 minutes. The instructions weren't as clear as they probably could have been, but I got the gist pretty quickly. Unfortunately, I realized I installed it so the door opened out into the hallway instead of into the room. So I had to take it down and re-install it the way I wanted it. That took less than 5 minutes because I knew what I was doing. For our doors, which I assume are standard width, we didn't need any of the extensions.My only concern is that the spaces between the bars is a little wide. Our larger dogs can't get their heads through or anything, but I don't know if a curious child might be able to injure themselves somehow.	
1. 	I love these snack traps and have been using them since my son was at least 12 months, if not sooner.  I wish they made lids for them, but I use a daisy sour cream lid and it fits well.  Combine it with a paci grip to keep it from landing on the floor when he is in his stroller and it is perfect.	
1. 	I think we bought this for $8. I was in the market for a snoogie but couldn't bring myself to pay $60 for a pillow I would only use for a few months. I am 7 months along and I didn't realize that I needed to 'lift' my belly a bit. Works great. A lot more sturdy than I thought. I'm glad it's not memory foam because I need a 'lift' not to sink in. I gave it 4 stars only because I have 2-3 more months to go in my pregnancy.A great buy! A great little size that does the job.	
1. 	I love this pump! My daughter didnt latch on right away and I used this pump since day 1! She still doesn't latch on and now she is 6m and still breastfed. I use this pump EVERY DAY! Easy to clean, easy to use, your hand won't get tired like many women think, (only if you pump for an hour, then maybe) I get good suction with this pump! Always pumping 4-7oz in literally 20mins or less from both breasts! I pump at work too, so it is easy to carry, no noise, easy set up and takes little space! I loveeeee this pump! It comes with everything described and it is all handy! Trust me! All extras will be useful someday when pumping everyday!	
1. 	this is one of those things you buy and will never see.  It's pasted under the car seat and in theory it's protecting the seat from long term chafing from the car seat.  All I can say is it fit our suv well and was simple and easy to use.  The front pocket on it is a nice touch	
1. 	My baby loves these cups! (6 months). Right now she just likes to chew on them and throw them on the floor and watch them spin, but I am excited that she can still learn to stack them later. I like that each cup has little shaped holes (stars, hearts, triangles, etc.) according to the number it says on the bottom of the cup. Great price especially compared to other brands!	
- 1	I feel like my son has trouble getting the water out of the spout.So I use this cup without the top on it, and he gets more.Better off getting a normal cup, in my opinion..	
- 1	I read several reviews and finally decided to buy this chew toy. As soon as I received it was a total dissapointment. My twins didn't like it, it smells strong and the worst part, it looks like a dog chew toy, even the sound it makes. My dogs became crazy for this toy, and even though they are wonderful around my babies, i was terrified thinking they could jump over the babies trying to grab it.  I'm returning it now.	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
1. 	This is the best potty chair in our (me and my toddler) opinion.  easy to clean and super comfortable for her.  plus, since lots of our friends use them, she has &#34;her&#34; potty when we go over.	
- 1	This item came missing an essential part. The lower latch on one side, which the upper bar of the bassinet connects to, was missing. The manufacturer made us take pictures and email them to prove it was defective. We also had to email our proof of purchase. You would think they would take something that involves infant safety more seriously.After all that, they couldn't send us the replacement part because the frame did not have the holes pre-drilled. Then, they wanted us to package up and return the frame. I had to insist that they send a replacement in the meantime so we would have something for our baby. The next day, however, they called to say they no longer have that color in stock.In the end we had to mail them back the frame so they could repair it and then return it to us. All of that hassle and nothing to show for it except a repaired item that should have been correct in the first place.	
- 1	Make sure you notice that this is made of Polyster - it will make the pillow less breathable and more likely for you to be sweaty.  This (IMHO) is a bigger deal during pregnancy as I'm much more frequently hot than I have ever been before.  The snoogles come with a pillow case (albeit a plain white one).  What I do is put a king sized regular pillow case on the side where I rest my head and end up washing that alone more often then the full cover.	
- 1	I bought this for a child who is scarred of hair washing. But this is just another form of torture really. It doesn't fit right on any head (a 2 year old head, 9 month old head or adult-yes I tried it too). It is really tight and kind of painful and if your child is scared of hair washing, this will just make things worse. I would never recommend this to anyone.	
- 1	The Belkin WeMo Wi-Fi Baby Monitor for Apple iPhone looks pretty cool.  It's sleek, compact and modern looking. The hardware looks and probably works pretty impressively, probably. I say that because I haven't taken it apart to see for myself, haha.So... the App is exceptionally frustrating. I installed - uninstalled - installed, uninstalled and got the app to work once for about a minute before it locked up my phone.  I'm hoping that Belkins does something to rectify the app soon because being just an audio monitor at the price point of ~$70 is already a steep handicap. Being an expensive audio monitor with a beta stage app is unforgivable.Not recommended.	
1. 	We used Dr. Brown's bottles with our first daughter, and now will do so with our second as well.  Both kids are gassy babies, so these are especially great for us.  The wide-necks are great because there is much less spillage when you are putting formula/breast milk in them.  They are simple to put together, and it only takes a few extra seconds vs. a regular bottle.  The only downside I really know of is that there are more parts to clean, but that's not really a big deal, especially if you use the dishwasher.	
- 1	I had bought previous ones that had 4 tabs. Now it seems they changed their design to 5 tabs, so it's not compatible with the previous ones. No indication on the packaging. Boo.Pros:+ Durable foam surface, doesn't scratch floorCons:- I don't like the removable shapes because it's just more cracks for liquids (like saliva) to leak through.- Also, when the baby removes the shapes, then it's hard floor below.- I also don't like the multi-colored tiles because I can't see colorful toys on them and have stepped on them. Next time I'm going to get a plain neutral mat.	
- 1	I received this as a gift for my baby shower. I was so happy to find a product like this. I have a 9 year old and a baby. With my 9 year old I pumped exclusively and either they didn&#8217;t have products like this or I never saw them. The first time I saw this I knew it was a great idea. Unfortunately, this particular product didn&#8217;t work for me.It I ordered one size bigger than I usually would after reading reviews. It fit OK, but the top was too loose and felt like it was slipping. The bustier closes with a zipper. The zipper was just annoying in my opinion. Then after  a week of use the zipper broke. It seems like they could&#8217;ve fashioned something a little better. A friend of mine gave me the advice to make my own. I took an old sports bra and put it on. I felt where I needed the holes to go and cut 2 small holes. This gives me more support since it goes over my shoulders, especially for heavier bottles. It also was virtually free (I didn&#8217;t wear the sports bra much anymore).  I am MUCH happier with my homemade solution, rather than this rather expensive alternative. I do have to give them credit for coming up with such a fabulous idea. It could&#8217;ve saved me a ton of time 9 years ago and it makes pumping not so annoying since I can eat, respond to emails, play on my phone, write in my sons baby book, read a book, ect.	
1. 	We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA, they didn't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway. My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort!  They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal. Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words!  So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option. Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly. Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room. Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe.	
- 1	I got this for my baby shower and I really wish I had chosen a different organizer.  It simply doesn't stay stuck.  My tub IS CLEAN and the bag is empty and it falls off the wall within minutes.  It's going in the trash.	
- 1	I really an disappointed with these. They didn't hold at all. I don't think they held for 24 hours. Now I need something else.	
1. 	I love this mirror. I saw it in the store and was skeptical at first but figured hey why not try it.  It's hard to keep turning to check on the baby while I am driving.  Anyhow I saw the other cutsey ones and even though they were cute I chose this one because of it's size and the amount of area that it would make easily visible to me.  I had no problem installing it in my car.  There are a variety of ways that it can be installed. I luckily was going to install it on the headrest of the car.  It installed easily and hasn't moved or slipped off.  I love the item and all though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles (character design or remote control light attached) like some others I am extremely happy with it.  This is definetly one of those baby gadgets that every parent can not only be happy with but will be useful for a long time.	
- 1	My 15 month old banged his head on the corner of a dresser, so we bought these and they fit on fine and are cushy enough to protect him, but he just won't leave them alone.  The moment he sees them he runs over and pulls them right off and flings them across the room.	
1. 	These toys are adorable and functional. They'll attach to other toys, including playmats, stroller toys etc. Not so sure why they're so expensive though.... still fun and unique!	
- 1	My sister was paranoid about good breastfeeding after a difficult start and wanted her son to use these bottles at grandma's house when she began working, but he cried and screamed and made bottle feedings impossible for grandma.  I tried giving him this bottle also, and watched the outer nipple buckle in, so he was literally not able to latch on to it.  Grandma switched to a basic regular nippled bottle and he did much better.	
- 1	I bought this spoon set, hoping that the silicone would be gentle for my firsttime feeder. Unfortunately, the spoon was too big and too deep. Save your money, and buy the the NUK/Gerber spoon.	
- 1	I thought this would be helpful when using public restrooms, but my child hasn't needed it and I haven't wanted to carry it around in my already-too-full diaper bag all the time. Wish I hadn't purchased this.	
- 1	I don't normally write bad reviews on here, but I had to for this item, because I was incredibly disappointed with it. I purchased Sophie Le Girafe because so many other people gave it good reviews--and because it was supposed to be vanilla scented/flavored. When ours arrived, it was much smaller than I pictured but that was no problem. However, it completely reeks of rubber. No vanilla at all. It's like chewing and eraser. Even after washing it my son made a horrible face when he put it in his mouth, and refuses to to use it. I don't blame him, it smells nasty--like balloons or latex gloves. Don't buy this. It's a stinky waste of money.	
- 1	I really loved this product, but unfortunately the quality isn't very good.  The first time we bought this, the projector stopped working within a few months.  We would push the button to turn the projector on and the whole thing would shut off.  We contacted Amazon about the issue and they sent us a replacement.  We received the replacement and within a month and a half, the projector stopped rotating.  Had I reviewed this product initially, I would have given it 5 stars, however, after going through two that have broken down within a couple months of use, I have to rate this one at a 2.	
1. 	simple and works well. It can be hard for adults to pull out when you want to use your plug, but I guess that also makes it hard for babies which is the point	
1. 	My daughter has been in sleep sacks since birth and Halo is by far the best brand.  This is a great summer weight sleep sack that is very very soft.  They hold up very well to weekly washings.I had a long debate whether or not to get the early walker one for my 15 mo who has been walking for 5 months.  I'm glad I didnt - I don't have to worry about her wearing socks and most of the time she isn't walking in it ( and even the few times she had she is fine).  My daughter is a bigger than the average 15 mo but the 12-18 mo fits great and she should be able to wear it for another 4-6 months.  I would say they run a tad large.	
- 1	I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born. However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher, they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic. No other bottle kept that smell, it permeated my home for days!!! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong, they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back. I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30. It was offensive and disgraceful. Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info. Disgraceful company. Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick. The smell in the air was awful enough!!	
1. 	I love this cart cover. I had doubts about ordering it at first because some people said that it didn't fit bigger carts; however, it has fit every cart I tried so far. I have used it at Target, BJ's, Wal-Mart, and other places. I haven't had any issues yet. It is perfect for babies who need a little support to sit up. It has two cushions on both sides in case they topple over so the baby won't get hurt. My son is 6 months old and had to transition to a convertible car seat. That meant no more car seat base combination so I didn't have the car seat to pick up and balance in the cart. This was the perfect solution.	
1. 	I'm not sure why there are bad reviews on here as we LOVE these locks! They're the only locks we use and they work great. They're not the best for sliding drawers, but for regular cupboards, they work great! Easy to install with no screws, yet they keep little hands out. My older son (3) figured out how to unlock them, but by that age, I don't really care if they unlock.They are a little pricey, but well worth it to not have to screw anything in!	
1. 	What was I thinking using cloth bibs when I first starting giving solids to my baby?  These r the way to go. U just wipe it off after use. And it has a little catch pouch which helps too.	
- 1	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.  While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.	
1. 	Very solid well made gate. Doesn't have a foot opening option but that hasn't been an issue, opens easily enough even if your hands are full, but the little one cannot open it. Mounts easily (definitely want to screw the mounting pads into the wall though if a permanent placement, friction based installation will not stand up to little one yanking on it). Gate closes automatically behind you... if we want to prop open we just set a chair next to it to prop.	
- 1	My son loves rattles and like to shake them.  However, the first two times he played with this one, he wound up hitting himself in the head and crying.  Because the rattle ends are very hard plastic and have parts that jut out, it really hurts when it bumps him in the head.  I took it away and haven't let him play with it since.  There are lots of other rattles out there that won't leave you with a crying baby.  Look for a lightweight one with rounded edges, either made of wood or with rubberized ends.  Sassy and Manhattan Baby have some good selections.	
1. 	I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.	
- 1	They don't really fit to your breast, so when I wear them under a thin tank top or bra you can see the edges.	
- 1	It's super cute. Now I don't have to worry about the temperature being too hot or too cold. Sometimes I don't realize that the water is getting cold becuz I'm too occupied playing with my daughter, but with this, I red really catches my eye and reminds me bath time is over. She loves the turtle too.  It's soft and cute. Doubles as a bath toy.UPDATE- after a week's usage I have to say I'm really disappointed in the product. The temperature gauge stopped working. I am returning this :(Guess I should have listened to the other reviews.	
- 1	I bought 4 of these just a couple of months ago and only one of them is still functioning. The loop that holds the pacifier on broke in about 5 seconds on one of them...literally. That is not an exaggeration. I clipped it to my daughter and she pulled on it and it broke right off immediately. One has a clip that completely rusted over. One clip doesn't stay clipped anymore. Finally, the last one I have left is slightly rusted and the clip doesn't hold as firmly as it did. It won't last much longer.Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive clip. I was tempted by the low price and hoping to save money, but in the end I spent more. There is a reason why these are only $3. They are a complete waste of money.The Booginhead brand works really well. I suggest them.  They are more like $10-$15 but the ones we have now are still in excellent condition. We have one that is over a year old and still looks new and performs the same way it did when it was first purchased.	
1. 	We bought my son a Bumbo and were really excited about him being big enough to use it. Once he was capable of sitting up without support, we started feeding him in the Bumbo and putting him in it to play with his toys. He really enjoys his time in the Bumbo. After hearing about the recall, we realized how ridiculous it was... we would NEVER leave our son unattended in the seat. As a result, he thoroughly enjoys spending SUPERVISED time in the seat.Ultimately, he doesn't spend quite as much time in the chair as I though he would... therefore, while I was pregnant, I thought it would be a necessity, but looking back, I would probably add it to the nice to have column.	
- 1	My baby never liked this teether.  Maybe it was because he never used a pacifier, but he never liked putting this in his mouth, which was too bad because he started teething early and I thought this would be helpful.  Maybe it would work better for babies who use pacifiers, but he just never seemed to understand how to use it.	
1. 	I used this for breast milk and baby food. The cubes were a little under an ounce. The lids were not very secure, but secure enough to keep freezer odors out. The cubes do not pop out easily and I had to run the tray under hot water to get the cubes out.	
- 1	I'm not going to waste much time on this review. The bottom line is this spout cover does not fit our standard size bathtub spout so it's completely useless to me. I see that this is a common problem. If you find you are having the same issue, I recommend that you try the Puj spout cover.	
- 1	I'm not too fussed about keeping everything sterile for my baby, but I did want a separate brush for the bottles and pump accessories, and I usually like OXO products very much. This brush, however, hardly makes my life easier.Pros:- pretty colors- soft and gentle on the bottlesCons:- the bottom unscrews if you brush counter-clockwise- the nipple nub is completely useless (maybe okay for nipples, but cannot really reliably clean any other small parts, e.g. Medela pump accessories)- the brush sprays, no matter how carefully you move it- after less than two months of limited use, the brush bristles are starting to look tangled and worn- if it leans against anything, the brush gets flattened (so you pretty much have to buy the stand)	
1. 	Came on time, color matched the description, fits great. So far, so good. Haven't used yet, but it looks promising.	
- 1	Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped.  Ridiculous.  I went through so many batteries.  For an item as high priced as this, I needed it to work longer. Disappointed in you medela. You worked so good 10 years ago....now... Thanks for the great 3 months..... I ended up stopping breast feeding after this broke, because I couldn't pump at work since it didn't work anymore. My milk dried up. Only being able to feed twice a day was not what I envisioned for my daughter. Now, when it DID work, it was worth every penny.  Handy tote that looked like a purse. No one even knew. Quiet and fast and comfortable. $250 is steep, but for the convenience, worth it.... For three months.	
- 1	While my son is drinking from the cup, the part where the plastic spout meets with the lid comes apart and leaks all over the place.	
- 1	When I first recieved it, it looked really pretty and thick, but after a few washes it started to tear. I wouldn't recommend it.	
- 1	This is obviously not the product's fault, so maybe I shouldn't be giving it only 2 stars but every time I hang the diaper bag on the back of the stroller with these and then take the baby out, the stroller falls over backward. I guess there is a reason that they don't already have these hooks on the handles of most strollers!	
- 1	Crystal clear sound? Check. Yes, I can hear my baby breathing, but I can also HEAR a lot of nothing. Which is what I'm trying to avoid. In my dreams, no sound from the baby's room would result in NO SOUND on the baby monitor. This one doesn't do it.As far as the other reviews, the lights really aren't that bothersome, and I am very sensitive to light when I go to bed. The static/white noise, however, is killer.If you like to sleep with a sound machine, maybe you would love this one. You can hear your baby AND constant white noise at the same time!	
- 1	I purchased this to give my five month old somewhere to sit beside her bouncy seat and am underwhelmed by the quality and construction. The fabric is very course and the toy bar seems rather chintzy, although I normally remove the toy bars so my daughter can see what's going on around her anyway. The seat also seems somewhat jerky when rocked and just looks uncomfortable. That said, it's not terrible and I didn't hate it enough to send it back. I submit this review only to let other potential buyers know that the quality isn't what it should be given the price tag.	
1. 	My baby loves her sleepsacks almost as much as I do.  They are wonderful because you don't have to worry about the blanket falling off or accidentally covering the baby's face.  The cotton ones are perfect for summer because it is light and airy.  My baby knows it is bedtime when we pull out her sleepsack and settles right to bed (typically).  They are pretty long, so they fit for a long time.	
1. 	This sheet fit great on our crib mattress and held up in the wash. It's very soft and comfortable. Would buy again	
- 1	I got these as a gift and they really were great for the babies because they were premie and had difficulty sucking initially. The venting system helped them drink their milk better. But after they grew a little and learned to suck, we used mostly the Evenflow glass bottles with Evenflow nipples and rings. The Dr. Brown's were a serious pain to wash. It has all these plastic parts with small holes and nooks and crannies. They include small brushes, but we really had to spend time to scrub them well because if we didn't, we'd find built up milk residue or mold in the plastic inserts. Gross! Overall, a new parent is way too tired to be dealing with these bottles. They have a glass bottle version, which is a nice option, but again, you still have these plastic inserts for the venting system that are touching the milk and are tedious to wash. Really annoying.	
- 1	I got this for my daughter when she was about 9 months old. Within a few days she realized she could just open the barn door and throw the pieces in. No need to fuss with fitting triangles in the hole. Totally useless. It went to Goodwill.I ended up buying a more expensive sorter that is more difficult to open. She's 18 months old and still plays with that one.	
1. 	This works great for protecting your cars interior from a car seat base.  I am happy with this purchase and recommend this product.	
1. 	I'm not sure how much there is to say about a wipes warmer, except that it works really well. We use it for cloth wipes, we replace the little pad thingy every six months, it keeps wipes at just the right temperature, and works great. Obviously, you cannot use the pop-up feature for cloth wipes, but that isn't a problem for us. We tried not getting one and I ordered one about a week into the baby being born because he already didn't like diaper changes and then a cold wipe on his tush just made it all the worse. This did help. Thus, especially suggested if your little one is already not a fan of diaper changes.Great shower present - not something people think they will need, but very nice to have.A+	
- 1	I have had good luck with some Oxo products before, but these do not stack up. First of all, there is a small rubber/plastic ring that provides the seal on the inside of the lid when it is screwed closed. It has an annoying habit of falling out when the cup is being washed. I have spent a lot of time hunting that little ring down inside the sink because without it the cup will not seal. The inner valve that prevents the cup from leaking also easily falls off into the contents of the cup. It is almost impossible to clean it properly, and it is also nearly impossible to clean the inside of the spout properly. (The manufacturer does recommend hand washing and no dishwasher use. I have always hand washed them.) I initially bought these on impulse because I was looking for a larger capacity, but I have had much better luck with my Nuby soft-spout cups which have been in use for more than three years and still going strong. I have been really disappointed with this purchase and wish I had read the reviews before I bought them.	
- 1	My baby's head falls to the side in this swing! It does NOT recline enough. This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own. Not, NOT for newborns!!! Needs to be re-called. If you are going to use this swing, make sure you are within eye sight of your baby, don't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side, even with the net there.	
1. 	I used the Halo Swaddle Sleep Sack with my third daughter and wish I had it for the other 2. It is the perfect transition from swaddling to non-swaddling for babies allowing you to only buy 1 garment instead of 2. I love mine!	
1. 	My son loves this pillow! He will nap in it often. It is inclined enough for him to get a different view of what is going on around him, although the incline is probably not great enough for those little ones who have problems with gastric reflux.I agree with a previous poster that this pillow was much larger than I expected. My son is 14 lbs and 25 inches long and he still has a lot of room left on this.The one thing I am not crazy about is the fabric, it has pilled quite a bit in its less than 3 months of use. The pillow also can only be spot washed. It would be nice to have a removable washable cover. Otherwise, great product, would purchase again if ever needed.	
1. 	This swing is awesome!  My daughter loves it and it soothes her when nothing else will.  She loves it.  It is also very easy to use for us.  The only bad thing is that she will outgrow it one day!  Thanks Fisher Price!!!	
- 1	I bought these when I was pregnant with our first son. I bought the 24 pack One Size Elite in hopes that these would be the only diapers we had to buy, thus saving money (which let's face it, is the number one reason to cloth diaper). I used them as soon as his umbilical cord fell off and they worked great.. I should add he was 8 pounds even at birth and was EBF until he was 2 months old.. I followed the care instructions to a T and when he hit about 4 months I noticed they started leaking on the sides. So I adapted and started changing him more often.. Then that made no difference, because they started leaking from the front of the crotch.. I thought ok, maybe he needs to have it sized differently.. (Which sizing these diapers is a whole other issue) You have to practically take it apart to change the size and some of the elastics stretched more than others so each diaper had a different size because of it...I tried stripping them to no avail..  By the time he hit six months he was 23 pounds and they did not fit him even on the largest setting... I was furious.I talked to my husband and enough was enough.. I had ordered a BumGenius 4.0 while I was pregnant and found those to be much better. So I redid my stash with all BG 4.0 and never looked back. I wouldn't order these again.. I will say though, they did contain poo pretty well and none of them have stains so that's somewhat of a plus..UPDATE: I actually sold these to a friend of mine and her son is a teensy baby and she loves them. So it really depends on the size of the baby..	
- 1	I am not a fan of this Munchkin brush.  The bristles are stiff and spray the soap everywhere when you run the brush in and out of the bottle.  Another thing I don't like is that the nipple cleaner needs to be screwed out of the bottom; it's inconvenient when you're in a hurry trying to make a bottle for baby.  Lastly, the sponge portion fell apart after a month of use.  I ended up buying the Dr. Brown's brush to replace this one and I like it much better.	
1. 	I use this cup for my 17 month old boy and he loves it!  He can drink as much as he wants without having milk all over his face and shirt.  The top is designed to look like a real cup.  The valve included is the same as all Playtex spill-proof cups, it doesn't leak at all.  The cup itself is made of thick, sturdy plastic that is double-walled so that the drink stays cool and no condensation forms on the outside of the cup.  The tumbler also is slightly contoured for little hands to get a good grip on it.  It can withstand multiple throws on the floor just fine with no cracking or breaking.  The Playtex Tumbler is available in six colors: pink, purple, blue, turquose, green, orange.  There are plain cups and those with cute prints such as flowers, fish, frogs, butterflies, dots, sports balls.  These are recommended for ages 2 and up, however, a one-year could handle this cup just fine.  My son has always hated traditional sippy cups because of the spouts.  These are absolutely perfect for him!  I definitely recommend these for anyone whose child is ready to move onto a different type of cup.	
1. 	My baby loved a tight swaddle - something I could never do with a blanket.  This made it so easy, especially after middle of the night diaper changes.  It's very soft and easy to wash.  Makes so much sense!	
1. 	I am sure it works fine but just think about buying it before you do. If you are like me, as soon as you were pregnant you ordered absolutely everything you would possibly need. I do pump and exclusively breastfeed but I now realize I really don't think there is ever a time where I would need to pump in the car!	
1. 	This product is a great idea, but this was buyer error on our part.  Our eating area was rather small so a high chair would have been a space taker, this product fit the bill EXCEPT we have a lip under the table all the way around and it was useless because by the time our son was ready to sit up and eat his little thighs were too big to squeeze under there (and he wasn't a 'big' baby).  My parents were able to use it with GREAT success for my nephew, so the product itself is wonderful - just MAKE SURE there's no lip!!!	
- 1	My son is 2 1/2 and had no trouble ripping these door knob covers right off!  Pretty sure a monkey could defeat them.  I will say that the actual mechanism for squeezing and turning the knob is good; he can't do that.  What he can do, however, is pull the two halves of plastic apart and take the knob cover clean off.  But, since these were so inexpensive, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much.  A little home engineering and I have gotten them to work for us: duct tape.  Taping the cover around the knob keeps it from being popped apart and removed.  Now it is securely on the knob, spins when he tries to turn it, and has the little tabs that I can squeeze through the tape and open the door.In short, if you don't mind having to alter the product a little, it can work.  But, if you're planning to put them on every door knob in your house, I wouldn't recommend them.	
1. 	It closes on it's own, which is perfect for my needs.  It is heavy duty construction.  The wall posts can be screwed in but unlike another gate I purchased, it came with double sided tape as well.  Installation was pretty easy.  Auto-close works fine so far.One note though:  The gate requires you to unlatch and lift, which if you have older people in the house it may not be desirable.  My mom finds is hard to use.	
1. 	Small enough for the baby. I have this kind of nail clippers for myself. So I have no problem with using.	
- 1	I wanted to like this monitor- but this one most definitely stinks.  It is so quiet that even on the highest setting the baby is barely audible.  I would constantly have to check on him to make sure I wasn't missing his cries- which at that point defeats the purpose of the monitor.  If I happen to hear a faint something on the monitor I would have to tell everyone in the house to be quiet and stop everything everyone is doing just to hear if the baby is crying on the monitor.  I checked the manual- I was doing everything right.  Volume was turned on high - but the high setting on this monitor sounds like the low with any other monitor.  Don't get me wrong/ I'm not looking for rock concert loud- just high enough volume so I can hear the monitor next to me while quietly washing dishes.  I don't feel that is setting the bar that high....  Sent this one back and bought a Motorola one from babies r us and am MUCH happier.  No static and crystal clear- LOUD sound.  Now there is no doubt- I know if he is crying.	
1. 	I have 8 children ranging from 24yrs to 5 weeks. I have never used a formula dispenser before. I found this product by accident and thought I would give it a try. What a lifesaver in the middle of the night and for diaper bag use. It saves me time and effort. It also saves the formula from landing on the floor or the bottom of the diaper bag. It also allows you to work one handed. It's a small addition that makes life easier.	
- 1	As all other reviewers mentioned:  very, very small. If you plan to buy it, just go ahead and buy two. Ivery slippery too.	
1. 	Overall, this is a great pillow and I highly recommend it.Gives support from head to toe (I'm 5'5 and sleep with knees slightly bent; my top foot stays elevated with this pillow) -- most others on the market are too short to do that. Provides back support, and prevents me from rolling on my back when I sleep (which was a big concern). It's a little firm - but you're sleeping on your side, so you want your neck supported. The c-shape also makes it easier to get in/out of bed than if it didn't have the opening in the middle (ie, I don't have to climb over it). It's not even as big as I'd expected - in fact, my hubby and dogs still fit comfortably with me in our king-sized bed, with room to spare.Two minor drawbacks were already mentioned in other reviews - both have to do with the cover. First, the fabric is a little scratchy (feels like a cotton/poly blend). Second, the inside seams are pulled too tight, so you have to adjust sleeping positions (in order not to have it dig into your neck). I'll probably just end up making myself a new slipcover with softer fabric, and adjusting the seams to allow a little more give/room.	
1. 	In regard to what some have posted about toxins in sheepskins--this Bowron product is safe. See below.From: [...]G L Bowron & Co uses a combination synthetic tannage process for all its shortwool (SWW) and longwool (LWW) Sheepskin production, including Babycare products.The tanning process for Babycare products includes the use of Chromium III, which is a non toxic and non carcinogenic chemical.All Bowron Sheepskins are free of chemicals specified in the Oko-tex Standard 100, which include:(1) Pesticides (PCP/TeCP) (Pentachlorophenols, Tetrachlorophenols)(2) Organic Tin compounds(3) Azo Dyestuffs(4) Extractable Heavy Metals (Chrome VI, Antimony, Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium,  Cobalt, Copper, Nickel, Mercury)Although the wool on Bowron Sheepskins is bleached during processing, it is done so with hydrogen peroxide--no chlorinated chemicals are used at any stage of the tanning process.From [...]Proven and loved by millions of babies around the world.In the crib or playpen, or on-the-go in stroller or car.Clinically tested in hospital and laboratory research to betotally safe and secure to calm and comfort your baby.This is considered one of the safest baby sheepskins in the world, which is why it is so popular. The natural color is a tell-tale sign. Stay away from snow white sheepskins--this means that they have been bleached and excessively treated.	
- 1	I knew several people that used these and loved them, but they were more of a hassle for me. I put in a few different foods to try and all of it ended up being mush in a sack.My daughter would try it, lick it then toss it on the floor where it would squish all over the place. And don't get me started with cleaning this nasty thing. GROSS!In theory the feeder sounds great but functionally its gross and traps food in places. blah! :(	
- 1	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.  In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.  Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.  This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.	
- 1	The baby set seems needed, but it is so stiff that it is hard for my little one to get in and out of it. She has to keep her legs stiff in ofer to get in and that is a process, then the straps connect within the seat and that too is hard to manuever. My 6 month old daughter doesn't like the hard confinement the chair offers. I'm looking forward to her growing a bit so we can try it with straps only and not the baby set.	
1. 	I hate that I have to use this, but I'm not one of those women that is able to discretely breast-feed my baby, and a nursing cover is a necessity.I love several things about this item.1. Great design, with the metal loop opening the area in front so you have view down to see baby2. Great design, with the soft, heavy corners, to pull it down and keep you covered.3. Nice choice of fabric designs.... Hot dots, the one I chose, is cheery and fun and colorful, IMO.4. Big enough for large chest and large baby.5. Folds small enough to easily stash in diaper bag.Only complaint: fabric is not very breathable, so, on hot days, baby and I get really hot using this.Recommendation:  I almost went with a dark , plain cover, thinking it would help me to be discreet.  So happy I didn't for several reasons:1.  Nursing is wonderful and although I don't feel the need to flash the world with my boobs, I am glad people know I'm doing it.2.  Dark colors in the sun are hotter (see my only complaint)3.  Baby is wonderful and joyful and fitting that he can eat under a happy cover!	
- 1	These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.	
1. 	I found this potty at the baby store while I was actually looking for one of those fold up toilet toppers, which they did not have. This is way better and I am so glad I purchased it. The potty does look SMALL and I was thinking maybe it was too small, but I tried it out with my 22 month old son, and it is way bigger than I thought, he has plenty of growing room. So I think this will come in handy for some time! I love how this seat can be used as a toilet topper, and a portable potty! Comes in handy when you do have a toilet nearby but the little guy is afraid of falling in! I've also used it to top trash cans or a bucket so I can just spill out the mess. We take it outside in the yard with us while playing to prevent accidents, and avoid the not wanting to stop what I am doing senario...and we don't even use a bag then. Great for outdoor use, such as parks and picnics where restrooms cannot be found! You can also use this without a bag if you are in the grass or camping or such. In the car the bags are a great convience. and the little legs are sturdy when snapped in place, and although not tall legs it works just fine! I use regular grocery store bags and just throw a sanitary napkin at the bottom to absorb liquid. This prevents any problem with the grocery store bags leaking. And you can get a giant box of overnight napkins at the dollar store. Much cheaper than purchasing the actual bags.	
- 1	These were not the spouts that I thought they were. Although, the picture looked the same. One side of the spout is larger, so it didn't fit my nuby 10oz cups!	
- 1	We charged this up, used it... and it lit up for us exactly once.No amount of fiddling with it & recharging it has brought it back to life again.Great design, nice idea...if it worked. Ours doesn't, so we're returning it. Very disappointed.	
1. 	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.  It works great.  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.  It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.  The reviews were definitely right.	
- 1	I'm weird I think......First, I hate hate hate pumping.  It's more work...and boring.  But, sometimes you gotta pump.  I have a nice electric medela and then bought this one for vacation in Europe.  It's just not my thing, sitting there pumping away with this.  It feels weird and is even more boring than the electric one.....and I didn't get much milk.but that's just my opinion.  Even though the electric was around $200....it's definitely worth it to me.	
- 1	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! If you are ok with that, then it's fine. However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. No thanks. I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.	
1. 	I have used First years take and toss sippers and bowls since the birth of my nieces. Now I am using them for my son and they do not disappoint. I have absolutely no complains about it. Great product great price.	
- 1	These are literally cheap rubbery foam corners with stick ons.  They serve their purpose when I can keep them on the table.  Unfortunately, my daughter can tear these off within seconds.  They are extremely cheap and don't look nice in addition to being way overpriced at $7.99.	
1. 	Best sippy cups.  We have tried countless others and all others leak.  These dont leak and are super durable.  Our daughter loves to throw these around and they still look like they are brand new after 6 months	
- 1	As if feeding baby wasn't messy enough already, these spoons have such long heavy handles that no matter what you set them in (little bowls, cups jars...etc.) they flip out of them. Now you not only have food all over the baby and tray, now it is all over you and the floor and you are left with a dirty spoon. The upside is that the dogs like them!	
- 1	I wish I had researched these a bit more carefully before I bought them. I was sucked in by the cute contrast stitching and organic material. However once I washed them for the first time I realized I had wasted my money. Let's face it, the price isn't cheap for only five cloths. When you first receive them they are super soft and the perfect size but after one wash (on delicate, with baby detergent, and dried on low) they were pilley, paper thin, and had shrunk to a size that is way too small to be effective. Yes, I suppose you could delicately hand wash them and line dry them, but is this really going to get something clean that you are using to absorb baby spit up and drool, I don't think so. I would NOT recommend these!!!	
- 1	I was so excited about this stroller! It has the rear facing feature which was a MAJOR requirement in my new stroller purchase. Well that's about the only good thing about the stroller. Oh well the fact that it has a bassinet feature as its called was awesome! It laid 100% flat, that was great when my daughter fell asleep... But here's the stuff that made me return the stroller... The front wheels don't roll over anything other than a perfectly flat surface ie the slightest pebble made the stroller jerk. And they squeak REALLY loud! I pushed it through walmart for 10 minutes and it slowly but surely started squeaking... it started out quiet by by the time I finished my 30 minute shopping trip the wheels were so loud I was honestly embarrassed cuz I could here people making comments... after research i bought silicone spray and sprayed the wheel... worked like a charm! (of course that was another 4 dollars tho!) Anyway... The canopy is tiny! It didn't matter if my 1 year old was forward facing, rear facing, reclined, sitting up, etc... The sun hit her face directly! I took her to the fair and as I was walking the front wheel fell off! I had set up the stroller according to the directions but apparently there was a piece either missing that comes assembled on the front wheel (the clip that keeps the wheel on) or it came off (which if thats the case was WAY too easy to fall off), regardless I couldn't use the stroller from that point on because there was no way to keep the wheel on! It is a cute stroller but honestly even tho it is inexpensive it is not even worth that price!	
1. 	This net holds a lot more animals than I thought. Now my daughter can see all the stuffed animals she has and they are up off the floor. Would definitely recommend this product	
1. 	My son loves his sleep sacks! these are so nice and warm and very large so the child can grow without replacing them all the time! we love our sleep sacks!	
- 1	At first I thought this was the best seat, it was soft, fit all toilets we tried it on, was made of one piece so it was easy to clean, etc.  I told my friends about it and even bought 3 (two for our home, one for grandma's)!  However after frequent use the seat began to crack.  It started on the inner edge of each side in the center, I guess the part that has the most pressure pushed down on it and nothing under it for support.  Eventually it cracked to the point it is unusable.  I have two kids and expect items like this to last for use with child #2 which this did not even make it through the first one!  I ended up buying the hard plastic arm and hammer seat that is about ten dollars to replace it.	
1. 	I bought this for my 2-month old son who HATES car rides and the minute he looks up at Mr. Panda, he is instantly enthralled by it.  It doesn't last the whole car trip, of course, but it has grabbed his attention multiple times.	
1. 	I gave this 4 stars b/c it works for its intended use however, I prefer not to use a cushion b/c they get so dirty.  My little one is learning to feed herself and is very 'busy'in her chair.  The cushion constantly has food smeared on it.  After I realized she was fine in the chair without it (it was in the wash during a feeding time) I decided not to put it back on.  My personal preference.	
1. 	I also have a jeep carrier, a petunia pickle bottom and an evenflo carrier and this one is by far the most comfortable for both me and baby.  The straps are longer so they fit bigger bodies (and men!) better than the other three.  THis also has a softer fabric than the others making it easier to mold to baby and be comfortable.  I use this carrier to walk my two large dogs and i can bend over and squat down without any worry of the baby moving, being uncomfortable or falling out.  The carrier is so easy to wash.. i throw it in the washer and hang it to dry.  it's wonderful!! i recommend this to any new (or old!) baby wearing mama!!!	
1. 	Very wonderful blanket! Works like a charm at letting baby know that it's time to go sleepies (whether it's naptime or bedtime). I've used this for a while now, since we stopped swaddling. It may soon be time to go up a size too.	
- 1	Inside this package they give you spacers to fit the product to the toilet. Three spacers is too loose on the rim and four spacers is too tight. (The clamp won't fit over the top of the rim without snapping in half. The spacers fall off anyway.)It says in the directions that it'll work when slightly loose. Well, when it's slightly loose, it slightly POPS OFF the toilet. Isn't very useful when it won't even attach to the toilet.I refuse to spend extra money and time fitting adhesive or rubber onto the inside of this gadget. It's going back. I'll just close the bathroom door. It's free and guaranteed to work!Our toilet is a brand new American Standard--nothing out of the ordinary. Don't waste your time or money with this thing.	
- 1	I do NOT like this tub!!!!!  It gets 2 points for cute, but -3 for having NO drain, being TOO slippery, and too short on the inside.  The duck tub is better, we got this car tub to replace a holey duck. I didn't realize it didn't come with a drain, which is really fantastic if your baby/toddler pulls a maneuver that causes a need for emptying the tub quickly for safety reasons.  I feel it's a potential safety risk, more than other tubs.  What a disappointment, it's otherwise really cute and the pockets are fun.  It's also a lot harder to inflate than the duck tub.	
1. 	On first introduction, my son at 2.5mos old wasn't particularly interested. Tummy time especially was not happening. He enjoyed gazing and eventually reaching for objects as he got older. Inevitably he'd turn himself over and become fussy. At 5 mos now he finally enjoys looking and grasping at objects on the mat. He soaks it of course with drool and so far I've had no problem throwing it in the wash. I don't blame the mat when he didn't enjoy it, certain interests take time to develop.  Oddly my dog ignores the attached toys as baby only with the exception of the monkey. We gave up on the monkey after finding it downstairs a few times.I do have one complaint - the music and lights do not always work. If I use the first setting it stops playing after maybe 30 seconds and only restarts briefly if you nudge the poles. The second setting doesn't generally have this problem. Baby doesn't necessarily seem to notice but it bugs me.	
1. 	I am a first time mom, so in my search for a rocker, I was looking for something:- Sturdy  (the metal bars here fit the criteria versus the plastic ones out there)- Cheerful and colorful  (as a bonus, this looks great in pictures!)- Gender neutral  (since this is my first baby)- Not too expensive  (got it on sale!)This rocker met all of the above at the time of purchase, and until now after months of use.Some bonus points for me:- It was easy to assemble- It can be used up to his toddler yearsMy baby boy is currently 4 months old, and has had (and used) this rocker since his first month.Although in his first month he seemed too small for the rocker, with the help of head support, he was very comfortable in it.At 4 months, he seems to fit perfectly on it.  He uses this every day, when he's getting his sun time, after meals (to keep him upright), and it the afternoons for playtime.A bonus for us is that it's light enough to bring with us when we visit his grandparents.It would be nice if:- The toy's on the bar are removable so that we can put in his fave toys of the moment	
1. 	This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk & formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free.	
1. 	This seat belt strap adjuster is PERFECT for anyone who is tired of the chafing caused by a seat belt that constantly rubs on their neck and/or shoulder! I purchased this one for my daughter but I've had these in my vehicles for YEARS! I always try to remember to take them before I sell a vehicle I've been using so that I don't have to order another and wait for it to come in! I'm spoiled to NOT having to feel the rub of the seat belt anymore!	
- 1	I was so excited to get this because of the great reviews. After trying it out and on the changing table, I quickly realized that there was no way I was going to keep it. The first thing I noticed was that newborn diapers do not fit in the holder. It is made to hold full size bigger diapers. Then I realized that since I am left-handed, I wanted this to be on the left side of the changing table. Well that doesn't work, because the dispenser opening to get the diapers would then be in the back! So I tried it on the other side to see if that could work. In doing so, I realized that the plastic had left 2 scratch marks on the pretty cherry wood of my changing table!! The plastic is sharp and scratched my changing table on both sides as I was trying to figure out how to make it work. I considered using a cloth or something soft to protect the wood from the plastic, but quickly decided it's not worth it -- not only will it not work with newborn diapers, but it is also not left-handed friendly, and really does not give much storage space. Returning it right away. I would have given it 1 star but &#34;hate&#34; is too strong of a word. I simply do not like it :)	
- 1	I just can't believe anyone that received the same product we did,would give this any praise. It is cheaply made,the design looks like it work, but it just plain doesn't. The ones we purchased and installed [according to directions] lasted one pull from our 18 month old daughter and then it was laying on the floor. All my wife and I could do was look at each other and  laugh, what else can you do when something is so bad, besides returning them, which we did.	
- 1	This product is not safe!!!!this carrier is horrable! Its cozy for the adult but bad for a baby. I doesnt truly fit infants. the insert only smashes, and contorts the babys legs, and maks baby unconfortable.  if you try put the legs out, it pushes out on babys legs in a way to slowly injure there knees. this carrier will not work until your baby is practly old enough to walk on his/her own! Its also to hot with the insert, your baby could get heat stroke. I wish i kept the reciept so I could get my money back.	
- 1	Those are the nicknames we have for this bag and after reading the reviews I see I am not alone.I will start with things I like about this bag. It's great for packing for long trips and after realizing this bag isn't good for everyday we did find another use for this bag. It's sturdy and for the price has lasted a very long time. The bag is still in good condition and we haven't had issues like the rods that make up the clamshell opening poking through. We've had this bag for quite some time.Now for things we don't like about this bag. It's basically a duffle bag. The bottle holders are shallow and we've always found them falling out of the bottle holding pockets (there are two). The front two pockets can be deceiving. they look larger than they really are and hold smaller things like pacifiers, socks and diaper cream. Then there's the inside. there's no pockets to organize anything on the inside.It's so bulky we stopped using the bag for everyday within the first week. Like other reviewers have said the shoulder strap is oddly placed. It's so huge to carry around along with kids during the day. it's too bulky to hang off the stroller and it's too big to fit in a standard stroller's basket.We did find a good use for it. We store extra supplies in case of an emergency in the back of our SUV. It's perfect to store extra diapers wipes change of clothes blankets etc.I went and purchased a skip hop diaper bag (via in platinum) while it's $80 price tag might be out of the price range most people would want to pay for I went on ebay and found a great deal on one for a great discount (brand new).Columbia is another great brand. I've had friends who haven't had a lot of money to spend on a diaper bag and decided on a columbia and it has lasted through 2 babies. Several guarantee them so if something breaks or tears they replace it. With cheap bags they don't offer that, so by the time your baby is a year you might go through 4 $20 bags. That's $80 and enough for a skip hop or 2 columbia bags. I love my skip hop bag and the long journey into finally finding the perfect diaper bag that fits my needs is finally over.	
- 1	I was so excited to buy these clippers because of the light.  Well the light caused all the problems.  I can't use these clippers because I'm afraid I'm going to cut my baby's finger off!  I can't see anything I'm clipping because of the light.  The light casing blocks all views of those tiny fingernails and fingers.	
1. 	We grabbed this tub @BrUs when our little guy started arching past the guard in his infant tub. It's been a great investment! When he first started to sit up he could lounge against the tail and I actually think the fact that it's inflatable helped strengthen his core enough to sit up successfully. If he topples over he lands on cushy air! Now that he's crawling, he flops all around, but the tub still prevents him from crawling out since he can't seem to get his balance on the wobbly surface. Well worth the money!	
1. 	My 13-month-old daughter loves to rip bibs secured with velcro right off.  These, will certainly stay on and they are easy to wash.  However, it's not super easy to fit wiggling arms through the arms (which are a bit long on my daughter who is in the 50th percentile for height and 10th for weight).  Overall, we like these when we really want to make sure her outfit will stay neat and clean.  Otherwise, it's not really worth the effort.	
1. 	We used these with our second child so that she can eat what everyone else is having for dinner and I don't need to make baby food.  It makes it so easy to give her a variety of food choices.  They can be hard to clean if you don't clean them right after dinner- I flip the mesh inside out and run it under water and scrub it with my fingers before putting it in the dishwasher and I don't have any issues with it coming out clean.  If you have a teething baby- you can put ice cubes inside and they are great on sore gums.  We also keep one in the fridge with frozen fruit in it most of the time to just pull out whenever the baby needs/wants something to chew on.	
1. 	These are great in the bath.  They float, stick and are great for my 8 mo old to suck on (his favorite hobby these days).  My only complaint is that there is only 1 of each letter (I should have paid closer attention to the number of pieces when ordering).  Not a huge deal, but we can't spell my son's name out, (we need 2 R's).  Oh well, they do their job otherwise.	
- 1	Look, I'm all about cute baby products, and this one is very cute.  However, I think that the utmost quality of all baby products should be SAFETY, and this product does not seem safe.  The clip itself is made of metal that is quite sharp and easy for baby to cut him/herself on.  I returned this item.  I don't recommend it at all.	
- 1	Looking for a quality liner. These aren't the best. Wish they were thicker and held more. Would not buy again.	
- 1	The material seems to make my skin itch around my breasts. I've never encountered a reaction quite like this before to any materials. Perhaps my breasts have just become sensitive since I've given birth and started pumping/feeding, but I every time I use this bra, I get itchy breasts and red marks; especially on the underside. I'll try re-washing it.	
1. 	I love this for travel or quick changes when we're home - we live in a 3 story townhome and after my c-section I couldn't go up & down stairs. We keep this on the lower level so I could change my son easily. It's a nice big area - it doesn't hold enough if you're going out all day long (for a newborn anyways). But at the park or traveling (I HATE public restrooms and will not go in there to change my son lol!!) it's perfect.	
- 1	These cups are very spill proof, but very difficult to drink out of.  When the lid is totally locked into position it creates a suction making it extremely difficult to drink.  If you release the lid a little you can drink much easier, but then its easier to spill.	
1. 	I'm 28 weeks pregnant, and have been having trouble sleeping with the extra tummy weight so I thought this would help.  However, this didn't really help me sleep better at all, if anything it made it worse.  It was very uncomfortable.  Maybe I'll try it again later when my tummy gets even bigger.***UPDATE***  Now that I am 33 weeks, I use this support pillow every night.  Once my tummy got bigger, the pillow was no longer uncomfortable and actually helps support my belly very much.  Now I can't sleep without it!	
1. 	I've used Halo sleep sacks since my son was a baby! Was so happy to find this 2T size!! It fits perfect. My son is an average size 2 year old. The only complaint I have is the foot holes. Sometimes both feet get stuck in one foot hole when he's going to bed and kicking around. I don't really see the need for them since the sleep sack is too bulky to wear around the house anyway so wish they'd make one with no foot holes this size. Other than that it works great and my son is happy in it.	
1. 	I purchased two for my twin sons.  This was easy to put on my sons and I love how the zipper unzips from the bottom for easy diaper changes.	
1. 	We used this tub for 11 months!  She finally outgrew it and we moved onto the regular bathtub.  This little plastic tub worked so well for us.  It's portable and easy to clean.  We would use it again.	
- 1	I got this mobile thinking it would be good for my twins' tummy time and also a crib mobile. It's hard to use for tummy time because the girls kept scooting forward and bonking their heads. Then when I put it on the crib - according to instructions - it fell off - twice! I think the plastic strap that secures it stretches out and the hole for the hook becomes too big. I am returning it before it hits one of my kids on the head. I'll order another Fisher Price Precious Planet mobile, which I love.	
- 1	I thought this would be a great idea but I tried using it and it squirted in my babies eyes because the dispenser got stuck.  She now plays with it but it didn't really serve its purpose.	
1. 	This item was great up until our son was 5 months old. Then it became really confining and uncomfortable for him.  We ended up getting the Primo Baby tub for the later years.  It's huge and really does keep the baby in place.  Plus, there is room for our son to splash around in it.	
- 1	I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. What they say about the center being weak is true. I have twins and they where born of 3 and 5 lbs and the bassinet started loosing its form. I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard. If I knew that was the use I was going to give it, I would have bought a cheaper one.	
1. 	The free one we got from the hospital at delivery final wore out and I was looking for a replacement. This one is perfect! Holds two large DrBrowns bottles. Definitely recommend	
- 1	First the colors will vary is a horrible idea for baby items as I got hot pink ones with cupcakes in the mail for my son...  I didn't feel like going though the whole hassle of returning them to Amazon so I went to Target and bought the right color then returned the pink ones to Target.I do NOT like that the plastic ring for pacifiers without the bull-nose ring is only attached with Velcro making the ring a choking hazard.  I'd rather just purchase the Dr. Brown ones...	
1. 	does exactly what it's supposed to do. just be careful if they ever notice it's there. small children love to bend things the wrong way and this device will break if bent too far the wrong way. on the upside the adhesive lets go without industrial solvents.my favorite feature of this clip: it latches itself when you close the door.ours lasted 8 months before the youngin' realized it was there and started testing it.	
- 1	I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product. The designs will not show up on dark walls and even if your ceiling is painted white, the images are still fuzzy. It is also perplexing to find a place to sit this product AND allow the baby to actually see the designs that will show up on the ceiling/wall. There should be more slides that come with the product or the availability to purchase more slides according to the baby's age.The good points of this product are that it tilts so that one can TRY to find a space for the lights to project and you have 4 choices of music to choose from. The music is soothing.	
1. 	We really don't have a lot of room for more furniture, so after agonizing over the $100 FP high chair and the $200 Boon, I decided to give this little $23 booster seat a try. What the heck, right? If it doesn't work out, it goes to grandpa's and I break down and get the big chair. So far it's been great. Our son loves sitting in it and playing with his toys, either on the floor or on a chair while we eat, and it packs up so we can easily take it to friends' houses.  Sorry, but you can't do that with a Boon.I find snapping the tray on mildly annoying, because you have to line it up and it's hard to see where to snap it when you're looking from above, but that's my only complaint. The straps are plenty long to secure it to any dining chair and it's easy to clean.  Our son is 8 months and big (21 lbs, 30&#34;) and he fits in it just fine with the tray snapped on the closest setting, so we know there's room for growth.	
- 1	We were given the Tripp Trapp chair as a gift, and sadly I bought tihs baby set on my own without reading the reviews on Amazon first.  This chair is literally TORTURE on our little one, and we have literally thrown away and purchased a different set for a fraction of the price that does not inflict severe harm on our baby.As mentioned in the other reviews, the baby can only be inserted in the chair by forcing the legs at such a weird angle that his/her legs are contorted at the very best.  TEARS and more tears.  clearly this was NEVER designed as a baby chair, and to throw this baby set in as an afterthought is absolutely fraudulent and cruel to TT customers' babies .Interestingly, in wondering how anyone could rate this product anything better than HORRIBLE, I read in one positive review that one can simply pinch the tab that holds the baby seat on and lift up ,and voile, the baby will come out without breaking his/her legs in the process.  Excuse me?  This is the tab than holds the baby seat down in the front, and the plastic is hard and stiff so the idea of pinching it is a joke.  More like, get your husband and two neighbors to help squeeze the incredible stiff pieces together while kneeling under the chair, and then take a hammer (all with your baby still in the chair) and pound on the tab until it pushes up through the extremely tight hole.  THIS PIECE IS BUILT TO REMAIN INSTALLED, and the idea that one satisfied customer has to literally remove the entire baby seat in order to remove the baby (without the baby's legs being broken or hyper-extended) simply confirms the reality that this baby seat is defectively designed.  That this customer is furthermore satisfied with this makeshift solution to a horrendous problem only shows that they are clearly desperate to avoid admitting that they have wasted their money on this horrendous product.I also feel horrible about this complete waste of money and have tried with my husband to figure out some way that we can live with our mistake, but at the end of the day a real high chair is not that expensive and it is more important for us to be have something we actually feel comfortable using, that does not involve me breaking my nails and using a hammer to hammer the baby seat off every time I want to remove my baby.  (Imagine him choking on something, clearly every high chair should feature a quick and easy release.)If I were TRIPP TRAPP I would immediately recall this product before a baby does die of choking while stuckin the chair, or breaks their legs being yanked out during a choking fit.  This is literally a dangerous product and I am surprised it is even on the market.	
1. 	Our son had reflux, so he slept in a Rock and Play rocker bed for the first 6 months.  When we tried to transfer him to the pack and play or crib, he just screamed and cried and did not sleep more than 30 minutes at a time (with protest!).  Since he was able to sit up and his legs were starting to hang out the end of the Rock and Play, we had to do something!We bought this wedge (which came in one piece unlike some of the other reviews) and put it under the mattress on the pack and play.  We then took two rolled up towels and put them under the sheets on either side of our son.  This recreated the feel of the Rock and Play and he slept in it the first time we tried!  We also let him play in the pack and play for the few days before the wedge arrived - hoping to create a positive feeling about the thing before having him sleep in it.I know we're lucky he slept in it right away, but without the wedge and the towels, he would not sleep in it!  So, it worked for us.  Also, he is now 7 months (two weeks sleeping with the wedge in the pack and play) and he does not slide off the wedge.  Not to the side or the bottom.  We will slowly start to remove the towels (use smaller ones...) and then eventually remove the wedge.  But for now, it works great.A note: If you are expecting this wedge to be high enough for the recommended reflux elevation, it isn't!  It is fairly subtle in terms of lift.  So, if your child is still dealing with reflux and needs a significant incline, read the details so you know what you're getting.	
1. 	I love these outlet plugs. We had the cheaper ones by the same company that you don't press to put in the outlet and my 18 month old daughter was able to pull them right out. So we decided to try these. Let me tell you... these things are HARD to get out of the wall, even for me. But that's a GOOD thing in my opinion. I would rather have something that is so difficult to get out that I even have to take a few moments to do it than something my daughter is going to just pull out and possibly end up hurting herself.PROs:+Hard to pull from the wall+Easy to install+Works on any standard outletCONs:-Hard to pull from the wall even as an adult-A bit pricey if you need to do a lot of outlets	
1. 	Bought matching crib and changing table.  Nice color and sturdy.  Is assembled but not in use yet (baby only 6 weeks old) but look forward to using it.	
- 1	This holder is a complete waste of money.  If they did something at the top, to help hold the juice box in the holder, it would make more sense.  A child can simply dump it over, or pull it out.  Save your money!	
1. 	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).	
- 1	This looks like it would be a great product if you have the types of outlets with the two ovals and your wall plates have two oval openings (not the ones where both sets of holes are on one rectangular section and your wall plates have a single rectangular hole for both).	
1. 	This is one of the best gifts we received!  We've used this bouncy seat every day since bringing our baby home from the hospital two and a half weeks ago.  The vibrations really calm her and lull her to sleep, and she already shows interest in the flashing lights and sounds.  We've even let her sleep in this chair at night when she's too fussy to sleep soundly in her cradle.  My only complaint - a VERY minor one - is that the straps on the 3-point harness are a bit too short on the sides that get threaded through the back of the seat.  They tend to slip back out through the seat back when the straps are unbuckled, which means fishing around and pulling them back through when it's time to buckle the straps again.  However, this really is a MINOR inconvenience and it doesn't detract whatsoever from my 5-star rating.  I would definitely recommend this learning seat to anyone with a new infant!	
1. 	My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep.  This is a very small wedge, but I don't think you'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly.  She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed.  When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor, this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring.  She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout.  Sometimes it is under her belly.  Sometimes it is wedged into her back.  Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it.  We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more, so I think I got my money's worth out of this.  I'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA:  Found another use for the pillow.  It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars!  Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard, but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that.	
1. 	I would probably make some without holes for arms.  The kids also throw arms around and wake themselves up.	
1. 	This thing is so DARN CUTE! It's perfect! It keeps my baby occupied while I change her, dress her, etc & my preschooler loves it too. It's been dropped on the floor and rolled about and not chips to the paint either! GREAT TOY!	
1. 	I love my body pillow.  I got it when I was about 3 months pregnant.  I didn't start using it nightly until I was about 4-5 months along.  It was a little stiff at first.  However, once it was broken it, it was great!  I use it every night!  My husband loves it as well!  He often says that he may buy his own!  It's a great pillow!(I also bought the cover for it.  The cover is pricey, but worth it.)	
- 1	i had got this product excitedly ordering from here but when we started using the color shade started peeling off and my son..use to chew on that .it was unacceptable n we somehow cudnt return the product.neways i wiidnt suggest anybody to buy this product which claims ORGANIC but cannot deal with basic problems.	
1. 	It's funny - the hospital advised against using these types of outlet plugs. They said that baby's little fingers can get underneath a corner and pull them off. Since I got these before giving that advice, I put them on and attempted to take them off. What a nightmare these are to get off! It's great that they do not easily come off so I don't have to worry about my little one getting them off and either eating them or putting things in the outlet. I would recommend these to a friend.	
- 1	I dropped this adapter from about 3 feet and one of the latches broke off rendering it unusable. Amazon was quick to replace, so disaster was averted. Besides that, we are happy with it.	
- 1	I did not realize looking at the image that the mat is clear.  It is very thin & not what I expected.  I am looking for a mat to go under my high chairs that will move with the high chairs without scratching my floor.  This mat does not satisfy that need.  The high chair easily slides on the mat, while the mat remains in the same place on the floor.  There is no cloth backing on the back to protect my floor from the feet of my high chairs.  I am returning them.	
- 1	I purchased the Select-a-Show-Soother for my 6 month old Grandson. Unless you have a very light painted room and ceiling, don't bother purchasing this product.

- 1	I had already purchased the Inglesina Fast Chair.  Our daughter has been using the Fast Chair since about four months and loves sitting in it.  We get compliments on it when we are in restaurants and its fairly easy to clamp on with big rubber top and bottom clamps to protect tables.But we decided that we'd probably prefer a snap on table with a tray as our daughter enters the messy-eating-by-herself stage.  Enter the P&T; Lobster.  The P&T; looks more stylish, is sleek, and has some serious clamp-on ability -- I certainly liked it better than the Inglesina.  The only problem I had is that my daughter didn't!  She's now 8 months old and a little over 26 inches tall.  When she sits in the Inglesina she can easily see and manipulate items on the table in front of her, rest her arms on the chair sides, etc.  There is still room to grow but she fits in it.  In the P&T; Lobster, the seat is so deep that she was drowning in it and while her head was still higher than the table top, she could no longer see things as well to interact with them.  As a result, she doesn't like being in the chair and we've had to return it.It's possible the P&T; will work beautifully for older children, but for our sizeable 8 month old, it was just too deep.One last thing, while this chair does have a tray, the tray simply slides in (and back out!) easily and has pretty small sides for holding food in.  I didn't see a way to clip it to the chair or cause it to stay put when you have a wiggling kid trying to move everything around.  It didn't strike me as a particularly solid or useful tray.  I'm going with a tinydiner mat and the Inglesina for now until I find something better.	
1. 	This are soft and full and help support my son's head.  They also are big enough to help hold his WannuNub Monkey passifier.  We ended up buying two pair.	
- 1	This thing is too big for small babies (mine is 5 months old) I thought it would be something small that they could hold and fit in their mouth but its really large. The blue rubber piece in one corner is about 4.5&#34; x 3&#34; which is way too big for a baby. Maybe this would be better for a toddler but then I dont see why an older child would need this. Im returning it.	
- 1	This is the worst mirror ever. It doesn't fit correctly. The baby looks like she's a like away when you are able to see her. When you position it, during the ride it moves and you become unable to see the baby. The music sounds like something out of a horror movie. Do not buy this!	
- 1	My daughter is exclusively breastfed and never takes any bottle. This is the only bottle she will take to drink her water. That's why I have 2 of these bottles.Cons:1.the strawd broke after used for a while2.the bottom part with handle of the bottle doesn not come off and clip back on easily, maybe you are not supposed to do so, but it gets mold and I wanna to clean up the mold.3. Some mold issue happen is the lid part.	
- 1	I am not a fan of Mustela newborn products. They are over priced and the smell is so strong (think old lady) and lasts forever! I know we each have our own personal preference when it comes to smells so I suggest you try before you buy.	
1. 	I liked this product although I did find it somewhat of a pain to clean after putting someting like avocado or banana in it.	
1. 	I really like this product.  I put in the Huggies pop up wipes and don't really have any problems.  When the wipes are getting down to the bottom, they sometimes fall through the top so I have to pull them back through.  I re-wet the fresher pad everytime I add more wipes and I've never had dried or browned wipes.  Besides, what baby doesn't like a warm wipe versus a cold one?	
- 1	I was not satisfied with this purchase and thought the kit was over priced and poor quality.  It looked a lot better online than what actually came.  I also didn't like how when it arrived some of the pieces were all jumbled around, I hope it wasn't a return!  I would not recommend getting this kit, I think that you can find better quality kits around the same price or less at any baby store.	
- 1	I have two of these sets -- the first I purchased at a major baby chain store, and it has worked perfectly for nearly two years.  I loved it so much I ordered a second set for our new baby.  The larger clippers of that second set are useless -- the blades are out of alignment and they just barely mash the nails, failing to cut them at all -- super frustrating when I finally get that tiny baby to sleep in the right position in my lap to trim her nails!Two stars only because I reminisce about the quality of the first set, and how much I love the easy to hold handle.  Otherwise one star because the second set is utterly useless to me.  I only wanted the large handled clippers, so the small set being functional is not much consolation!	
1. 	I love this tub! It really does fit baby from newborn on up.  I have an exceptionally large boy (we just grow 'em tall in my family!), so I don't think he'll fit in it as long as most kids, but for newborns through 9mo it should work great.  He is 4 months now, and about the size of an average 7-8 month old, and he is using the &#34;toddler&#34; side sitting up (he already can sit up on his own for the most part).  He won't fit in it for way longer, but since he's sitting so well that's fine.This is very well constructed, and the bump in the middle really helps keep him from sliding around like I've had trouble with in some tubs.I would definitely suggest this to all new parents!	
- 1	the straps are designed to be locked onto an adjustable headrest.  Using them on the back seat of my jeep, the headrests are attached.  Babies are supposed to be in the back seat.  Most rear seats do not have adjustable headrests.  I LOVE my 2013 Patriot.  But this mirror wasn't designed for it.	
1. 	I'm sure I can't come up with anything new to add to the other reviews of this product, but I just wanted to commend cloud 9 for the AWESOME product!I want one for my room!	
1. 	This item is so helpful.  It keeps all my baby food jars nice and organized.  So much easier to find the exact food I am looking for.  My pantry was a mess before I got this.It was a little tricky at first to put it together (the instructions don't specify that you should twist the shelves to lock into place).  But once I figured it out, it works fine.This item works for jars only, by the way.  If you buy the Gerber baby food that comes in plastic tubs, it won't work on this organizer.  I mostly buy Earth's Best baby food and it fits perfectly.  In fact, in the photo on the box it came in, that is exactly what they show it being used with.	
1. 	After my first ride in the car with my son, I found him with his head in a very weird position due to lack of head control.  The poor thing looked so uncomfortable and I swear I thought the jiggling had snapped his little neck!  So I ran out and bought these head supporters.  I have to say, they were helpful.  I put the larger one in the swing and left the smaller one in the car seat.  They did seem to help control the head bobbing until he was old enough to hold up his own head.The cons:1.  the headrest does not really snap in to the seat anywhere, so basically you're just placing it in the seat (similar to what you'd do with a rolled up towel).2.  when we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected, they didn't like the head rest placed in the car seat because it didn't fit securely (i.e. wasn't secured to the fabric) and because the seat had not been crash tested with the headrest in place.  The alternatives they recommended were either to contact the manuafacterer and buy a head rest that HAD been crash tested in our particular seat model, or to just use rolled up towels.  (I'm not sure what difference a towel would make in a crash, but I'm just repeating what they said)In the end, we disregarded what the police had recomended and just used the headrest until our son no longer needed them (which really wasn't all that long).  The product worked fine and luckily we didn't need to test out the whole crash test theory.Having said that, would I buy this again?  Probably not.  Like I said, the product worked well and I gave it 4 stars because we really didn't have any problems with it, but all things considered, why not just roll up a couple of towels?	
- 1	I originally chose this spout cover over because it was cute and unique. However, after opening the package, I realized it is also very flimsy. It is made of a very light weight foam material, not plastic. I decided to give it a try anyway and now regret it. The first time my son pulled on it (and of course he is going to be curious, he is a one year old!), it began to rip along the top seam. I imagine it will soon be unusable. I was very disappointed because it looked so cute. The only way this would hold up is if your child never touches it, and anyone with a small child knows that is highly unlikely! Considering it was designed for a child's protection during bath time, I would have to say this is quite a failure.	
1. 	This little bean is made with teething babies in mind! My son brings this everywhere! The long parts are perfect size for holding and the head is perfect size for biting. I got compliments from everyone for this toy- they think its adorable and so do I. I love that it is also safe and not plastic. I will be buying more under the nile toys for sure! It is the best $6 I have spent!	
- 1	not easy to clean, straw is not easy to put pack after washing. not sure about them. i gave them away, my 1,5 yr old didnt like them.	
- 1	I almost wrote a glowing review when i first got it. it sat on the faucet fine, it protected their heads, i could use the thingamajig that makes the shower go on and off easily, and the kids loved how it spread out the water and that i could fill it will bubble bath. that was the honeymoon period...the bubble bath dispenser stopped working pretty quickly even though i tried washing it (i figured it was sticky with soap) and helping it along with my fingers while it ran, but it became more of a hassle than to just pour the bubble bath or shampoo directly in the running water.then the mildew... oh the mildew. i didn't initially take it off after every bath but noticed it was started to get a little black on the inside. so i bleached the heck out of it and then took it off and hung it to dry after every bath. it was still FULL of mildew. it was stained to the point that even though i knew it was disinfected i just couldn't use it anymore because the whole bottom was tie dyed with black mildew stains.overall since i had to buy another faucet cover anyway it was a dumb purchase.	
1. 	My 9 month old loves this toy!  She may not like trying to get the shapes in yet, but she loves to spin the sorter and turn the tail.  She likes for me to put the shapes in and watch them spill out...	
- 1	I bought this pump because, as a stay-at-home mom, I expected to pump very little (just to relieve engorgement, etc).  Unfortunately, my daughter had difficulty transferring the milk from my breast, and in order for her to get enough milk, I had to pump and bottle-feed her eight times a day.  Since I already owned this pump (and didn't want to spend a ton on an electric pump), I tried to make this one work.  It lasted less than three days before the gasket that helps create the suction gave out.  I'm sure Medela would have replaced it (later experience with the company left me extremely impressed with their customer service), however I had come to the conclusion that manual pumping eight times a day was not going to work for me.  The muscles in my hand and forearm were exhausted from the work, and I found the suction created by this device (before the gasket gave out) hurt my nipples too much.  I was able to return the pump and bought a Medela Swing to replace it.  The Swing worked much better for me.  If you have to pump often, it is much more convenient to have the pump do the work itself, it is quicker than manually pumping (at least in my experience) and the adjustable suction on the Swing made it much more comfortable to use.  Overall, if you expect to need to pump more than once or twice a day, you may want to consider the investment in an electric pump.	
1. 	After our twins got too big for baths in the sink but still too small to just sit in a tub, we were at a loss.  All of tubs we saw were meant for one kid and we were hoping to be able to give them baths at the same time.  I finally saw the EuroBath and decided to try it out.  It worked fantastically!  One baby had to recline while the other partially sat up, but we could finally give them baths at the same time.  We've been using it for several months now with no problems whatsoever.  Our kids love it and so do we!	
1. 	I love the mellow music that this bouncer plays.  Not the typical loud nursery rhymes.  It is very soothing for my baby.	
1. 	I highly recommend this product..it's affordable..it gets the job done...no odor..you can literally use the shopping bags as pail liners...	
- 1	The weld on this gate broke after 4 months of use!  I was surprised based on what this gate costs.  I won't be getting this gate again!	
1. 	I bought this to help with teething and help my baby explore new food without choking.  Overall , it's pretty good.  I think you can buy this one and not the Starter Kit.  All you really need is one set.  I have tried it with ice, which she loves, and peas and a frozen peach.  It is a huge mess, which I can deal with.  The main issue I have with it is that the mesh is pretty thick so it's hard for her to actually get any food out of it.  It is easy to clean and she likes it overall.  I wouldn't say this is one of my indispensable baby items though.	
1. 	Bought these after giving birth to my second child. Had trouble pumping/breastfeeding the first so I was looking for solutions. Not sure I needed the XL shields, might have been ok with L, but these work great. They are comfortable, wash up well & I feel they will last.	
1. 	My husband and I knew very little about carseats and early on in our research we kept hearing that Britax seats were the best.  In the end we bought the Roundabout and we could not be happier!  Our son grew too tall for his infant carrier at the ripe old age of 4 months so we needed a convertable seat for him earlier than anticipated.  The Roundabout is plush and comfrotable, not to mention being one of the safest seats on the market.  I drive a VW Jetta and the seat fits nicely in the middle.  The rest of the backseat is tight but getting two more people in there is doable.  We have a Graco Comfortsport in our other car and while our son likes both seats, there is a huge difference between the two.  The Roundabout was fairly easy to install and it is easy to adjust the straps.I love it and would but another in a heartbeat.	
1. 	Although they seem pricey for a bib, these are an excellent size and material.  They are big enough to cover my one year old's clothes and are easy to take on and off.  They rinse off easily for minor spills and machine wash for bigger ones.  We also use the Bumkins long-sleeved bibs for when we really want to protect an outfit, but these are handy for less messy meals or when we aren't as concerned about keeping the clothes perfect.	
- 1	Unfortunately I believed a previous review that this item fits the Baby Bjorn Crib Light 2 and upon checking out when Amazon said the Baby Bjorn is often purchased with the American Baby Waterproof Quilted Crib cover and the fitted sheet - I purchased both.  NEITHER FITS so listen to Baby Bjorn when they say ONLY Baby Bjorn sheets fit our Baby Bjorn crib light 2!	
- 1	Very disappointed with this product. I am unable to use it because there is not much space to push the buttons in on the sides and turn to open the door. when I turn the handle, the bottom of the lock rubs the door frame & makes it near impossible to turn to open the door.	
1. 	I use these for my twin boys primarily after they are done nursing for spit ups. They are very absorbent and wash very well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.	
1. 	My little one can't sleep without it; it doesn't seem like much as nothing moves, but the calming lights really do something for the little ones. Everything is secure (can't get to the batteries without a screwdriver) and it never gets hot! Sure you might get some star indents if your little one sleeps on it...but that's okay.	
- 1	it was super tight for my 3 month old and she cried every time we tried to put it on her so we stretched it out by leaving it on something wide but then we tried it on to our self realized that you can hear everything from outside even the small TV sounds. I don't see why it is named protector earmuffs. We can't even use it for going movies with my baby. It is total wast and want money back!!	
- 1	Got this to make our vacation with a 7 month old a little easier. The bottom is supposedly slide resistant, but this isn't the case. My baby's butt would slide forward on the chair, so his neck and head ended up squished against the back of the chair. Both straps were super tight too.  Needless to say, it didn't get much use.	
- 1	Purchased 2 sets of these bottles after seeing all the positive reviews and I really wish I hadn't. The bottles leak and with so many extra parts to clean, it's just not worth the extra time. As a new mom, having to clean and sterilize bottles properly in between feedings is hard enough when you've hardly had any sleep, you really don't want bottles with extra parts that make cleaning even more time consuming and tedious. After 5-6 uses, I found one of the bottles leaked milk during a feeding (the inner ring stopped sealing properly). Not only was the milk wasted, but the leaky bottle got the front of my baby's clothes all wet. Really frustrating! We ran out to Target and purchased a set of cheap no-name bottles for $4.00 (also BPA free) and they work better than these. Didn't notice any difference in gas, spit up, or burping when using Dr. Browns bottles versus the cheap ones. Would not recommend these.	
1. 	We love these bibs!!!  They cover our baby's (7 months old) entire shirt and the velcro is adjustable so we can tuck it in under his chin as well.  They're super easy to take on and off, we rinse off in the sink and hang to dry and throw in the washing machine after a couple uses.  They are good quality and will last!	
- 1	I am not a fan of this Munchkin brush.  The bristles are stiff and spray the soap everywhere when you run the brush in and out of the bottle.  Another thing I don't like is that the nipple cleaner needs to be screwed out of the bottom; it's inconvenient when you're in a hurry trying to make a bottle for baby.  Lastly, the sponge portion fell apart after a month of use.  I ended up buying the Dr. Brown's brush to replace this one and I like it much better.	
- 1	I personally feel this is trash - the typical plastic expensive trash that is provided to us in the marketplace these days. The attachment is a little plastic piece that latches onto the small plastic harness that you screw onto your britax. And once it is attached, it is not that sturdy. I would give this a much better review if it was $1.50. Highly over-priced. Even $2.50 would be overpriced. Send this crap back to China.	
- 1	this sunshade has very strong terrible  smell!!It smells like $1 cheap product, and for the money ($8 ) I paid ,  I think it`s riped off!Don`t buy it! it`s not about money, but about safety. this product definitely not safe for you and your baby!!I am not a chemistry, i don`t wanna say anything unprofessional, but I suspect this product may contain some toxic material, ,I don`t understand why it got 4 stars?  OR , maybe most of the product are good but im just so unlucky to get this terrible one?? if yes the case,  I really suggest the manufacture should test every product carefully and don`t waste customer`s time any more!	
- 1	Sigh. Why did I waste my money?These are too big and bulky - you can't easily see or &#34;feel&#34; what you're clipping, so you better just hope that they're going into baby's fingernail and not his flesh. The LED light is not bright enough to make up for the bulk of the clipper obscuring the other ambient light. Better to have something small that doesn't block what you're doing and sit by the window or under a reading lamp.Somebody gave us a cheap little manicure set containing a cheap little pair of clippers. Those suckers are awesome and are worth ten of these at what was probably a tenth of the price.	
1. 	I received this as a shower gift.  I loved the idea of being able to get my daughter for night feedings without getting out of bed.  This worked wonderfully!  I loved the fact she was right next to me in arm's reach all night long.  &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;The only difficulty I found was getting in and out of bed with it there, but that was minor.  The construction and detail that this possesses suggests a mother designed it.  Everything is secured including the mattress pad in both the bassinett position and the playard position.  It is well worth every penny!!!	
1. 	I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.	
- 1	1. It was not the same as the photo, but I was too lazy to contact Amazon about it.2. Baby only likes it slightly.	
- 1	The &#34;lock&#34; isn't a lock at all.  It is just a handle for you to pop out to make removing of this plug guard easier.  However, I and my 9 month old were both able to easily pull this rounded cover from the socket without even using the pop out handle.  Not child safe at all.  I returned them.	
- 1	Our baby found this seat very uncomfortable and cried whenever bathed. We were also disappointed to find that it does not fit in any of our sinks.	
- 1	THIS PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA BUT IT WAS REALLY NOT. I DID NOT LIKE HOW THE BABY WAS PRESSED AGAINST MY SISTER'S CHEST. IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE 28 POUND. SHE IS AN AVERAGE SIZE BABY SO FATNESS WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND THE PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED FOR 8-35 POUNDS. IT HAS TOO MANY STRAPS AND THE MATERIAL SEEMS VERY BASIC (CHEAP)WE DISCARDED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE BABY WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE IN IT.	
1. 	I waited until I was 7.5 months pregnant to purchase this and I wish I bought it sooner.  It supports my back and my belly at the same time and allows me restful nights.  It is quite large and takes up a lot of room, but it is worth it.  There are many options on how to use it and it is a great investment.  I am not sure how it will be as a nursing pillow, but we will see.	
1. 	I really like these mesh feeders.  The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.  The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.  The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.	
1. 	I was a little nervous about buying these based on some reviews that said they got too hot or melted, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they actually work. On the box, it clearly says take them off if you are going to use the broiler. They get warm, but not too warm to open to adjust the dial. My 14 month old son goes straight for the oven when he's in the kitchen, and it's nice to see that he simply cannot get these open.	
- 1	I saw the bad reviews, but I love Munchkin products usually, so I decided to buy this anyway.The mirror itself is terrible. You can barely see a thing.The attachment mechanism is ridiculous. It is inconvenient, and attaching the mirror to the back of the rear view mirror is useless. All I could see was the headrest of the passenger seat.	
- 1	I've had this for 7 months and I totally regret buying this. It stays up for a day or two but will eventually fall down. It also doesn't hold much. I have the Big Foam Letters and Animals from One Step Ahead,Foam Bath Toy Letters and Animals for Kidsand it only holds about half the letters comfortably. If you're looking for something that will hold all your bath toys, this is not it! I had to get another organizer to fit the remaining bath toys we have and now my shower feels cluttered. Also this isn't very convenient to use. Since the opening is narrow you can't use it for bigger toys. It can only be used for small or thin bath toys. If the toys are too wide, it will not fit through the opening. It also makes getting the toys at the bottom very difficult. You have to dig out everything. The cheap white net organizer that came with the foam alphabets stays up much better, holds a lot more and has a wide opening so I don't have to dig everything out!	
- 1	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old.  We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs.  I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy.  It worked great at first.  When he turned 4 months old I had problems.  I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it.  IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV.  With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier.  Never used it since	
1. 	These leg extensions lifted the bassinet to the perfect height for my wife to easily roll over and either grab or console our baby. The bassinet does not feel less stable with them on.	
1. 	I didn't like using the caps with the rings because they always leaked.  These fit perfectly on my glass Evenflo bottles.	
- 1	I bought this because of the lid. However I find the lid very hard to put on, the little tab / hole on the one I recieved seem very tight and it made the lid useless.  I also prefer the ones that have a handle on both sides. Sometimes I'm wrangling a toddler with a snack and it helps if she can hold both sides leaving one to hold the snack while I get one hand in a coat, etc.  going back to the other brands.	
- 1	I registered for a bunch of these for the newborn phase and boy do I regret it! I used them a lot longer than I would have liked to because I needed to increase my stash of other diapers and didn't want to use disposables in the meantime. Every time my son had a wet diaper the pee wicked onto his clothes from either the tag in the back or the leg gussets.  The one pro is that they fit for a long time, so if you are one of the lucky few they work for (I read a lot of positive reviews before choosing these) you will get your money's worth.  The XS still fits my son @13.5 lbs. I plan to use them as swim diapers this summer because I cannot in good conscience sell them to another unsuspecting mother. DO NOT recommend unless you really enjoy doing laundry or changing baby's outfit every time you change his diaper!	
- 1	I have had the motor replaced after 3 months of using it 3X per day.The pump just stopped working (output gradually got lower until it was barely pumping anything).The new motor worked well for about another month (so it wasn't my supply but the pump) but I am again loosing suction.So I have replaced the motor, the spare parts kit twice, and the hose.When I received the new motor, my output immediately went back up, but its now going down again.I am running out of stuff to replace on this pump.Even though I love the size and convenience of hands free, bottom line is that since the suction starts to get weak after a few months, then its not worth it.I will be contacting company AGAIN (ugh) to try and get the pump in style advanced.My recommendation, hold off on getting this.Hands free looks nice, but the overall quality of the pump is lacking.And not to mention, cleaning all the spare parts every night on this kit is so very exhausting.  Yet another issue I have with this pump.Bottom line:  Pump did not hold up for full time use.  (I've been using it for 7 months now - 3 months at 3X per day).UPDATE:Since I've written this review, I did get the pump up and running well again.  I did however have to contact Medela who decided the second time around to send me a new motor and a new battery.  When both of these were replaced my pump started working like a charm again.  Of course I cannot say how long the newly replaced parts would last for since I stopped pumping for my little guy only 3 months later.  However, all in all, I was able to successfully pump for a total of 15 months with the freestyle (more thanks to my determination and diligence than the performance of the pump).  I was able to pump everywhere from my car, plane, in my room while on lunch break, in a bathroom (I know yuck) while at a conference.  I wouldn't have been able to do that as easily with a bigger/bulkier pump.  However, I don't think that moms should use this reason  alone as a deciding factor in getting this pump.  It way a huge pain to keep up my supply when the suction got weak, and this caused a lot of unnecessary anxiety, and hassle.  I'm therefore stearing all new moms away from this model.  At the very least, make sure you have a backup because if this pump fails, and you are still having to go to work, and wait for another pump to get shipped out to you, you'll find yourself in a bind.  I had to call in sick several times when this happened to me as I did not anticipate problems, and was stuck w/out a pump and no way to feed my child.	
- 1	I'm updating my review on this product.  After using some other brands of bottle brush, I'm going to give this one 4 stars.  This is because the sponge on this brush is denser than on other brushes.  A denser sponge holds soap better.  I found that when using other brands of brush, I went through soap much more quickly.  The denser sponge on this brush also lathers the inside of the bottle much better than other brands too, which means cleaner bottles in less time.  This brush still has a durability issue, however, I've come to the conclusion that it's probably a good idea to throw out bottle brushes every few weeks anyway.  I'm going back to this brush!(Old review below)Purchased this brush to use on my Dr. Brown's bottles.  I don't have a dishwasher so I use it every day.  The brush works well and cleans both the bottom and the neck of the bottle.  Unfortunately, mine have only lasted about 2 months because the sponge starts to break apart.  I'm on my second one.  I thought I had been to hard on the first one, so I was nicer to my second one.  But it still is falling apart.  Won't be buying another.	
- 1	This pillow must be designed for women with very short torsos.  I find that if I try to curl it around me, it feels like it is attacking me.  The pregnant woman shown in the photo fits neatly into the inner curve but I wonder if she is holding the top in place, because when I tried to use it that manner it would curl under my neck.The cover is scratchy,  you really cannot put your face on it.  So you will need to add the cost of a cover to this if you are going to use it for sleeping.I breastfed two kids, and used a U shaped pillow at times. I can see that this might be better for breastfeeding, since you can get a double &#8220;height&#8221; by wrapping it around yourself.  However, it is a fight to get it into that position, and you cannot just get up easily with it wrapped around you.It is much harder than a regular pillow and also thinner than it looks in the photo.  I also washed the slip cover to see if that would soften it up, but it did not. And getting the slipcover back on was a monumental struggle, like wrestling a reluctant snake into a tight jacket.  It actually reminded me of a topology problem and took almost 20 minutes to accomplish.  This means if you use it to prop up your baby and he/she spits up on it you will have to face trying to get the clean cover back on.Back to my full length body pillow, this one is just physically too hard, too scratchy and fights me too much.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old... She really love it !!...It's was very difficult make her to sleep... but the first day that we bought this I turn on the toy on her crib, and when the toy turn off I came to the crib and she was REALLY sleeping....I recommend to use this just one time a day, and when your daughter (son) is sleepy...but if you use it more than 1 time a day, BELIEVE ME, she or he will get tired of it quickly.  The only reason that I didn't put the 5 stars is because the images have poor quality, and now that my daughter is 7 1/2 months, she doesnt like it that much!!	
1. 	Between our two children, we've gone through a number of different zippy cups.  I like these ones the best.Pros:- Hard spout so my child so it doesn't leak when my kid bangs it on the table or sits on it.- Rubber coating on the spout so my teething child doesn't gnaw off little plastic pieces that she could choke on.- Two handles so it's easier for her to grip it.- Dishwasher safe.Cons:- None.	
1. 	OMG this was the best thing I ever bought while pregnant, i used it for holding up my stomach while sleeping on my side it was invaluable. It stopped pulling and stretching of my stomach, kept my legs apart when I put it between my knees. If you are a man reading this with a pregnant wife, get it for her. I promise she will love it and you.	
1. 	Just got this bag via Amazon, first I LOVE that it's a messenger type and not flowery or pink.  Maybe I'll change my tune as my baby gets older, but I've seen friends/family lugging around a whole house-full of gear/toys/clothes/blankets/food for their kid in massive diaper bags, most of which they never seem to use - I have no intention of doing any of that.  This seems to hold what I think I'll actually need, a few diapers, wipes, a bottle or two, change of clothes, a toy, my wallet/keys.  Only annoyance so far is the cell holder, considering how many people have smartphone/iphones now I can't understand why they would include a holder for a flip phone.  I also don't love the changing pad, it doesn't fold as nicely as I think I'd like, I want to pick up one of the wallet-style changing pads that are more compact and fold nicer.  All in all I see this as a perfect urban bag.	
- 1	I wish I had spent the extra money and bought a better brand.  This one was hard to put together, is hard to adjust the incline and is just much flimsier than I was expecting.  My mother in law has one at her house that's a different brand and I should have just bought that, it was only about $20 more.	
- 1	UPDATE 9/24/11: I have had to exchange this item twice since starting to use it in early July. The bouncer seems to work for about a month, but then, suddenly,  the vibration stops working after approximately 30 seconds of turning it on. I loved this bouncer, but have given up on exchanging the item. I just returned it for the last time and will be purchasing a different bouner.5/16/11: They have 2 other bouncenetts that look similar, but neither one has the bounce in the seat (only the virbation). Make sure to pay close attention to what the seat does before purchasing in order to make ensure you get the seat you want. This was exactly what we wanted because it can vibrate when the baby is too young to bounce and it can bounce as the baby acquires that ability. Additionally, the mobile is detachable, so it can be on or off depending on the situation or age of baby. Very soft material, detachable seat cover for washing, not too large overall.Complaint: the assembly directions aren't great in respect to step #6. There are these small latch-like items that attach to the metal frame (I assume to keep the bouncer in tact), but the directions for attaching them and the picture to follow is horrible. I am really good with assembly and this step was horribly explained. Since every step in most baby items is crucial, making sure the customer understands the assembly should be top priority.	
1. 	My 16 month old loves this toy. And I can see it growing with her for a while since the neighbor kids (8 and 10) love it too. High quality and the small size was fine for my taller than average child.	
- 1	I bought this set at IKEA and it's a lot cheaper to get it there. 6 bowls are $2.50, 6 cups are $2.50, and 18 utensils are $2.50. So you can get the entire set shown here for $7.50 at IKEA.  If you don't have an IKEA nearby then $15 isn't bad, but I almost bought something on Amazon once but I read a review from someone about buying it at the actual store and I saved a ton of money.  Since, then, I always try to pass on the tip.The product itself is awesome, so buy away if you can't get to IKEA.	
1. 	I don't know why people are still buying plastic bottles for tiny babies, it's not like they are going to hold the bottle, they are too young!  Do yourself, your baby, and the environment a favor and use glass bottles for as long as possible!	
1. 	While I love the app on my phone (Baby ESP) for my husband and I-- it's not realistic for someone filling in to download the app. Our parents, who frequently watch our baby, have yet to embrace the app world.So, we use this on days when we have help. It keeps track of everything the doctor will ask you. (How many poop diapers, how many pee diapers, how often are you feeding, how often is he sleeping, what's his schedule like). We usually end up entering the data when we get home so our app can tabulate everything for us in easy to read charts.I kind of like this too because it helps us to review what was going on during the day while we weren't at home.	
1. 	I've been using these for a couple of months and they work great. I have one to keep my toddler out of a couple of closets. He's pretty strong and he hasn't pulled them off.	
- 1	I am so unhappy and fustrated with these monitors.  The battery only lasts about 5 hours off the charging base so I can't make it through the whole night without it beeping due to low battery.  And it doesn't just beep once - it beeps and beeps and beeps until you do something about it.  I have to keep it on the charger all night so it doesn't go out.  There is tons of static and extra noise.  Also, the belt clip is not tight - the monitor always falls off of my belt if I bend down to much.  Just super dissapointed with these monitors - ABSOLUTELY NOT worth its big price tag!!  Please look elsewhere - DO NOT recommend!!	
1. 	Nice variety of bottles for a starter set.  I really like the size, design and concept of these bottles.  Once I have had time to assess the prevention of colic and ear aches, I will update this post.	
1. 	I originally went up to size 27mm shields and was happy with them, but tried these and was glad I did. These fit me well, but I wish they made 33mm shields. They fit into the connector well (unlike the 36mm) and are well made. I'm glad Medela makes different sizes to make pumping more comfortable for us mamas! If you are debating on whether or not to try another size and you are having pain, discomfort, excessive redness, or blanching, go for it! Trying different sizes has made pumping much more enjoyable for me.	
1. 	Although there are other brands of products like these, I prefer Avent and this is definitely an item that is a must in my diaper bag.  I use it all the time until my girls grow out of bottles.	
1. 	Bought this for my now mobile lil man. Hes able to see me and cant run away! I was going nuts running after him so we decided to get this and we are very happy with it. Throw a bunch of toys in and in goes baby. Hes super busy and I can be too with peace of mind! It does seem a tad flimsy though and I notice my 8 month old able to push the play yard out of shape with his feet. We will see what happens with time and how long this thing will last.	
- 1	I have a few issues with this pillow. First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item.I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the belly support on my back side.	
- 1	So I bought this for my jogging stroller based on the fantastic reviews. I have the britax stroller organizer for my regular stroller (yes, I have two strollers... no I don't need two strollers but this is my first kid and I'm learning!) and I really prefer that. Whenever we pack this thing up into the car, everything in the organizer spills out. I realize I could just empty it out each time, but I forget. And with the britax organizer (with the center Velcro flap that keeps items IN the organizer), I'm forgiven.	
1. 	This sterilizer is so easy to use even a dad like me can use it.  The tray holds all types of bottles, caps, etc.  Best of all, the bottles are clean and sterilized in four minutes, without boiling water or running a half-full dishwasher.I know, the price seems high, but this is one luxury that is truly a necessity.	
- 1	Okay for the money but feel pretty cheap. You can get nicer ones for a little more money (e.g., Osocozy brand). They are almost like thick gauze packs. Don't think they'll last very long.	
- 1	We returned this product.  I didn't like the fact that you could never really get all the water out of it which led me to believe that over time, mold would grow inside.  Also, the plate part and suction base are not one piece so my child was able to easily pull on it to remove it from the highchair tray and spill all the contents all over herself and the floor.  Not good in my book :-(	
- 1	The basket and toys in it get mold very quickly and must be cleaned regulary. I will go back to using a mesh bag that suctions to the wall as I did not have to worry about mold.  Overall not happy with the this product.	
1. 	My son is 3 months old and from birth has been extremely gassy. He also has reflux so we are constantly dealing with spitting up, burping issues, and excess gas. I originally used the Dr. Browns bottles because I had heard SO many good things about them. Well, Dr. Brown's bottles did not work for us. I recently decided to try the VentAire bottle, based on a friend who was happy with them. As soon as I switched I noticed a major reduction in my sons gas. I also immediately noticed that he was burping better, both during and after a feeding. I highly recommend these bottles, especially if you are dealing with spitting up and gas issues. Putting the bottles together is an extra step, but a lot less time consuming than putting together the Dr. Browns bottles, and it's well worth the effort.	
1. 	We bought this gate to keep our cats out of my husband's study - keeping the door closed in the hot summer months makes the room quite hot (with all the computers, etc.)The gate works wonderfully - the cats have jumped the shorter version (one of them hurting their leg in the process.)  The taller gate is just the ticket.  I recommend it highly.I've just picked up my second one of these gates to block the stairway at my new house (my cats are old and I don't want themwandering around the top floor.)With the addition of the recommended bannister kit, it took only about half an hour to set this up on the stairway.  I don't know if it is sturdy enough to keep children out, but it certainly works for my cats.	
1. 	Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape.	
1. 	It works well for our Sorelle Rosa crib which has relatively thin bars and hidden hardware.  The covers are a couple inches short for the length of the crib but this works well since cribs with hidden hardware also have bars flush against both ends of the length that would have made it hard to pinch off the last bits of velcro.  Note that the velcro attachment extends the full length of the teether cover.Also worth noting is that the material can be bunched up for the attachment of a cozy crib tent.  This takes out the extra length provided in the attachment strips of the tent while giving a bit more volume to teether cover.  It looks seamless to the casual observer.We're still waiting for the baby but the product looks quite durable and the initial wash didn't cause any pilling.	
1. 	We love this!  We actually use it as a back up in the car, especially when my husband takes our 2 year old out alone so that he does not have to drag her into a male restroom.  We have also switched to using old grocery bags with napkins inside - it works just the same (so long as the bags have no holes) because when she first started potty training we were going through the other bags too quickly and couldn't order them fast enough (and I haven't found them in any stores yet). It really helped us to be able to pull over to a parking lot and let her go as soon as she felt the need.  I was alittle timid about it at first but we never had any probelms with the potty not locking into place and it's the perfect size for her - she actually loves it.	
1. 	We used this blanket from day one in the hospital, it was so much easier to swaddle our little one in this rather than the rougher flannel blankets the hospital gives you.  We had a hard time swaddling with the standard hospital blanket but this one is the perfect size.  Baby was swaddled and soothed in no time.  It is flannel, so can be a little warm for the warmer spring/summer weather.  We used this blanket in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block video and have had great success.  It has already been washed several times and definitely holds up!  We loved it so much that we ordered a second one.	
1. 	This has to be one of the best purchases we made for the new baby.  We bought 2, one for the living room and one for our bedroom.  You can stick odor controllers in the top, the top seals on real tight, and most of all - you don't need to be special trash bags, you can just use grocery bags to line them.  This is a must-have for any new mom who doesn't want their entire house smelling like baby poo.	
- 1	After 6 months working pretty well the monitor just die. I took it to different stores to try to fix it and nobody could do anything. I wasted almost $200 on this Motorola. I don't recommend this. It is cheaper and so much better to buy a camera system and now I can see my daughter on my cellphone every where I go, I can see her day or night and to listen perfectly clear even her breathing. Don't waste your money, go for something good.	
- 1	My little guy is only 10 weeks old, and at 13 lbs the neck opening is already too small.  He's got a chubby neck, but still, I can't believe this bib would ever fit a 3 year old.	
- 1	This company is local and I wanted to love this cup but it leaks right out of the box. Baby didn't have to squeeze, shake or bang the cup - she just tipped it to drink and her front was all wet!	
- 1	I didn't really do any research first and I should have.  I wanted a different warmer but this was available at the store and I liked the reservoir and the flexible options.  It worked really well for about 2 months.  Then is started leaking and now you can tell the electronics are getting wet...the beeping is sounding funny.  We are scared to use it now.Pro's flexible, water reservoir is a plusCon's leaks, loud beeping	
1. 	This warmer worked great and it was so convenient for the middle of the night feedings to not have to go up and down the stairs.  I used it for almost 3 months and then I went to the microwave.  I know everything warns you not to use the microwave but it works just fine and is much quicker.  Now that my 3 month old is sleeping through the night, I don't have to worry about the convenience factor.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this warmer.	
- 1	For some reason it's not letting me change my 'star status', as I'd like to update it to a 4 star!!  You know, when I first bought this I didn't realize how great it was!  It's much better with older babies (when they can hold their head up at least) and I really prefer the Active Carrier (with the lumbar back support) as I'm petite & this carrier does not have the support, so it would always hurt my back after awhile.  With the active carrier, I can do everything & go anywhere and it does not hurt my back or shoulders.  After 2 years & 2 babies: I love it!  In the beginning (1 week-3 month old) I really prefer the Moby Wrap as it's just a simple fabric wrap and the baby is practically skin-to-skin and it's easy for nursing too, but when the baby is a little older until nearly a year, I really like the Bjorn (Active carrier best).  Buy the Bjorn Carrier Cover too, I really think it's worth the value if you're going outside in the wind/rain elements!!	
1. 	This is cute.  The foot stamp is difficult to use but at least the baby stays clean.  Overall nice amount of pages.	
1. 	My LO is a major drooler, so we and the nanny have taken to putting bibs on her all the time. These are our favorite so far. They are large enough to catch the drool. They are very absorbent - other bibs I have tried seem to repel the spit, which isn't helpful. Or they soak through easily, which means having to change LO's clothes. Two or three of these bibs can see my LO through the day, whereas other bibs have to be changed more frequently.My only gripe is that we have a problem with these weird dark greenish stains that develop and get worse with subsequent use and washing - I'm afraid it could be mold of some sort. I searched the other reviews and looks like only two other reviewers mention a similar issue. Not sure what is going on. We do laundry every other day and have not seen these dark stains on any other baby items. We had actually borrowed a set of these bibs from a friend and managed to ruin nearly all of the bibs before returning them to her. (I bought her an Amazon gift card to replace the value!) Since we needed more bibs, I bought a brand new set and paid close attention to the issue. So far, I've seen the stains develop on one of the bibs after a few weeks of use. I had initially thought they were food stains, but these are dark, spotty discolorations, and not really consistent with food. (I have not used the new set of bibs with food.) So the mystery continues...	
- 1	I washed the changing pad covers according to the directions, and they turned rough and fuzzy.  REALLY fuzzy on the back of it, and kind of fuzzy on the top.  It is also impossible to get poop stains out of it...and with a new baby, poop will be everywhere!  We have just started to lay a hand towel down on the changing table.  It is bigger than these crummy pads and stains come out much better!	
- 1	Ordered this for my bottle-refusing 3 month old. It was exactly like the Tomee Tippee bottles she was already refusing. There is nothing special about this bottle. I'm sure it's fine, but I feel it's overpriced.	
1. 	Along with my bouncer, this swing has kept my son entertained for about 5 months!First of all, you have to know...*  The swing is quite large, and warrents a nice chunk of our den. I can say that it doesnt need a very open area (like the middle of the floor) so thats good.*  The mobile is timed, I wish that we could just push a button and it would go FOREVER until you pressed OFF. My baby does LOVE this part of the swing though.*  For an infant (until my son was about 2 months) the swing went a bit too fast for him, even on the slowest setting. We solved this by using heavy blankets that drag onto the floor.*  You will need a screwdrived to assemble it!*  The swing DOES fold, but this isnt a fold that means lug it around and bring to grandmas! I use the bouncer, and a simpler swing for that... because the O.W isnt built for travel.Now, this is why the swing gets 5 stars...*  My baby LOVES it. If hes a bit fussy, sometimes the saucer doesnt soothe him... The ocean wonders does! He still fits, and the seat is very comfortable. It also got him onto a napping schedual, and its a great place to put baby while you need to eat or something.*  The battery life is suprizingly good, considering most of the toys in the O.W set eat batteries like crazy. I change them every 2 months of constant use.*  The toys are intruiging, and never get old. Its also a great place to bottle feed the baby. The music has a few settings, but all of them are deal-able and quiet enough so I can hear the T.V.*  Other than the Jungle Plaid (not enough toys) and the Papasan (too much MONEY!) the Aquarium was the only swing that had the cradle motion as well as the old fashion swing motion. My boy has ALWAYS prefered cradle.All in all this product is fantastic, and is still saving our skins today! I have no idea what we will do when he outgrows it... do they make this swing in adult sizes?	
1. 	This nipple works great for both my babies. Does not interfere with breastfeeding. No problems latching (on either) going back and forth from breast to bottle.	
1. 	I really liked this gate. It goes to 60, no more. It took a little while to put up, and like all pressure mounts can do, it fell once. Other than that, it does what it should and I like the mesh; it's harder to climb.	
1. 	This sponge works great for travel. I used it over the holidays instead of lugging the infant tub around. It is a bit hard to wring out, that could be improved.	
- 1	We had this item on our baby gift registry and just received it. The packaging clearly states that the backing is made of vinyl, not polyester. Only the batting is polyester. This is an essential difference if you are avoiding toxic materials in your baby gear.	
- 1	This was way too small for the price that it is.  Also it seemed like my kid could just knock it over.  Check out super panel playyard for same price and the extensions are much cheaper!	
- 1	We loved this - so useful with all the pockets/etc., but after a week of use, it started to STINK like mildew (even though we washed it a few times and even dried it out every time).  Had to ultimately throw it away and just keep the kneeling cushion.	
- 1	Absolutely the worst!  The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out.  Buy the old school kind for REAL safety!!!	
- 1	This stopped working correctly, shortly after I got it.  When I try to use the ocean or white noise sounds, the machine shuts off after just a few seconds (even after putting in new batteries.)  Also, it no longer starts up in the same mode that was last used, like it used to do when I first got it.I'm unable to return it, because the person who got it for my baby shower bought it ahead of time, so now it's past the window of time where I'm able to return it.Loved it for the short period of time that it actually worked.:(	
1. 	What I liked:Firm and has kept it's shape. Provides support for the back. Like the pocket. Great for just having baby sleep in one's lap while reading a book. Simple to adjust the straps.What I didn't like:Could only use it in the cradle-hold position. Had to use pillows for all other positions. Depending on your body's proportions, you still might need a pillow placed under My Breast Friend to bring the baby high enough to the level of your breasts - I did.Great for use while sitting in the bed, on the floor or in a nursing chair but not in a regular recliner/lazyboy - the front slopes up because of the chair's incline.Why the four stars: Overall, would buy it again even though a bit pricey. I had the navy-blue fabric with white flowers - the color bleeds a fair amount initially, beware!Take it to the hospital with you. And if this is your first time, please see a Lactation Consultant/attend a local La Leche League meeting.	
1. 	More comfy than my Boppy body pillow from 1st pregnancy, but still not the amazing pillow I hoped for. (to be fair, there may not be such a pillow).  Still, a necessity for second half of pregnancy.  I like that it has a removable, washable cover.  Would recommend to a friend, and definitely would recommend over Boppy.	
1. 	After reading dozens of reviews of different outlet cover, got a few different kinds.  This worked the best.  Was very easy (I didn't even need my husband's help installing) and laid perfectly flat and tight.	
1. 	These are way better than those bulky plugs my son tried to take these out but he couldn't. I totally approve of these.	
1. 	Great bed! Transitioned my 2yr old daughter to this bed after her crib and we LOVE it! She does too! She was so excited to have her first real bed and wanted to go to bed right away when she saw it! It is rich in color, very well done and sturdy. I sit on it (150lbs) often and I have layed down with her a few times with no problems! She sometimes walks on the bars supporting the bed underneath when we remove the mattress for linen changes (she is 38lbs) and they hold her.  The standard crib mattress fits snugly right into this frame with no problem. We actually purchased a memory foam padding (twin size) and cut it to fit her crib mattress and encased in a mattress covering. Crib mattresses are so hard and we really wanted her to have comfort now that she is old enough to not have a hard mattress. All this fits great in this bed. The bars are great keeping her from rolling out of bed. I usually find her backed up against them while sleeping so glad they are there.  My only gripe is that we had the davinci crib which was supposed to convert to a toddler bed but did not work out so we had to buy this product. Anyway...glad we did because it is perfect for her. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed!	
- 1	This powerstrip cover is pointless.  Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.	
1. 	I've been using these for a few months now and I think they are great.  The lid lets me stack easily in my drawer freezer.  I wash them in the dishwasher (including high heat dry and sanitize setting) and haven't had any issues with the lids fitting or warping.  In fact, I just got two more as a hand-me-down from a friend who used them for her children (several years) and they still look great, so they hold up well.	
1. 	it moves around a lot.but it does what it's supposed to.having a wipes case on top weighs it down a bit, which is good.all in all, not a great idea to have all this stuff on the counter where the baby loves to reach for it and play.	
1. 	This pillow is a godsend for pregnant women.  It supports just about every part of the body that needs it and it's SO COMFORTABLE!The only complaint I have is that it takes up a lot of room so hubby doesn't have much room left in the bed!	
- 1	For those of you that don't know, there was a version of this in the nineteenth century that KILLED babies. The milk couldn't be cleaned out of the tubes completely and it would rot and cause severe diarrhea which sometimes ended up being fatal. I'm not sure if this tube would have the same problem or if they have since developed some way of cleaning out the ENTIRE tube since then, but I'm not risking my child's life for convenience! [...]	
1. 	This item works great for us! Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it.	
- 1	This mat is very cheaply and poorly made - also much smaller than other similar mats. We purchased this when my baby started rolling around at 3-4 months... the mat would not stay together and all of the pieces would break apart from hardly any movement. We returned it and got an awesome mat we love from costco!	
- 1	I wish mine were counterfeit. That way I could return this torture device.Unfortunately it is authentic and I'm stuck with it.I registered for this item on my baby registry and received it at my shower. When the time came to try it on with my baby, it was too late to return it.The product itself is a high quality item. The problem is just that it doesn't fit my (average height and weight) body. All of baby's weight is either on my bladder or my low back, depending on how I adjust all the straps. While those things are super fun reminders of being pregnant, it's just not what I'm looking for in a baby carrier.I'm holding out hope that when baby is a bit bigger the back-carry option will be good for us.Also, the side-carry feature... is that a joke? The strap goes exactly across your throat!	
- 1	I bought four of these total, thinking the first two were just back QTs, but all four actually started to unravel at the ends.  I like that they just have a snap button and are safe for baby, however, the unraveling became dangerous because the threads soon came loose, thus making it a choking hazard for baby.  I recommend the Boogin sippy straps for toys as well (LOVE these! - bought many and they hold up very well).  You can use the velcro part to link the toy (where your kid would be holding the toy) and the neoprene part (which is intended to use to 'grip' the sippy) and use that end to attach to your car seat, stroller bar, etc, etc....  MUCH better quality.	
- 1	As everyone else says, this thing doesn't work. Takes like 45 mins to heat a 4 oz glass bottle. Useless! I now carry around a thermos brand insulated food jar that I fill with boiling water. Keeps hot all day (easy to refill at coffee shops, etc too) and heats a chilled glass bottle in about 20 seconds. Can't beat that!! It was suggested by another reviewer and it works really, really well! :D	
1. 	My son will not sleep at night without being swaddled. This product was an amazing purchase. The swaddle is attached to the sack so the risk of suffocation of using a normal blanket is substantially reduced. My only complaint is that I have a really big boy and the largest size the sleep sack goes to is &#34;small&#34; which only fits up to 18 lbs. My son is 3 months old and is very long. He is almost too big for this even though we could still use a swaddle :(	
- 1	To go straight to my points:1) It leaks (I'll upload pictures)2) After 30 minutes of steaming 1 1/2 cup of carrots they were still tough (very!) So I decided to put more water in the chamber and steam it for another 20!... Then &#34;puree it&#34;. When I was done, the carrots (maybe because it leaked all the water) was more looking like grounded coffee than anything else, so I added water and puree it again and it kept the same texture.I didn't want to burn the machine by &#34;pureeing&#34; too much (as it started to make a weird noise after 40 seconds of chopping) so I just got the carrots out (I'll post pictures of this too).I thought carrots might have been the problem, so I steamed apples and it happen again!3) I don't even know if the bottle warmer works, but I have to say, a Tommee Tippee bottle fits comfortably, so it is a good size.4) It is big (specialty for the counter of a 700sq2 feet condo) (10in height x 10in depth x 7in width) and the power cable is kind of short (31 inches)Arghhh I was going to write more, but the Bruins just lost the Stanley Cup... So... I guess this info might be enough.Don't buy this thing, an oven or a microwave and a regular blender will do a better job!	
- 1	If you use Avent bottles, this brush is a terrible choice.  Go with the brush Avent makes.  No brush works well for nipples, you'll have to use your fingers to get them really clean, but the Avent brush works fabulously with the bottles.Philips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brush	
1. 	This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)	
- 1	My son was born at 10 lbs so these we're too small from the start.  However, most average sized babies would likely do well with them.	
1. 	I broke this pump down and put it in my diaper bag. I live far out and after rushing home to pump after being engorged for 30 minutes I had to get this. This is perfect for over producers!	
1. 	I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it.	
- 1	Overall the camera is great when we got it.  Was impressed by the range, sound, and picture.  About 8 months after the first one the night vision stopped working.  Got lucky and when I bought it Amazon had a one year return on it.  Explained what happened and their great customer service exchanged it for me.  Now this time it has only been 5 months and the night vision went out again.  It was a brand new unit.  So it was not just a one time issue.  If you don't care about the night vision I would recommend this camera.  If it is one of the reason you are purchasing the unit I would go with another model.	
1. 	With 3 boys close in age who all share one closet, these organizers are a must!  They help me keep the 4 year old from wearing pants 4 inches too long, and the 6 year old from wearing high-waters.  And since getting them, not once has my husband dressed either of our older boys in the toddler's clothes!	
- 1	Bottles have smell of plastic and ratain milk or formula smell.  we have clean them very well. will be using glass bottles	
1. 	Very solid well made gate. Doesn't have a foot opening option but that hasn't been an issue, opens easily enough even if your hands are full, but the little one cannot open it. Mounts easily (definitely want to screw the mounting pads into the wall though if a permanent placement, friction based installation will not stand up to little one yanking on it). Gate closes automatically behind you... if we want to prop open we just set a chair next to it to prop.	
- 1	this would be a great toy if it has music.I just ordered the musical one, hope it will better. I guess this will be an extra.update- stopped working	
- 1	When I first bought these diapers I was very excited to use them.  Once I did I was disappointed.Pros- not as bulky as some diapers, and they are really cute, I have not had leak when he is awakeCons-  When the inserts get wet the shell gets wet as well and the odor is strong.  I don't feel the insert was designed well.  Its a great concept but not very functional.  I put my son down for a nap and he woke up soaked.  The sheets were soaked as well.  He is 9 mos old and the first and only time this happened is when I put this diaper on him.  These are the only diapers I have besides the prefold diapers so now I make sure to put on a prefold before a nap.I just recently ordered bumgenius and thirsties.  I have been using disposables for overnights since my son is a heavy wetter.  I am hoping with the new diapers I can eliminate the use of disposables.  I know for sure the grobaby diapers won't work for that purpose.	
- 1	this concerns me because I am not sure of the safety of the toy or whether it's a legitimate Lamaze toy.  It looks legit, but this issue just raises concerns for me.  Again, I am not saying that this toy is unsafe or not Lamaze, just that the buyer should be aware of where the toy is coming from.	
1. 	I had registered for this blanket out of the recommendation from a friend who had one.  We use it almost daily.Pros:1) Conveniently folds up and has built in carrying system.2) Decent size, but wish it was at least a foot longer all around (at least 6x6 instead of 5x5).3) Easy to cleanCons:1) Did smell initially, but wash it a few times (which you should do before using anyhow) and it will go away.2) Wish it was larger.3) Limited pattern option.  We got the Cococa Bubble pattern.  It's a really really busy pattern.  In hindsight I wish I had gone with the gray/green instead which looks less busy.	
- 1	I LOVE thirsties covers so when I saw they had an AIO I really wanted to try it out despite some of the reviews.  I ordered 2 and much to my disappointment the reviewers were correct. I used these on my 1 year old daughter and they leaked...maybe they would work better on a smaller baby because they do not have bladders that are as big as a 1 year old.  I definitely will not be able to use these out in public as I will have to change my daughters entire outfit everytime she goes to the bathroom.  I only will be able to use these at home when she is toddling around in just a diaper and I can check her frequently.  I cant believe how wet the cover got--its like there is no water proof coating inside the cover of the diaper.  Really disappointed as I really wanted to love these diapers.Alot of people were complaining about the drying time as well--not a big issue for me--my dryer managed to dry them almost completely and the little bit of dampness that remained would dry overnight if I'd leave it lay out on top of the dryer.  .	
- 1	I researched extensively before I bought this, so I was surprised it ended up being such a bad product. Doesn't hold 270 diapers; the lid doesn't open easily and comes off the hinges; you have to push each diaper through to make room for more. Someone said this was a glorified garbage pail, but the reality is a normal garbage pail wouldn't cause problems.	
1. 	My 13 month old son loves playing with this. He enjoys switching up songs.2 complaints, 1)its pretty heavy 2)all the instruments sound very electronic	
1. 	i purchased this exersaucer for my 4 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has different height adjustments which is a must since she is already 25 inches. She is very comfortable in this exersaucer. After doing extensive research I originally was going to buy a different model but I took my daughter to the store and she hated my 1st choice.  This one she started playing with right away.  It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the directions were easy to read and assembly wasn't hard at all.  Money well spent!!!!!!	
- 1	I bought this as I was planning to have a home birth and realized the initial footprint isn't taken like it is in hospital, and I really wanted that first footprint.  I liked that it was inkless and came with paper, but to call it deluxe is a complete overstatement.  The paper was nothing more than thick printing paper and the inkless wipes left more than just a footprint on the paper - like inkless blots.  I followed the instructions and the result was a messy, ink-like footprint on paper.  The only saving grace was there were no inky feet to clean off afterward - a simple wipe down with a wet cloth did the trick (though, I'd highly recommend a thorough hand wash if you do handprints).  There were other products just like this for far less and I'd have been equally happy with those.  Would not recommend this product.	
- 1	May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms.	
- 1	We ended up giving this away. The stickers it comes with is a joke. We went with another brand (just one long piece) and it worked out much better since our brick fireplace is rounded. If you do go with this one, make sure to get the removable caulk as the stickers don't work AT ALL.	
- 1	I really wanted these to work. I can't keep socks on my 3 month old's feet, so I gave these a try. She managed to kick these off in her car seat before we got to our destination. Now I'm back to just buying white socks since I lose at least one every time we go somewhere.	
- 1	Pros- seems to have compatibility with a range of carseats- easy 1-handed OPENING from folded position (but NOT closing)- nice big canopy- nice to have the versatility of the different add-ons (pram, stroller, carseat connector), but it requires effort to change between them so you probably want to pick one and stay with it for a while- decent folded dimensions with the stroller and canopy on (though not as good as competitors' single strollers):20 H x 29 L (handles to wheel) x 21 W (wheel to wheel)Cons:- horrendous assembly experience (4 hours later) - they left out several key steps... almost like the instructions sketcher had no idea how the parts would actually be packaged up in the box! Definitely watch the YouTube video first so you get a sense of how it generally works- overall the versatility of this requires a lot of levers and pulls that do not feel very robust, get easily jammed (fold-up mechanism, teeth that pop up to enable pram add-on)- DIFFICULT two-handed folding - requires you to push a safety button with your right thumb and pull back on two levers with your index fingers SIMULTANEOUSLY otherwise they get off track from one another and you have to begin again- the stroller seat is only held up by two pins on each side - feels a bit unsafe as I have easily dislodged the pins when removing the canopy which could send the kid sliding backwards to land on his head!- carseat adapter faces FORWARD only - so can't make eye contact with your kid- canopy cannot be used with the carseat for that `cocooning' affect that keeps a kid sleeping on a sunny day- canopy is not designed to work with the pram and the pram only faces one way so if the sun is behind you, you're out of luck- pram stand doesn't add any value for me- the break is a little jenky - and you kick the storage bin when you lock and releaseFor $399 I would recommend instead the Britax B-Agile ($188 currently on Amazon) and buy the pram ($118) and save yourself $100! It's much better designed, robust with easy open/close and better versatility of seat orientation with cocooning sun shade option. It does require you stick with the Britax family and a B-Safe carseat however.	
- 1	This monitor worked great for the first week. Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor at the Apple store.  It was really easy to set up and the picture quality is great.  It's nice to be able to easily launch an app and view the baby from anywhere, not just on the home network.  BUT - the sound doesn't work.  All you hear is a staticy white noise.  Not only that, but the volume on the white noise is inconsistent.  It would get super loud suddenly, then cut down to nothing.  At one point in the night, the sound turned off altogether.  Thankfully the baby's room is close to our bedroom otherwise I wouldn't have heard her crying.  I contacted customer support about the sound issue and they had said an update to the app would be released near the end of the month (March 2014).  I was skeptical since the issue had been reported before and was even in their FAQs.  I asked if they were positive an update would be sent since I had only 2 weeks to return the monitor to Apple.  They advised me to return it and get a replacement.  I returned it, but I purchased the Medisala Monitor instead and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	Loves to take it apart, play with the balls by shaking them or hitting them together.  I can see this toy lasting a while, looking forward to when he figures out he can toss the ball back in the top for music and lights!	
- 1	And I wasn't all that impressed with it. It seemed like it could tip too easily and I didn't like that you have to buy all of the accessories separately. This is already an expensive stroller and it should come with some of those bells and whistles.	
- 1	So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.	
- 1	I bought these pacifiers because they're so popular and everyone raves about them. As soon as I opened the package, I noticed a smell. I looked at the package (which was already open, so too late to return) and it said they were vanilla scented to appeal to babies. Yuck! They smell awful. Plus who knows what chemicals were used to make plastic smell like fake vanilla. I will not give these to my baby.	
- 1	I bought these bottles as I wanted BPA free and also something that may help in reducing the possibility of colic/gasiness in my infant.For the last 3, we have dealt with a very gassy (and screaming) infant all while using these bottles. We are now on our 3rd formula and she the gas has been greatly reduced; however this was due to the formula not the bottles. As others have mentioned, there are more parts to clean & put together than usual (which I was fine with if they were good bottles that also helped with gas issues). Unfortunately, they have issues with nipple collapse and leaks. In addition, the newborn flow of the nipple in this set seems to be too fast for my newborn as she choked every time she ate. I thought this was normal until I bought another slow flow rate bottle and found she does not choke with a different bottle/nipple.Note on the gas: We did try all the other basic remedies to reduce gas (i.e.: holding baby upright while feeding, holding her upright for 20 minutes after feeding, burping, feeding in a calm environment, etc)	
- 1	Let me preface this by saying I don't usually write such harsh reviews and it's unfortunate that this product missed the mark.  But I also worry that the reviews may be misleading and perhaps even false- something I've heard about before but haven't encountered in many years.I am always looking for ways to organize my home since I like it neat.  So when I came across this product, I ordered immediately.  Especially when I saw all the great reviews.  BUT, I'm not so sure all those reviews are fully accurate and have reported this to Amazon.  Notice how most of the reviews are not verified purchasers, entered within the month of April within a span of a few days, and if you click on the see other reviews by that person many of them only review this or this and the other universal product.  That makes me wonder- not making an accusation, but seems odd doesn't it???Now, when the product arrived I was actually quite hopeful because it seemed like good quality.  Decent plastic (another reviewer said it was flimsy but I thought the opposite), VERY EASY to adjust to the three different sizes, came with an additional basket for storage that could be useful, and was about the right size to fit in a cupboard shelf (maybe a little big for the fridge or freezer though).Make sure you note that if you try to put assembled sippy cups in there, the lids will make it all get stuck.  The same with bottles- you'll have to store them in pieces if you want to use this product.  This might be a personal preference but I always take the extra few minutes to roughly assemble things so I can just grab and use.  If you use the basket to separate this might not be a big deal, but you'll have to use the same brand to avoid extra effort.BUT, even when I took them all apart, things just don't fall down smoothly at all.  I tried bottles, sippy cups, cans, baby food, etc. and NOTHING flowed smoothly.  I made sure to have all the same brand and it sort of worked here and there.  However, at least 75% of the time, when I got to pulling two things out, it would get stuck behind the big center column.  There's just too much space right there for it to really work.  This appears to be a design flaw- instead of being so vertical, it probably would have worked if it were more horizontal.With my first son, I hated all the equipment just being in the cupboard so now that I've had a second I want more efficiency since I have less time.  This is a GREAT idea.  It reminds me of the old soda dispenser/stackers that a large plastics company used to sell and my mom had.  Those worked well but were annoying to fill up (now they aren't needed since the soda companies are making those boxes with the flap to remove).  Too bad this didn't work as well.  I'm printing my return labels now.	
- 1	I registered for a bunch of these for the newborn phase and boy do I regret it! I used them a lot longer than I would have liked to because I needed to increase my stash of other diapers and didn't want to use disposables in the meantime. Every time my son had a wet diaper the pee wicked onto his clothes from either the tag in the back or the leg gussets.  The one pro is that they fit for a long time, so if you are one of the lucky few they work for (I read a lot of positive reviews before choosing these) you will get your money's worth.  The XS still fits my son @13.5 lbs. I plan to use them as swim diapers this summer because I cannot in good conscience sell them to another unsuspecting mother. DO NOT recommend unless you really enjoy doing laundry or changing baby's outfit every time you change his diaper!	
- 1	Bought these as a cheaper alternative, but I am disappointed. They are very rough, not absorbent at all, and the edges unravel after the first wash. And yes, I did not use any fabric softener in the dryer, so that's not why they were completely water repellent. Good thing though: I contacted the company on their website, asking if there were any special instructions before first use. All they told me is I shouldn't use any fabric softener sheets. And they send me a brand new package for free. They were still water repellent but after 5 or so washes the absorbency actually improves quiet a bit. It's just a hassle. I'd rather spent more money on the OsoCozy organic unbleached flannel wipes. They cost much more but are better quality and work right away.	
- 1	I have been using the one from the hospital, which we love, and when it finally broke, i had to replace it.  Bought this one from CVS.  It was horrible! Useless piece of crap.  I use all my might and could not squeeze this  aspirator.  It is just like a hard piece of plastic that does nothing.  My husband had a hard time using it too.  Even if he can squeeze it, he couldn't get the snots out of our child.  Can't believe they put this on the market. If there was a zero star, i would give it a zero! Don't waste your money.  Found one on Amazon which everyone says it's exactly like the one that came from the hospital.	
- 1	I ended up returning this sippy cup. The silicone sleeve was torn and jagged. It has a Very hard and super long spout. Very not user friendly. My 6 mo old wouldn't use it.	
1. 	We use this for cloth diapering. It is better than the diaper genie at keeping smell in - and we don't even use a scent thing in the top. It's in our bedroom where the changing table is. NEVER smells unless we open it and, hello people, whether we all like it or not, smell comes out when we open a diaper pail. But when it's closed, the smell stays in and doesn't leak at all. The only issue I have is it's a bit small, but we have 2 girls in cloth diapers, and we wash every 2 days, and it fits 2 days of 2 kids diapers easily. So I guess it's not that small. We line it with a PUL lined bag or a trash bag, and the lid still works well. Just make sure you snap the lid on right.	
1. 	My son LOVES this. The arch is too low and hits him in the face so we took it off. But I bought all the extra toys to switch out (crinkle bee is a big hit) and my son wants to be in it all the time. He started using it at 4 months and now at 5 months he is just as amused by it. Lifesaver. I haven't had any problems others talk about with sharp areas. He loves the butterflies and has never been hurt by them or the cell phone (although that was the first toy we switched out).	
- 1	What is all the hype about this pail?  It's awful.  It's hard to dispose a dirty diaper in this pail.  There is no foot pedal to help lift the top, and you have to press the diaper down into the pail really hard to dispose of it.  Anyone who has changed a messy diaper knows how difficult (and gross) that can be.  I recommend the Diaper Dekor Plus.  I had that one first, and even though the hinge on the top broke, it's still better than this design.  I'm returning this and ordering another Diaper Dekor Plus.	
- 1	I was hopeful this product would work wonders and I'd have a happy baby in my arms in no time.  Well, it didn't.  It's easy to use - just microwave the little pouch and put it inside the belt, put the belt on the baby. Easy, right? Well, the belt is bulky and looks like it could be uncomfortable...and my baby just screamed louder when we got near her with it.  In fact, when we took it away we had better luck with her calming down.  I got rid of it since it didn't work.	
1. 	When we eat with chopsticks my daughter loves to use hers!  The thumb rest didn't last long, but is not really needed for the child to use these.  Sometimes the two sticks will press together and overlap but for the most part these work great and are great for daughter's motor skills.	
- 1	This has two sides so you can switch the product for a different side as baby gets bored.  However, when hung up on my LO's crib, only one side has the picture facing the correctly (the contrast colors side).  When I hang it up with the other side exposed, the pictures are all upside down.  The only way it would work is if I tied it to the crib so that the item is laying flat on the crib mattress, but that is a safety hazard.  I'm not impressed.  They should have flipped the pictures or added ties to both sides so that it could be hung properly.	
- 1	I loved the pacifier pocket the first week. It was so convenient to have the pacifier on the outside of the diaper bag in an easy to find location. But the snap that secures the pocket stopped working and the pocket would constantly fall off. I returned the product!	
1. 	This would be perfect if it was a little thicker.  The fabric is super thin and I find myself having to change it sooner than I would like if the baby drools to much and it soaks through.  Definitely need a waterproof sheet underneath this sheet.  I still like it though as it's hard to find many other sheets that are deep enough for my 5inch mattress.  It still does the job and is soft.  Even with its cons I still would buy another backup.	
1. 	My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive. Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious. But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)	
1. 	smells heavenly!  The price is better than at baby's r us and it smells so good I have been using it on myself rather than on my munchkin.	
1. 	I searched far and wide for a booster for my two year old.  I thought that this looked like the best one, and the price was not too bad.  I was right!  My favorite thing about this booster is that it is very easy to clean! No nooks or crannys for food to get stuck in. It wipes clean very easily.I also like that it is low profile and not offensive looking.The seat does not slip off the chair and feels pretty sturdy.I think that this chair is the best value to price out there.  I just ordered a second for the grandparents' house!	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift which was on my registry. I did read all the reviews here and all the negatives were that it didn't fit the crib. Well it fit my crib fine, but the craftsmanship on this mobile is not really up to par. The bird up top is just a cloth covering. I thought it was an actual plush. The birdie perched on the branch is lopsided. The branch itself is lopsided. And the kicker? The mobile plays a different melody than Brahms which is stated on the box itself. The mobile I have plays something that sounds like twinkle twinkle little star, and I actually had to google Brahms lullaby to make sure I was going crazy and hearing the wrong melody.I wanted to return it but was told that since I opened it and assembled it, I won't be able to so I'm stuck with it.	
1. 	This really worked great for my baby from day one. I used it until she was about 6 months. It is a really nice, comfortable pad and I think my baby enjoyed using it. The only thing that I didn't like as much was when she got to be about 4.5-5 months she would slip down and I would have to keep re-positioning her. But that didn't bother me too much. I still really like this product and would recommend for new babies.	
- 1	I don&#8217;t know if we just got defective cups, but these do not work at all.  You cannot drink out of them.  Nothing comes out to the spout, at all.  No matter how much sucking you do, it is impossible.  I tried, my wife tried&#8230;all of my kids tried with no results.  My son just got mad at this.  I took this thing apart and put it back together a few times, making sure it was exactly as shown in the diagram, and still nothing.  So, either everyone else reviewing these are blind reviewing them, or the ones that I received in the mail are defective.	
1. 	I use this organizer all the time!! It holds my Avent bottles perfectly.  It has a place for everything!!  I do have leaks somethings but thats only when I don't hang it over the side of the sink (duh, right).  It also doesn't take up that much space on my kitchen counter.**update**My baby is now 7.5 months old and I still use this organizer! She is now learning how to use the sippy cup and it fits on here perfectly as well!  I put the valves in the little valve basket!  I still give this bottle organizer 5 stars!!	
1. 	This sleep sack came and I was shocked at how large it was get a size down for sure!! Our son wont be able to use this for months but it is soft and cute!	
1. 	This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a bucket for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can wear the baby down in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!	
- 1	These liners were horrible, they got wet and stuck to my daughter's skin and gave her diaper rash, which she did not have before we started using them and cleared up after we stopped.	
- 1	These stink! The gap in the c shape is so large that using them to attach toys, etc doesn't work. If you link them together they'll disconnect after a minute or 2 of playing.	
1. 	I love my pad, I use it under my bassinet sheet.  It has proven to be very durable.  I also have the mattress pad made by this company as well.  Worth every penny!	
1. 	This is a great crib at a great price. Assembly instructions could have been a little clearer but nothing unmanageable. It also does ding/scratch easily, so giving it 4 stars. The honey oak color is lovely.	
- 1	I bought this one in pink-lavender stripes and found that it's impossible to use it correctly and very uncomfortable for the child in it (the whole body and especially the neck). I prefer the real carriers though. I would not recommend this type of carrier to anyone.	
1. 	I was worried this would not fit well and in fact it does very well. Very happy to have this during the cold winter!	
- 1	This car seat was put on the do not buy list by the Institute of Highway Safety in November 2013.  It failed safety tests because of the placement of the belts (too high on the abdomen and too far out on the shoulder).	
- 1	This bath toy seemed like a really cool idea.  Water spurts out the top and it self propels around the bath while blinking a blue light.  It seemed great. Unfortunately, it broke within 5 baths and that was before my son was old enough to really be able to play with it.  So it broke after floating itself around the tub after 5 bathtimes.  Way to expensive to be so poorly made.	
1. 	Excellent gym mat for the little one! Lots of extra items to change around. Colorful, musical, and easy to setup.The 2 downfalls I've encountered are (1) it requires 3 C batteries (they are located under the giraffe) and (2) the music doesn't have an option to continually stay on until you turn it off. Unfortunately, with children under 3 months of age, they don't have the ability to touch anything yet to keep the machine music playing. Consequently, someone has to hit the top object to get the music to stay on and coincide with the lights.However, the mat is great and very useful!	
1. 	This potty seat works great.  My daughter would not sit on a public toilet, especially with a protective paper cover over it.  This potty seat will fit in a good sized purse or small backpack.  It has never pinched her.  We have not had problems with it sliding around.  She happily sits on it without any complaint, which is a great stress reliever while potty training.  She calls it her special seat.  Highly recommend.	
1. 	Makes it very easy to take temperatures rectally which is the most accurate way! Love how it folds and is always accurate.	
- 1	I have not been able to measure the temperature with this device. I tried it on myself, my spouse, and my baby. Each time the temperature reading was different and completely off from a normal temperature when all three of us were healthy. I can't imagine using it when the baby is actually sick.	
1. 	My son hates tummy time and until I got this item he would cry from the moment I put him down for tummy time until I picked him up.  It was really a struggle for me to encourage tummy time when he disliked it so badly.  This item has improved the quality and enjoyment for my son.  He now rolls over to his tummy on his own to play with the mat.  The product is simple to use and effective.	
1. 	Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.	
- 1	The nipple brush is perfect for nipples like medela, evenflo. However the bottle prush design is not good. The sponge is al,ost impossible to get through the narrow neck of the bottle without some squeezing assistance, and the sponge once in the bottle rarely scrapes or reaches the bottom of the bottle where most of the milk residue builds up.	
1. 	I gave this five stars as this is the third one I've purchased.  I purchased one for myself, one for each of my grandchildren who's parents have counter height tables and the grandchildren are too big for their high chairs.  I originally purchased this one for our granddaughter (since we too have a counter height kitchen table) who was 9 months and it was perfect for her!  Now that our grandchildren are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 it is perfect for them still.  I HIGHLY recommend this for grandparents, people who do not have children as it is so handy to pull out and use for company that has little one/toddlers.  The seat conveniently folds up and has a strap for throwing it over your shoulder if you're going to someone's home that doesn't have a high chair/booster seat.  Fisher-Price has done it again!	
1. 	These are helpful when you have a high bed. It worked well to increase the height. It makes the co-sleeper more wobbly and when you pick up the co-sleeper, the extensions can fall off so you cannot place it down without it being re-built. Would still recommend if you needed to increase the height.	
- 1	This would not fit a table that I had pre-measured to be 100. So we took the item, stretched it out as far as we could and measured the length. It came out to a little over 40, multiplying this by 2 means that this item is only 85. I do not know who came up with the length, but they clearly do not know how to measure. A total waste of time and effort.	
- 1	This product did not work when I took it out of the box. Not sure if I just got a faulty one or what.	
- 1	I was specifically looking for a narrow backless booster to fit 3-in-a-row in the back seat of my sedan, this was not so narrow.  The description says 12, but now I see that means the internal width, not the width of the whole thing!  I'm sure it's a great booster, but I feel like I just wasted a bunch of time... it will be going back.	
- 1	The swing is pretty ok though it seems that it has only 1 speed, it seems that no matter which speed you set it for it still swings the same. I turn it on, give it a push but most of the times it just stops swinging so I have to give it another push. Not sure why it does that but I wish I had purchased another swing that actually does what it's supposed to.	
1. 	Great bath!  Super useful and will be used for much longer than a typical baby bathtub.  It is very big, but much better than the others available in my opinion.  I like that there are two sides- one for a reclining baby and the other for a toddler sitting up.  This is better to use than sitting in the bottom of what can be a very dirty bathtub and  it saves me from having to wash the bathtub multiple times per week.	
- 1	This is excellent in regards to a child. The fan is soft so if any little hands grab it (which happened right away) it doesn't hurt. She actually thought it was fun.The down side is that it doesn't clip on a stroller properly. Part of the battery area keeps it from getting a proper hold so it slids around and doesn't stay where we aim it. It is also a glossy plastic so there is no grip. We ended up clipping it onto the canopy as that is the only place it will stay. While we aren't too disappointed, we wish we had gone with a different option and defintely would not recommend this to someone else.	
1. 	The product is as advertised.  We used it for our baby car seat.  It has worked fine.  Additionally, the seller shipped the product very efficiently.	
- 1	I got this second hand from a friend. Her baby loved it but grew out of it very fast. My daughter was 5 weeks and 11 lbs when we first used it. There's absolutely no noticeable difference in speeds, also it swings VERY wide. My baby girl loves a wide swing, especially when she's fussy in her car seat - it relaxes her instantly, but a SLOW one.I had her in just long enough to do some quick makeup and pack her diaper bag. I nursed and burped her 30-45 minutes prior to putting her in the swing. She was swinging for 10-15 minutes when I heard her fussing because she woke up. I went to soothe her and see if she needed to nurse again and she started spitting up TONS of milk. It was literally gushing out of her mouth.Now, my diet is consistent, she exclusively breastfeeds, she's never had a bottle, she's never had bad gas, and she's only spit up a total of 3 times all of which were trace, dime sized amounts. There's no reason she would spit up that much. Thank god I was in the room and looking at her when this happened because she could have choked on it there was that much.I will NEVER use the power swing on this again. Which is a shame because I was looking forward to her enjoying this. If you want something for your baby to nap in try the fisher price newborn napper. It's takes up less space, folds away, is portable, and rocks very gently either from your or your baby's movement.	
1. 	We ordered this before our son was born (he is now two months old) and I am overjoyed with this bathtub solution. We have used it both in the sink and the bathtub. Due to the size you do need a larger sink. It has worked perfectly- it cradles the baby while still allowing the water to surround him or her. It does absorb water during the bath which must be drained out of it but it is so comfy and there is nothing hard or slippery which was important to me because wet babies are slippery enough. I also like that you could use this to give a sponge bath before the cord falls off. Lastly, I love that it is made in America.	
- 1	Looks cute, but started falling apart within 6 months.  We have washed it a few times and the edge is fraying and coming off.	
- 1	I hate this monitor. It is 20 feet from my child's room yet it constantly beeps that it is out of range. The beep is so loud and annoying and it's allllll night long. I've tried plugging both parts into to other outlets but have had no luck. There must be something in our house or neighborhood that causes interference.	
1. 	The point of this isn't fun so it's kinda difficult to rate that and it has no educational value as that's also not the point. I have had this for 4 months now and it's a godsend at night!  In the crib he'll wake up every hour & a half fussing, but if he's in the chair he'll wake up for the first time after sleeping for 4-5 hours straight! Makes a gigantic difference! You can turn the chair so it rocks froward to back of leave it in position so it rocks outwards and back.  Have had no issues w/ the headrest. Doesn't squish my babies head or press against his ears as others have mentioned. The upright postioning of the chair is really ridiculous cause it's at such an extreme angle that he'd have to be super strapped in (and very uncomfortable at that!) to not fall right out. The angle is so so stupid and dangerous!Other issues I do have are the 7 min timer (that's not adjustable) for the music and mobile. I have to go back to turn it on all the time and it's really annoying! And contrary to another persons review I read...I motor does make noise and it's really loud! We could never have this in our bedroom cause we wouldn't be able to sleep so we have to only use it in our living room. If the dial is turned anywhere past the first few notches you here the motor going back and forth. Also w/ each swing one side of the contraption at the back of the leg moves slightly up from the floor. Not dangerous as it's just barely but that also causes it to make more noise so we have to place something under it all the time. It's very annoying this thing only runs of batteries as we have to change batteries every week it seems. We just started usign re-chargables cause the cost of D's is far too expensive to keep buyign packs of them constantly. This really should have a plug option. Overall it's great though we are looking for another type of swinging chair that doesn't take up so much room and that's less noisy so we can have it in our bedroom.	
1. 	I got this for my kids for Christmas. They are ages 6,4,2,and 6 months. They love it! I have even tried it in my room and the stars are just the right dimness. As an adult night lights are too bright for me, but these had the perfect amount of dimness. I also like how it turns off after a while. This was a very good buy.	
- 1	I don't like these. I bought 2 for our 18&#34;x36&#34; cradle and while they fit our mattress (just barely) the elastic doesn't go all the way around so it kind of pulls up on the sides. Also, theyre extremely thin so i'm not sure how well they would hold up with extended use. I ended up keeping these as back ups but i went to BRU and bought their brand cradle sheets which are SO much better.	
1. 	I love these monitors. The only thing I don't like is that the nightlight feature is a little too sensitive. It comes on if you barely touch it when turning the monitors on or off. Otherwise, I love the fact that it even has a nightlight. Also, these monitors are very sensitive so I can hear everything that is going on with my baby. Some people may not like this, but being a new mom, I love that they are so clear and sensitive. Great product!	
1. 	This is everything it is stated to be.  It is tall but comes in handy as the children grow up and are able to reach higher. The biggest plus is the metal construction.  Have accidentally run into these baby gates in the middle of the night and the all metal construction has saved it more than once.  The wood frame style if torqued will split and break at the bottom.  This is a stylish gate and the few plastic parts blend in well.  Easily fits in our 36&#34; door opening with an extension to spare.  The screw out door anchors have rubber style pads that prevent slipping and damage to the door frame (even if it is knocked down).  Easy to setup and sets firmly in place.  Only a &#34;mindless&#34; adult will be able to knock it over.	
1. 	My 10 months old baby has now been using this one every night for the past 2 months, and probably still will for a while :)Very practical, it still allows her to roll over and sit easily in her crib. We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!	
- 1	i have a solely breast fed baby and I needed her to take a bottle when I went in for surgery when she was 2 months old I spent close to 50 dollars trying to find a bottle that would work! Ultimately this is my favorite design out of all of them (the only reason its getting a second star) but she hated this bottle! The nipple is way to long and caused her to gag and puke!	
- 1	I thought I broke my finger turning this thing on. I have to put all my weight on the one finger and then this thing vibrates so hard that it makes too much noise! I was really excited about getting this, but it has been one of the buys I regret.	
1. 	Our daughter was extremely fussy and gassy for the first two months. When the screaming started I would put her in the swing and within minutes she would relax and go to sleep. At times the swing (and baby Bjorn) was the only thing we could do to console her. She of course grew out of her fussy stage but she still loves being in her swing and we still use it everyday.She is now 4 months old and really gets a kick out of the spinning mobile and mirror above her. She will smile and coo at herself in this swing for hours if we let her. We now only do the swing for 5-10 minutes at a time since it's time for other activities but when she's fussy she wants the swing.I am thoroughly impressed with this swing and would pay $500 if necessary to have one. The swing itself is very sturdy and the seat itself seems to hug daughter where the other swings almost sit to upright causing their heads to wobble. This comes with a toy bar but we've never actually used it since our daughter is so fascinated with the mobile and mirror. There are different music and nature sound selections that automatically turn off after 7 minutes. This is a turn-off for some but I like it since it saves battery juice! This does swing side-to-side and front-to-back but we've never even used the front-to-back since she's so content with side-to-side.There isn't anything I don't like about this swing. The only thing I recommend is purchasing the rechargeable D batteries. We replace batteries probably every 5 days or so...Thank you FP for making such a fantastic swing!!!	
- 1	I just received this today and I am rather disappointed at how different this is from the existing one in our home...we bought an extra for daycare and the differences are so obvious it really does make me wonder how this could come from the same manufacturer.  If there is something going on where these products are being manufactured differently from the originals, Amazon should disclose this information, yet there is no mention of that in the description.  I am truly puzzled - the smaller Vulli is COMPLETELY different just by weight alone, there is no density to it and it is flimsy and most definitely NOT the same as the one we got originally from Nordstrom.  Subsequently our 6 month old daughter seems much less interested in chewing on this and kept throwing it on the floor whereas she absolutely loves the other one we have from Nordstrom.  I would caution any considering buying this on Amazon to NOT let the price make the decision, as you will end up with two useless tethers that are questionably made and makes me a little concerned about the materials going into my daughter's mouth.  I can't even return them because I washed them right out of the box and gave them to my daughter.  This is priced well compared to the price in stores, but it was definitely money wasted for us.	
- 1	I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good...  I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little, and we LOVED it.  It was much softer, and much larger.  It was completely round along the sides, without this weird S-shape, and it definitely caught more food.The newer models aren't as soft.  The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby's hair caught in it (ouch!), and worst of all, the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib, and not in the bib pocket where it should go.  All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side, these bibs do wash really well.  I've even stuck them in the dishwasher, and they came out just fine.So here's my plea to Baby Bjorn: RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK, PLEASE.  They used to be much much better.	
- 1	I heard that my son might prefer this over the little suction bulbs to clean his nose... but this doesnt do anything! The suction is too weak and it can not get deep enough into his nose. I went back to using the bulb that the hospital gave me	
1. 	I love the Ocean Wonders line.  I have the swing, bouncer, crib soother (older version), and toys.  The swing is great.  I used it from day 1, although it does swing a little fast for newborns.  This is easily solved by placing a blanket on it to slow it down.  I love that it swings as a cradle, side to side and front to back.  The music and ocean sounds offer a nice variety and the light up mobile keeps my daughter amused.  It functions as both a toy for amusement and a soothing swing to lull your baby to sleep.  We use it every day.  My daughter loves it.  It has gotten more use than any other baby gear.	
- 1	It's simple - if you use any bottles that aren't wide mouth (AKA any bottles best for breast-feeding babies) then this is not the brush for you. I unfortunately found this out the hard way, as it was impossible to get into the bottle. I tried using it as a brush for other dishes, to feel like I hadn't completely wasted my money, but the microfiber pads get disgusting and look bacteria-filled within the first few uses. I put it in the dishwasher to clean, and it still didn't look clean enough for future uses, so I tossed it. I'm back to a Munchkin brand bottle brush and love it.	
1. 	Looks great, easy to put together. Very sturdy, and adjustable. I like its build, my wife likes its look. Consumer Reports highly recommends this product, and I now can too.	
1. 	I LOVE this blanket and everytime someone sees it, they ask me about it.  I keep it in the car and we use it all the time.  Washing is fairly easy.  I put it in the machine but then air dry it as I don't think it would stand up to the dryer.  Great item!	
- 1	Easy buckle harness in the front. How about the back?? Terrible hand-tie design is clumsy and time-consuming and does not fit tall backed chairs (which we have at home: 35h). I can understand a 1-size fits most issue; however, I do hope they revise this design with buckles on both the front AND back. Time saving features for parents are a MUST. I give it 2 stars for modern fabric choices. I returned this item.Also see my reviews for the BambinOZ travel chair (my final pick) and Snazzy Baby travel chair.	
1. 	This seat fits in my kitchen sink, but just barely. Fortunately, it also fits perfectly in the Ikea Lattsam baby bathtub, if you don't have a sink that it will work with. The seat makes bath time much easier because you don't have to hold the baby up in the water. I put a washcloth down so that the baby's back isn't directly against the cold plastic, then put another washcloth over the baby's stomach to keep him warm. He will outgrow it pretty quickly, but it is inexpensive and works really well.	
1. 	I love this swing.  We have the aquarium cradle swing also(and love it), but this swing is so portable.  I actually leave it in my car all the time so we have it wherever we go.  My daughter loves it.  She's been using it since she was 6 weeks old.  She loves the lights.	
1. 	If your child wants to get into the toilet, this lid will not stop him. For us, it is a deterrent. He tries a couple times and moves on to other things. But the few times he reeeeally wants into the toilet... he just pushed the thing to the back of the toilet and can apply enough pressure to force the latch open. It's pretty weak and won't save your phone from taking a swim if your kid is really motivated. My 14 month old seems to ignore the toilet a lot more now so I gave it 4 stars instead of 2 since it is at least working mostly.	
1. 	Our 11 mth old twins let us brush their few teeth with this brush. Then they enjoy chewing on it afterwards since they are teething. I'd recommend it to other Moms.	
- 1	This worked OK for a few weeks.As some other reviewers noted the vinyl rips when you try to take the bumper out soyou have to be extra careful with that.	
- 1	The Avent manual pump is much more comfortable and efficient than this pump. This one squeaks and hurts my hand after a while. I also always struggled to get much milk. I only used it when we traveled. I had to start pumping three days in advance to get enough for one bottle on a plane. On our last trip, I got fed up and bought the Avent pump. I pumped four ounces from one side in less than ten minutes on my first try with the Avent. That never happened with the Ameda. The only good thing about this pump is that it has fewer parts and is easy to clean. But I had to clean it more often because I needed to pump more to get enough milk.	
- 1	We had a regular spring mattress but it sagged in the middle. Since our baby loved sleeping on our foam mattress, I thought we'd get a foam core mattress for her crib.  We didn't expect the vinyl cover to be so hard.  For a bed that was so hard, it still sagged in the middle where we needed to put a piece of plywood under the mattress to keep her from rolling face down into the middle. It's a chore to get her to sleep in her own crib, no matter how many crib covers we put on it. We've had to resort to getting a foam overlay which seems to make her a little happier.  Even I thought this bed is too plastic with no give. I wouldn't recommend this mattress to a friend.  For our next crib for our second child, we're not making the same mistake again.	
- 1	Almost every night there would be a false alarm that almost gave me a heart attack so I just returned this monitor. I followed the instructions very carefully and I'm confident I was using it correctly...but maybe my baby squirms too much.	
- 1	I gave birth in July and I live in the South, so it is unbearable hot to wear this, add the wrapping technique and you get a very very very frustrated and sweaty me (I don't sweat almost at all). My daughter hated being in the Moby wrap. Thanks to a friend of mine who gave me Over the Shoulder Baby Holder I get to carry my baby around other wise I wouldn't have. I hope I can sell it to at least make something out of it, I have worn it maybe 5 times in 3mo :( I know it works for some people but not me...	
- 1	This is a piece of clear plexiglass that is the length of you dvd player and is angled at 90 degrees, so that you attach velcro (included) to the top of the dvd player and then to the plexiglass and the other part of the clear guard actually protects the buttons. It says that if your dvd player is too short to use the longer side, reverse it and use the longer side of the guard on the player and the shorter side to cover the buttons. I understand, but it was still too big. I have a Sony DVD player that is 1.5 inches high and the short side of the guard is 2.25 inches high. So since the guard would not lay flat, there is no way this would keep my son from getting into the dvd player. I thought about putting a book under the player, but I think he would just lift it and get into it.If your dvd player is less than 2.25 inches high, this will not work for you.	
- 1	We (and our daughter) had  high hopes for this airhead of a penguin -- the promise of an endless stream of bubbles. The Munchkin Bath Fun crushed that hope. The wands spin and the penguin blows a stream of air, but the bubbles pop on the sides of the penguin's mouth, making a mess, and no bubbles.We tried changing bubble fluid (homemade and two store brands) with the same result. I will try the tape fix recommended in other comments, but this is a waste of time and money.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
- 1	My daughter was born in July and hated this infant insert. It was way too hot for her, and she cried every time we tried to put her in it. We used the Moby wrap instead, which we both love. We do like the Ergo carrier a lot, but will have to wait until she is older to use it. Dad particularly likes the Ergo.	
- 1	Don't waste your money!  Overpriced leaky bottles!	
- 1	The print is cute, but the material is so rough and stiff I can't use it.  I've washed it twice now with fabric softener, thinking it might just need to be broken in, but it hasn't helped.  I'm so disappointed.  Feels heavily starched, and is very rough on the skin.	
1. 	these cloth diapers are great.  i don't use them as diapers though.  i do use them mainly for burp clothes and they are great.  super soft and wash well.	
1. 	The Avent pump in this kit is very good. I also like the carrying bag, which is subtle and good for work - it can even be used as a lunch box when you are done breastfeeding.However, the nipples in this kit are very hard and the speed on the slow flow was far too fast for my newborn (when I tested the milk on my wrist, I didn't get a drop - it squirts). There are better bottles out there too, that keep the baby from getting too much air. Instead of the Avent bottles, I have started using the Playtex nurser system - which means I pump into the Avent bottles and pour them into the nurser (the Playtex system sells a kit with a pump adapter - but it does not work with Avent). This has worked fine for me, though if I were not pumping at work I would not pay the extra money to have the kit. Since I pump at work, the insulated bag is helpful.	
1. 	They seem a little flimsy and loose. But the looseness turns out to be a benefit, because my toddler can't accidentally turn anything on. Easy to open for adults, hopefully will take my toddler a while to get past these. Great investment!	
1. 	I use these in the morning with the first feeding because I leak on whatever side my daughter is not nursing from.  I use them more so the milk doesn't go to waste than to protect my clothing.  If I used them for protection of clothing or for sore nipples I would not have rated them as high as I did.  First, they are not made for really large breasts.  They set nicely over the nipple, but certainly do not cover much more than the areola area.  If I were to wear these out, my breasts would look like large mushrooms.  They are nice in the privacy of my own home, though.  The shell that fits on the breast is comfortable.  It is easy to clean and soft.  I would recommend these for the use of collecting leaking milk while pumping and feeding only.  I would not recommend these to wear out when you are going to miss a feeding and know you will leak.  Wear disposable pads.  Also, I wouldn't recommend them for the sore nipple problem either if you are large breasted.	
- 1	I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock.  I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down.  Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.	
1. 	They are spoons, really what can I say about them.  They go fine through the dishwasher.  I like them.  Pretty colors, soft tips.  Two thumbs up.	
- 1	Initially i loved the product. Was huge enuf to hold the biggest bottle of garnier conditioner bottle, shampoo bottles, loofahs etc.. But in a week or so, the sticker with which it was attached to the shower wall, came off and the whole thing crashed into the tub.. Now its jus sitting in the bathroom occupying the space n not of any use.	
- 1	Super cute, good grip. I specifically set out to find something my daughter couldn't spill, and she managed to find a way.The small air hole to allow liquid to flow also allows liquid to leak. No matter what we always find my daughters cups on their side. Do not buy if you have the same problem.	
1. 	I first got BabyBjorn when my son was just a month.  But I returned it soon after I bought it.  The baby was so soft and I had a hard time to put him into the BabyBjorn by myself.  Plus, Houston is very hot, wearing BabyBjorn in the summer wasn't comfortable for me.When my son was 3 month old, his neck was a lot stronger.  I wanted to try it, again.  He really loved it.  He enjoyed so much when I walked with him.  He could look around and see the surroundings.  I would say he liked this more than his stroller.Although this product does have good back support, at 6 month now, my son is more than 20 lb.  My back cannot really support this weight for very long...	
- 1	I got a very gently used one from a friend. It had been used for 2 babies, so about 6-7 months total, and my baby is now almost 6 weeks. The cloth platform that the mattress rests on is sagging like mad and lets my baby slide towards the open side. That is absolutely unsafe as there is no mesh there and she could suffocate. It was never stored, it was just closed up and left in the front hall closet, so it's not like it was exposed to extreme temperature changes or abuse.There's also a gap between it and the bed. Due to the gap there's really no simple way to reach over and pull the baby in; you still have to sit up or at least prop yourself up on an elbow and be kind of unsteady while you pick the baby up. Plus, to be honest, you have to change baby before and/or after a feeding, so honestly, you're getting up anyway.So, I guess if you're only going to use this for one baby for a few months... and have a ton of money to burn, this is a great item.If you're going to use it for multiple babies, I cannot recommend it.It's not really portable up and down stairs, either. It's not hard to set up but it's time consuming, but it's nothing you'd lug around the house with you all day. If you have a one story with a fairly open floor plan, this would probably be fine, but in a real house with rooms and hallways, it's not convenient.	
1. 	bought it for my baby daughter, very cute.  Though not sure how long the strap will last, it consists of round &#34;beads&#34; (all molded together so one piece) that you press into place in a plastic fastener, wonder if this will wear out over time so it will no longer clasp into place.  I have seen others where the pouched is much deeper, I prefer this shallower one because it would be much easier to clean and is angled outwards to catch more things.  It is not so shallow that things would spill out (unless you spilled a bowl of soup into it...but who does that?)	
- 1	There is really no reason why you should have to replace these bags, other than they make them that way. They could easily make bags that dont need to be replaced, but there goes a lot of money soo....do not buy.	
- 1	I found I liked other product designs better and we really didn't like the aquaduck color selections. Just not my favorite product.	
- 1	My newborn is just over seven pounds, and the newborn size is rated for 6-12 pounds.  The wings (part you swaddle with) are very oversized for her, to the point where there is no Velcro left in order to close it once I have her wrapped up.  I have also had issues with the product bunching up over her face, I assumed this is due to the poor fit, but it seems others had the same issue.  This product is also very overpriced, especially since it seems I wasted my money on something that isn't functional.	
- 1	Yes I read the directions. About 4 parts just do not fit. One main piano piece is about 1/4 too shallow for the screws to reach and hold it in place. It won't even balance on there. And the other 2 or 3 tall pieces won't hold even the slightest tug. I'm telling you, the entire thing is garbage. Maybe you will have a better experience, but keep reading reviews. Off to Babies R Us to see if they will let us return it.Maybe I will upload a videoFrank	
- 1	This falls off the wall. I prepared the wall as instructed, both surfaces were very clean. It stayed for a week then fell off. I put it up again and it fell off a day later. If you are happy to keep putting it back on the wall, it's a great catch all basket. But I worry about it falling on my daughter while she is in the bath.	
1. 	Someone had given me a really nice, very expensive Graco travel system, but that contraption was so complicated I hated using it. I'm soooo glad I got this frame. My daughter always falls asleep in the car and this allows me to remove her from the car and snap her into the frame without waking her up. It's super lightweight and easy to fold & unfold maing travel a cinch. I've been using it several times a week for four months and I've had no difficulties with it or with the quality and construction. It fits nicely into my small trunk. I would have given it 5 stars, but the storage basket, although roomy, is not easily accessible when the carseat is snapped in. Overall, I'm very happy with this item.	
1. 	I'm very happy with this product and have had no issues. I use Huggies wipes and have and no issue with using them with this warmer. This is the first one I've owned, but def the most affordable one I've found and it works great.  It has a little spongy pad you soak with water and place in the bottom. The wipes go on top. Yes, the pad will dry out if you don't soak it again.  I actually wet it twice a week, whenever my wipes run out (I use at least 3 every change). Just put it in the sink and run some water over it, if you forget it will get hard and start to turn brown but just wet it again. The little nite light on the front is cute too. No issues with dry wipes or browning wipes. The ones closer to the pad do seem to be warmer than the ones at the very top of the stack, but that would make sense.	
1. 	We went through several different swaddle blankets (Aden + Anais, Carter's, SwaddleMe, Woombie) before finally settling on this one because it was the only one that truly helped my newborn twins sleep better at night (and during naps). It is a bit cumbersome with all the flaps and wrapping requirements (you have to lift baby's back 5 times to get the blanket on right), but the extra efforts are definitely worth it for those additional minutes of precious baby sleep! All the wrapping movements actually helped my babies tune into sleep time since they became another &#34;sleep cue&#34; in our bedtime routine. I just wish it was designed for babies older than 14 weeks... once they hit 14 weeks it's pretty clear the blanket won't fit since the bottom flap becomes too short. I would have loved having a few extra weeks with my &#34;security blanket,&#34; the Miracle Blanket! Truly a great product!	
- 1	I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.	
1. 	These are not fancy, but they do the job.  They're clear and are very easy to install.  They fit snugly so little ones can't remove them but we (the adults) haven't had any problems taking them off as needed.  One pack covered our whole house.	
1. 	What a great idea! High quality, we have washed these and they held up well.We bought 5 of these, what a time saver! We tried to use the traditional blanket wrapping, but that didn't stay put.Absolutely love this product. We have given this product to many of my girlfriends for baby shower, along with a bottle of Vitaville Argan oil for the expecting mom.	
1. 	My daughter loves this bib.  It is of adequate size to prevent food from getting onto her shoulders when she turns her head from side to side during a feeding.  She also really likes the teether.  I've had two of these for several months now, they are constantly in the washer and so far, have held up really well.  Only thing is, the packaging says nothing about BPA free plastic on the teether part.  However, when I purchased mine, the sight claimed they were BPA free.  I haven't let it bother me too much because she chews on most of her toys and only a few of them claim to be made of BPA free plastic.  Give these a try if your child has trouble hanging on to her teether.  This one is guaranteed never to hit the floor because its fastened to the bib itself.	
1. 	I use these spouts with my stainless steel sippy cups (Kleen Kanteen & Pura Kiki)...these actually run just slightly bigger round than the 2 smaller sizes from Avent so it can be a little harder to get on, but you're guarenteed no leaks out the vent hole once on because of it! To get on you have to put it in place then twist the top until it pops on...not too difficult but you can't just expect to just put it in place like the other sizes. These are my favorite, though, because they're tighter they don't leak out the vent hole like the other 2 can do at times. The only leak it does have is when your child sucks up liquid & then may not drink all that was sucked into the spout then there's leftover...that will leak out of the cup is tipped but that's it & only if it's left in there & tipped. Love these...actually have already bought more to replace the smaller sizes.	
- 1	I bought 2. The material is nice and soft but the sewing of one of the sheets is all crooked and didn't fit my cradle mattress at all!!!!I'm using that one for my changing table pad.	
1. 	I decorated my daughter's room in Koala Baby sun/moon/stars theme but didn't like the mobile that came with it.  So I chose this one.  It has a very quiet motor and the lullaby is great. It took about 15 minutes to assemble (canopy is hardest b/c of small openings).	
1. 	The Warm Fuzzy seems to do two very important things for my 16-month old daughter: 1) It makes the BOB more comfortable for her. She fits better in the stroller and lasts much longer in it now that we have the Warm Fuzzy; and 2) It also seems to keep her warmer. The canvas material of the BOB can get quite cold during the early mornings and this does a fine job of blocking out the cold.My only complaint is that it's so expensive. The BOB is already a high-ticket item and this warm fuzzy, at least in our experience, seems to be essential.	
1. 	Easy to install.  Very good for keeping little hands and fingers out of sockets while easy for adults to plug/unplug things.  Our daughter is only 14 months, so I don't know if an older child could figure out the sliding technique, but I imagine it would be difficult.  Generally a good product for the price.	
- 1	Came in package with a tear at the seam. I kept it anyway. Its white but also stickers in package left mark on top. I think I will just get one with pattern next time.	
- 1	When I am out I always have my diaper bag. The diaper bag has more then just diapers, think about it you have a change of clothes, toys, food, etc. When would this product really be needed? I got it before my son was born thinking it would be nice to carry this around and not a big diaper bag but I have rarely used this product. The times I have was for a changing pad at home and I have found the product to be rather small. Useless and not needed product!	
1. 	it is very useful, i took it outside when my girl and me went outside, i put the diasper inside and throw away, very feasible and clean.	
1. 	My toddler gets so messy that it was a revelation when I discovered bibs with sleeves.  This bib is awesome.  You just wipe it down to clean it, it has a big pocket, and best of all- those sleeves really keep his whole shirt clean.	
1. 	Yes these pads are thicker than most.  I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them rounder before I put them in my bra.I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.  This is important to me because I don't want liquid locked in between plastic and my skin.  Also, I don't feel as if they are as hot.I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.  I have never had a leak-through and have been very pleased with the success of these pads.	
1. 	I use mine 5-8 times a day, especially while out in public. What did I do before I owned this??? It's an amazing nursing cover that provides light weight (breathable) cover-up while still allowing you to peak down at the baby feeding. It folds up easily and fits into any pocket or diaper bag. I pretty much just carry my baby in my sling, with my cover-up and a spare diaper. All you need! If you breastfeed this is a must! Washes great in the washing machine too.	
1. 	Highly recommend this.FANTASTIC BABY BRUSHThis is an excellent baby brush - we bought this for the brush alone - toothpaste will be a nice extra when we start using it (just water and the brush with an infant for now - and baby loves it).  He actually smiles and opens wide.  This is contrast to using a wet cloth to wipe his gums and teeth which made him cry.  It must feel like a baby gum massage or something.The brush is like a large, soft thimble with a mini brush (very soft) on the finger pad.  You put it over your index finger and rub it on baby's teeth and gums.  From what we read (including from the American Dental Association), you should start some kind of brushing this as soon as baby starts teething, but toothpaste seems optional for infants.TOOTHPASTEWe're not using the toothpaste yet, so I hesitate to comment on it - other that you can see from most of the other reviews that the toothpaste is a big winner too.	
- 1	I love Dr. Brown's bottles but after trying this sippy cup once or twice it's been shoved to the back of the cabinet and I doubt we'll try again.  My daughter hates it - I think the flat spout is very much unlike a bottle so I am not sure why it is designed that way for training.  I tried drinking from it myself and I found it difficult and was getting a lot of air along w/ the liquid, so I'm not surprised my 9 month old didn't like it.	
- 1	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings.  There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin.  First of all, the instructions are not user friendly.  Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret.  Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally.  During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place.  The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why.  The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle.  I also purchased the sterilizer which works great.  However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use.  Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart.  I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts.  Overall, this pump was very messy.  For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be.  And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying.	
1. 	we use this every day at the kitchen table.  very easy to wipe clean.  I think of the various chairs I've seen this one is the best for every day use because it wipes clean so easily.  I don't think they really need the padded style.  One thing that was a slight issue when she was little was that she seemed to have difficulty drinking her bottle because she had to tip her head back.  This chair makes it a little difficult to tip the head back when they're really little and short.	
1. 	Good price and good product. Fit well with the pack n play mattress.  Mattress cover is a must have when you have new baby.	
- 1	Unfortunately, i did not like this pacifier. It was just too big and heavy for my newborn newborn...and frankly just weird shaped, not 'ergonomic' for my baby's face. I recommend MAM pacifiers personnally.	
1. 	We love this seat so much, we ended up getting two...one for each of our bathrooms. Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she's going potty like a grown-up. Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo (gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea) since it goes right in the toilet!	
1. 	We basically just use it around our Christmas tree and it does the job. Keeps the baby from pulling the tree down on herself.	
1. 	If there is one baby product that was a game changer for us this was it! Amazing and very effective especially when your baby constantly wakes him or herself up with their movements(hands,legs). Seems to work best until about 3 months of age after which ours learnt to take out her hands.	
1. 	These have been our favorite cups for quite some time as they are valve free. They don't drip or spill and do not gather debris and mold in the tops. We throw them in the dishwasher everyday and the graphics stay for a long time.	
1. 	This has been a quality product. I was weary, after first opening the box, because I assumed that wear and tear from adjusting the fence would quickly make the flexibility useless. However, the fence has held up great. I am sure that his is a great product, but proved not too useful for our baby. His apparent separation anxiety made isolating him impossible. we more or less ended up using a few fence pieces as large gates to keep the baby from accessing certain parts of the house/rooms. I would recommend this product. The only reason that I give this product 4 of 5 stars is that if a person is mechanically challenged, they will not like adjusting the fence settings.	
- 1	it was comfy for my son-- but it's bulky and impossible to dry after baths.  so the mold came -- despite my efforts to squeeze and hang it -- in just over a week.  4 or 5 baths and mold was growing inside and out.  disgusting and dangerous!!!	
1. 	we LOVE this cup. we've tried a lot of different sippy cups and the avent is mine and my 8 month old's favorite so far. i'm amazed at how many terrible sippy cups are out there and it seems like we've tried them all. the avent magic cup is exactly what i've been looking for and i wish i had gotten this before we bought the 9 other sippy cups that are taking up space in my cupboard! it has a nice, soft, flexible spout with little holes at the end and a valve inside. the valve makes the cup leak-proof but you can take the valve off for faster flow for when your baby gets older. i tried drinking from the cup myself (with the valve on) and it was very easy to drink from--the easiest out of all the other sippy cups (except for maybe the take and toss). i'm not sure why other reviewers say it's difficult. maybe their valve was not on correctly? you do have to tilt the cup a bit because the hole of the valve is in the middle of the cup. in order for you to get any liquid out, the middle of the valve has to be submersed in the liquid, which means it has to be tilted more than if the hole was on the edge of the cup, but because of the shape of the cup, it doesn't require quite as much tilting as some other sippy cups with center valves. i also haven't had any problems with leaking. upside down, shaken, thrown around in my bag all day--no leaks for us. the handles are nice but i prefer not to use them. it also has a nice lid. it snaps on and off and has a hingey part that opens and closes, so you'll never lose the top when you're out and about with a thousand baby things and a baby.we tried avent bottles and pacifiers and didn't quite like them as much as some other brands so i didn't bother trying their sippy cups either. i tried the magic cup as a last resort before giving up on sippies altogether and moving straight to straw cups and i'm really glad i did. we finally found a functional sippy cup that works well! hooray!	
- 1	I actually purchased these in June, and wanted to try them for awhile before giving a review.  In the past couple months they have not been used heavily, and NOT handled by a wild little infant/toddler.  I was the one filling, cleaning, feeding it to him, etc.  Tonight, when I went to fill one of them, the ziploc pulled completely away from the pouch!  Not acceptable.  I&#34;ve contacted the company directly, and I hope there is some recourse for me.  Maybe it was a bad run, I don't know.  I just dread the time and effort that is going to be required to get replacement pouches, which may or may not work.  And then, I&#34;m reading all the reviews that say they're made in China....not happy...	
1. 	This seat is fantastic for people who have a small dining area and already trip over two decent-sized dogs.  It attaches to a kitchen chair and is at exactly the right height for my very large five-month-old to sit at the table - although we prefer to use the tray, since it is easier to clean.  This makes feeding a snap, and the seat fits in our sedan's trunk easily for road trips.  It's not as adjustable as a high chair, particularly height-wise, but it will adjust for girth.  Overall, we're very pleased.	
1. 	These are great bibs! I saw one review comment that it was flimsy and they didn't see how it could ever hold up..... I definitely beg to differ! While these bibs are thin, they are strong! It's annoying for the child to have an overly stiff bib.  These are incredibly thin and flexible, yet the pouch to catch crumbs stays open nicely.  They just flip inside out for easy hand washing or you can throw them in the washer.  Having the entire bib be washable (i.e. no fabric backing) is a huge plus! Our daughter has had the same one for FOUR years now and it still looks and works perfectly.  That's four years of 3 meals, two snacks a day.  It's a hardworking bib.  And, might I add, her only bib because we love it so much! We just rise it with soap and water each night and throw it in the wash every once in a while.  She now also has the toddler version with little cap sleeves (which easily still fits her) for visiting grandparents and using as an art smock there. We got our son one when he was born and we expect it will last just as long! Adorable prints too.  We give these as gifts to new parents and they all have loved them too!	
1. 	great changing pad cover, washes clean after accidents and it's nice and soft.  I have this in blue and sage, the blue is very pretty, the sage isn't quite what i expected and isn't that pretty of a color, but I'm more concerned with function anyway so it doesn't bother me much.	
1. 	I ordered two of these sheets.  At the time they were the only sheets I could find that were made for the travel lite.  When they came in I quickly put them to the test to see if they would fit.  And they do they fit perfect.  They are a little thin but I like having some thing on there so that my baby isnt laying directly on the pad.  They are easy to clean and I havent had any problems with them.  I use them everyday since we are using our travel lite as a bassinet as well.  I think that they were worth what I spent.  I wish I could find some that were a bit higher quality but these work just fine.	
1. 	My baby was born is September 2003, and we just started using the Bundle Me. The big velcro closures make it very easy to attach to the car seat, and to take it off as needed(good for this crazy weather we have!) I looked at other car seat covers but none came even close to this one. Some of them you had to put over the car seat and take it off everytime you had to take baby off the seat...a hassle! You can easily open the zippers on both sides to control the temperature, and even take the cover off, leaving only the back part on the car seat. It seems very safe and cozy, and everywhere I go other Moms ask me where I got it.It's great 'cause we don't have to struggle with blankets anymore, and don't have to dress our baby in snowsuits either! You can attach it to the stroller too, which is great for cold weather - and especially great for those who go jogging or walking with their babies, since there won't be anymore blankets falling off all the time!I recommend this product, and it makes a great baby shower gift! I will be buying the Bundle Me Big once our baby outgrows this one.	
- 1	This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller.  The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps.  When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder.  Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward.  He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn't mind facing me.  Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier.	
- 1	I got this pump because unfortunately its the only one my insurance will pay for. It's the worst pump ever!!  There's no rhyme or reason when turning the dials for speed and suction. You'd think by putting the suction dial up full force it would produce more suction. Wrong! When turning the dial, the suction may get stronger 1/2 way and then completely lose suction if you turn it more. It takes forever to pump milk as a result of the poor suction. Most moms don't have a large window of time to pump, therefore making the Ameda very frustrating. I went back to the Madela and am so much happier.	
1. 	My 2 month old son loves this play mat. He started following the light pattern about 2 weeks ago and is now paying attention to the toys dangling down from the cross bars. The mirror that comes with this has been so handy as well, I didn't have to go out and buy one for him.	
- 1	I was so disappointed in this monitor. If you want to put the parent unit in sleep mode it turns the sound off and then it only activates when a sound is made. It also has an alarm that goes off when the baby cries (as if you couldn't figure it out on your own from the actual crying.) It fails mostly because you can only choose between beeping or vibrating, you can't turn it off. As if the crying wasn't enough now you have to listen to the monitor beeping or vibrating at you. Impossible if you let your little one cry it out. When we first got it. The sensitivity was too high and the fan in his room was setting it off so we turned it down a little. Then it was the air conditioning setting it off every time it kicked on. That was a fun night... So we turned the sensitivity down some more. Now I can hear him crying in his room before the monitor goes off. Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this product. We went with the motorola and are very happy. You can turn off the screen and still hear. There's no stupid alarm and the picture quality is great!	
1. 	For my first child I pumped and froze a lot of milk in a mixture of bags and bottles. The bottles worked the best for us for thawing purposes without any degradation of the milk. The bags held up well, but our baby wouldn't take that milk as often because I believe the bags may have changed the taste. This time around I'm buying only bottles for freezing and storing!	
1. 	After a year of use this brush is still going strong! A good value for money in my honest opinion.	
- 1	I wanted to love this walker, but I just couldn't. There is a design flaw with the seat. The leg holes aren't straight down, so they kept my sons legs up at an angel where he couldn't reach the floor. My son is almost 6 months old and in the 75 percentile for height, so he is not small. Also, I liked that the toys made some noise, but without the need of batteries. We ended up returning this walker because of the seat issue. We ended up buying the Chicco - DJ Baby Walker. It cost a bit more, but my son was able to sit right in it and go.	
1. 	I used this head cradler for my son from birth until 8 weeks old.  It was a wonderful product for the carseat, swing, or any other seat we put him in.However, once he started getting bigger I needed to expand the pads a bit.  The two pads are connected by velcro behind the babies head.  Unfortunately, the prickly side of the velcro faces towards the babies head.  Therefore, when it is expanded, some of the prickles are uncovered. My son hated the feel against the back of his head, and we had to discontinue using the product.	
1. 	My son constantly kicks the blankets and I wake up to find his blanket on the floor. The sleepsack is a life saver. It's very easy to move in it, you have complete control of arms and legs... he loves it	
1. 	These are awesome training pants! They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I've found. They look like real underwear. Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents. They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training.	
1. 	As they should be. They work and have all the necessary features. Really not that much to say about them.	
- 1	I agree with the other poster who said this needs to be recalled. We used it fine with our newborn for a while, I actually loved it. However, one afternoon I found it bunched up around my 1 month old daughters neck! She is a real squirmer and easily would break out of regular swaddles so I thought this thing would be a good idea but it turned out to be too dangerous. I also filed a complaint with the government consumer safety agency. I'm using a SwaddleMe now and it works much better, it can't bunch up around the neck. I heard a Woombie is good too.	
- 1	I like the concept a lot but this blows around too much in the wind and doesn't stay put. I am trying to use it with my son sitting up &#34;normally&#34; in the stroller - I wonder if it would have worked better when I had him in the infant carrier seat?I remember reviews saying it worked ok in the wind, so if I am missing some sort of tip, let me know!	
1. 	I have only used this pump twice; the first time I used the pump, I was very diasppointed: I have quick let down and my baby nurses rapidly so I opted to use the greater strength suction in conjunction with the fastest speed available on the machine.  The result: It took me half an hour to pump just under an ounce of milk!!!After chatting to a lady at the Pump Station, she advised that:1) Instead of pumping at night when the milk supply is at its lowest (which I had done), I should pump at the same time each morning.2) I not use the strongest suction (which was very painful and almost gave my nipple blisters), but rather, progress gradually as a baby does.The next day, I pumped at 10am.  Before doing so, I massaged my breasts inward toward the nipple a couple of times to stimulate the supply, and.... VOILA!... I pumped 3 oz in 8 minutes!  I didn't even need to use the greatest strength suction, instead, I opted to use the second level speed available and gradually increased the speed.Some things to look out for:1) If, for some reason, you do want to use the greatest strength suction (I can't imagine you'd need to even if your baby nurses hard like mine does) it reduces the speed of the machine.  So, you have to choose between the strength of the suction or the speed but cannot have both at the same time!!!2) Make sure you position the cups at the center of your nipple.  It took me a few tries the second time round.  Hint: 1) Your should not feel your skin around the nipple/on your breast being suctioned or pulled  2) If you are unsure about the position of the pump, have a look in the mirror to check the imprint that the suction cup makes on your nipple to be sure.3) Make sure that all parts of the system are clean/sterilzed and bone dry before using4) There is NO need to sterilize or wash the tube that attaches to the pump (I've been told it will clog the system)I hope this helps you with your purchase!	
1. 	MY BABY IS WARM WITH HER HAT AND IT'S CUTE IF I KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE TO SIZE I'LL ORDER 6 MONTH INSTED OF 3 MONTHS OTHERWISE I JUST LOVE IT	
- 1	I love that this attaches to the toilet. However, the lid will not close. That's fine, even for a germaphobe like me. But when I have to sit on the toilet, I lift this little seat and it falls to hit me in the back. My hair gets trapped between my back and this seat, and that's disgusting. A man would have to hold the seats in order to pee. I'll be returning this seat and the other one I bought (by Safety First).	
1. 	We have 2 of these to use in restaurants (one for each car) I love them! My 3 year old has been using the same chair since he was 8m. We carry them when going out to eat because I'm not going to ask my kid to sit In a nasty booster that I wouldn't want to sit in lol. They are also great when we go home for the holidaysPros:- I like how the tray has a lid on top so you know that surface it clean when you open it- it attaches to any chair easily (buckle snap strap around the back, buckle snap strap underneath the seat)- the tray has 3 little adjustments to bring the tray closer to baby- the straps come out to wash- the trays are dishwasher safe- fold up nicely so you can carry it on your shoulder- you can adjust the height level on the chair- there is a tray that is the high chair tray & then another tray that snaps on that - it comes off super easy but is very secure when in use- seat belt secures them in their seatCons- every now and then the straps can be kinda of a pain to remove for washingGreat buy, I've also bought several for baby showers	
- 1	I wish I could give this less than 1 star. Just got off the phone with their customer service.I bought this product (the gray center and gray lid version) in the mid 2011 while expecting my first child. I ended up barely using it (only for steaming) because my child turned out to be very sensitive to texure and Brezza could not puree the food finely enough for her. It sat on the kitchen shelf until this year, when my youngest was ready to start solids. She is less finicky, so I was using Brezza a bit  more - maybe 2 to 3 times a week, I would not say that's heavy use by any measure. Three months later, the bowl broke (see my review below) and the shaft started falling out. There were no replacement bowls available on their web site, so I called customer service and was informed that this was their first model, which has been discontunued and there are no replacement parts anymore and the warranty is only 1 year from purchase! Mind that a lot of people get these as gifts on baby shower, so by the time the baby is old enought to start solids, the warranty has run out. What a waste of money! I am definitely not spending another $100 on a Brezza. This company obviously does not stand by their product, so I have no trust in them.I bought this product 3 years ago but used only for 3 months. So far worked as designed, I barely used with my fist child; now  with my second I make a batch of baby food 2-3 times a week. More frequent use caused some plastic parts on the bottom to break off so the drive shaft does not lock in anymore. Here comes the kicker: it is impossible to find a replacement bowl! The website lists a replacement bowl with an orange center for $24 which it states will not work with the gray one, but even that is not availlable. So, am I supposed to buy a whole new one for $80+? and trash the old one which still works?! If I were aware of that from the start I would have NOT purchased this product.	
- 1	I thought this would be less hot than the other options I saw, but it made his head so hot!	
1. 	This is a fun toy for babies as the sides move into different shapes.  The plastic surfaces have various textures for chewing and touching.  Simple, yet a great product.  I recommend it.	
- 1	What a weird shape. The edges don't lay flat so wearing them in my bra is not my favorite look...they look like hockey pucks. I also have pretty small breasts, even for a nursing mom, so you would think the pads would always be in place but no. Often I have to rearrange the pad to cover my nipple during letdown and if I forget the milk soaks one side of the pad so thoroughly it leaks through. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.	
1. 	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months. She laughs continously when I turn this on. It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready. My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib, it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little, however a little padding under it has solved the problem. I have never used the remote, so I can't comment on it.	
- 1	These feeders get so gross and it's too hard to clean them out.  I feel like they wern't sanitary and I just don't have the time to mess around with that.  I bought the Kidsme Food Feeder from Amazon and it's a million times better.  No mesh!  It's silicone (like a bottle nipple) so it's easy to clean. My 6 month-old daughter and I are both happy campers.[Award winning] Kidsme Food Feeder for 4 Months and Above (Small, Blue/Yellow)	
1. 	Like L.Flack posted, my daughter too looks up at the straps but with any toy, you need to always supervise your child (not that L.Flack didn't by any means).  When my daughter does this I puller her attention to her toys and the handle bar and she gets to jumping and watching the lights flash.  When I see her putting her hands off to the side, where they could be smashed between the door and the bounce  I always tell her (though she is only 7 months and doesn't understand, but someday she will) that she needs to keep her hands inside the ride at all times.  I would not reccomnd this toy if you are busy with something else, because you do need to be watching her, like any toy.  If you are busying try the ExerSaucer (read my review).  But overall this toy is pretty safe if you are there to supervise and well worth the $40 to see you child bouncing away.  I like to keep the lights really dim at night so she can see the pretty lights.  It is really fun watching her jump around in this.  I can see though how it is very possible for fraying to occur, but I think as long as you inspect it with each use and make sure it is secure you will be fine.	
1. 	Great product great price!!	
1. 	I purchased this for my son and loved it. This model when I purchased it came in two pieces which you insert into the cover which is waterproof. Mine had no zippers, just a hole on the back to allow for the pieces to slide into. I used it with my first son from birth and he slept great. I also used half of it in our bassinet under the sheet with positioners ont he side to prevent rolling and he rarely spit up or had problems digestive problems while sleeping. I thought my son had outgrown it and gave it to a relative, but I'm buying two more, one for my son, and the other for our second baby due this July.	
1. 	My husband insisted on this for the boy, because he cried when we changed his diaper for the first month and a half of his life.We still use it. It is attractive to look at and does a great job warming the wipes. We have never delt with stinky or dry wipes and here is why.We are analy clean. We pour approximately 1 whole cup of bottled water into the container either before or after putting the wipes in. They absorb the water and stay warm and wet.We also buy the special anti-germ pads for the bottom. We change the bottom anti-germ pad every 3 months and there is no smell or dry wipes. So if you use the pads and more clean water than it calls for you should be very happy.	
- 1	Make sure you notice that this is made of Polyster - it will make the pillow less breathable and more likely for you to be sweaty.  This (IMHO) is a bigger deal during pregnancy as I'm much more frequently hot than I have ever been before.  The snoogles come with a pillow case (albeit a plain white one).  What I do is put a king sized regular pillow case on the side where I rest my head and end up washing that alone more often then the full cover.	
- 1	This teether is a good idea, but it has problems in the execution.  The main problem is that the paint that makes it so colorful and fun will chip off.  Yes, into your child's mouth.  Not good.Thankfully, it isn't a really effective teether.  My children didn't like to teethe on it much--just enough to rub the paint off the bugs' bodies and legs (the nubbly legs are the best teething surface on the whole ring).  But they mostly ignored it.  Now it's up and out of the way, so my eight-month-old can't get the paint in his mouth.  We only still have it in the house because my toddler likes to name the insects, so it's useful for that.The favorite teether in my house, by far, is the Discovery Toys'sSuper Yummy Teether.  If you're looking for a good cold teether, try Infantino'sOcean Teethersset.  These are also okay when they're not refrigerated.Bottom line:  Skip this one.  The paint rubs off.	
1. 	okay but a little bit cumbersome to carry around which is what most people purchase it for to avoid dirty high chairs in eating places. We used it primarily at home after lugging around a few times then just deciding it wasn't always worth the hassle of extra baggage.	
1. 	My husband and I ordered this to keep in our bedroom.Assembly took him no time at all and it looks really lovely once assembled.We opted not to put the wheels on it so it could rock but I do not feel they would take away from the overall appearance of the crib at all.I was worried about what sheets would fit best with this crib, but American Baby Company makes fantastic mini-crib sheets that fit it perfectly. They even have an organic cotton option which we ordered.I'm so happy with this purchase because unlike a bassinet which can only be used for about 3 months, our daughter will be able to use this crib for much longer.We have another DaVinici MiniCrib in her bedroom that we are also very happy with.From what I've seen so far, DaViinci makes great products and I would order from them again in a heartbeat if we need anything else.	
1. 	We've been using this (washed) for one + months in our Graco Pack n Play.  It fits well and is made of quality materials.  I would recommend this and am considering purchasing another for myself and one for the grandparents who have a chicco pack n play.  I just haven't done it yet.	
1. 	I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.	
- 1	They are small and doesn't cover the entire window as a result you still get sun rays inside the car.	
1. 	This tub fits in my standard-sized sink. It's easy to dry, small enough to store in lots of places, and my newborn fits nicely into it with room to grow.	
- 1	This pillow is still in it's original packaging and never used. It is very tiny and probably OK for a newborn to 3 months but not at all for an older baby.	
- 1	Function of the latch works perfect. The trouble is that the adhesive isn't sturdy enough and the latch falls off of the door with the slightest pressure. Not recommended.	
1. 	My son really enjoys his jitter buggy, it has cute indicator lights and sounds, he loves the vibration, he's 6 months and has sat happily in it up to an hour while I was cleaning. Once he gets bored with one side, I turn the seat so he's facing the other direction. I got it on sale at a great price so definitely worth the price.It is a bit bulky, luckily our apartment has an open layout so it tucks away against a wall, but it is not portable and you can't really store it. I do move it room to room without any problem, even when he is in it, I just push it into the kitchen or family room and nothing falls apart (as another reviewer wrote)	
1. 	We could not be more pleased with this item.  A great item at a fantastic price.  We are very happy we chose to try one of these prior to purchasing a high chair.This seat is simple to clean, easy to install, and has some great features.  It folds for travel, and we really like that the backrest folds down so easily.  This allows us to fold it down and push the chair back under the table with all the other chairs.  Clean up is very easy, everything wipes off without problems and our son likes sitting in it and eating.  He now goes over to the seat and points to it when he's hungry.We haven't traveled with it and aren't sure we will, but it's nice to see how easy it is to fold up and take along.Would be 5 stars even at a slightly higher price point, well worth the money.	
- 1	I love the idea of a mini-diaper bag for those instances when you don't want to lug around a full-size bag. Unfortunately, this Brica version is too skinny to actually function as a diaper bag.The diaper pad takes up the entire width and length of this thing so anything you add needs to be very skinny otherwise the velcro won't close. Adding just two size 5 diapers already causes the Brica to start bulging uncomfortably. This leaves hardly any room for wipes. You will need a very slim container or a near empty package of wipes. There is a good chance you will need to pack some stuff separately which defeats the purpose of not having a full-size diaper bag.I give credit to Brica for having a very good build quality. The materials are attractive and seem durable. The integrated bag holder is a nice touch. An integrated wipe holder would have been much more valuable though.	
- 1	I ordered this sheet knowing that Aden by Aden + Anais is their lower end line so it was pretty much what I expected, but I still didn't like it enough to keep it. It is thin, so I didn't think it would hold up to a lot of wear and tear. For the price I felt Carter's brand was a better choice for what I was looking for. Personally, I think it is worth paying for the Aden + Anais line of products to get the higher quality item.	
1. 	Keeps our plugs covered and our LO can't get the plugs out of the wall which a plus :) Would recommend	
1. 	I bought this pillow shortly after I first found out I was pregnant, in anticipation of needing it later. I decided to try it out the first night and it seemed to fit well between my knees. And then, on a whim, I put the biggest part under my head, with the small tail curving towards me. It was amazing. I have always been a side sleeper, and this pillow is so much more comfortable than a regular pillow. The small tail is perfect as a natural arm rest and the pillow is not so thick as to create a crick in the neck. I have been sleeping with it for several days now and have never lost it over the side of the bed, and it is small enough that it doesn't crowd out my husband.I already have plans to buy a second one for the belly/legs later on when I need it. I've tried a full body pillow before, but I'm too hot natured. Even with a fan blowing on high and the temp set at 69, I would wake up burning up and sweating. I think the smaller size of this pillow will help with that and will provide the support I need without feeling like I'm pressed against a furnace at 3 in the morning!	
1. 	A lot of parts to clean each time, but I found that my baby does have less gas after using Dr. Brown's than after using other brands.  One question for the manufacturer--is any woman's nipple shaped like the way manufacturers shape bottle nipples???	
1. 	I use this on a Dream On Me 3&#34; Foam Playyard Mattress with a Graco On The Go Pack and Play. I had to bend the foam mattress to get it to fit into the closed elastic corners. The mattress was a little bowed before I put it in. I just pressed it tightly into the frame and it fits amazingly. The sheet will NOT come off because the corners are sewn closed about 5&#34; in at each corner. It fits firmly and flat on the mattress, not puckered.Quilting is thick and luxurious, but not overly fluffy like a down blanket. Soooo soft and snuggly. I'll switch to cotton in the summer but for cold months this is PERFECT!! So happy!!!!	
1. 	This is the best bottle brush! Worth every penny!It has lasted longer than any other one I have ever bought & it does not have the sponge like the other brushes. It works great, stands on its own which I find practical and sanitary. It cleans extremely well and the nipple brush attaching right on the bottom is very convenient. Just love it!	
1. 	I recommend this to anyone who has kids starting to eat solids. Its so easy to clean, holds all the mess in place... and a 2 pack would be sufficient for so many months instead of buying a ton of cloth bibs or any other variety of bibs!! Totally worth the price, its so well designed!!!	
1. 	This little guy is not only adorable, but works like a charm in the bath. Just pop him in and wait to see if the water is ready. He goes in before baby, and paves the way for a FUN bath time!!!	
1. 	Its different from the other ride-ons available. One addition that would have been helpful is to at least give some kind of horn or any other push thing that toddler would enjoy.	
1. 	If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.	
1. 	A second set of everything is a must for any mom who has to pump at her full-time job. I borrowed a friend's pump, bought this set of funnels/bottles/filters, and I no longer had to haul my pump back and forth every day. Huge timesaver.	
- 1	I really wanted this basket to work, but it just kept falling down in the bath. I returned it immediately.	
1. 	Cute pattern and fits well.  I personally never used the swaddle wrap... just took it off and can use the sleep sack as is since I could no longer find sleep sacks without the swaddle option.  Zips from bottom to top which is smart for late night diaper checks/changes.  Only downside is the fabric pills after the first couple of washings and now (2 months later) looks pretty banged up :( but she will be out of it once this cold winter ends soon.	
- 1	He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great. So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us.	
- 1	This mattress looks like a good deal, but it's not. 4 months in and it is sunken in where my son sleeps. If he's on his stomach (which he can do since he rolls over) then his face can easily fall into one of the indentations in the mattress and I worry about him not getting fresh air. It also smelled really strongly of plastic for a week and we had to let it air out. We are going to try and return the mattress for a better one.	
- 1	We don't even use it.  It has GREAT compartments, but with the way it needs to hang on the cribs:BE SURE YOU HAVE SIDE RAILS OR FRONT RAILS THAT ARE NOT TOO THIN OR CURVED AS THIS DESIGN REQUIRES TO HANG STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN AND WILL SLIDE IF NOT LEVEL!!Hanging it on the wall is not an option, who wants this on their wall??!?!?!?!Be cautious on this design, it works great if your crib can accomodate it, but even still, it is bulky and not meant for the front of the crib.	
- 1	You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.	
1. 	My baby enjoyed these very much.  The only pacifier she would take.  I like the clear because it goes with everything.  But it is hard to find sometimes because it doesn't have color.  We wasted precious minutes trying to find it when baby was crying.  I still liked the clear, its unique.  Would buy again!	
- 1	Couldn't find a table that it would attach to. I ended up returning it and got the cheap $20 booster chair from target that works great!	
1. 	My sister had these on her coffee table and they were so much more effective than the ones we had that didn't stay on and were not particularly cushy.  These don't look as attractive, but they work and they stay put.  My toddler did manage to pull one off recently, but extra sticky strips are included, so I put new ones on and haven't had a problem with it since.	
- 1	Don't buy these if you need the bottles pictured--that's not what you get. I received newer bottles that aren't compatible with my pump, and when I contacted the seller was told the &#34;old&#34; bottles aren't available anymore. Really? Yet somehow they were included with the pump I bought 2 months ago! ARGH!	
- 1	This is cute, but not that functional. My little guy had trouble getting his legs over the front of the frog. And it was uncomfortable for him to sit because his legs had to rest so far apart. The bowl insert is also large compared to other potties making it hard to wash in a normal sink. I would have to wash it in the bathtub. I ended up getting a Baby Bijorn potty and both boys have used that no problem. So in trying to save a few bucks I ended up having to spend much more! Go with the Baby Bijorn.	
1. 	I used this at a company picnic and occasionally in the backyard. It's made well enough to not feel sharp sicks or grass poking through. It also doesn't appear to have any undone seams or rips.  Water that spilled seemed to bead up and wipe easily.I love that it folds up into a perfect little &#34;purse&#34; and has a carry strap. There is a &#34;guide&#34; of sorts that helps you fold it perfectly every time. It is a hardened panel stitched in that you fold around and it ends up being the rectangular little package that makes it easy to transport. It fit well in our stroller basket inside a mesh beach bag.The print is very nice and neutral. Not too loud.I used it for me, my husband, my 2-year old, and 4 month-old all together sitting at once. My husband 5'11, was able to sit with his legs extended and so was I, 5'4&#34;, while our little ones lying down in between.I had the KidCo Peadpod tent on the side as a private area to change diapers and store our valuables. It was so nice to have our little &#34;haven&#34; to eat our lunch and relax in between playing at the playground and activities.The only thing missing for next time would be a mini cooler with ice and drinks cause it was hot outside!The only cons I have are that it was just about the right size to fit us all. I wished it would have been larger so we wouldn't have been so confined, but then again, I can't complain since it suited our needs. I think if it were bigger, it would probably make it heavier or more cumbersome to lug around.	
1. 	Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3 with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!	
- 1	This bowls are worthless. The suction cups do not work. I've tried everything. I make sure the surface is super clean, I add a little bit of water to try to create a greater suction, no luck. My 16 month old daughter pulls them up with ease. The bowls are a good size, but if you're looking for something to stay put, these are not a good buy.	
1. 	these cloth diapers are great.  i don't use them as diapers though.  i do use them mainly for burp clothes and they are great.  super soft and wash well.	
- 1	We returned this gate. It opened very awkwardly. Was not worth drilling holes in the wall for. If you want a gate please invest in a more expensive one. You pay for what you get with this.	
1. 	We put this carrier on our baby registry before really researching baby carriers, but overall we've been really pleased with it. I've got two slings and this carrier, and we just bought an ErgoBaby, since our guy will definitely pass the weight limit of the Bjorn within the next couple of months.This carrier was and still is my husband's favorite carrier. I'm a big baby wearer/carrier and usually wear baby on my hip or front in aLite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling. Baby never rides in a stroller when we run errands, he always gets worn. However, I think men just don't do the slings very well. My husband has tried the sling a few times, and it's not comfortable for either him or baby, so they always use the Bjorn. We both like the Bjorn because it adjusts easily, so switching who is carrying baby is no-fuss, though this actually only happens on special occasions that involve a bit of walking: baseball game, apple orchard, Biltmore House. Daddy usually carries him facing out, and when he's ready for nap, we switch and I carry him facing in where he falls asleep. I have actually managed to nurse in the Bjorn, by letting out one side so baby tilts and I support him with an arm around him and continue on a walking tour. Our guy is almost 20lbs, now, and the Bjorn has gotten harder on my back as he's gotten bigger, so that's kind of a bummer.I have seen many moms mention the crotch dangling thing and how this is a bad carrier that will cause hip dysplasia. Of course, I freaked out about the Bjorn, when I read all that... Our son was born with a pigeon toe and when we started physical therapy for it, I specifically asked our therapist (who specializes in babies) what she thought about the different baby carriers, and if the Bjorn would cause hip dysplasia. She said no, the Bjorn is fine. Don't carry baby all day, every day in it, but for a few hours, a couple times a week, a BabyBjorn is just fine. So if that is your plan for baby carrying, by all means get the Bjorn. When baby gets to a certain age, and you're on a special outing where there's lots of activity, your baby will really appreciate being able to face out!!	
1. 	These are quality made bottles and like most others stated, they don't leak.  They are easy to clean and BPA free.  Most babies are picky, so if it is your first child, you might have to experience to find the right one.  I recommend giving this one a try.	
- 1	Didn't work as I expected. It it similar to the Moby wrap (in style) but only half as wide. I used it twice. The material is also like old gym uniform, that shiny stuff.	
1. 	these bibs are awesome. We use them everyday to feed our baby. The shoulders are wide enough that it protects from food getting on her clothes. The front pocket is great at catching food that falls and liquid that drips down. We've never really had a problem with her clothes getting dirty underneath these. They seem to be waterproof and it works pretty well. They wipe off really easy and they dry super fast. Overall these are excellent I would definitely recommend.	
1. 	The product itself is great! Works like it's supposed to and my little one is unable to put things into the openings if she takes the plugs out. Matches my trim color nicely, not noticeable at all.The only qualm I have is that I expected both plates to be center screw style (as stated) and I received one center screw and one decora style (two screw). It's fne because I have both in my house but I was looking to cover specific areas and now am short one. Sigh.	
- 1	The PUL on these covers is thin and kind of stiff. Plus we've had some issues with loose stitching and snaps coming off. And when you fasten the diaper, the tabs curl back. They are bargain-priced for a reason. If you are looking for a cheap but high quality cover I would suggest a more reliable brand like the Bummis Super Lite, the Sweet Pea or the Econobum.	
- 1	I ordered the DOG backpack because my newphew is a huge fan of dogs, but received a MONKEY instead.What I disliked about the service was that no one called or emailed to ask me first what other option I wanted or, if they were out of stock, the option of refund.I absolutely LOVE every skiphop product, especially the lunchies, but I found that the backpack's materials are a bit low quality for the price.	
- 1	Durability is terrible even for the price, bought 2 and they both ripped along the seems in under a month. Each only saw the wash twice in that time. Not worth it.	
1. 	Like those pads! The design is awesome and the other side feels smooth. washed them and i did not have any problems with those like it did with the cheap ones from walmart.	
1. 	My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in. He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best. Even my husband is able to feed him with ease (breastfed babies are picky!). I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk. I recommend this to everyone. It would make a great Baby Shower present!	
- 1	I find this carrier to be beautiful, and I actually don't mind the long straps because this carrier fits a wide variety of body types.  I, for example, am 5 feet tall and 115 pounds.  My husband is 5 foot 10 and about 170 pounds.  We liked the idea of being able to switch the baby back and forth between us without readjusting all the different clips found on other carriers.I was so excited to try this carrier, and I first used it when Em was about a month old.  She curled into it, in a ball, and I didn't bother making her put her legs in the legholes, because obviously they were way too wide for her.Fast forward to today-My daughter is 4 months old, and screams every time I try to put her in this carrier.  The leg holes are WAY too far apart, and I can't figure out how to make it more comfortable for her.  She basically has to do the splits in order to ride in this carrier!  I wish I had returned it and gotten something else.If anyone has any suggestions on alternate configurations for the leg holes, they would be greatly appreciated.  Otherwise, we will cut our losses and buy a new carrier to use.  I strongly disagree with the 8-35 lb weight guideline, this is obviously a mistake.  Unless, of course, I am missing something?	
1. 	These are wonderful. Please wash a few times before wear to increase the absorption of the organic cotton. These pants, as well as the velour version, are much thicker than most and hold more pee. The brilliant part though is they-feel-pee and your-sofa-isn't ruined because there is a PUL liner hidden. This is the same thing that the baby's cloth diapers use and the reason they are more expensive than others. If you are at the late stage of training and just want a little extra coverage, buy something cheaper. These protect your house without another bulky cover. They also contain poop really really well. Even uper big accidents--never a leak once.Some people expect training pants to contain as much pee as a diaper or a toxic/potting training delaying/expensive disposable pull up. Um, no, and you shouldn't expect them to. A few accidents and the occasional pair of pants that need a change are fine and just part of the process.	
- 1	I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed.	
1. 	We had been using Dr. Brown bottles exclusively, but our little one was getting gas and seemed fussy after meals.  We bought one of the Ventaire bottles- just to try- but ended up with a fast flow nipple- much too fast for our three week old.  So, the bottle sat unused on the bottle rack for a week or so until I found slow flow nipples at a local store.  I brought them home and we tried the bottle out again- what a difference!!!  First of all, it is so much more comfortable to hold compared to the Dr. Brown!  Secondly, there are much fewer parts to assemble- and wash.  Thirdly, and most importantly, our little one is much less fussy and gassy after meals.  I went out today and bought 3 more of the 6 ounce bottles- they were the only size that came with the slow flow nipples.  We are going to keep the Dr. Brown bottles, but the Playtex Ventaires are our new go to bottles!	
1. 	I love these bottles!  I breastfeed and my son takes these bottles so easily when I'm not around.  They are easy and convenient!  I'm not sure how they would do with mixing of formula, but it seems it may not be so easy because seeing exact measurements are rather difficult.I recommend these to everyone!  No problems with excess gas and you know you are getting a fresh, clean liner everytime!  Love love love them!	
- 1	UPDATE 10/19/13 changed from 5 to 2 starsAs of yesterday, one side of the pumps topped working. II was using it regularly when I first go it for about a week or so, then stopped to try to regulate my supply because I had an oversupply. 2 days ago I started to pump again and it was working just as fine as the day I got it. (Was expecting it to because I only used it a few times) and Out of nowhere yesterday one side just didn't get suction anymore. No matter how high the setting. I don't understand how it can work perfect one day and then just die out.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)This pump is amazing!  I was pumping to up my supply and had been previously using the evenflo single electric breast pump and I loved that one.  It was my first pump after all,  and being a first time mom on a budget I bought it.  It was loud and took a while to get the job done,  but  beats a manual any day. So after it broke when my son was barely 3 months old,  I went searching for a new pump and found this.Now back to this pump,  this thing is AMAZING!  I don't know why it got got bad reviews. Maybe because I only been using it for a day. I'd update it of it breaks or I have issues.  So far so good.  No problems.  It was easy to put together.  At first I thought the tubing process would be complicated so I was nervous.  (the evenflo pump I was using did not have any tubing)  but my goodness there is a BIG difference.Pros=1.  Soft rubber like material.  (evenflo had hard plastic that was hard hard to adjust over breast)2. It comes with a bag to put your pump in.3. Its COMFORTABLE4. The different suction strength is AMAZING5. Its NOT painful,  on level one (or whatever it's called)  it feels like when a baby has fallen asleep on your breast and is sucking in their sleep6. I got more milk in less time then I did with evenflo7. It's quiet.  (compared to my evenflo)  .8. I it came with storage bags (but I don't know how to use them9. It came with clear instructions with pictures that matchCons=1. It took me a while to take out of packaging.  I had to cut things and was afraid I might damage the pump doing2. The bag it comes with is SMALL.  It looks big in the picture but it is actually like a tiny purse.3. It makes an annoying ticking sound when pumping.  It doesn't bother me (yet)  but may get on someone's nerves so I thought I'd warn you.4. It didn't give instructions  on how to use the storage bags	
- 1	The lids were strange - guess they were specifically made for their pumps but awkward to handle and keep leaking from where it attaches to the bottle. I was also amazed that the gauge reading was pretty inaccurate - for example when I measure 2 oz of milk and pour it to this container, it only shows 1 oz and a bit, and so on. Realized that on the bottom of the gauge, it says &#34;approximate&#34; - meaning their gauge was approximate. I simply had never seen a milk bottle that has incorrect capacity reading so rather unimpressed. I mean, how difficult is it to label the gauge accurately? Or why would you even bother to make it different?? With the leakage issues and inaccurate capacity reading, we tossed out the whole set - feeling guilty about creating another plastic waste... Would not recommend.	
- 1	Even after reading all the reviews with most of them complaining that the seat was too high for the average baby, i decided to get it anyways.  Some reviews said it fit their baby fine, most said it was too high even on the lowest setting.  I thought my average twins (6 months)would fit, because we have a different walker already and they fit it just fine.  This one leaves their little feet hanging a good three inches off the ground! My boys are of average height too.  I should of listened to the reviews, but i went with my own gut.  Now instead of going through the trouble of returning it, we just prop a pillow underneath and hope one day they will actually be able to touch the floor, hopefully before they start walking.	
- 1	This cottony cute microfiber slipcover is neither cottony nor microfiber.  It is 100% polyester and looks and feels like it.  It is not a soft material, it is kind of scratchy.  I'd rather spend $3o on one of the soft minky fiber type covers or buy a real cotton cover on easy. I will be returning this one.	
- 1	The first time I put this diaper on my baby boy, he made a regular sized poop, and it leaked up and down! I haven't had a diaper blow out since we switched to cloth! (at 3weeks old he's now 3months)Poor quality... if this did work well I would probably consider sewing in some new Velcro as well because as baby gets bigger I don't think this will hold well at all!	
- 1	This cup leaks and the lid doesn't screw on well after awhile. I won't buy it again. You get what you pay for.	
- 1	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower.  I thought it would be wonderful.  I was wrong.  My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner.  In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides.  SCARY!  This started happening after about 3 weeks of age.  Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part.  I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow.  Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone.  It's not worth the risk.	
- 1	This product stuck for about 1-2 days and peeled off from itself, not from the surface I stuck it to (my refrigerator and the glass doors to our fireplace). The sticky surface broke away freely from the plastic piece it was attached to and was in no way due to strain or stress placed on it from use. DON'T BUY. THIS PRODUCT IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.	
1. 	I got one of these as a gift for my baby shower and thought... it's a toothbrush, what's there to say?  I ordered a couple more from Amazon since at least I knew what these were.  Well then we take little one into the dentist since she has 7 teeth and a few more coming in and they give use new toothbrushes.  That night I used the new toothbrush since her first one was all chewed up and she is screaming bloody murder.  I'm thinking that it has to be the new toothpaste... so back to the no fluoride toothpaste and still screaming.  Then I notice little drops of blood at her gum lines.  My poor baby was being hurt by the stiff bristles of the other toothbrush.  Well it's a no-brainer that I put those away for when she's older and opened up one of these and no more screaming kid.  Happy, smiling tooth brushing once again!  I know someday I need to go to a stiffer bristle, but for now these soft bristled brushes will be all I use.	
- 1	I loved this bath mat because of the shape, but have definitely not loved the size. I have a very small one year old (still wears 3-6 month clothing) and she barely stays on the mat while playing. It also isn't as slip-resistant as others, as she has fallen over when soaping her a few times. It does stick very well to the tub though.	
- 1	This pillow sounded like the best thing in the world. I got it out to try it and immediately found that I was too tall for this pillow, unless I slept in a curled position (I am 6ft tall). You have to use the dedicated head part for this which seemed like a rock and the material was not soft. For the money this should have been the best thing ever. I was so bummed, I really thought this was going to be great. So I went and found a 10 dollar body pillow and a 10 soft cover. I also get to use my own head pillows. Wish I could have gave this a better review!	
1. 	I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!	
- 1	Bought this to use with my boon flair from Craigslist but ended up not even using it. Within taking it off one time, already lost the tiny crotch piece, so now the rest of the harness has nothing to click into. If harness is on, must be worn or else the baby is sitting on it. Kind of dumb. Food and dirt collector.	
1. 	These bottles are the best. I read reviews on all the bottles and picked these as the bottles to use on my son after all the good reviews. And they work great. Only pain is they take more time to clean. So I tried Avent because of less parts to clean but they leaked and my son has a had time getting formula from the nipple. So I realized I need to just clean those extra parts and stick with Dr.Browns bottles.	
- 1	I used these cups once and quickly found that I had trouble knowing how far to push the straw back in once I had removed it for washing.  Also, there was a lot of leaking from the straw area because the &#34;stopping&#34; mechanism is too high in the straw (outside of the top), rather than inside.  This one missed the mark for us and was sent immediately to the donation bag.	
1. 	This was just what I was looking for! A small food processor to evenly puree my baby's meals. We leave ours right on the counter and whatever we have for meals we just toss a small amount in for a few seconds and it's to the consistency that she prefers.I also use it for making and freezing bulk baby food however I would recommend a bigger food processor for doing that. This does the job fine but its a process since not all the food fits in it at one time. Plus, if you over fill it the food doesn't puree all the way as some gets stuck at the top.	
- 1	I returned this. It didn't fit and it was really scratchy.	
- 1	This potty seat worked well for us, but only for about the first 3-4 months.  When we were at the beginning stages when we were placing him on the seat ourselves, it worked great.  He was very secure and comfortable.  It was also easy for him to put on and off on his own.Now that he wants to be more independent and go all by himself, he finds it difficult to climb onto because it sits so high up off the top of the toilet seat.  Some mentioned that it was easy to clean.  I agree...but only in regards to the smooth topside.  The bottom side is a different spongy 'texture' that I find more difficult to get clean (almost seems like it's permeable and absorbs pee stains).  The other downside that revealed itself after some time was the cracking of the inside of the seat that is shown by others in their customer photos.  I also felt like the suction cups lost their sticking ability after a short time (not a huge problem though, because it doesn't really move around a lot).I am back here on Amazon again looking for one that doesn't sit as high up off the toilet seat and is a solid surface that will be easier to clean.	
1. 	My daughter loves this carrier, and so do I. It is extremely easy to use. She loves facing outward to see everything and I love that she loves it!! I hardly use a stroller anywhere because she would rather be in the Bjorn. I would recommend getting the covers (sold separately for about $17) for when they start being carried in the front position. Highly recommended from a very picky mom!! FYI - she is 5 months old, and we have used it a ton since birth.	
- 1	Since my son finally started doing #2 on the potty and potty training is going really well, I decided it was time to ditch the pull-ups and move to cotton training pants with a cover.  After reading reviews on covers I decided to order these because of all the great reviews.  Since everyone said they ran big I ordered 2 packs of the large (26-31 pounds) for my 34 pound, 38 toddler.  We had our first accident (using these covers over the gerber training pants)today and urine rolled all down his legs within seconds.  He may as well have worn nothing over the training pants.  I had purchased BRU vinyl covers to use until these arrived and they did not leak at all when he had accidents.  The unopened pack of these is going back.	
- 1	I can understand the premise and I like the premise.However, I just don't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.While they are not hard, they are not soft.The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever doesn't make it into baby's mouth.  It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.	
1. 	Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.  If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.  No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.  The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine.	
- 1	If you enjoy causing yourself pain in order to feed your baby, this is the product for you!  If not, go with the Sassy model.  Opening and closing this is extremely difficult.	
1. 	I love this as a snap-n-go for my Graco35. We were going back and forth between buying this and buying the adaptor bar for our City Mini but opted for this since it's lighter and more convenient.  I actually don't love the car seat itself (Graco35) but this in combination as a stroller was perfect for the first 6 months.  It's lightweight, has ample storage and cupholders, steers well.  Not a lot bad to say about it, except that sometimes when it's folded the &#34;one-touch&#34; open button doesn't work because the wheels kind of lock together.  Then you have jiggle the wheels a bit then the button works.  It was easy to snap the car seat in to place.  All in all, this is a product I'm glad I bought and would use again if we used the same car seat for the next kid.	
- 1	I bought this product to use on my 14 month old's teeth. When I used it I felt like my hands had a weird film on them afterward. It didn't make me super confident about using them in my son's mouth. Other than that it's a great concept, wish it had been executed better.	
- 1	We bought this for a 10 day trip with our four month old daughter.  It did fold up and fit in my carry-on suitcase as advertised but it did not really work well for bathing her.  I tried it three times in three different sinks but it never seemed to fit properly.  It only ended up holding a small amount of water so she got cold and uncomfortable (but not very clean).  It was easier to just sponge bath her, in which case we did not need to buy this kind of expensive tub.	
1. 	My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks	
1. 	Everything was as expected. Great bottles for a reasonable price - better than what I have found in local stores. I have no complaints and would recommend to others.	
- 1	I have a baby with big plump cheeks, and unfortunately this pacifier leaves marks on her cheeks because the hard plastic curves a bit.	
1. 	Great high chair for travel!! We started using this when our daughter was old enough to sit up, it came in handy when travel because restaurants high chairs are huge for a 5 months old and filthy.  Our daughter is now 16 months, 22 lbs and we still use it. You just wipe off the tray with a diaper wipe and throw it back in the trunk until you need it again. It's nice to go anywhere and always have a seat.	
- 1	The pacifiers are great. My baby loves it. It was MY mistake to buy all translucent pacifiers. DON'T. Once you set them down, it is hard to find them, spot them and when you have your baby asleep... the hustle with no lights to find these translucent pacifiers is hell. My first mistake as a first mom: wanted &#34;cute&#34;pacifiers and forgot about practicality. AVOID translucent. I then bought the same with colors and my baby loves them. So i do highly recommend the brand and product, just not the translucent ones!	
- 1	My daughter hated having her teeth brushed.  I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon.  I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger.  The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all.  Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway.  It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket.  Also, do know you can't pick color.  We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice.	
- 1	My brother gave this to me when my son was born back in 2010. The good news? It's still going strong after three years and two babies. The bad news? By &#34;going strong,&#34; I mean randomly triggering itself with astonishing frequency. We had it packed in a box in the hall closet. The music would go off when the front door opened. We moved it to the attic, and would hear echoes of the music on windy nights. If it falls on the floor, it will chime when someone walks across the room.So, bottom line:- loud music may disturb child- music triggers at the slightest movement- suction cup does not stay affixed to surface- toy does not stay secure in suction cup base- your brother might be so amused by these stories that it will become his mission to find ever-louder, more annoying toys for his nephew (see also: Fisher Price Bubble Mower, B Whee-Mote RC Car)	
1. 	They do their job of cleaning out all the holes and crevasses of those darned Dr. Browns bottles.  These bottles really are great for keeping gas and reflux to a minimum, but boy are the a pain to clean.  You can't clean them without these things (and shouldn't, because if you don't get every crevasse, ick will build up on the tan colored plug thing especially - talk about nasty germies!) so buy a pack or two today!	
1. 	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.Love it!	
1. 	If your baby is like mine, i.e. takes any cloth/soft bib to their mouth and makes bibs pointless, this is a life saver. They would still try to raise it up and put in their mouth, but they won't be able to. So now the bib works as it's supposed to: catching all the drips.	
- 1	Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube	
1. 	I love this potty, we have one upstairs and one downstairs.  My son doesn't mind using it, it is incredibly easy to wash, get one!	
- 1	I am a huge fan of the bottles, so much so they are all I used. I hoped the negative reviews were isolated experiences regarding the sippy cup. I was sorely disappointed. This cup leaks everywhere. Used it once. In the discard box now. Can't even give it away because of the poor functionality of it.	
1. 	While other carriers may be comfortable, they are a headache to put on. This one you just slip on, but the baby in and close the velcro.  I have not found it to be good for long-term wear, but great for around the house and on short trips to the store. Also, it not good for a tiny baby. Maybe 15 lbs and up?	
- 1	I bought this peek-a-boo ball for my then 5-month-old because I thought it was cute and it would be fun for my daughter to manipulate and roll around. We had played with it less than 5 times when one of the circular wooden pieces just fell off along with the little head!Attached is a picture. I am so thankful that my 5-year-old noticed it and brought it to me. My baby would have definitely put this in her mouth and choked on it. :( I will definitely be contacting Wonderworld about this product. They really should take toy off of the market. Parents, please do not buy this toy.	
- 1	I bought this product based on the reviews I read about a year ago.  My daughter is now 11 months old and the entire room STINKS whenever we have to dispose of a soiled diaper!  I have to change the bag every time she has a BM. I finally gave up and and bought another Diaper Genie. I had one with my first two children and it may be more of a hassle to use but I do not recall it omitting as much odor as the Diaper Dekor Plus.  Save your money, don't buy this product!	
1. 	I bought this product for two reasons. 1. My daughter is going through a nightmare phase and has ended up in bed with me often lately. She is a thrasher at night and needed something to keep her safe so we could also get some sleep.  2. We plan on transitioning her to a full-sized bed in a few months and predict she will need this based on how much she moves at night so it will get a lot of use in the future.  The rail installed fairly easily. I would say it took my husband a bit longer based on our very heavy tempurpedic mattress and the set up of our bed-frame. It folds down fairly easily as well. My Mom has one at her house as well for when we sleep there and she is equally pleased with this product too.	
1. 	this is the best product.I bought it after redaing several reviews and am very happy that i got this tub for my little one. she loves it.	
1. 	I was pulling my hair out looking for baby proofing stuff that wouldn't require a hardware install. These are perfect for my 50 plasma. Just a note, because I didn't see it in any of the other reviews... You have to pull the clips open to insert the plastic strap. The instruction page that comes with them doesn't mention how you're supposed to join the clips and it took me a bit of puzzling and trying to thread the strap before I realized you need to snap them open. Maybe I am just slow today, but there it is if anyone is wondering! I will absolutely recommend and buy these again.	
1. 	These plugs are easy to use and they do what they shoukd - protect. They have perfect size so it is not easy to remove them so even I have to put some efforts. My daughter never interested in plugs so she never tried to remove them but I feel safe as even if she will one day, it will be very hard for her and absolutely sure not quick so I can notice that.	
- 1	As my son discovered the fun of bathtime recently, I quickly bought several small bath toys and this mesh bag for storage.  While he loves the toys, we're having some problems with the toy bag.  First of all, he mainly wants to take the toys out of the bag and put them back in.  But, the suction cups have a hard time staying attached to the wall or the side of the tub as he pulls on them, which gets him frustrated.  He also gets frustrated by the toys getting stuck in the mesh as he tries to pull them out.  Since bathtime comes right before bedtime, we're dealing with a tired, easily frustrated toddler, so this causes a few short-lived fits each night in the bath.  It's also not the easiet thing to get the toys from the bag into the bath at the beginning of his bath.  I have to fish around to grab each toy, several of which get stuck on the mesh sides.  It would be better if the bottom opened (like the trash bag I have in my car) and the entire contents could just be emptied into the tub.  While he loves to empty and fill this bag...I think I'm going to have to look for a less frustrating, easier-to-use product.	
1. 	I really like the opening and the top so you can see your baby without picking up any of the material. It's not the softest by far, but it's tolerable unless you and your baby have extremely sensitive skin. It's pretty airy, so it's perfect for the warm weather.	
1. 	love these! a wonderful staple once baby starts solid foods. we were able to bring a cup, bowl, and spoon to each grandparent to keep which is much easier then transporting it every time we visit. perfect price too! i highly recommend!!!!	
1. 	We use this with the KidCo G15 White Center Gateway with Walk Through Pressure Gate for the bottom of our steps. Our staircase looks just like the one they have advertised in the picture and it works perfectly for us. I was so happy to have found these two products!I would have given it 1 more star if it was not quite so expensive but highly reccomended to anyone in a similar situation.	
1. 	I own 3 of these and so glad I do.  They definitely do the job and then some.  I wouldn't put a car seat in my car without one of these.  Grey blends in well with our honda grey leather seats.	
- 1	Got these for our 1 year old to play with in the bath tub. They float face down in bath, are very small in size, and fill with bath water that's impossible to clean out.	
1. 	I use cloth diapers and was anxious to at least get the BM's into the toilet instead of having to wash them. I bought this for my son when he was 8mths old and we have been using it for BM's. I am fortunate to be able to stay home with my son so I am in close contact with him and can tell when he is trying to go #2. As soon as I see his BM face (starts pushing, and eyelids get red) I quickly take off his diaper and sit him on this potty. It works great. With him being so small you do need to sit directly in front him and entertain with a song or a toy as he does his business but it is worth it. I don't always catch the BM's but have to clean a lot fewer ones by using the toilet.This seat is comfortable and I like the back part because he can sit back without falling over. If he is not positioned quite right he might pee outside but for the most part if you are watching closely it contains everything just fine. :)	
1. 	Highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding.  It's clears the nipple confusion instantly.	
- 1	We bought this instead of the pull back shades, thinking it'd work well and be easy to install.  Was very hard to get flat and straight on the window and pealed up when you lowered the window (this wasn't a huge surprise and was discovered by accident).  Wouldn't buy again and would just get the pull down shade in the future.	
- 1	Not to be one of those people who complain about too much of a good thing, but here it goes... It's just too big! You need a great deal of wall space to be able to accommodate this net. It spans at least 5 feet and requires bigger holes in your wall then I was planning on. I never put the thing up, just took it out of the box and realized it won't work. I'd you have major wall space available, don't mind anchor screws in your wall, and need to house A LOT of toys, this might be for you.	
1. 	Mainly the block with a jingle bell is the one he likes right now but maybe as he gets a bit bigger he will be into looking through the colored ones or playing with the more tactile ones, decent price plus the baby likes them.	
1. 	This is a great pail. It doesn't hold a ton, but it doesn't smell bad and the top easily pops open when you push the foot pedal. Is not unattractive in the nursery either.	
- 1	He pulled this off in about 2 days...	
1. 	We have used a few different brands for childproofing cabinets and drawers - this is definitely my favorite.Why its good:- Kids can't get in even after they have figured out the mechanism (it takes a fair amount of finger strength to press)- The lock open feature is great for preventing smashed fingers.  With twins even the other brands that keep them out of the cabinets do nothing to prevent accidental finger smashes.- Easy to install, better than other brands on alignment- very sturdy over timeWhats not so great:- people who visit the house always complain about how hard it is to get into anything.  I don't think it is so bad but I use them on a daily basis.- the larger tab size cuts into your usable drawer volume as it needs additional clearance to disengage the latch.  Drawer inserts, full drawers may cause additional difficulty opening.Despite the flaws, this is the best set of childproofing locks I have used out of several types and brands.	
- 1	While being put forward as more environmentally friendly, we found these wipes to be not up to par.  they always seem to leave the baby sticky and not really clean feeling.  Will not be buying these again.	
1. 	my 9 month old son love these cups, the quality is very good and the colors are beautiful, he plays with these everyday.	
1. 	I bought these after reading the reviews.  They are MUCH better than the Gerber ones.  They dont leak out the goodies so easily or the crumbs.  Def a must have for little snackers	
- 1	Short of duct tape and super glue, I tried everything to get these to stick to the windows and they will. not. stick. Complete waste of money and time. Not to mention dangerous should these hit a newborn in the face or head. Avoid this product at all cost.	
1. 	What a great purchase.  I buy tons of things for my 7 month old son and he loves this.  We now call him DDS since he will brush his two teeth all the time.  Great for little hands to hold and he can get it in his mouth easily.  He loves to chew on it and I got it when he was 6 months old.Highly recommend!	
- 1	Very disappointed with the quality of design. For example, attempting to adjust the level (angle) of the seat base is absurdly challenging. You have to push downward on the button to the point that you fear breaking it. Horrible engineering. And when locked at any given seat level (angle), the seat base is very sloppy rather than tightly locked, resulting in the baby rocking forward and backward because of the slop (looseness) in the seat level (angle) adjustment mechanism. To make a long story short, the mounting engagement of the seat to the base is a cheap design.Update: The main (front) bow for the canopy is constantly pulling out of the pivot assemblies (left and right sides) because it doesn't lock in solidly. Reconnecting it again and again is a time consuming annoyance.The straps are a pain in the neck. If I had 4 hands, two extra to hold the straps apart while I place the child into the seat, I could manage.Removing the child from the seat is extremely difficult, owing to the deep V shape. Essentially, the baby's sitting in a hole. The baby's not crazy about the severe angle either.This seat is a mix of good and bad, but the issues above are unacceptable. I see immature engineering that should have been refined more before mass production.	
- 1	UPDATE:  In my original review I loved these cups.  They didn't leak at that point.  However, after a few more weeks of use I notice that they were starting to leak a little bit here and there.  Fine, I can deal with a little tiny leak every now and then.  However, the more we used the cups the more they leaked.  They leak sitting up right as the liquid creeps to the top of the straw then spills out.  They leak upside down, the leak on their side, etc.  It seems that they don't leak for the first 2ish weeks of use then after that the start to progressively leak more and more.  The more they are used the more they leak.  Worthless!  My search to find a good straw sippy continues.We've tried lots of straw cups and these are our favorites.  They never leak for us and we've never had the spouting milk problem like others mention.  I've actually tried to get the cup to leak and it just doesn't.  Love that!  They straw is easy for my son to use - unlike the nuby straw cups that you have to have at a certain angle to drink from.  My only complaint is that the straw isn't long enough to get all of the liquid out of the cup.  Not a huge deal since my son hardly ever gets all the liquid out of any sippy - straw or not.	
1. 	We love this baby shampoo because it washes out easily.  Nothing is worse than a baby shampoo that requires lots and lots of water to rinse out so that the baby loses patience and starts crying in the tub.  This shampoo cleans well but washes with a few rinses of clean water.  In fact, we like this soap so much we use it as an overall body wash as well.  The smell is also pleasant and not too strong.	
- 1	I really loved this product, but unfortunately the quality isn't very good.  The first time we bought this, the projector stopped working within a few months.  We would push the button to turn the projector on and the whole thing would shut off.  We contacted Amazon about the issue and they sent us a replacement.  We received the replacement and within a month and a half, the projector stopped rotating.  Had I reviewed this product initially, I would have given it 5 stars, however, after going through two that have broken down within a couple months of use, I have to rate this one at a 2.	
1. 	This little bathtub is GREAT.  It has a nice texture to keep slippery baby in place while you're bathing her, and it's VERY soft.  One thing that added a little extra is it comes with its own (detachable) clothes hanger, making it easy to hang dry.This also makes a great back rest for momma's bath time!	
- 1	So originally I really liked these diapers, so much so that I ordered 6 more after 6 weeks of use. Now I've been using them for about 16 weeks and they leak without fail around the legs.  It's almost like the insert isn't made wide enough to absorb in the correct areas. I have other diapers (bumgenius and fuzzi bunz) that I have had for the same amount of time and have yet to have any issue with. Don't waste your time, go with the major brands!	
1. 	Love it, I have no idea how anyone could get through a pregnancy without it! Highly recommend and great price.	
- 1	Despite the smart design of these bottles (nipple is sized and shaped similar to a breast, bottle is comfortable to hold, bottle is compatible with pumps), I would not purchase.  Invariably, there is a fast leak at the lids and a frustrating mess.  They are worthless for feeding and storage.	
1. 	This is a great Bouncer. My daughter loved the vibrations and watching the fish swim by. When she was older she loved to bat at the objects hanging down. When all else failed i would put her in the bouncer and she would fall asleep. The music was calm and relaxing and she could spend hours in there.	
- 1	I guess it's more my fault for not reading the dimensions before buying, but this was much smaller than it looks in the pictures.	
1. 	My baby girl loves this bunny. It has all sorts of knots she can chew on and it's soft and cuddly.	
1. 	Fits on most seats with minor adjustment. Once set it is one hand operation especially for the times when you are running with the kid in one hand. My daughter likes to do it herself and it is very easy for her to do so. It not heavy in case the finger gets in between the seat.	
1. 	These are the BEST nipples I have ever used!  I call them dial a nipple!  You line the number, you want to use, up with the babies nose and it's smooth sailing!  They are variable, numbered 1,2,&3.  1 is for slow flow, 2 is a faster flow and 3 is for cereals or thicker liquids. These are great!	
- 1	The idea of the bottles is good. They do help to reduce air. However, to me, it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples. It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem. EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked), but for some reason they ALL had different flows! Some would choke and gag him, some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out, some were okay... you get the point. It was always a guessing game with these bottles. We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work. And when you have a hungry, fussy baby, its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that. On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to. Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed! It was horrible. He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed. I felt that these bottles were very poor quality. Like I said, the idea of the VentAire is good, but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations.	
1. 	I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!	
1. 	My son loves this teether. He loves moving things and this is great for that since it twists and turns. My husband and I actually play with it too sometimes! Great teether and also great toy, it keeps my son entertained for a long time. (He is 6 months old)	
- 1	I found I liked other product designs better and we really didn't like the aquaduck color selections. Just not my favorite product.	
1. 	I love this so your kid can actually fall asleep if they have to!  Takes a little getting use to with one hand but after 3x you get it.	
- 1	There is really no reason why you should have to replace these bags, other than they make them that way. They could easily make bags that dont need to be replaced, but there goes a lot of money soo....do not buy.	
- 1	My 1 year old has been using this cup for a few months now and I'm not terribly impressed.  The fact that it has a straw makes it easier for him to drink out of, but the cup has not withstood the test of time.  The picture is peeling and a piece of the top has broken off. I will admit that my toddler has dropped it a few times and this has probably contributed to it's early failure.  Honestly, I don't know too many toddlers who don't drop things. Overall a good idea, but needs to be a bit sturdier if it's to be used for this particular age group.	
- 1	...but I expected better quality and easier handling. Frankly, I had high hopes but was disappointed by the flimsy quality. It was easz enough to install and it fit our wide area, but it is difficult to close. We need to re-adjust the top screw every other day because for whatever reason the gate will not close easily. The fact that this seems to be an issue is reflected in a little piece of paper that comes with the gate. It states that when you have difficulty closing the top latch, the upper screws are too tight. Not a problem you may think, but it becomes a problem when you have to loosen them to the point where the whole thing becomes rather wobbly and loose.	
1. 	My daughter loves her sleep sacks.  She was swaddled for almost six months and then we transitioned to the sleep sack.  It took a few nights, but she finally got it - and now she loves it.  In addition, we live in a colder climate and do not heat the house above 62 degrees at night, so combined with a little heater, this sleep sack does the trick.I have tried Aiden and Anais as well as Grobag.  I find neither to compare to the functionality, the longevity and the simplicity of the HALO.  We have this sleep sack in fleece as well as cotton, depending on the temperature.  We have not even gotten the early walker yet and this works just fine.  Ultimately, when we put her in the sleep sack, it's time for bed and there will be no more walking anyway, so this works just fine for us!Highly recommend.	
- 1	I don't like these. I bought 2 for our 18&#34;x36&#34; cradle and while they fit our mattress (just barely) the elastic doesn't go all the way around so it kind of pulls up on the sides. Also, theyre extremely thin so i'm not sure how well they would hold up with extended use. I ended up keeping these as back ups but i went to BRU and bought their brand cradle sheets which are SO much better.	
- 1	We bought this item to use in our nursery. The sleep sheep arrived in what appeared to be great condition and was really cute.  Unfortunately, the screws used by the manufacturing company are so cheap, we stripped them by lightly applying pressure with the screw driver.  We were able to get one out, but not the other.  I can't comment on how the item works since we weren't able to gain access to the battery compartment.	
1. 	When the doc told us to put cereal in his bottle, we couldn't have lived without the level 3's.  They are the only one with a hole big enough to get the thicker liquid through.	
- 1	Ive owned several hand pumps and this was my second electric pump. I had the old Lansinoh pump which was the same as Ameda Purely yours. So when I accidently dropped it and broke it I read all the reviews and decided to buy a Lansinoh pump again. I figured if they changed it, it must be improved ...... wrong. I like that its a closed system, that was a requirement for me, a top priority. It also did work for awhile so that got it a second star. But it is LOUD. REALLY LOUD. Like you cant have a conversation its so loud. Im pumping right now with my new Ameda and I can barely hear it. This Lansinoh Affinity worked for me, pumping exclusively for my daughter, for about 9 months. I started thinking I was having supply issues because I was having really bad days where I just couldnt pump what I normally do. Finally it occured to me that it may be the pump. I called Lansinoh and they suggested ordering new valves. I did that and nothing changed. Because I didnt save the receipt (the time we bought this was crazy, she had RSV, etc) there was no option but to trash it. I understand not replacing it without a receipt but it would be exceptional customer service to do so. So I had to buy another one and I went back to the Ameda. I love it so much more. you can get it for the same price here on Amazon so there's no reason to buy the Affinity, in my opinion.	
1. 	I bought this inexpensive chair for use at my parents' house and I wish this is the one I would have gotten for myself instead of the more expensive one I have. This chair is a great space saver, it's an awesome little high chair. LOVE it.	
- 1	Pros:perfect size for any size diapers and wipesHas a little side pocket for smaller itemsHardware seems pretty sturdyCons:Fabric quality seems poorOverall structure seems poorly designed- shape is sort of irregular.Overpriced for what it is.	
1. 	I love this and got tons of use out of it.  I am just sorry that my daughter outgrew it so quickly.  I used it to keep her in bed with me when she was first born and I was nursing. I also travelled with it and she slept in it in hotels, or at my friends homes.  It was so much easier than hauling the pack n play.  Once my baby was able to roll around I didn't feel comfortable using it.	
- 1	Our Summer Infant Best View (no longer in production) finally stopped working.  We had a tough time finding a replacement product that had all of the same features we loved: good range, quality picture in both light and dark, remote pan, portable handheld monitor, and good parent reviews were a few of our top priorities.  The description of the Graco True Focus, along with the price and reviews seemed to fit the bill with the one exception of remote pan, which we could live without to save the extra $70 it would cost to get that feature on another model.Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and we ended up returning it.  The biggest drawbacks for us were the night vision picture, and the limited range, which came in nowhere close to the claims on the box and the website.  After having other video monitors work well in our house - both our Summer monitor as well as visiting friends' other brands, we were very disappointed at the constant Linking error that would come up regularly when we were a mere 50 feet away (again, nowhere close to the 1000 ft claim on the box).Pros:- Price for the features claimed- Daytime picture clearer than other video monitors I've seenCons:- Effective range of less than 50 ft. compared with well over 200-300 feet with other monitors (we were able to walk a few houses away with the old monitor, and still have a reliable signal)- Night vision picture required constant fiddling with brightness settings - sometimes appeared to just be a big white screen, with little definition of what was on camera.  I could have lived with this if the range had lived up to claims.Luckily Amazon took the return after we tried it out for a little over a week - desperately hoping that it would somehow begin to link more consistently.  We definitely wanted it to live up to expectations, but unfortunately it did not.	
1. 	My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!	
- 1	I started my daughter out on the Nuby Super Straw Easy Grippers and I think she was so accustomed to those, that this was too difficult for her to use.  Maybe if I started her out on this, she wouldn't have had such an issue.	
1. 	This is a nice, cozy fleece sleep sack for the winter months.  My son sleeps well in these esp. since we can't use blankets in the cribs these days.  I love the puppy dog print on this one:).  Very cute!	
1. 	Great teether and toy. Mulitple materials, teething surfaces with different designs to chew on, twists in multiple ways. Like it a lot! Good for little hands to grip. He doesn't manipulate the twists yet, we do it for him, but its still a hit (5 mos).	
1. 	These leg extensions lifted the bassinet to the perfect height for my wife to easily roll over and either grab or console our baby. The bassinet does not feel less stable with them on.	
1. 	It's a life saver for public washrooms that aren't smart enough to have seat covers available.  It's thicker and more comfortable that the flimsy ones anyway.  Sesame Street design made it an immediate hit with our daughter who got a little freaked out by our earlier attempts at lining seats with toilet paper.  Definitely worth having on hand.	
- 1	The primary reason I got this monitor is because of the advertised coverage.Primary cons:-It did not deliver AT ALL on coverage (I ended up ordering the Motorola and am pleased with it)-Graco plastic also feels a lot cheaper/light than the Motorola-Thought I could just prop the camera on the bookshelf but was hard to get a good angle so fact it doesn't mount ended up being a problem	
1. 	My son drools A LOT. He was getting really bad rashes under his jaw and on his chest from all the wetness. These bibs have solved the problem plus the colors are great without stupid commentary on them and they aren't bulky. Just remember to fasten the velcro before throwing them in the wash.	
- 1	Our baby was too small for the Ergo carrier we purchased so we got this. It was $30, but is basically just a fancy pillow to sit on. The wrap-around part provided no head support. The instructions said it should be used up to four months, but we were able to put our average-sized baby in the Ergo without it at around 10 weeks. It was a total waste of money.	
1. 	These still work, but the bags used to be thicker and really keep the stink in. These are still better than not using anything, but I wish they had more scent to them and were thicker. But still the best I've tried.	
- 1	Mine never worked and even after getting a second one it didn't work either. There is so many neat ways to take a temperature now that I wouldn't waste any more money on this.	
1. 	This worked as a nice jumpy toy for a home with odd sized door frames. May want to choose an option with more padding if you have a child with very strong legs and greater chance of hitting door frames, but we thought this was perfect for use in a small home with most kids.	
- 1	They weren't functional. They didn't bend they did fit a larger cord (power strip) and you'd have to secure it to the wall. But the part of the cord coming out of the wall is still exposed. They just didn't work for us at all as a baby proof hire hider.	
1. 	My daughter has loved this toy since the day she got it.  She got it for Christmas when she was almost 11 months old.  She was already walking, but not steadily.  This toy gave her confidence and she loves the silly face and fun music.  She also loves when we convert it to a ride on toy and push her around.  Now that she is 1 she loves to put things in the basket and truck around the house.  she also loves to push the nose and just dance to the music.  The motion sensor on this toy is real sensitive so it doesn't have to be banged to play.  My daughter just has to walk up to it and it will play.  Also, it isn't so loud that is can be mind numbing and the beat is kinda catchy.  My neice who is almost two recieved this on her first birthday and used it for a walker until recently.  She still uses it to push around, but now she really loves to sit on it and scott around.  This is really a useful toy and really fun.  My daughter doesn't really care about the balls that come with it she uses the basket more to push around other toys and her stuffed animal.  She also loves the ram into things with it and since it is lightweight it doesn't hurt anything.  Another good point is that it has all rounded edges so when she biffs she doesn't seem to get hurt.  she just gets up, rights the walker, and keeps on movin'.  This toy is sturdy and easy for my daughter to move around.  I find that it doesn't get away from her like other walking toys did.  I think the width of the toy and the wide wheels help to keep the toy moving at a good pace.  If you want your child to use a walker to help him/her get used to her feet and have fun doing it, this is the toy, plus it is convertible and will last beyond a year.  It is very affordable and worth every penny.	
1. 	I have nothing negative to say about this sheet.  The color is true to the photo, it holds its color and shape well after washing and drying (a problem I've had with other jersey sheets), it's super soft and I hope to buy a few more!  It fits well on both our standard crib and our pack-and-play.	
- 1	I really like the material of these bibs.  It makes them so easy to wipe clean.  However, these do not work for us because of the pocket.  The pocket sticks out so much that it won't fit between my daughter and her high chair.  She is one now so maybe when she gets taller  the pocket will be above the tray enough so she can wear it.  But for now they are useless for us.	
- 1	We have a ton of Skip Hop stuff for our lo that we love and have had no problem with. This pull toy gets stuck after 2 pulls. It seems we have to spin in backwards like 20 times in order for it to be pulled forward just across the apt once. We cannot figure out the problem, twisted rope attached to the wings? The wheels are stuck? Who knows but it's a shame as it is one of the cutest pull toys out there for a reasonable price and out lo LOVED it until it busted shortly after, 1 week of use. Do not buy it until Skip Hop fixes the toy.	
1. 	This bib is AMAZING.When my baby started solids, a bunch of our regular cloth bibs were stained with carrots and peas, and broccoli, and mango. You get it.At first I didn't want to spend 12 bucks on one single bib... When you could buy a package of 10 cloth bibs for 5 dollars. But after ruining half of our bibs, I placed my order and God was I happy!It's wonderful, you can just wipe it or rinse it and you're done!The bottom pocket is awesome. It catches food and you can even use it as a bowl lol.We've been using this bib daily for over a year and I love it. We have the green one and color is still the same as when we first got it.My baby is now 17 months and still fits him great.	
1. 	This is a nice big bath mat - nearly covers entire base of our tub.  Suction cups work pretty well and it is easy to clean.  I use this in the bathtub used by my 1 year old daughter as it provides a little cushion and non slip.  Non slip surface changes depending on type of bath soap used, so use a little caution when changing it.	
1. 	I, like MANY other people, couldn't decide between the Diaper Champ, or the more popular Diaper Genie. Well, I was sold on not having to buy special bags, so the Diaper Champ it was! I'm soooo glad I went with it! I haven't had ANY odor problem, and if the handle gets stuck, that's an indication that it's full...so just change the bag!Don't be swayed by the negative reviews here. This is an excellent product. I've had mine for almost a year now...it sits right in between my sons crib and changing table. I change the bag about once every 5-6 days, and it couldn't be easier. I definitely recommend!	
1. 	I love this thing. It fit our large power strip easily. Also very easy to use. I would highly recommend.	
1. 	It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse. Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is. I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years. When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three. Just keep the smaller stature in mind.	
1. 	I have the original pump in style and this is not the same icepack that it originally came with. It still fits in the cooler, but not as well as the original one, but you can still close the bag and everything. Otherwise keeps milk cold and works as expected.	
1. 	My two year old loves this. We got them in the fish color, the pink paisley color, and the cream with flowers. She loves the first two the most. It is easy for her to put on, and she tucks it down while sitting in her chair so that the pocket stays under the tray.The pocket is deep enough for storage of necessities but mostly goes ignored by her. The bib is made of some sort of waterproof fabric, which is extremely easy to clean off - just wipe it down, no matter how dirty it gets. It's long enough to sit in her lap.There is a velcro adherent on the back which we have to help her with, but it is long enough for thick necks, or even thin ones. There are two armsleeves which are basically T-shirt style, coming down a small amount but we pull up her shirtsleeves so that she does not get them dirty. It can hang on the chair until ready, and is a cinch to put on her.It also has adjustable sleeves with elastic cuffs which are great to keep food out for those especially messy meals. The colors are vibrant and fun, and our two year old just loves it.	
- 1	Pros:InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons:Didn't last.  Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now.UPDATE:If I could, I'd probably raise this to 3, maybe even 4, stars.Why? As I state in the title, it's cute and does the job.  It's also inexpensive.  When ours died, I looked around for something different.  Something that fit the spout well (like this one does), that stays clean inside (like this one), that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does)... I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit.  In the end, I bought another one of these.  At the price, I can buy another if this one pops too.  In the meantime, it has everything I am looking for.	
1. 	These are the BEST waterproof, easy-to-clean, bibs ever. We've had them for several months and use them daily with no issues at all. They wash very well in the laundry, too. My son loves to check out all of the patterns when I put these on him - it's really cute to see his reactions. :-)  We won't feed him solids in any other bib (we use soft ones for when he drinks milk). Love this brand and highly recommend!	
- 1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.	
- 1	Nice that it is not a solid mass so you can bend it and fit into a lunch bag easily.  However, I purchased two a couple months ago and one is already ruined due to two of the compartments leaking out all the fluid.	
- 1	I have a couple of sets and the lids aren't interchangeable. They are hard to get on tight. I just don't trust them. Gladware seems to be better and a lot cheaper.	
1. 	We were in that in between stage for the bath. My son was way to big for the baby tub. But at nine months to small for the real thing.  I did not need a tub that had slots for the shampoo because then my Son spends all of his time trying to play with the shampoo. This works great. Soft, blows up easily, roomy but not too roomy. This is a good product.	
- 1	I cannot believe all the great reviews.  I never even got to use these sheets because they shrank to 50% of the original size when I washed/dryed them for the first time (and our dryer doesn't even get hot).  I was a stupid first time mom who registered for 4 sets and washed all of them together.  Had to purchase another sheet set (2) which we've used for 2 1/2 years.  This is at the very top of my stupid baby purchases.	
- 1	First of all, the weight limit on this swings reads up to 25 lbs. My son is 16 lbs. (which is a full 9 lbs. under the weight limit), and the swing didn't move even on the highest setting. The motor was obnoxiously loud, and it made constantly loud clicking noises. There is no way this swing could sooth a baby, let alone rock a baby to sleep. My son was only in it 3 minutes, and he wanted out. We tried the swing without our son in it, and it worked; however, we then tried it with an 8 lb. weight, and it stopped moving. My husband and I bought this swing intending to use it for a month (or longer if at all possible) for our 6-month-old and then use it for the new baby we just found out we're having. Instead, it's going right back in the box and being returned. If eating expensive batteries was the only downfall of this product, then I might have given it an extra star. By the way, once you get the swing together, it's a royal pain to get undone and back in the box. Looks like I'm headed to a baby store to look for a better product/ one that actually works.	
- 1	I was a little irritated to find out, that you MUST attach the 2 safety straps, one on each side, before using the stroller each time, and unstrap them both BEFORE folding, there goes that one hand fold strap in the seat everyone loves. A little disturbing also that it is marketed as such. I urge everyone to read the brochure! It is in there TWICE, I just dont want any baby getting hurt because people want to believe it is truly one hand fold or dont want to bother w/ the straps, as they really are a pain esp. when you are just wanting to fold it and throw it int he trunk.When it comes to baby products, I would never want to take chances. I did want to buy this, but, once I read the full brochure online and talked to other owners who had become aware of the straps on each side also, I decided not to. I tried the straps in the store, and bending down and unstrapping them on each side, was a pain! No thanks.	
1. 	The breast pads are soft and they absorb well.  I still leak through the pads when my breasts are VERY engorged (but I think that would occur with any similar product).	
1. 	I prefer Avent breast pads to Gerber and Lansinoh as they are more absorbent, stay in place with adhesive and are really comfortable to wear. I found that Gerber pads leaked straight through and Lansinoh pads were too thin and I hated that wet and burning sensation when wearing them [I leaked a lot and the pads got soaked in minutes and were rubbing my nipples badly :(] Avent pads are realy cushy and soft, and they conform to the natural shape of the breast. They are also perfectly sized: had they been a little bigger, they would hardly fit in the bra. I think they are inexpensive enough for you to try (there're trial 2-packs and packs of 40 pads for less than $5 at Target and Babies'R'Us/Toys'R'us stores). I really like Avent pads better than any other disposable pads I tried. :)	
- 1	My #1 complaint about this sling is not uncomfortable it is on my shoulder. It's the opposite of comfortable. I've used it in many different holds (newborn, on the side/hip) none of them were comfortable. Also the padding around the sides is completely useless and makes it more difficult to tighten through the rings. Don't waste your money!	
- 1	It is extremely hard to open the pouch. I suppose this is great when your baby is holding it, but they are nearly impossible to use especially if they are a little dirty from having food in them.	
- 1	This just kept tipping over and/or falling off, so we returned it. The fastener just isn't very strong. When you would fold up the stroller, this would get tweaked. Not a good product.	
- 1	Interior foam compressed significantly to one side after two months of a newborn sleeping on it causing the baby to move to that side.  Once material compressed it was worthless and we replaced with a natural latex mattress.	
1. 	I originally bought theMedela Advanced Pump In Styleafter two months of renting the Medela Lactina while establishing my milk supply with my 32 week premie girl.  After lugging it back and forth to work and finding the breastshields as absolutely uncomfortable and extremely painful since I was pumping 5x a day, I set out to find something that worked differently and this Playtex seemed reasonable.It is amazing - the technology was just perfectly how I envisioned pumps should be made.  Rather than just straight suction of the nipple into a tube, a pocket of air is suctioned around the nipple, like baby's mouth would naturally do, making this virtually pain free.  At first I found that I was not getting enough suction on the highest setting but my husband pointed out that there is a Y connector so the suction power is split in half when double pumping, so I tried single pumping and the suction was very strong and worked better than the Medela.  I don't mind doing each side separately if it means less discomfort and pain.  Also, this is $100 cheaper, lighter and even came with the vehicle lighter adapter.  What more could you ask for?!  I wish I had done research prior to buying the Medela but it was really pushed by the hospital as being the best but it is far from it.  I plan on recommending this to any new mother who plans on pumping regularly because it is that much of a lifesaver.  It is a hard decision since you cannot just try out pumps since they are not returnable but I can honestly say if it is a choice between the Medela and this, you MUST choose this as it wins for its value, milk expression ability, and comfort because those are the most important factors.	
- 1	We loved our Diaper champ deluxe until it was about 9 months old.  Then we noticed an undescribable smell in the nursery.  Low and behold it was the diaper champ :(  So after cleaning and soaking in everything from vinegar to baking soda to bleach, nothing defeated the grossness.  We followed every instruction and nothing.  Come to find out, it was the plastic seal in the lid of the diaper champ that was causing the odor.  You can't clean these???? (I tried) Which makes no sense to me.  Anyway, we contacted babytrend, the makers of Diaper Champ to get a replacement seal.  They are on back-order??? So they took my information and were going to ship it out for almost $10.00 plus S&H when it came in. Over a month later, and no seal.  I don't understand how a company who makes an item can claim they are on back-order for over a month. According to the representative at baby trend, they don't have to supply replacement parts, it is an extra service they provide for their customers. She then proceeded to agree with me when I said I guess I should just trash the useless diaper champ and look for something else since they could not give me any idea as to when the replacement seal would be available.  Seriously! So needless to say, we are on the hunt for a new diaper pail.  Sorry, but no need to waste money on a pail that does't even last a year.  A trash can with a lid in the nursery would have served us just as well.	
1. 	These wipes are great for moms who have returned to work and are pumping!  It saves some of the embarrassment of lugging all your equipment to the break room to wash and rinse.  After a pumping session in my office, I use a wipe to clean up and then take the pump parts home at night to do a full wash down.  They are alcohol-free as well, so no worries of contaminating the milk and they are completely scent-free.  A must have!	
1. 	We have 2 of these.  They are a must.  Great color and I very much dislike the primary colored gates.  We needed to keep our young crawler and now toddler away from a gas fireplace in the winter and a console with electronics on it.  They come apart and are adjustable which is great.	
- 1	I am so surprised by all the good reviews for this swing!I think it's terrible. First off, it's HUGE and there is no easy way to move it around. So you won't be moving it into a quieter room or taking it to Grandma's. Second, the mobile is too bland for the baby to see and enjoy, there's a reason why most baby toys are neon plastic, because neutral colors do not excite the baby. No baby will be entertained by the three brown birdies on the mobile, the mirror helps, but bright contrasting colors really keep baby happy. Third, it's hard to get the baby in there! The giant mobile and controls sit right above the  cradle and you have to maneuver the sleeping baby into the cradle and it often wakes them up. You can get a compact portable swing that will do the same thing and your baby will like it just the same.	
1. 	Better safe than sorry. Easy to install. Totally toddler proof.	
- 1	really want to like it since we desperately need a good bottle warmer, but this one unfortunately is not good.the switch is on the back!! terrible design if u ask me.power is turned back on if u forget to turn off the switch. and the problem is that you cannot tell since power does turn off for a while, and u can easily forget to turn off the switch. quite a few times the switch was left on and water was boiled dry. we were very lucky that nothing happened but it could happen!!my mom, my husbband and i hate this product; and we'd rather just put bottles in a bowl of hot water.Very disappointed with this product, and also it is priced too high. there is no advanced technology with this product at all.	
- 1	I thought that this would be a great solution to the baby teething, especially being able to reach the back. The quality is very good. The colours are beautiful and the rubber is so gentle on the gums. But I found that the baby really liked to put the wrong side in her mouth causing her to gag! Yes, supervision is required with any of these things the baby puts in the mouth. But for this price, I don't think it's worth it. I have 2 kids and both of them love chewing on their toothbrush! I found that to be the best solution. (Supervision also required to prevent gagging).	
1. 	I bought this item a little late. My daughter was born at 21 inches. She was about 1/ 1/2 months old once I receive this item. I bought it so I could have her sleep with me w/o the fear of her face in the bed, pillows falling on her, or my husband and I rolling on her. It is a little short like most have said. My daughter is 23 inches long now and is to the point she can hardly fit. If you don't have a king size bed or there is 2 adults in the bed don't waist your money. I have a queen size bed and with this in the middle and 2 adults on each side, we must sleep on ours sides for us all to fit. My husband worked nights and on the nights he worked I used this item. It is also great for putting on the couch in the living room for afternoon naps. The light is very dim and only lights the top of her head. I have also noticed for the last few nights my daughter has managed to wiggle herself down and her legs are either hanging out the side where the mesh is or over the footstop.	
- 1	I hate this monitor. It is 20 feet from my child's room yet it constantly beeps that it is out of range. The beep is so loud and annoying and it's allllll night long. I've tried plugging both parts into to other outlets but have had no luck. There must be something in our house or neighborhood that causes interference.	
- 1	I bought this hamper for my son's nursery but was very disappointed when it arrived. It was incredibly flimsy. If I threw any laundry in it would loose its form and the lid would cave in. I also thought it was pretty pricey for what I got. It ended up getting returned.	
- 1	We bought this hamper for our son's jungle themed nursery. At first I was happy with the product it was cute and I thought it was durable. Not 6 months of use later the hamper is falling apart. Not as durable as I thought. It's ripping and the sticks you use to keep it up, keep popping out. Now I have to go out and buy a new hamper. Honestly I would like my money back b/c this item was a joke. We only used it to put dirty clothes in it and then we would empty the basket when it was full so I could do laundry. Not work the money. Listen to other reviews, I wish I had.	
- 1	I'm a bit new to the whole cloth diapering thing, but I just had twins so I'm able to really evaluate the test of these in a short period of time.  The designs are ridiculously cute, I really love them.  The diapers themselves are also very soft.  I in particular love the cheetah print one, it's so so cute!  However, the sizing on this is a bit off, even with the rise.  One of my twins is in the 25% range in terms of height and weight, but none of them fit him at all.  He's a bit on the thin side (still normal range) so I can forgive that.  However, my daughter is 70% on weight, and 60% on height, and it still doesn't quite fit her that well.  I end up using these diapers on her, and prefolds with a wrapper on the boy, but I've already had several blow outs from these diapers when she uses them.  I haven't had leaks, but I also don't use these at night, only during the day.  I have noticed around the legs in particular, it seems to be wide, even though my girl has pretty chunky legs, it still can blow out of there.  I prefer the thirsties wraps in comparison, with the prefolds and snappis, because of the double gussets on the legs that prevent blow outs.  With these, even with chunky thighs, the stitching and elastic is not really tight enough to prevent blow outs, even on the tightest settings for the rise.It is an inexpensive first investment into cloth diapering, and I still use them, mostly because they are the only pockets I have, and I already bought the inserts (these do not come with inserts, so I bought the bamboo inserts also by alva baby, which work fine), but I'm a little turned off by the fact that 1) they dont' fit that well 2) I cannot reuse them (unlike the thirsties wrappers) 3) they dont' come with inserts.  I wish they were a bit better made and came with different patterns besides this and I would be a firm supporter.EDITED: just so you know, when I initially wrote this review, the twins were about 3 months, so not quite newborns, and they were still too big.  Now the twins are 9 1/2 months, and after not using them for a while (I had bought fuzzibunz and bumgenius from cotton babies in the meantime since these didn't really seem to fit), I am using these again.  I have found though, that they don't seem to be quite as absorbent for some reason, even with the same liner.  Perhaps the PUL doesn't work as well with these?  The bumgenius and fuzzibunz generally last me about 2 1/2 to 3 hours with the twins (assuming they don't poop), but these will last me probably about 1 1/2 to 2 hours only, which is a lot of diaper changing then.  They still are super cute, so usually what I do is reserve these for the diaper change right before their nap and then I always change their diaper after their nap anyhow, so then they are only in this diaper for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, which works out fine.	
- 1	this stroller is cheap, flimsy, and the fabric on the seat started to rip within a couple weeks of use. The whole canopy bent and the wheels started to squeak within 2 months of use. I paid $51.00 for this stroller on clearance at a store and i paid too much! The only positive thing about this stroller is that it folds up very small	
- 1	I bought this after the birth of my daughter because I was afraid to cut her while cutting her nails and it was difficult to get her to sit still.  I will say that this item definitely does not hurt the baby's fingers at all.  I did test it myself and then I did use it on my brand new newborn daughter so it is safe.  But, it doesn't seem to do ANYTHING to trim down the nails.  I would file and file and they wouldn't change at all.  For the money it costs, it's just not worth it!  I returned it and went back to the baby nail clippers.	
1. 	I was very apprehensive about getting a hook on high chair but there's NO WAY this one is coming off! Easy to install and is VERY SECURE! Perfect for traveling or leaving at Grandma's house! AWESOME CHAIR!!!	
1. 	This cover was alright, the hole does seem a bit large and it wasn't quite long enough for our biggest power strip, but I have yet to find a cover that is, so I can't dock any stars for that	
1. 	We use this when we are visiting family, friends, and going out to eat.  Always nice to know you have a clean place so sit your child in for meals or activities.  The booster feature is great too for dining at the table with grown ups.  We also really like that the tray has a cover so you can stick a spoon, flat plate, etc. over the tray and not worry about getting yourself, car, or others messy when you are done.	
1. 	Like most people, I read the reviews before purchasing this and decided to just give it a go. We used it this past weekend for 4 nights at the ocean for our 2 year old, and she loved it (as did we!). The biggest complaint that I read about was a strap that went across the cot on the bottom in the middle, however, I can tell you that there is no strap. The bed hangs there with nothing to interfere it, like a hammock. No straps or bars across the middle of it.My daughter went to sleep on this without even giving us any grief (you should see bed times at home!). So we know it was comfortable for her.The bed comes with a cover, it's so thin though, I'm not sure why it is there. We had a couple leaky diapers when we were on vacation and we were able to wipe this down with soap and water. I was about to complain about the fact that you cant take the cover off of the stand, but, after further inspection, we found that it can just be unbolted from the frame. I hate buying baby/toddler things that aren't machine washable, it's so unpractical. So I am so happy to say that this wasn't the case with this.It says to handwash, but we threw it in the wash machine when we got home (on a super gentle cycle) and it came out as good as new.The fact that the top can come off and the fact that my daughter was comfortable on this enough not to try to get into our bed, makes it a wonderful product. I whole heartedly recommend it.I will aslo apologize for my lack of knowledge on what to call certain parts of this cot - I am happy to clarify if needed.	
1. 	When our son was just born, sometimes the only thing that would calm him down was being in the bjorn - perhaps because the movement mimicked the womb. My husband would put him in this and either walk up and down the stairs, or hop on the treadmill - and it would calm our son right down and usually put him to sleep. Now he faces out and loves it!	
1. 	When we were over my moms my daughter didn't have any place other than my lap to eat. My mom doesn't have the space for a big high chair so I ordered this one for her. My daughter loves it and really enjoys eating her food there. Didn't give it 5 stars because my 10 month was able to remove the top tray without a problem, so now she thinks its a game. So we have to remove to top tray since if we don't she removes it with food on it and it gets every where.	
1. 	I don't have much time to go out shopping for things we need with a new baby. The playtex bottles are easy since there's no real cleaning everyday - the liners just pop in and out! The price here is just as good as walmart but it comes right to my door without the walmart craziness :) Would recommend for sure! No problems with leaking or anything...	
- 1	This could have been a great product but it really is not. The bottom rack makes difficult to find anything. I would recommend some other one and am only keeping it because it would be a hassle to return. In hindsight, I would have bought one of the rack's that spin or something, so that I could easily find and assemble the bottles.	
- 1	This is not an item that I would purchase or give as a gift, simply because it is a little bit pricey for what you get. It is small, yet still takes up a fair amount of space. The most expensive part is purchasing the batteries. Batteries don't last long and with a fussy baby you don't want to run out of them! This might be a good gift for a relative who only has the baby for a small amount of time, but not for every day use. If this were less expensive, then maybe it would be more of a consideration for me, but for the cost you can purchase something with an ac adapter that is more useful.	
- 1	my son got hold of it while it was clipped to the stroller... well that was the end foam blades.	
- 1	I spent the extra money on this because I had the coordinating bed skirt, blanket, & pillow and I wanted my son's room to look nice and put-together. This dead way too loose on our standard-sized changing pad, though, and didn't look good at all. I returned it & got a Carter's cover in sage that coordinates well enough and looks much better overall.	
- 1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.	
1. 	Love the snack trap!  Keeps my 13 month old baby entertained with some crackers or cheerios a long time in the car, on the airplane, etc.  Can't imagine doing without these.	
- 1	Ok someone tell me what all the fuss is about. This tray is good for one thing- setting toys on it. You don't need it for feeding since any babies in this are too little to feed themselves. It is a pain to get on and off and you need 2 hands to do it. We all know having to use 2 hands to do something is a pain when you have the baby on your hip! You can't leave it on when you get baby in and out of the bumbo. I just don't get it- don't spend money on this.	
- 1	I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.	
1. 	These liners are very wide, but will be perfect with my daughter gets a little wider herself.  They are very thin, so the wideness isn't really a problem.I was slightly confused by the description for this item. You are buying 200 liners total.  These are NOT rolls of 200 liners. There are 2 rolls, 100 liners each.	
1. 	While my husband and I were registering for baby items for the birth of our first child, inevitably, a highchair was thrown into the mix.  Family and friends *insisted* we needed one.  So, needless to say, we spend quite awhile searching for a highchair we liked and registered for one.  As it turns out, we were not presented with one as a gift.  This turned out to be a good thing.Shortly afterward, our daughter was born, and immersed in the daily duties of being new parents, we didn't think much about a highchair again until we began feeding our daughter solid foods.  Unburdened by other's opinions, we decided we did not want a full-size highchair, as we originally considered.  Too hard to clean, too bulky, yet another single-use/stage item.Amazon to the rescue!  After looking at several chairs of this type, comparing features and reviews, we couldn't be happier after purchasing this one!All plastic = Easy to cleanRemovable DISHWASHER SAFE tray = Awesome!Adjustable height = Grows with our babyAdjustable/Removable seat back = Great for all stages of developmentStraps double as carrying straps = Super portable!Very affordable price = At least 1/4 - 1/3 the cost of a full-size highchair!I have already bought two; one for home and another for 'daycare' (my Mom's house).  We will be buying a third and fourth for our second child to be born this summer.In short, this product just makes sense!	
1. 	This little crib is really well made, cute and just the right size for small babies.  The mattress that comes with it is worthless, however.  I bought the mattress that is recommended to be used with it.	
1. 	This padding works great, and has a nice fit. The velcro that comes with it is poor. I had to use silicon caulk to keep it down because my 10 month old kept pulling it off. The silicon works well. She doesn't even try to pull it off anymore. It has definitely saved us from a few accidents though.	
1. 	Maybe it's not the blanket, and it's possible that I got lucky.  But, I ordered this Miracle Blanket before my 3rd son was born.  My 2nd son was a terrible sleeper, so I needed to try something different.  I swaddle him in this blanket and he seems to like it a lot and sleeps better than any of my other kids did.  He is 2 months old now and I still swaddle him in it only at night (minus the arms), and I find that he has a more restful sleep than when he doesn't sleep in it.  It's pretty expensive, but I find it's worth every penny if it allows me to sleep because baby is comfy and sleeping.	
1. 	My brother and his family are a very green family!  They loved this gift.  They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!  My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's green test!  YAY!  I recommend this gift!	
1. 	This product is a godsend!  I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc.  I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger.  The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.  There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area.	
1. 	I used to use plastic grocery bags but these are the perfect size and a must have for the stinky diapers or when you are on the go.	
1. 	I absolutely love this tub. It is perfect for infants. It has a mesh hammock that attaches to the tub that keeps the baby in a perfect position. My daughter loves getting a bath. It also has a padded head rest. I would recommend this product to any new mother.	
- 1	I loved the concept of this item and was looking for something that we could use on the high chair and at restaurants. However, we haven't gotten it to be of any practical use, and that makes me sad. First off, I can't, for the life of me, get the thing to actually stick to anything with the suction cup. It'll stick for like 2 minutes tops, and then fall off, and that's if you don't even touch it. Additionally, my little one pulls the entire thing off of it's base. It's not very sturdy. We've put it away.	
- 1	I suspect that breast shields are a highly personal thing so I don't want to discourage anybody from trying them but in my experience (exclusive pumper 8 months and counting) these do not produce more milk nor do they fit in my medela shields.  I actually got about 2 ounces less the few times I used them. They are a bit short for my taste and on the expensive side.  If your on the fence about them you might wanna pass.	
- 1	Although this is snuggly, soft, and adorable, when we took our car seat to our local California Highway Patrol station to have it professionally installed, he saw that I had put this in it (it was cold and rainy at the time) and warned me that car seats are not crash tested with these in them, that they can compress during an accident and cause the infant to slip, and are overall dangerous for use in car seats.  It would be perfectly fine for use in a stroller, but NOT WISE for use in a car seat.  Instead, use blankets or something that can fit completely over the baby and carseat rather than inside of it.  Bummer.  I returned it and use blankets instead.	
1. 	One of the items that was highly recommended to me by other mom's before my baby was born was the Snap N Go stroller frame.  Boy, were they right!  I have a Graco Snugride car seat which snaps right on this thing!  As a matter of fact the first time I used it, I set the car seat on the frame and was preparing to bend over to look to see how it attached and I heard, Snap.  It just snapped right onto the frame without me having to do anything!  It folds up so easily and doesn't take up much space in the trunk of the car.  It unfolds easily, too.  I love the basket in the bottom for holding purse, diaper bag, etc. and the cup holders and the little storage compartment on the handlebard are very nice!  I hear this frame works with lots of different car seats.  I say buy this easy, peasy item for a lot less than the fancy travel systems that are sold with the brand of car seat you buy, which are more expensive.  Heck, you're only going to use these infant car seats for a while anyway.The name suits this item perfectly...it truly is Snap and Go!	
1. 	My 5 month old was screaming his head off tonight before going down to sleep for the night.  I handed him this lovey, and he immediately stopped crying and started hugging and fingering the soft material instead!  No crying = winner!There seems to be some confusion in some of the other reviews about what a lovie is.  Just to clarify, this is NOT a full-sized blanket, nor is it meant to be.  A lovie is a miniature sized security blanket that older babies and toddlers hold with them as a way to self-soothe.  It's much easier for small hands to carry this small lovey around than a full-sized blanket!  It helps for mom to keep the lovey close for a few hours, so that the lovie takes on some of her scent.  Baby can smell the scent on the lovie, and it helps baby to bond with the lovie.Anyway, this lovey did what it was supposed to, and now my baby is fast asleep with lovie in-hand!	
- 1	I assembled it while I was 9 months pregnant (It was a gift). It took me a while, not too complicated, but it would have been better for it to be assembled and shipped whole. The pieces are all plasic, of which I am not a huge fan, but what can you do. However, my biggest concern was this: the first day I used it to take baby for a walk, on our way back, an entire wheel fell apart! We were lucky to be a few feet away from home! I was not happy...Still not pleased with the product--it's been sitting there and I'm thinking of giving it away :(	
- 1	These nipples certainly weren't &#34;fast&#34; for anything but water. Formula barely comes through. Slower than the slow-flow! The other Playtex nipples I've bought aren't BPA free and they work MUCH better.	
1. 	I have the pump so I got extra and they are solid build and  it is good quality.	
- 1	I love the idea of a parent organizer - a place to put a water bottle, cell phone, keys, etc. However, when the UPPAbaby Cruz stroller is in forward facing position, you cannot recline the seat if the parent organizer is strapped on! It gets in the way and the seat will not recline. What use is the organizer if I have to unstrap it in order to recline the seat? I will definitely be returning this item to amazon since it is pretty much useless. Don't waste your time and money on this one.	
- 1	this is impossible to use. Its very very very warm . I live in Beverly Hills and we have a very hot weather anyway, but i keep my bedroom cold. However , when you are [prego, you flush anyway, so having this was a nightmare that I ahd to return	
1. 	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.	
1. 	When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath. She is VERY active so she doesn't like to sit for very long. We first tried the bath ring, that was a disaster. This snug tub has worked wonderfully. She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips. It's very safe and fits snugly in our shower. I highly recommend this tub, especially if you have toddler who won't sit through baths!	
1. 	We've been happy with this so far. My 3 year old uses it to wash his hands/brush his teeth at the sink. We have it sitting on a bathroom rug and that doesn't interfere with it staying put.	
- 1	For us the Cons outweighed any pros...Cons:1. Flow was insanely fast for my son from 2wks all the way to 6wks.  He was drowning in milk.2. Nipple TOO soft & too long...so it made my son gag & spit up every few sucks, and his feedings that should've taken 10 min would literally take 30...craziness.3. Double nipple system means double washing (which we expected going into it).4. Double nipple system ALSO means you have to release the milk that gets trapped in btwn the 2 every few sucks...which we did NOT expect!5. All this means the bottles require an all out demonstration & tutorial to a husband, grandmother, babysitter, helpful friend, etc...unacceptable.  Period.6. Very Expensive, and in this case we didn't get a better product for the money.Pros:  I hear it has worked well for some babies, so it can't be ALL bad, right!?  But it's definitely below average IMHO.  If you do buy these I wish you more luck than we had!	
- 1	I REALLY wish I had read the other reviews here before I bought this thing. But I didn't. It is in no way a rattle, it's way too heavy for my baby, and will be way too heavy until he's over one year old, most likely. There is actually no rattle to this thing at all (as others have mentioned) and although there are speaker holes in the back of the gorilla head, almost no sound will come out unless you shake it very hard, and in a specific way. I doubt kids will get any of the tiny squeaks out of this thing at all, because it's not fun to try and try to get a noise that sounds nothing like a giggle, and is too quiet to really be of any use at all. My husband thinks it's bright and pretty and he told me I shouldn't return it, but I learned my lesson, to read reviews of even the simplest things before I buy them.It is suggested below that teether and teething toys are tags I might want to use. There is nothing on here that a baby would want to use as a teether, and rattles also suggested, is part of the name of the toy that so badly mislead me in the first place. No giggles, no rattles, not much of a toy.	
1. 	By far the best bib I have found to date! Excellent quality and the most adorable prints. I know others complained about the quality but if you wash and dry by hand per the instructions they will last forever!! They keep my children dry and food, drinks, markers, playdoh, etc... Off my child. They wipe off very easily. My child would get sick in the car and we would put the bib on before leaving the house and this would catch most of what came up. We are so thankful for these bibs and highly recommend them.	
1. 	The best thing is that this rocker is made to serve children from newborn to toddler who can sit and rock by himself. So far I have tested it on my newborn. The chair offers two options for him - a rocking chair with entertaining toys (including one musical) dangling over his head and a sort of portable bed where he can comfortably take a nap (this is converted from a rocking chair by a lever). My child as of now can only stare at the dangling toys, but I expect him to be able to play with them in a few weeks. The chair has been very helpful in getting him to sit up when he is awake so that I can face and play with him, and the sleepy position - for keeping him asleep but away from his crib.If there are any suggestion I would make, they are: it would have been nice to have a head holder (like car seats have) and that the rod holding the toys was a bit sturdier. Otherwise, not a bad investment.	
- 1	This product did not work when I took it out of the box. Not sure if I just got a faulty one or what.	
- 1	I bought a pretty princess seat cover just like this one and then saw this Sesame Street one in Burlington Coat Factory & confirmed (from taking it out of the box_) that it is the same thing, just different decoration. At any rate, I out it on the toilet and the overhang lip in the front does not hang over enough. If it did, I think it would help keep it in place better. However, the cushions on the underneath (wish they would show you that on the product images) are just that, a cushion. It has nothing to do with actually helping hold the potty seat in place, as it slides around all too easily. It snapped open well and I felt it was good, but once I sat my 16month old 21lb girl on it, I better understand the reviews others are giving. Although it's snapped together pretty solidly, when I put my daughter on it, she seat really sunk in toward the toilet water a bit, enough to worry me too much to keep it. I can see where people might say it pinches because although it's not supposed to bend anymore in that direction, it does, and could possibly pinch. My main issues with the seat though are that it:1 - had nothing to click it/stick it on the seat to keep it in place2 - sinks down under the weight of my 21 lb girl3 - I can see my own hands getting unsanitary from touching the seat to open and close it after being on the toiletI think it's a great idea, but not a well developed/made product to do the job it's supposed to do.	
- 1	I'm 5 months pregnant and was looking for a body pillow that would help me sleep comfortably on my side as I'm primarily a back sleeper. After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back.  Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams.  I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body.  It did do the job in keeping me sleeping on my side but I just wish it was softer and more comfortable.	
- 1	The kids figured out how to open it right away.	
- 1	We couldn't even install this gate, because it arrived warped - the door of the gate would not close, because it was not level with the lock. Does this company ever check the quality of their products? For the price they are asking for it, there should be a much, much better quality control. I am extremely disappointed with this gate. Obviously, it is going back ASAP!!!!!	
- 1	I'm not experienced in the world of toddler cups... this is the first straw cup we've used.  I gave it to my daughter (12.5 months) yesterday and she loved it.  She thought the flip cap was pretty awesome and once she got the hang of the straw she didn't want to put it down.Until she dropped it... and it broke.The cup got a fracture line near the bottom... so it's totally useless now.  If a toddler cup can't withstand a drop from a highchair, I don't know what the point is.  Just sent an email to customer service to see if this is typical of their product.  Just disappointing.Update 1: Customer service replied within 24 hours and said that breaking like that is not typical and will be sending me a new cup.  Hope the new one lasts a lot longer.	
1. 	we bought this almost a year ago- when my daughter was just a couple weeks old. we have used it at every nap and bedtime (if we were home) she LOVES the ocean waves, but the whales make her fussy. anyway- when she was newborn, the sound would immediately put her to sleep, now, when we lay her down and turn on her sheep she just rolls over and listens til she falls asleep. she can and does sleep without her sheep, but with two other kids in the house i needed something to drown out the constant noise, and this did the trick. i still have it attached at the foot of her crib, hanging from the top, facing her, i just push the button through the slats of her crib, no problem at all.batteries last a very long time, volume goes up much higher than i have ever needed, you can have it on for 23 or 45 minutes, usually 10 is plenty for us. definitely would recommend this sheep.	
- 1	The product itself is fine. I ordered this particular set for the brackets. I wanted to stick them in the lid of our diaper pail. Our pail is really a kitchen trash pail and doesn't have a place for deodorant disks. The adhesive on the brackets is pretty weak. So they fell off after a few opening and closings of the lid.	
1. 	This HALO sleep sack is the perfect weight. Keeps baby warm, but not too warm. The size chart is about right. I have a very long baby, but he was in the small until almost 6mo.	
1. 	Our apartment is very small, and the thought of spending money on a bulky high chair got me looking into booster seats. I absolutely love this one!!! And I'm thrilled I didn't go for the high chair cause this is even better cause you can put it anywhere and take it everywhere with you! Plus it's a total space saver and you can't beat the price! $30 vs. $150!	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
- 1	The price point is awful for what you get. It challenges products from the high quality diaper companies. I purchased these to turn in to burp cloths as I figured the cloth diapers I purchased to use as actual diapers would be too thick. These were so thin, funny shape, stain easily, etc. I would have went in a completely different direction looking back.	
- 1	It's nice and thick, but the length is way too short. By the time he fit the 3-6 month size (neck/arms) his feet were already sticking out the bottom- he's not weirdly long either, pretty proportionate despite daddy's genes of crazy height. I prefer the onesie with feet over this, since in that size (6-12 month) he's getting to wear for quite some time (of course, that's a 6 month age spread and the other is just 3 months, i know)- my point is, you'd think that a gown would fit for longer, but since the bottom elastic is on the tighter side and its weirdly short, it really never fits unless you've got a short squat baby. Which is cute, congratulations to you!	
1. 	My son is a really messy eater and his bibs used to be completely covered with food after every meal. It was such a hassle to have to rinse the bibs and then wash them in the laundry. With this bib I just wash it along with his tray. It takes 1 minute and it's ready for the next meal. He was a little annoyed with it at first, but he was fine after the second day. The bib does stick out a little at the bottom so you have to move the child's tray out but he is still able to reach everything on his tray/plate. I highly recommend this bib!	
1. 	I registered for this tub to have a lower-priced item on my list and it turned out to be one of the best things I was given.  The sling allows a newborn to feel secure so baths are a pleasant experience and when baby is bigger, the incline side lets him have little more freedom.  We used this from day 1 until my son was about 7 months old.  We'd still use it but he's too active to be bathing on/in the sink.  We used it across the kitchen sink so as not break our backs leaning over the regular bath tub. I did a test on our plug to see if it changed colors and it did slightly but, as was stated before, you shouldn't be relying on the plug to tell you if the water's too hot.	
- 1	I'll make this review to-the-point. Reasons to NOT waste your money on this:1. It is exremely big and bulky, bigger than the actual wipes from the package. It literally takes up 30% of my diaper bag.2. The red button pops off if you use to much pressure3. The wipes dry out very quicklyI use the travel wipes from Target - cost less than a dollar, more in the package, no need to transfer, more compact and they stay moist!	
1. 	I purchased this after holding a family member's hostage for some time.It's great for travel. You can fold it up and put it in the car. It adjusts well in different spaces.Ie. We use it to cover the stairs in some places, we use it to cover the fireplace at home, I've used it to cover the bookcase.... It created a nice little cage for my kids.I have never used it closed... My kids would probably just drag it around if they were stuck in it. But I have used it to keep them out of things they shouldn't get into. I tuck the ends away to prevent it from falling over and keep a zigzag pattern going to keep it sturdy.I ended up purchasing the 6 panel item with the door as well because I didn't enjoy stepping and hurdling over this one every few moments while trying to cook/serve dinner. I was told by the company that they did not advise linking the two gates together because it would make them less sturdy. Thus, I did not.	
- 1	Vinyl is being phased out by the U.S. government due to its lack of safety. These items, including mattresses, mattress pad covers, and old bath books made of vinyl off-gas (as in, leak toxic gases) and children can breath them in. I would not recommend this product.	
1. 	My daughter is 6 months old and she loves this rattle.  She likes to chew on it at different angles, and she seems to like that there are two rattle sounds: the clacking of the rings on the handle, and the pouring rattle sound of the beads in the bubble.  This is one of her favorite toys right now.	
1. 	I researched a lot of tubs before buying this one, and I am happy with my decision.  I wanted the biggest one available so he would be able to use it for awhile before growing out of it.  It has wide sides, is tall and long.  It is pretty good with being nonslip.  The only downside is I haven't been able to get the suction cup to work to allow it to hang dry so I just set it up in the tub to let it dry.	
- 1	I too am baffled by the number of good reviews. The main problem is that the handle and the base spin so they are very difficult to open, especially if your child tends to handle the cup itself and it becomes slippery. Additionally, since the handles turn , they are not aligned with the spout, which means that the child can be holding the handles and the spout can be facing an entirely different way. My child was not able to figure out that she needed to hold a handle with one hand, then twist the cup to line up the spout in line with the handle, then drink. It's such a bizarre feature to have that spinning and it only makes things difficult. Like many, I have tried virtually every cup on the market and these, hands down, are the worst.	
- 1	I ordered the strap assuming that there will be a spot on the TV to anchor it to. But even though the TV is just two years old, there isn't an anchoring spot. Therefore, it will be a good idea to check that before ordering.2 stars because they should clearly specify on the product description.	
- 1	This booster chair never made its way out of the box.  Its chemical smell was too noxious to warrant even a peekaboo.  Even the best designed chair fails miserably when you can't stand to get near it for the fumes.  My search continues....	
1. 	We used a Stork Craft crib and dresser in our nursery and turned to them again for our son's &#34;big boy&#34; room. These sets are well wrapped and arrive safely, and are relatively easy to put together (maybe not quite as nice as IKEA). We definitely used screwdrivers and drills, not the included allen wrench. :) Overall it looks nice, but I'm disappointed that the finish of the various pieces doesn't match very well. (One drawer front, for example, is noticeably lighter than the others, and a few others had flaws in the finish that were clearly not due to shipping.) The drawers feel a little loose when you open and close them with one hand, as if they're not quite set on the rails well. (Obviously this could be user error when putting it together as well, but we didn't have the same problem with the other Stork Craft dresser.) Finally, the wall-mount (critical for a toddler's room) doesn't appear to be very sturdy and could potentially damage the wall. The high back and wide sides of the dresser top look great but prevent the use of after-market wall mounts that need to attach flush to a side.Still, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture and a great value.	
- 1	We have a convertible crib that is barely a year old and this does not fit at all - the ties are way too short.  I already stupidly threw the package away and now I am stuck with an item I can't use.  I will add that it doesn't smell and seems of decent quality - but they should make the ties longer or add that they do not fit all cribs.	
- 1	I had these exact same burp clothes when I gave birth in 08 to my son so I figured with my second pregnancy I would buy them again big mistake they are made cheaper NOW you can see right through them I am going to have to fold them in half just so it will not go through on to my clothes I do not even think they will make it through a wash load what a disappointment they are worth maybe a dime each at best It is kinda hard to tell how thin they are unless you open the package I would suggest passing these up	
1. 	We purchased this toy for our daughter when she was six months old and 7 months later it still continues to be a favorite of hers.I initially liked the idea of the walker that is on the track because many babies are hurt in the walkers that the baby can freely roam around in.  I never imagined she would love it as much as she did (and does)though!When we first put her in it, it served as more of an exersaucer.  She would sit quietly in it, look in the mirror, beat on the piano keys, and grab the little rattle.  Then, one day, she realized she could actually move around a little bit and so back and forth she went on the track, stomping on the keys with delight.  It warmed my heart to see my little girl enjoying something so much.  Now that she is thirteen months old, the seat has been removed and she loves to stomp on the piano keys and compose her own music.I think this one of the most versatile toys and it has lasted so long in our house that it is well worth the money.  I'd recommend it any day.	
- 1	After reading such good reviews on this carseat I really wanted it to work.  It arrived about a week ago.  Took me an hour & a half to install in my newer style Mazda 3.  I tried the side w/ latch, the side without, the middle with, the middle without.  Finally I got it leveled and tight on the side after several attempts.  It is a BIG carseat.  I am 5'0&#34; and with my seat all the way up the top of it was hitting my seat.  My daughter was really comfy in it.  The install was a pain, but I got over it.  Then I went to put my daughter in it for a car ride.  With it rear facing the knobs are pushed into the seat pretty bad.  It is really hard on my hand when trying to turn the knob to tighten.  HAving to do it for the next year or more while she if rear facing (currently 9 months old) is going to be a pain.  Still I can get over that because my daughter is comfy and it's highly rated.  When I went to take her out, the harness system jammed.  I tried several times and could not get the harness to loosen at her waist.  I called Combi and they said I would have to remove the seat and troubleshoot it with them.  I said if I had to remove, it was going back.  Back it went to Amazon.  Hopefully it works for other, just not me.  Once my daughter was stuck in it I was done with it and wanted to throw it out the window.  The crank ssytem just kept jamming everytime it got used.	
- 1	I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review. Let me start by saying my son is only 3 1/2 months old, but is teething. I found this very difficult for him to hold because of its size, and the only parts that really fit in his mouth were the ears and legs.  Any Mom with a teether knows how they jam the toy in their mouth. He tends to do that with the head portion, which is to big for him and he just gets frustrated and cries.  I do think the texture is good, very soft and very squishy. I will continue to give this to him as he grows, perhaps he'll be able to hold it better as he gets older. Unfortunately for now, I have to give it 2 stars for the stage I'm in.	
1. 	LOVE this brand, really the whole line is great- the style is so refreshing no goofy cartoony stuff! Quality, softness, size, style are all A+ in my book.  These receiving blankets are also swaddles, and can triple as a lightweight stroller blanket, many uses for them- I have 4 different colors!	
1. 	This duck is fun, it floats, and it tells you when the bath is too hot. Perfect for my husband when he bathes our little one, because he never got the temp right before. Now this little ducky will tell him when it's too hot! Yay! No more worried mommy!	
1. 	with our first kid we had so many cutesy bibs. most of the time the bottle would soak through them, which inevitably stained the clothing. with the second kid I decided to get a pack of these to supplement. they have been so good I went back, ordered two more packs, and am ditching the other bibs which are worthless.	
- 1	I tried using this with a Coach bag but it didnt work well because it kept bunching up in the bag and added substantial weight to the bag as well	
- 1	This bag would hold a good amount of toys however the weight from those toys will never be held with the included suction cups. I will be going to a local home store to get stronger suction cups.	
1. 	We have been using only Mustela products for my son since he was born. They do the job, they smell great, and they don't break him out.	
- 1	I am really disappointed with this monitor and wish I had retained the box so that a return could be made.  I have been using it now for about four months in our relatively small home, but the range is terrible.  The initial receiver is located in the living area (only a few feet from the baby's room) and that location has good reception.  However, the second receiver is in our room about 20 feet further away and through one wall.  There are no other devices located near this receiver and yet it gets almost no reception.  We have tried moving it around the room (as close as is possible to the babies unit) nothing works.  Also, there is no apparent failure pattern which would help us determine the cause of the problem.  It simply works for a little while and then for no discernible reason begins to sound the out of range signal.  My advice is to pass this one by.	
1. 	Such a cute chair.  In case anyone is wondering, you can take the bar off.  We replaced it with the Tiny Love Take Along Arch which is a much better toy.	
- 1	I've tried this in my 2013 Mazda CX-5 and in my husband's 2012 Ford Focus. tried to attach this on the headrest and with every movement of the car, it shifts so that you can't see the baby anymore.  Total waste of money. Get the Diono Backseat Mirror instead (which I did)Diono Easy View Back Seat Mirror, Blackhttp://www.amazon.com/Diono-Easy-View-Mirror-Black/dp/B005PK1EQ4I have no idea how this product got so many 4-5 stars.  It's total crap.	
- 1	I'm returning this product.  It really didn't work at all - I'm not sure if it's meant for infants, but it didn't do anything for my 19-month old except scare her a lot.  Didn't pull anything out of her nose, and she was very congested.  I tried it several times and got nothing, then followed up with either the Nosefrida or the Baby Comfynose, and got a ton of snot out.Again, maybe it's meant for younger babies, but a 19-month old isn't that old and a product like this should work on a little one as she grows.	
- 1	So, my first impression was very bad with these liners, they kept bunching and making a baby thong and not catching anything but that was only when using a pre-fold and cover. When we switched to pocket diapers these started working amazingly. I lay it all the way out and let the edges lay over the out side of the legs and that holds it tight across the diaper and catches everything. So I love them now. I have never tried any others, so I don't have anything to compare them to. My son is also in the largest size of his one size Kawaii diapers and this cover almost the whole way from front to back of diaper.	
1. 	I had purchased a couple of gates from a big box store for my new home, but it did not register with me that I had a spindle on one side of my stairs where I wanted the gate.  I did some research into what others did about this and bought this product.  My gates are the &#34;Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate&#34;, and this works perfectly.	
1. 	I use every day. More so for the baby to sit than for nursing. The strap is also very useful, something that a Boppy doesn't have.	
1. 	I have used this so many times since my daughter was born a year ago. This is GREAT to keep in the diaper bag. So convenient to have pre-measured formula on the go. I was worried that with the top of the container, formula would spill into other compartments, but it doesn't at all! I never had a problem with that. Also, the cover and the top stay on TIGHT, it never once came off in the bag, and the top always stayed on.This is a PERFECT baby shower gift, all parents should have one! You can use it for snacks when your baby gets older, too.	
1. 	Buy this one as soon as you find out your pregnant. I waited and had a few weeks of no good sleep, wing up several times from pressure on my belly. Slept with it for 2 night no and am 4 months pregnant. Just loooove it. The only problem now is that I don't want to get out of my bed in the morning, because it's almost too comfortable.	
- 1	These straw cups leak, standing up, laying down, upside down, it doesn't matter, they always leak from the straw!  Liquid comes out of the straw simply by screwing the lid on the cup.  I figure there is some kind of pressure equalization when the milk or juice is squeezed out while the cup is sitting upright.  That, or the liquid is expanding slightly as it gets warmer. Either way, for as complex as the straw unit is, it should really be able to accommodate whatever this issue is.If your child drinks from a sippy cup, stick with it.  If you're trying to graduate to a different kind of cup, try a regular cup before you go with this dripping mess.	
- 1	I have been using this for about 3 months and it doesn't seem accurate. It's very large and I have to take it out of the infant bath tub before I put my baby in so it's not in the way. The reading always seems colder than the actual water temperature and I have started just using my elbow because I don't trust the reading. Wouldn't recommend.	
1. 	I bought this because I liked that it gave me a lot more access to get our baby in and out of the car seat.  It certainly does that, but it is also very well made and very warm!  I also like how we could use this in a stroller or other device that would carry our baby!  Love it and wish I would have had it for the other two of my kids!	
1. 	I find this bag to be roomy it holds a lot of things besides bottles great to travel with high recommended	
- 1	I just purchased this recently, however My 2 year old son  attempted to do up his seat belt on his own, and somehow plugged a carry strap plug into the seat belt spot, and now it is unusable (can not remove the wrong strap from the seat belt connecters between the legs).  :(  The two strap types are are v similarly shaped, but slightly different in size.  beware....	
1. 	These are so easy to install and easy to use! We got one for each toilet and love them. My daughter (19 mos) goes up to it and tries to play with it sometimes, but she's never even come close to getting it open.	
1. 	I purchased the Hula Baby Diaper stacker and it looks great.  Color coordinates with my room and the print is very hawaiian-like.  Super cute!  Lots of room for diapers!!	
1. 	Need a mattress cover? I would highly recommend this one. Not to expensive and works great and is machine washable. You can'tbeat it.	
1. 	Wow, we received this as a shower gift and never dreamed how much our baby would love it.  He loves to hop and jump and dance in this thing and can make it turn in whatever direction he needs. So cute! He also likes the fact that it gives him better access to the dog!We love this product!	
1. 	It expands to hold a LOT of toys! Very simple item, but feels like it's of good quality. I don't think it's going to fall apart anytime soon, regardless of how much weight I've thrown in there. the stitching/rope weave seemed solidly done. It'll come with hangers, but I just used nails and made sure I hit the studs. Also, I didn't have a full wall to mount one side because of my window layout, and I just used a couple of zip ties to shorten up one side so it would fit snugly in the corner. Cheap and easy storage!	
- 1	This company is local and I wanted to love this cup but it leaks right out of the box. Baby didn't have to squeeze, shake or bang the cup - she just tipped it to drink and her front was all wet!	
- 1	Apparently my LO is very picky with her binkys.... She would only take the NUKs, and I've tried every brand under the sun..  I thought these were a great choice because the were attached to the wubbanub and the hospital issued them... So I bought these too...My LO didn't like the green ones, and didn't like these!My niece on the other hand, absolutely love her green soothers...Now at 10 months, you would have thought she graduated, to at least these...so since my LO didn't want em, I gave em to her...Nope... Still loves the green ones, but for some reason, refuses these!	
- 1	I realize I am in the minority here, but I really did not like this pillow. I know it is supposed to sit right under your chest for breastfeeding, but I found it to still be WAY too tight to wear comfortably. (For reference, I weighed 135 before pregnancy and gained 35 pounds. I'm only two weeks postpartum, but I still don't consider myself to be exceptionally large at this point.)I do like that there is the option to turn the pillow upside down and use it to sit Baby up, though we haven't used much of that side yet. And the optional vibration is also an interesting feature, though, again, my baby isn't that interested in it yet.Overall, and especially for the price, I'm not terribly impressed with this pillow. If I can't comfortably use it for breastfeeding, then what's the point? I'd rather use myBoppy Pillow with Slipcover, Peaceful JungleorMy Brest Friend Original Pillow, Fireworkspillows. At least they fit around me.	
1. 	We bought a second one for our second daughter.  Light, easy to clean, durable. Makes the chore of changing sheets easier.	
1. 	I couldn't get comfortable using this item, so after the first try, I ended up washing it and giving it to a friend who wanted it. She has had more use out of it then I have.	
1. 	I got this bouncer as a gift. It has been absolutely wonderful and I could not imagine life without it. The music is soothing and the seat is comfortable and washable. I love how I can change the sounds or let my son turn it on by himself when he bats at a toy in the baby-activated mode. He has fallen asleep in it on many occasions and while he's in it he's happy. Th volume control is also great because you can keep it low for yonger babies. Fisher-Price also has excellent customer service. Something got damaged while my 3 year old nephew was jamming in the toybar the wrong way. I called them and they promptly sent out a new toy bar and when that didnt work they sent out a new motor. I was very impressed and pleased with their service as well as with this product. I can not say enough about this bouncer...a must have!!	
- 1	I'm looking for a good-quality pocket diaper to replace my leaky Alvas that doesn't break the bank. These retail on the Diaper Safari website for almost $14 and have pretty sound reviews both on their site and here, so I figured it was worth a shot since Amazon has them for $5.75 right now. I was sorely disappointed to see that these are identical to Alvas, with a slight modification to add a second pocket opening in the front, as well as different snap pattern. The pattern for the basic diaper shape/PUL is the same though, I discovered by laying one on top of the other. Laying them side by side with the PUL side up, there is absolutely no difference between them aside from the snaps. The insert is the same as well, holding only 3-4 ounces of liquid at best, with compression leaks happening quickly around the legs if the baby is sitting due to the poor-quality microfiber letting out a lot of pee with the slightest bit of pressure. So, I still haven't found a non-leaky pocket that doesn't break the bank, and these are going back (thankfully, Amazon is paying for return shipping).There are only 2 things that make these better than Alvas: the second pocket opening makes stuffing them a little bit less of a pain, and there is a PUL flap on the front for extra protection against pee creeping up through the top of the diaper (especially good for boys or tummy sleepers). If you have a very light wetter or a moderate wetter that you don't mind changing every hour (at least), these are great diapers! If you want to go a bit longer between changes, skip right past these.	
- 1	I bought this instead of a high chair for the convenience factor and it is really cute.  It is a HASSLE to assemble the straps, and once they are assembled, they don't securely lock into place.  The straps hang on my a tiny hole, and at the right angle can be pulled out, which I find dangerous for baby.  The point of straps is for safety, and they should not be easily removed from their base.  We kept it anyway, but had to rig it ourselves by locking the straps in with our own invention.  Good Luck figuring this thing out!	
1. 	These wash up well and also can be wiped off with a wipe if you are out and about. Also love that when he is teething the slobber does not get through to his clothes. Also nice for feedings since they wash so nicely. I have had these for several months and they are the only bibs that still look like new out of at least 15 different bibs. My son is 9 months old and is very chunky but these bibs fit him perfect and are comfortable on him. The pocket at the bottom is great for catching his food he drops while self feeding.	
1. 	we swaddled our baby for almost 3 months and rotated between two of these every night... it really is awesome and works much better than other blankets I tried... don't waste time or money trying anything else - this was really the best solution!!!	
- 1	Far to many holes in the cups to hold water!!!  Actually it's a pretty lousy bath toy overall since the cups don't stay linked together like shown in the picture (in fact, there are so many holes in the cups, the cups don't float well either).Find other water cups, promise you'll be happier than with this product.We have the cups I linked below and they are far better bath toy cupshttp://www.amazon.com/Stack-Count-Cups-8-pack/dp/B00005C5H4/ref=sr_1_10?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1325233510&sr;=1-10Stack & Count Cups - 8 pack	
1. 	You will get a lot of use out of this variety pack. I love the bowls with lids, they are convenient for storage and travel. I don't think you can have too many sippy cups or spoons when your baby starts solid. This was an excellent buy.	
1. 	Cleans up nicely no crevices for food to get trapped and my 2 year old can get up and down on his own.	
1. 	Very nice cleansing lotion. It has a very pleasant smell and cleanses the baby very well without irritating baby's delicate skin.	
1. 	My son sits in this swing fine he doesn't stay in it as long as his bouncer but I think that has to do with the motion, he can't handle that much motion. But he doesnt flop forward and the low setting is just right for him. He really likes the music. I put him in this swing on day 2 that we had him home. Out of all the swings I like this one the most because it has little toys that attach to the sides and a mirror to look at you can even buy more links and linkadoo toys and change out the toys that it came with. It is soo interchangeable with other Fisher Price toys. I wouldn't trade this swing for anything and it folds up real compact and is easy to fold and store!	
1. 	I bought this to complete our nursery and my husband assembled it completely with just following the instructions. Its not so difficult. The quality is great and I love decorating further more because of it.	
1. 	We've always used the microwave (most of the time) or a jug of hot water (when a mircowave wasn't available) to warm our first two children's bottles of formula - this worked fine for us as we knew the exact time to make the bottle just right.Unfortunately my third child had to spend some time in hospital when he was two weeks old.  What we learned from his nurses is that microwaves can 'zap' a lot of goodness out of your formula (the hosptial used a microwave as well until they were told this). We also learned that the prescription only formula he now has to have tastes digusting when not kept very warm.Hence our decision to purchase the Avent bottle warmer.  What we like about it is that it is easy to re-warm our bottles during a feed when the need arises and keeps all the goodness in the formula. The lack of an on/off switch is a bit annoying but we just turn it off at the plug.  The fact that the light goes on and off as it's keeping the water at a constant temperature is also a bit of a pain as at 2am in a dimly lit kitchen you can just assume you already turned off the plug when you haven't if the light is out.Despite these negatives things, they far outweigh the advantages for us of keeping our son's formula nice and warm.  It's easy to use, easy to keep clean and has worked pefectly from the day we bought it.We love it.	
1. 	My cousin recommended the Baby Bjorn carrier to me, which she used for both of her boys.  She warned me that they aren't cheap but well worth it.  I followed her advice and WE LOVE IT!  I especially love to wear it while shopping and walking around the neighborhood.  When my daughter was 0-4 months, she faced toward me (as required) and always slept comfortably in the carrier.  Now (at 6 months) if she is tired I face her towards me, and when she's awake, she loves facing out and looking at everything.  I don't have a single complaint about this item.  My husband is 6'3, 220 lbs and he can and does wear it comfortably.  I purchased the fleece cover (through RightStart) and that's wonderful too.  You know the saying, you get what you pay for, so pay the extra money and get an excellent carrier.  It's absolutely worth it!	
1. 	I just love this mirror. I purchased two of them. They are much larger than most mirrors and they attach to the headrest. No suction or tape to worry about. I am able to see my boys very easily.The only problem I have is that there is fog in actually both of my mirrors. I can still see my boys perfectly fine, but the quality could be improved a little. Also be careful when cleaning, they scratch very easily.As far reading other reviews regarding the safety hazard, WOW, I never actually thought about it.	
1. 	We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!	
- 1	When I first started using this product I loved it! It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner, rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner (what a mess!).However, there were several cons to them:1) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer, plan on spending a LOT of money because you cannot just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit, and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles!3) if you have a double breast pump, you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor!I like the playtex premium nurser, and wish the storage kit was more economical (and even if not economical, I'd like it if they didn't leak)I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles, which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive. I haven't seen them online, but you can buy them in BRU. These are more expensive than buying the Medela or other brand storage bags - but those bags are such a pain IMO. The bottles are great because you can easily pour them into the liners.	
- 1	I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.	
- 1	Stopped after 4 seconds--straight out of the package.  I could not get it to go any longer without touching/tapping/pressing on it to nudge it more.  Then my 4 yr old tried to fix it and it went maybe 20 seconds, when perfectly balanced flat on counter top.  The arrow doesn't even line up with the &#34;0&#34; &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; marks.  Looks cute and simple, but SO disappointed, especially for the price!!!  I knew I was taking a risk based on prior reviews, but geez...next time I take a risk on such an inconsequential item, I'll make sure it doesn't cost so much.  Now, if this mom of 3 can find time, I'll see if there's a return policy.	
1. 	My baby loves this...we hang it from his play gym to keep it interesting.  It appears very well made and gives him a new texture/weight of toy to play with.	
- 1	So mad, this does NOT work in the middle of the rear seat in our Trailblazer which there isn't a headrest. What a waste of $30. Maybe I'll put it on his crib.	
- 1	I got this in case it fit the bill but I prefer the 4-sided LA baby one. It fit better on my counter and 4-sided is good in case I need to contain a mess.	
- 1	Idea and design are good but my 18 month old can't get any water out of the firm plastic top.  I even tried and it would take an industrial vacuum to suck liquid out.  Very disappointed, especially given the other good reviews.	
- 1	maybe the one we got was defective but it wasn't accurate at all.  i love the idea of being able to swipe across the forhead to read temperature of sick child but it needs to be 100% accurate.  we were getting readings in the 60s...(!)  ended up returning it and keeping my rectal thermometer which while a pain to use is always correct.	
- 1	I purchased these labels to label my daughter's bottles for daycare.  However, the labels were difficult to put on due to the curves of the bottle and did not stay on once I had them on there.  I decided to just go with the regular old writing with marker directly on the bottle instead.	
1. 	Our son loves this!!  He really started liking it around 2 months, with the lights at the top.  He would just keep looking at them, and, as he's gotten older, he continues to love it.  It was great for when he was first learning to reach - there's a little monkey who's tail curves around a small loop, and, that's when I noticed he was learning to reach for things - he was determined to get the monkey!  Now, and 5 1/2 months, he pulls down the monkey within the first minute of setting him under, but, he still loves it, although is starting to outgrow it a bit, as he now rolls over on his belly, and ends up kicking at the long bars that hold it together, but, even given that, it still holds up amazingly well.	
- 1	The pros: It will keep the poop off your baby's butt and diaper.The cons:1)There is no way I would put that next to my child's skin. Go to your laundry supplies and pull out a fabric softer sheet. That's what if feels like. Can you imagine wearing that all day?2) It does NOT keep the wetness away from the skin. Not even a little bit.I think I'm going to soak my purchase in liquid fabric softner and use them in the dryer.I don't know if all liners are like this as this is the first one I tried. I've decided to use the fleece liners instead as they will keep the wetness away from the skin.	
1. 	The PROS: It is lightweight enough so my baby (5 months) can play with it. I give it to my baby in the morning as he wakes up & this keeps him busy for a few more minutes while I get a little more sleep. :) He loves touching the light (shell), watching the constellations around his crib, & changing the colors on the turtle. I also use it at night as a cue for bedtime & I notice it settles him down after a long busy day. He loves looking at the room filled with stars. I keep it on & enjoy it myself while I breastfeed him before bedtime. The timer option is also great.The CONS: You can't really see the brown constellation, only the blue & the green.	
1. 	i bouthg this because is Avent, this product have an excellent quality, I love products Avent, it has a perfect price	
1. 	Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3 with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!	
1. 	I have used this diaper pail for 2.5 months with twin babies.  We go through a LOT of diapers ;)  This pail has done a nice job.  The only time I have smelled an odor is if the pail is full to the top and the pop-lid is left open.  I really like the capacity to deal with double diapers of twins.  I also have a Diaper Champ and I prefer this diaper pail over the Champ.  They perform about the same, but the capacity of the Safety 1st Pail makes it a winner for me.	
- 1	bought these for a vacation.  These glasses would not stay on my toddler's head.  I was going to try to rig up a string to keep them on his face, but the lense fell out while in my bag.  Useless.	
- 1	my son hated this. tThe look of terror on hi face was heart breaking. It was like a straight jacket for babies. Now if your newborn loves to be swaddled I can see this being helpful. Neither of my boys did.	
- 1	The reviews that say this product is soft are all pretty old (2002-2004 isn). Recent reviews all agree that the product is not soft. Somewhere down the line they must have tried to save some money and made this product. I wouldn't sleep on this so will not use it for my son's crib. As far as protecting the sheet it probably does what is says...but I'll never know since I'm returning it.	
- 1	I purchased and returned because it was defective. Even when it was functioning &#34;properly,&#34; I found it not worth the hassle. It took quite a while to cook anything, and it was far easier to just cook it on the stove and mash it up with a masher or fork. Perfect example of our fatuation with gadgets.	
- 1	I only purchased this, despite the poor reviews, because I specifically wanted a navy blue changing pad cover, and this was the only one I could find. I've seen and felt higher quality terry cotton that this. I'm not very picky either. After a wash or two, it looked like a rag. So sad it couldn't work out. I would return it if I could, but I've already washed it. I ended up buying a white minky dot cover from American Baby (love it!) that remained soft after many washes.	
1. 	This blanket is so soft and keeps my baby feeling secure. Only one is necessary because it adjusts with your baby's growth. My baby is 6 months old and we are still using it just to swaddle her bottom part. (Her arms stay out because she is so long) My baby has always been in the 90th percentile for her weight and off the charts on her heighth and the blanket still worked great for her. I will mention that I've recently noticed a little hole where the wraps are, but it's nothing we can't fix by sewing.	
1. 	YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS FOR SMALL CHILDREN! I have a two year old that gets into everything! This keep her out of my kitchen	
- 1	Binky Bear is VERY cuteHe is fully stuffed and a pudgy soft ball of bear cuteness that happens to hold a pacifierBinky bear's arms are proportional with what we expect from a teddy bear... that makes binky bear not so great for a binkyI find the Bunnies by the Bay product to be infinitely superior because while many complain that they are under stuffed and not &#34;stuffed toy like&#34; enough, their long bendable under stuffed arms enable babies to contort their little under stuffed bodies and arms in ways that allow the pacifier to remain in babies mouth in ANY positionBinky Bear's short little suboptimal arms mean that if your baby moves at all the binky is out...and we all know that is not a good situation.	
1. 	I researched a lot of tubs before buying this one, and I am happy with my decision.  I wanted the biggest one available so he would be able to use it for awhile before growing out of it.  It has wide sides, is tall and long.  It is pretty good with being nonslip.  The only downside is I haven't been able to get the suction cup to work to allow it to hang dry so I just set it up in the tub to let it dry.	
1. 	As a tummy sleeper I needed a body pillow to help keep me on my side & support my hips & growing tummy.  At 1st I got the snoogle by the same maker as this pillow. I returned it the next day. The only thing that it had going for it was it's length...I got the back n belly pillow when I was around 24 wks pregnant. It's great!! It keeps me on my side & I don't have to worry about waking up & taking it with me when I roll from side to side. The only down side & the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because that I'm 5'7 and it's not quite as long as the snoogle so my whole leg isn't supported, just my thighs & knees & part of my lower leg. Another thing is the pillow cover it comes with. It's not fitted froperly & is pulled tight at the top on the inside where it's rounded & it tends to cut into my neck. (Maybe a new pillow case would fix that problem.) Other than that no complaints.**Update** I'm 5 wks pregnant (8/10/12) and wish I would have stood my ground when my husband wanted to throw my body pillow away.  Now I HAVE to buy another. I WILL be buying this one over again. Maybe I can find a used one for cheaper & just get a cover .... I also forgot to mention before that the pillow is fairly large as others have stated, but I have a Ca King bed so it only takes up half of the bed :)	
- 1	Imagine our surprise when we finally went to put these on our crib and they only covered 75% of the railing (length wise).  Plus, they were nearly impossible to get zipped, and my husband busted one zipper in the process.  We would never recommend this product.	
- 1	But my seven month old daughter HATES it. She gets so overheated, and it's only November. I cannot imagine using this in hot weather. I finally just found a 100 percent cotton long sleeve bib from Etsy. This won't be used. What a waste of $30 dollars.	
1. 	C&oacute;moda	
1. 	This is SO much easier to bath my little boy in than the big tub. He loves to splash in it and can even lounge on the duck tail when he feels like it. There are a few down sides, though. I was expecting it to be a little bigger than it actually is. My baby is 28 inches long and when sitting in the back (by the tail), his feet almost touch the front of the duck. I was really disappointed about this. That means we can only use it for a few more months before it will have to retire. Another thing, by looking at the pictures, I thought maybe the blue part on the inside of the duck changed color from blue to white if the water was too hot, but no. That's not the case. There's a little blue circle on the bottom of the tub that says 'HOT' and you can only see it if the water is hot (obviously). You have the option to hang the tub up with a little suction cup on the bottom, but I haven't had any luck getting it to stay. Our bathroom (and apartment in general) is pretty small, and the duck, when blown up, is pretty big. It takes up a lot of space, and I really don't want to have to blow it up every night to give the boy his bath. We still haven't found a place to put it. Anyway, overall, I think this was a great purchase for the time being!	
1. 	I just love these cups. My grandson loves them as much as my children did. Bath, play chewing it works all day long!	
- 1	many times my girl has hurt yoo hoo when sitting down. its sometimes hard to pop off the bowl you empy which is gross when you splash. my daughter who likes to put the pottys back together can never get this one. for the price there are better potty's out here.	
- 1	This is a great stroller for 1 child but not for 2It was impossible for my 2 year old to sit or stand in the back with my 1 month old riding in the front which I thought was the entire point of this strollerIt is only a good buy if both of your children are old enough to ride in the seats only the infant carrier part is completely useless !!!	
1. 	I have been using this bassinet for the past month and I am very happy with it. It was easy to assemble, and looks good. The lowest height setting is perfect for bedtime, the bassinet is level with my bed. The tallest height setting is good during the day for changing diapers and what not. I can move it from room to room, the wheels clear the door frames, but honestly it is easier just to carry the top bassinet part around the house. I love the light that is on the handle. I use it at night for diaper changes, it is bright enough to let you see what you are doing, but not too bright to blind both mommy and baby. The handle easily goes up to carry it around and is very easy to put down out of the way.Downside: I don't really care for all the ruffles. You have to move the ruffles every time you want to attach and detach the bassinet from the unit.	
- 1	This plastic cover is short and doesn't even cover my daughter's feet. Smells like horrible plastic...	
- 1	My little one was potty trained except for night time.  This was too small.  She is only 30 lbs and the weight limit is 51.  We could barely get it over her hips.  There also isn't much room for an insert and a 2.5 year old has quite a bladder, it would have been better if we left her in underpants (urine everywhere.)  I do not recommend this for overnight training.Pros:cutelooks nicewashabledurableCons:too smalldoes not look or feel like underweartakes too long to dryelastic is not very stretchy	
1. 	I was concerned about all the BPA fuss and considering that according to studies ALL plastic bottles can be harmful, I decided to find an alternative.. Although, I still use the playtex drop ins once in a while, when I'm giving my baby water or we're on the go, because its convenient. Anyway, back to the point, these bottles have been great! I noticed that with my plastic bottles (NUK- although I love NUK nipples) would still smell funky after several washes AND having them in boiling water. These however, are very easy to clean and SMELL clean! I didn't like the nipples it came with, so I bought NUK regular nipples to go with them, it fit perfect and my son liked it ! I saw reviews that said the medela nipples went along with it too, but I prefer nuk since I have found it is less confusing for my son (since I Breast feed and bottle feed)I got the 4oz pack of 3 for about $5 at target and that's enough for me, I recently purchased the 8oz 3pack from babiesrus for 6.99... GREAT BUY OVER ALL!	
- 1	These containers have the WORST dry erase system possible. I was able to use that the first time, and then the band either rubbed off or the marker wouldn't erase so that I could update the contents and date. I tried to contact the company directly and they didn't even bother to reply, so clearly they are not interested in having customers that are happy or will recommend their product. Honestly, save your money. I ended up just buying some jarred organic food, using it periodically and then reused the glass jars with much greater success.	
- 1	I had my doubts about this & should've listened to my intuition. I knew immediately upon opening it that I should've spent more & gotten a material cover. It has holes in it for ventilation but they're very small & I couldn't bring myself to use it. There's just something wrong with encasing your infant in plastic. I guess if you were trapped somewhere outside with heavy rain blowing in all directions it might be useful, but even then I'm not sure...it would likely scare a baby to have rain pounding on it. I'd recommend skipping this product.	
1. 	Fits well, relatively easy to get on. Washes up nicely too. My little guy looks very cute in it and works perfectly for messy meals!	
- 1	These outlet covers are dome shaped, making them easy to grasp. There is a cutout feature in the center to make it easier for adults to get them out.That is a joke as my under one year old can just take them out and just hand them to me!Do not purchase this item, it is unsafe.	
- 1	I had two Beaba trays and wanted a third but was hesitant because of the price (usally around $20).  This tray looks exactly like my other trays and costs a lot less.  I used it several times and noticed that the silicone was a bit harder and less pliable than those on the Beaba trays.  The last time I used it the silicone cracked and then tore when I was trying to pop the food out.  Once the silicone cracks/tears you are no supposed to use the tray anymore (according to the instructions it came with).  I was excited to find a cheaper solution, unfortunately it didn't work out.	
1. 	I have to say right of the bat, this is the comfiest pillow ever! It is nice and firm and stays put. It has really helped with side sleeping which is insanely painful for me. Actually its so comfy 3 year old son (who fits exactly inside the pillow) keep trying to steal it from me. As does my husband! Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this pillow!!! I am actually able to sleep almost entirely free of pain because of this! And even with me cuddled up with this, it still only takes up half the queen size bed. My husband complains about how little space he has, but he does that even when it's not on the bed so I ignore him. The only thing I hate about this thing (yes hate!) is that the pillowcase is a complete pain in the butt to put back on once you have washed it! If they made it with a zipper instead of a regular style case this would be perfect. Oh,the seam along the curve of the U is kinda painful on your neck and shoulders when you use it next to your head instead of at you feet but bunching a sheet or regular pillowcase along it completely solves that problem.  For me as I have at least a dozen pillowcases this is no big deal. But it might be for others.  It's still so amazing that even these flaws don't deserve to knock down the rating. I am so glad I bit the bullet on this and got it. We almost didn't due to it being $40 for a pillow but it is way worth the cost even if your on a tight budget. As an extra note, I was previously sleeping on my side bundled up in about 6-8 crappy Walmart pillows that went everywhere, never held their shape and that are NOT much help. My main problems were due to pain in my knees, hips, and shoulders and now it's almost 100% pain free! Normally I sleep on either my stomach or my back, so this is also invaluable at keeping me on my side.	
1. 	This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.	
1. 	We got this for our 3 month old at Christmas & he loves it! We have no complaints other than the sounds aren't exactly as they sound in the description. To us they sound more like someone breathing, a water feature, crickets on a summer's night, & a jungle groove over a campfire...LOL! But the freaky one of someone breathing holds him over until he is deeply asleep. I love the option of going longer than 20 minutes, at the 23 min timer he wakes up, but the 45 minute timer is perfect! And I don't know why we would ever get the smaller travel version. I like that his giraffe is big & cuddly...so does he! This normal size one has a velcro loop so you can take it anywhere!	
- 1	It doesn't look as cute as I see in picture. My daughter doesn't really into it. The design is below expectation	
- 1	These are simply too loose and easy to slip out.  My 14 month old easily removes them from the wall and then starts to chew on them.  Ahhhh! A better solution are the covers you actually screw into the walls.	
1. 	Compact enough to throw in the stroller and big enough for a family picnic. Waterproof, yet soft & comfortable. A must have. Great gift.	
- 1	The idea is nice: An all in one swaddle that the baby can't get out of. In practice though, this falls short in several areas:- My baby can free her hands in less than a minute and sometimes kick the bottom part off with the swaddle on pretty tight.- The velcro is really loud and wakes her up, which defeats the purpose of a tight swaddle being comforting. And it sticks to EVERYTHING in the washer/dryer.- Multiple sizes mean that you'll need to buy bigger ones as the baby grows. A swaddle blanket is one size fit all and much more economical.	
1. 	This is the ONLY small portable pump on the planet for me.  Works GREAT.  Quick, comfortable, compact.  Worth EVERY penny.  If you have others to choose from, don't pick another.  There is a reason no one has rated less than 5 stars!!!  I would actually consider using this as a daily pump at work!  I like it that much!!!	
- 1	Our Graco stroller is a regular stroller, nothing fancy. This netting is nowhere even close of big enough to fit it.	
1. 	have not put to use. baby not here yet but have attached and set up. seems to work well with original co-sleeper. appears sturdy. raises bed to good height. quick, easy and shipped fast.	
- 1	I was very eager to give Happy Heinys a try after receiving recommendations from friends. However, I was disappointed after washing them a few times because EVERY time I washed them, the laundry tabs came undone and they stuck to my other inserts, leaving nasty velcro marks on them. I could care less at this point whether or not they actually leak or not because if they are going to RUIN all of the rest of my diapers I don't want anything to do with them. Too bad, they are very cute.	
1. 	My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.	
1. 	We used this all the past summer, it was very convenient to carry to Central Park, it looks pretty, is durable.	
1. 	My daughter transitioned from swaddling into sleeping in a sleep sack. The ones we had were fleece from Carters and had sleeves. I wanted to get the same thing in a larger size, but no other sleep sacks had sleeves (and were reasonably priced). I bought the Halo SleepSack based on the good reviews, and I like them a lot. I was worried about them not having sleeves, but it hasn't been a problem. Since these are 100% cotton, they did shrink a little, but I bought a size larger in case of shrinkage and so it would last longer.The only complaint I have is that the zippers are upside down. They are designed that way, and I can see the appeal for night time diaper changes, but it makes it difficult to zip when my daughter moves around a lot.	
1. 	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.	
- 1	Our son hated this swing- it was super difficult to get him in to the swing and then strap him in without him crying like crazy. If you don't strap him in the seat is too shallow and is dangerous (he could roll out).I'm sure its great for some kids- not mine.The actual swing is of good quality.	
1. 	When my daughter was a newborn these were great. She slept better and longer. As she started to grow out of it, I would use it as a sleep sack so that her arms were exposed. I used it for 3-4 months.	
- 1	The idea of this is really good. It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib. Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it.	
- 1	The &#34;lock&#34; isn't a lock at all.  It is just a handle for you to pop out to make removing of this plug guard easier.  However, I and my 9 month old were both able to easily pull this rounded cover from the socket without even using the pop out handle.  Not child safe at all.  I returned them.	
1. 	My barely 2 year old figured out how to open this on his first try. However, we keep it way up at the top of the door so he can't reach it. It's very quick and easy to open, and my toddler can no longer open the door for strangers.	
1. 	We use it.  We love it.  The only drawback is that if you use the pop up opening, the wipes are no longer warm.  I recommend that you avoid wipes designed for pop up dispensers (e.g. Pampers) and keep the wipes in the main compartment.	
1. 	So happy I use these for my baby, secure, easy, practical, simple, I love these, I'll be getting more soon : )you can't go wrong with these. get them.	
1. 	I was concerned this safety latch wouldn't work with side-by-side refrigerators, but it does.You have to buy 2 latches--one for the freezer door; 1 for the fridge door.Place them on the TOP of the fridge, connecting from the top of the fridge to the door. I'm only 5 ft. tall, but I can reach the release button on the top of the door easily.So far, we have not had issues with the sticky adhesive not holding on the thing.  LIFESAVER, my friends!!	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these and washed them numerous times  in a 3 week period and they are like new.	
- 1	They weren't functional. They didn't bend they did fit a larger cord (power strip) and you'd have to secure it to the wall. But the part of the cord coming out of the wall is still exposed. They just didn't work for us at all as a baby proof hire hider.	
1. 	I saw this product when I was pregnant with my now 18 month old son. I wanted to get it, but had trouble justifying a $35 nightlight. For months now, bedtime has been a nightmare, sometimes taking two hours for him to fall asleep and my needing to be right by his side. For Christmas, my son received one as a gift, and he is so enchanted by the nightlight, that he is instantly calmed when it is on and drifts right off to sleep. I cannot say enough great things about this product. My husband is also quite thrilled with it, and we may need to get one for his office.	
1. 	Perfect size, I don't really know how well it works to clean her teeth because she doesn't always put it in her mouth correctly, but great for chewing!	
1. 	The item description as Baby's 1st Toothbrush is really sort of a misnomer ... this isn't really a toothbrush in the sense that you would actively use it to clean your baby's first sprouting teeth. However, it is more of a chew toy and has unique bristles in it that possibly COULD help clean your baby's teeth / massage their gums as they play with it.Knowing that, this toy is really great. It has a small form factor (about as long as an adult finger), is soft, and of cource the neccessary BPA, lead and phthalate free.It's a perfect little gift for that baby who is starting to teeth or has a sprouted a couple pearly whites already.I also appreciate the fact that the handle has a hole in it, so that i can attach this toy to a tether when my baby's in her stroller.	
1. 	I sent TWO packs of these plus a pack of the boy's bibs to my granddaughter to cover everything she has in her closet.  They help keep her dry and mom out of the laundry room.  Great colors that compliment all of her outfits.  Great purchase and I would gladly do it again.	
- 1	I have two of these, used for cloth diapering at daycare. They have a wet bag zip compartment and a dry compartment. They hold 4 all-in-one cloth diapers and a change of clothes, no problem.At first I was a bit disappointed as I expected them to be bigger, but they are just about the perfect size for day to day transport for daycare. (we use the large wet bags to collect diapers at home and much prefer those at home.) I grew to love them as we used them daily. They're washed and dried every other day in the wash with our cloth diapers.The first bump in the road was the plastic snap that holds the handle together. A snap broke on one of the bags, and we had to replace it. This was after maybe 2 months of use. Now we have 8 months of use and there are gaping holes in the outside fabric where the zipper ends rub against the fabric. The seams are threadbare, the zippers are becoming troublesome. Now our experience is looking pretty bad and I'm hoping we can limp these through a little bit longer.I'll give it this- the waterproof bag inside is still in very good shape and holding up, but it's looking like I will have to rebuild a fabric bag around the waterproof part! For the price? Find something else or you'll wind up disappointed. A plain wet bag without the dry compartment would have been a better move for our purposes.UPDATE: These ended up lasting less than 1 year before the cheap outer fabric and zippers were completely falling apart and unsalvageable. I replaced them with Bummis Fab Wet Bags- the simpler and sturdier construction on the Bummis bags makes far more sense for use with cloth diapering. I would not spend money on the Planet Wise brand again.	
1. 	They are soft, I'd say bigger than average (length-wise), have ample sized velcro sections in the back that are secure.  Great price also.I was concerned they would be too small but they are perfect for my teething (constantly drooling)  toddler @ 14 months. The neck is also ample - definately bigger than an infant bib.  We've had them for about a month maybe longer and i've seen no signs of wear with weekly washings.	
1. 	I took the side attachments off (it's great to have that flexibility with the product) and just use it to store diapers and have the wipes warmer sitting on top. It's convenient and easy and saves space, which is a premium in my world!	
1. 	This is the BEST baby gate I have ever used.  I have three kids and let me tell you, I have been through some baby gates and tried many models!  I wish I had invested the money in this one sooner!  My family uses the pressure-mount method with our gates.  This one is so easy to use and stays put.  It's easy enough that my 7-year old can operate it and still keeps my fiesty 2-year old in check.  My 2-year old has figured out how to knock down every baby gate we have ever owned (about 5 different models).  He can't knock this one down and he has tried and failed!  I have never been so happy to see my kid fail at something!  Thank you, The First Years!  I also love that I can operate it one-handed while juggling a newborn and shooing the 2-year old out of the kitchen.  Great investment!	
1. 	Love it! it fits almost anywhere you put it!  plus it's soft so if the baby was to fall on it they will not get hurt by sharp edges.	
1. 	When we were over my moms my daughter didn't have any place other than my lap to eat. My mom doesn't have the space for a big high chair so I ordered this one for her. My daughter loves it and really enjoys eating her food there. Didn't give it 5 stars because my 10 month was able to remove the top tray without a problem, so now she thinks its a game. So we have to remove to top tray since if we don't she removes it with food on it and it gets every where.	
- 1	I was very eager to give Happy Heinys a try after receiving recommendations from friends. However, I was disappointed after washing them a few times because EVERY time I washed them, the laundry tabs came undone and they stuck to my other inserts, leaving nasty velcro marks on them. I could care less at this point whether or not they actually leak or not because if they are going to RUIN all of the rest of my diapers I don't want anything to do with them. Too bad, they are very cute.	
1. 	I sometimes resell baby items, so I've been looking for a new highchair for a while now. I've been testing a few here and there, and they all gave me problems.  I owned a huge Graco chair with a giant tray that was a nightmare to clean. It stressed me out so much because it didn't fit in the sink and would cause water to splash everywhere. I also had a Svan for a few days and hated how the tray snapped on and how hard it was to clean.This booster seat is perfect.  I love the fact that the seat does not have a cushion, because I can just wipe everything out of the chair easily with no laundry to worry about.  The strap between the toddler's legs goes straight through a slit that stays clean.  I was constantly cleaning the hole around the strap of my other chair because the food would fall beneath the hole in the cushion that was for the strap.My favorite part are the little trays.  They fit easily in the sink even with additional dishes.  They fit easily into the dishwasher as well.  I cannot stress even how important this was to my family. It was stressful for everyone to have a giant tray in the sink. There's even a cupholder in the top tray and my little girl loves to organize her things and put the cup in it.I love this chair and it has lifted a burden from my shoulders!	
1. 	Your membranes will get worn out after some time. I usually replace mine about once a month...I pump twice a day at work during the week.	
- 1	This gate has great reviews so we tried it. Now I am seriously regretting spending the money, but the return shipping would be so expensive that it's not worth it. These are the things I don't like about it:1) The gate has a bar that you must step across. Also the perfect place for little fingers to get pinched if the baby is crawling and you close the gate behind you.2) Preschoolers cannot open the gate because the mechanism is too tricky. I bought the gate to keep the baby away from the stairs and living room. However, my preschooler has free rein of the house. If I hear one more Mommy, open the gate I am going to scream!3) This gate auto-closes. Meaning, when the baby is sleeping and we don't need the gate closed, it is closed anyways. That makes it harder for me to carry a large laundry basket through due to the height of the gate, does not let the dog go from one room to the other, and also causes the aforementioned preschooler problem.I would much prefer a gate that does not have a bar to step over, can be left open when I don't need it and has an opening at least 30 inches wide. This one is just a pain in the neck and not much better than a pressure gate that I have to take down and put up each time.	
- 1	Low quality work, the finish is not as nice as it looks in the website photo. The changing pad shape is non standard so you better take this into account because buying another pad or a cover is very hard (if not impossible). The pad that comes with the table is very cheap, I would not recommend using it. We ended up returning it.	
- 1	These outlet covers are dome shaped, making them easy to grasp. There is a cutout feature in the center to make it easier for adults to get them out.That is a joke as my under one year old can just take them out and just hand them to me!Do not purchase this item, it is unsafe.	
1. 	We bought multiples of these, just so we'd have them.  It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it!  He never took a pacifier, but this toy is the closest thing--sometimes when he's screaming, this toy is the only thing that'll calm him down.  So glad we found it.  Definitely worth the money.	
1. 	Must have for sterilizing.  So easy, just 10 minutes or less of your time and your sterilizing is complete!  I use this sterilizer twice a day and it really makes the task quick and simple.  Well worth the price of admission!	
1. 	These are my go to cups. They never spill. It's great to be able to throw these in my purse or bag with the confidence of knowing they are spill proof. My 20 month old son has no problem drinking from these and loves the different themes.	
- 1	I was specifically looking for a narrow backless booster to fit 3-in-a-row in the back seat of my sedan, this was not so narrow.  The description says 12, but now I see that means the internal width, not the width of the whole thing!  I'm sure it's a great booster, but I feel like I just wasted a bunch of time... it will be going back.	
- 1	This is a nice product, but the compartments are very tiny. Barely holds enough snacks for my 21 month old. Great concept, just wish the compartments were a little bigger.	
1. 	We got this for our 3 month old at Christmas & he loves it! We have no complaints other than the sounds aren't exactly as they sound in the description. To us they sound more like someone breathing, a water feature, crickets on a summer's night, & a jungle groove over a campfire...LOL! But the freaky one of someone breathing holds him over until he is deeply asleep. I love the option of going longer than 20 minutes, at the 23 min timer he wakes up, but the 45 minute timer is perfect! And I don't know why we would ever get the smaller travel version. I like that his giraffe is big & cuddly...so does he! This normal size one has a velcro loop so you can take it anywhere!	
1. 	Its a pretty good wipe warmer. Keeps wipes pretty moist. Also fits on the Prince Lionheart diaper depot. The only real drawbacks are that it doesn't have any way to secure it to the changing table without the diaper depot... and it is a bit bulky.	
1. 	It's very sturdy.  My little guy is a climber and it's never tipped over.  He learned quickly how to back himself down onto it.  We're still working on the process, so I'm not sure if the urine guard will work well or not.	
1. 	We got this for our six month old who rolls everywhere. We have an open plan apartment so it's great to put her in while I do chores. For $20 it does the job. she can't sit up yet and the part that the baby sits in is quite big so she can slump in it a little. We're still waiting for her to realize that she can jump in it. But right now she sits in it happily and spins... It wasn't too tough to put together but it took a bit of fiddling... basically if you're on a budget this is a simple cheap  solution.	
1. 	Got these hoping they'd be more comfortable than regular shields, and they definitely are.  However, the more you wash/sterilize them, the more they start to yellow and will eventually need to be replaced sooner than the regular kind.	
1. 	Living in a small apartment and knowing how quickly babies grow out of things I stumbled upon this rocker on Amazon.  First thing that caught my eye were the reviews... a high number of positive reviews coupled with almost 5 stars.... how could I not stop and look?  After scanning through the reviews and seeing that this is something that I can keep for more than a few months I quickly added this to my gift registry and I received it as a gift.Yes it's true that you don't want to use the rocking motion right away.  Wait until your baby has grown a little because they'll sink down.  But luckily for me my baby was born over 8lbs so it wasn't too much of a concern.  I started using it after 2 weeks and it works wonders.  I also put my baby in the stationary position during the day while he's sleeping and he is super comfortable.  He sleeps and sleeps.  Sometimes I pull it close to the sofa while I take a nap too.  It's better than having him in the bedroom.  He can be in the living room with me while I'm doing other things.  Yes you have to manually rock your baby but I don't mind.  I just rock him using my foot while I'm watching TV.I just started using the vibration switch and he seems to be taking to it well (He's 1 month now and over 9lbs).  BTW, I also own the Bright Starts Portable Swing-Biscotti (great reviews as well) but have only used it a handful times at most... he's just not big enough to handle the swinging motion - maybe in a month or two.I can totally see my little guy sitting in this watching cartoons in the future.  I cannot recommend this enough... Do yourself a favor and buy this piece... it's a sure thing.	
- 1	We ordered this for our little one after using a fleece swaddle blanket by summer infants. Our little one loves to be tightly swaddled. I ordered this size because our baby is 9 pounds. After trying it on, I was surprised by how constricting it really is.There was absolutely no room for our baby to wiggle a bit. I expected it to be tight but not THAT tight. My husband made the remark that it was way too tight and resembled an infant straight jacket. Reluctantly, I said well lets try it and see. The minute I put baby in the cradle she started screaming & fussing. It was just TOO constricting. We agreed to send it back and order a new summer infant swaddler.	
- 1	I bought this crib after it was recommended by the book Baby Bargains.  I thought, Why buy a $1000 set of nursery furniture when we'll only use them for a few years?My daughter is now 11 months old, and I just ordered a solid wood crib from Pottery Barn.  This Graco crib is flimsy, which didn't bother me when she couldn't pull up and just lay there, but now when I hear the ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-dunk of her standing up and shaking the side of the crib, I get nervous.  The drop-side was recalled and requires a special kit to make it fixed.  In a single day, my daughter has chewed the finish off in one place; it looks like a squirrel got to it.I wish I had saved my $150 (which was the price at the time) and just bought the more expensive crib to begin with.  It's not a bargain if it won't last through all of the children we hope to have.	
1. 	My son is 10-months old, and we've been using this product even before he had teeth starting at 4 months.  We used it to clean his gums and rub the milk residue off it.  Works great, and he actually loves chewing on it!  I still don't understand how the tooth paste is flavored and good for you, but it does what it claims though.  I plan to purchase this product all the way up until he has a full set of teeth, before converting to a real toothbrush.  I only wished that it came with 2 of the gum cleansers, instead of only 1.	
1. 	Kid gets to have a tumbler like mom and dad.  Great playtex quality and design.  Love this.  Will grow with my child and will be using for a long time since the design is not babyish.	
1. 	These bags are a must for disposing dirty diapers. They have a good ties and nice smell that stops the diaper from stinking up the room. Better price and value than the Munchkin ones	
1. 	Got these for my 11-month-old son as an early Christmas gift.  They are a great quality block.  They will be used for years to come.  My son has a great time knocking down the pyramids we build.  Even though he chews on them (he's got eight teeth) I haven't seen any paint in his mouth.	
- 1	My son was waking up and scared in the middle of the night from the pitch black, so we decided to pick this nightlight up for him. It was adorable, and the colors were beautiful, just what we wanted but it died after 3 nights of use... I'm assuming it was a bad egg, but disappointed and returned it. Didn't see where we could change batteries or anything.	
1. 	I like this bib better than the Baby Bjorn one because it's not rigid and has sleeves.  At first I didn't like that you had to tie it in the back and wish it had velcro straps, but it does make it harder for baby to take off.  Easy to wash and dries quickly.	
1. 	it moves around a lot.but it does what it's supposed to.having a wipes case on top weighs it down a bit, which is good.all in all, not a great idea to have all this stuff on the counter where the baby loves to reach for it and play.	
- 1	These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.	
1. 	This is the second one I purchased. The only negative thing about it - is that my 11 month old daughter has no problem pulling the inside tray out. I gave up using it for now and just put her food on the main green tray that is attached to the chair. Otherwise, we take this with us everywhere we go - picnics, restaurants, etc.	
- 1	The quality of fabric is very very poor. The material is fluffing and too much lints come out of it. Difinitely, causes the breath problems for infants.	
- 1	This product was a total bust for us.  It does not stay put in either of our cars (Equinox & Prius).  If it could be installed properly, it would be perfect.	
- 1	Money wasted. I bought 4. The pink one is hard to find too so she's stuck on the green ones.	
- 1	This pump I personally hated, I got less milk out then with a manual pump and it took longer. It's very slow, loud, and it's my only pump I had that felt unnatural. It made me hate pumping and made it more of a hassle and irritating. If it's what you can afford I say go for it, but you can see what your getting from the reviews. An my insurance was overpaid I feel for this piece of junk. If you can afford better please do better or stick to manual. The only thing I liked was the stand and the insert into the part that goes on your chest.	
- 1	We ordered this product because it is so hard to find black nursery furniture that is a reasonable price. We planned to use this as a dresser and changing table. Basically you get what you pay for, this item is made of processed wood/particle board so it is not the best quality. I knew this before I ordered it so I'm not giving it a bad review for that. My husband and I are not pleased with the dresser because it has a million pieces to it and the company put the wrong screws into the package. It is frustrating when you begin putting this dresser together only to discover part way through that they gave you the wrong screws. We tried to call the company but they were closed. Ultimately we can wait to get a hold of the company and I am sure they would send us the correct screws, but we don't really have time to wait. It is just a hassle to not have all the parts you need for the item. So now we have to try to find screws that will fit from a local hardware store. If we cannot find them we will have to wait for the company to send us the correct screws. I am sure the dresser will be sufficient once it is done but basically I am giving it a bad review because it is a hassle.UPDATE: After finding screws that worked and getting it put together I would NOT recommend this dresser. The wood is very cheap and cracked in a few different spots when tightening screws. We are not idiots and didn't screw them too tight, the wood just would not hold up. Also, we purchased the hutch (top part) for this dresser, it was actually better than this piece, but be aware that the top and bottom part do not match up perfectly. You can't really tell with the naked eye though. Once the hutch is on you cannot used the dresser as a changing table, as we would have liked to. It cuts a few inches off so therefore unless you have a very short changing pad it will not fit.	
1. 	these are really attractive. much nicer than what i can get here in the stores. it is see thru so i can see how much liquid is in it. daughter loves mickey so thats a bonus. easy to clean, washes well by hand or in the dishwasher. only problem is my daughter likes to throw cups from her high chair and the lid will pop off. so this is a supervised cup for the time being (she is only 14 months old) if i give it to her in the chair it's water only! now if your child doesn't throw cups this is great. as with all straw sippy's liquid other than water will leak out once it starts to get warm. two remedies, only use cold drinks and put back in the fridge, or lift the straw just above liquid level if sitting on the table!	
1. 	This is a nifty little contraption but it took a bit to figure it out. After opening the white part, pull the green plunger out to add the meds. It only holds about 1 tsp of liquid.	
1. 	Purchased this 4 years after purchase of DaVinci crib.  Relatively easy to put together; took my husband and I about 45 minutes.  Wanted to make sure everyone knows you must have a box spring with this bed frame.  Mattress will not be supported otherwise and in addition, you will lose your warranty on the mattress if not supported properly.  We purchased a low-profile box spring (cuts about 3 inches from regular one) and my 3 1/2 year old can just barely pull herself up on it.  So she will use a step stool for another few months.  It's a beautiful bed frame for a child's room.	
1. 	Great idea for a teething baby. easy to put chunks of frozen fruit or ice into. takes some time to disinfect due to mesh bag but over all i would recommend to others.	
- 1	I'm sorry to say, but there is very little positive that I can say about this set whether you use it a lot, or only occasionally.  I'm all for making your own baby food, especially if you are concerned about what your baby eats, but one thing I don't think it has to do is take up a lot of time.  With this set it will take you forever to make enough food in order to freeze any.Here are my thoughts on each part of the set:The Chopper:  This product worked, but what I didn't like was that you had to pre-chop your food before you could use it in the chopper per the manufacturers instructions.  I have a feeling it is because the contraption is almost entirely plastic and can't take too much force otherwise it would break.  If I'm going to use a chopper I don't want to pre-chop my food before I use it.  It doubles the amount of work I have to do.Steamer basket:  This is actually the same piece in the set as the chopper, you just remove the metal blades before cooking.  I've been reading a lot on how microwaving your food in plastic containers could be dangerous as the chemicals in the plastic can leech into the food.  The items in this set state that they are BPA free but what about PVC, and phthalates?  I wonder if by making your own baby food, which you do because you are concerned about the things in your baby food, that you could be exposing your baby to harmful chemicals by using this product to steam the baby food.  My advice would be to use the chopper if you like it, but to steam it in a glass container instead of the plastic one.  Good Housekeeping did a study to see if BPA or phthalates actually leech into the food when microwaving and the results varied by product, but there were some that did.  That is enough for me to not want to use this product as it is advertised.  Harvard Medical School has also recommended transferring food into microwave safe glass or ceramic containers to microwave your food.  I trust them more than I the Munchkin brand, so on that score I think this product fails.  Muchkin could have made the steam basket out of glass, not plastic but they didn't.Food Mill:  The food mill was awkward, messy and produced just a small amount.  You fill it from the bottom and push it up and the food oozes into the grinder and sits in the top bowl as you continue to push up.  Frankly I hated it.  Again it is made up of almost entirely plastic and the grinding blades are relatively cheap so I don't know how long they'll last. Not to mention that the amount of food produced is not nearly enough to fit into the storage containers.  Some people mentioned taking the grinder to make on the go baby food.  I would rather make it at home and take it in a container and not mess with the tools.  It's not big, but it's not small either, then you have to deal with taking it apart and cleaning it.  It's doesn't clean easily either.Food Storage:  These are like ice cube trays with lids.  I hated these frankly.  They are a rigid plastic and I had a hard time getting the food out of the container once it was frozen.  The trays didn't twist at all to help you pop them out and I found that I had to defrost it a bit to get the serving size that I wanted out, and then refreeze which isn't a good idea.  The lids that come with the food to prevent freezer burn didn't snap on tightly.  I prefer the silicone food trays with lids as it is easy to pop out individual servings.  I like the Beaba or Popfex trays the bestPOPFEX Baby Food Multiportion Freezer TrayAll in all this product made making baby food much more complicated than other products and if you use it as it was intended it's not as safe and healthy as they make it sound.  Busy Moms want the best for their babies.  This product makes baby food making such a chore and is so much more time consuming than other options.  This is marketed as a starter set, but what it really is is a product that will make you either give up on making your own food, or buying another product like what my sister has, the Baby BrezzaBaby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Greyor the Baby BeabaBeaba Babycook Baby Food Makeror even the Baby Bullet set which is just a little bit more expensive than this setBaby Bullet Complete Baby Care SystemWith something like the Brezza she has to pre-chop the food to fit it in the steamer, but after that she's done.  It steams the food, then grinds it all in the same container.  Don't buy this item just because it seems like it will do the same thing for less money because in the long run you will be buying one of the other products mentioned.  Save yourself time and money and pass on this one.Finally, I decided to give the product two stars instead of one because it does work, however I can't justify a higher rating because I question the safety of the product when using it to make food, I question it's durability, I don't like that I have to have so many things to store and clean when other options are easier, and it takes a lot of time and effort to produce such small amounts of food.	
1. 	We love the Playtex Insulators. We tried a whole bunch of cups when my youngest hit the sippy age, and these were the best by far. This is one of our many purchases as we have added to our sets over the years. We do find that after a while the plastic valves need replacing, and occasionally I have thrown away a lid but only after a long time (years). One note of caution, do not try to boil these as it warps the cups and then the seal is not correct. That may seem obvious but I have heard of several people doing it so it is worth mentioning.	
1. 	I registered for this and I didn't realize that it would be difficult to find covers for due to the depth created by the four sides, which is why it lost one star. After reading the reviews I registered and received theSummer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Tan/Green (Frog)cover another reviewer said fit and linked to. It did not fit, it tented quite a bit. So I ordered another cover a reviewer said fit,American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dot Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover, White Puff. These were a couple dollars cheaper than the Carter's version that other reviewers said fit despite the dimensions being the same as the Summer Pals cover. The American Baby fit much better but is by no means perfect, it still tents but not nearly as much and is made for pads an inch bigger in every dimension however the strap slots aren't in an ideal position. I was worried the tenting would cause the covers to rip or wear faster once the weight of the baby was on them or if they shrank after washing, or would come off mid change. If I hadn't thrown away the box I would have returned this one and purchased the 30 version of the pad and I think the standard covers or the American Baby cover would have worked great. If you are handy with a sewing machine you may be able to make covers that fit perfectly by making them an inch bigger in the depth than the American Baby covers.As for the cover itself it is of regular changing pad quality, perhaps a bit more padding than cheaper models. It's vinyl so it is easy to disinfect with a mild bleach solution. I like that it has four sides with a good depth to help keep baby from rolling around on me while changing and trying to scoot off the end or top of the pad. It just feels more secure and protects the baby's head a bit more from accidents. Overall save yourself the frustration and buy the 30 version you may have better luck finding covers and save some money.	
1. 	A bottle warmer has many uses.  The first and most obvious use is the fact that you can have a bottle warming while you're changing your baby's diaper, getting them dressed etc...While some will complain that it takes 5 minutes, I find that to be a gross over estimate.  It takes not quite 2 minutes from refridgerator to warm.  If it truly took 5 minutes my guess is that too much water was being put into the resevoir.The next great use is the fact that it's easy and so any Dad - new or experienced - can figure out how to use it to help out.  It's extremely easy to use so it can even be easily used in the middle of the night.The one weakness that I found has to do with warming up breast milk that's been frozen.  It seems to have some sort of timer that times how long the water in the resevoir has boiled to not let the milk get too hot.  If breast milk has not had an opportunity to thaw out in the fridge yet it will obviously take more than just 1 press of the button for the milk to thaw and be warmed up.  The problem is that even though there's still ice in the bottle the water will be warm and so the heating element that heats the water will shut off after 10 seconds.  What I had to do was shake the bottle to more evenly distribute the temperature through out the bottle and add more cool water to the resevoir 3-4 times.  This situation is easily fixed however by remembering (easier said than done when you aren't sleeping much!!) to take out a bottle 12-18 hours in advance.Overall, great product, great value and a must have.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to set some sort of control to tell it that the bottle is full of frozen liquid.	
1. 	I really like this magic cube. Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot. The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great. We enjoy it.	
1. 	I bought some outlet covers at Lowes that were the rotating kind, like this:http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Swivel-Outlet-Cover/dp/B000BQL7CI/ref=pd_sbs_ba_15?ie=UTF8&refRID;=1ZRRBYQ38MHFS52XZMM3These sliding ones are so much better! The rotating kind can get stuck in the open position (they usually do not spring back to their closed position). Additionally, they will not fit all cords - for example, an iPhone charger does not fit in the rotating kind.THESE sliding protectors are so much better because they always spring back automatically to the closed position when you're not using the outlet, and they accommodate all kinds of cords (every electrical plug will fit into these).I bought standard electrical plugs too, like these:http://www.amazon.com/Mommys-Helper-Outlet-Plugs-Pack/dp/B00081J3N6/ref=pd_cp_ba_0Personally, I recommend putting the cheap, standard kind in most of your outlets, and only splurging on these sliding covers for your frequently used outlets, unless cost is not a factor for you.	
1. 	This sheet is soft.  Fits our Graco pack-n-play.  I haven't tried other brands, so I can't compare the quality, but this one seems to be good.	
1. 	We received the same set of bibs when my first son was born in 2009. We still use them 2 of them on regular basis. However, I decided to order new ones and to my surprice they are still on the market!I recived it quickly (thanks to Amazon!), but noticed that the material they were made of is a little differnt this time. Not as soft as it used to be.I wouldn't be so sure if I didn't find one brand new bib from 2009 a day before I received this order.Otherwise, I highly recommend these bibs to anyone! They are the best!	
- 1	when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased. the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in, so it was a pain cause I couldn't go outside and relax, had to stay near the unit where the plug was. as I live in another country I couldn't call for the warranty. would not recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	This set would make a perfect gift for an expecting mother.  It comes with everything you need to feed a baby for many months.  The bottles have pastel colored rings that would be appropriate for either a boy or girl. You get 6 ounce bottles with slow flow nipples and 9 ounce bottles with fast flow nipples.  I still use the slow flow nipples even after 4 months because my baby is a fast eater and this helps her slow down. It even comes with an extra slow and fast flow nipple and two extra vents.  The nipples are also supposed to be naturally shaped to aid in breastfeeding, but my baby is exclusively fed pumped milk, so I cannot attest to that ability.The bottles are different because of the Ventaire technology.  The bottom of the bottle twists off and a rubber vent fits inside.  Make sure you twist the bottom on correctly, or milk will leak.  The first few times, I did not screw them on correctly- the threads are stiff and I did not match them up, and they leaked a little.  After more uses it is easier to twist them on. There are tiny holes in the bottom that allow air to escape, so your baby is not taking in extra air while eating.  I could hear the air escaping while my baby ate.  This was especially helpful when she had a cold and was breathing a lot of bubbles back into her milk.The bottles are shaped with a angle which allows for mothers to hold the baby in a more upright position while eating.  This helps reduce gas and supposedly colic.  It comes into narrow sides that the baby can grip when it is able.All of the bottles come with caps that fit very tightly, making transporting milk easier.  All the accessories are interchangeable between the 6 and 9 ounce versions.  they have held up well through multiple cleanings in the dishwasher.I would highly recommend these bottles.  I have also used Avent, and they are good, but I do believe the Ventaire technology has made my baby less gassy and less fussy.	
1. 	These bottles are well made to stand up to the constant use of a newborn.  The bent shape make it comfortable to use while feeding and the ease of transferring nipples will make for good swaps if your baby is particularly bite-y.  One issue for some parents, for those who don't want to upgrade after the newborn stage, I don't think these will be good for upwards of the first year of a child's life.  The size and setup don't really seem like something for anything but newborns.Regardless, it's a good newborn set that should satisfy all needs, because it can be used in conjunction with breastfeeding & formula.	
1. 	I have been using this warmer since I started using bottles at 3 weeks.  I love this warmer except for the fact that it takes 3-4 minutes to warm the bottle.  Not a good thing when she is screaming to be fed.  I use the Avent bottles.  Usually filled with 4oz.  The instructions are easy to use and it has the measuring spoon attached so you know how much water to fill in the warmer.  The only thing I noticed with this warmer is you have to be exact with the amount of water otherwise the bottle is either to warm (too much water added) or the bottle is cold (not enough water added).  We purchased 2 more of these one for each grandma's.  I am looking foward to seeing how this warmer works with baby food jars.	
- 1	This is a nice product, but the compartments are very tiny. Barely holds enough snacks for my 21 month old. Great concept, just wish the compartments were a little bigger.	
1. 	If you have a strong kid, this blanket will really keep them swaddled.  That being said, if your kid CAN get out of this swaddle (like mine), maybe they are too big for a swaddle and you need to wean them from it.  Either way, I really liked this product, and would recommend it for babies 4 months and younger to help them stay asleep if they like to be swaddled.	
1. 	When I purchased the Bjorn, I too had visions of long happy walks with my baby right up against me.  Well, that wasn't the case - at least not in the beginning.  My newborn hated it.  He was uncomfortable with the forward facing position and didn't like that he couldn't see out the sides.  I felt I was smothering him in there.  When he was 3 months I tried it again with the front facing position and his arms through the holes.  He liked it better, but could only stand about 10 minutes.  When I took it off I had such extreme back pain I immediately took 2 Alleves - something I never do.  Well, he's a high maintainence guy, so I figured I would give it one more try.  I readjusted everything, and when he was four months I put him in it again.  This time no arm holes.  This was much better for both of us.  I was able to get him in and out much quicker without all the extra arm and leg buttons to do.  He liked having his arms free and looking out.  It was still hard on the back, but I concentrated on keeping my knees bent and a bit of a pelvic tilt.  We did 20 minutes a day for 3 days in a row.  It sounds kind of like more work than it's worth, but it really isn't that bad.  After that we were pros.  I now take him everywhere in it.  I have worn it for 2 hours at a time and walked a 5 mile hike in it.  He often just falls asleep in it (and he's a tough sleeper).  He's a big baby - 19 lbs. - I know I can use it until 25 lbs, but honestly I'm not sure if I'll want to at that size! He seems to be busting out of it already.  I may try the hip sling - but for now he likes it much better than the over the shoulder type sling and it gives me some hands-free time.  I always feel he is secure - even if I'm dancing around or moving quickly.  Great for the mall, ball games and walks.	
1. 	That is so funny that a previous reviewer called this the Pooperoo because my daughter poops almost everytime I put her in it!  And it really squishes up the back of her diaper because all her weight is pressing down right there - ew!  But anyway, this thing is AWESOME!  We bought it for my daughter right before she turned 4 months and, I swear, within a week of getting this for her my very colicky daughter was suddenly a happy baby.  Before we had this, I was her Jumperoo - holding her for hours while bouncing on an exercise ball (not great on the back!)- and this seemed to solve all her problems!  She is now 11 months old and still goes in her Jumperoo about a half hour everyday to watch a Baby Signing Time DVD (and so I can take a shower!).  I'm surprised that even now that she is a skilled walker she still enjoys spending time in it.  I'll be sad when she outgrows the weight limit!	
- 1	These are CRAP... great concept but the tape doesn't stay put. I just pushed the door (pretty lightly) and it popped right off- after giving it 24hrs to dry- lol. So it popped off and took some paint with it... my friends 2yr old could have opened the door no issue with this thing installed (she's a great trial in knowing what we need to baby proof!). I knew it was a risk- as it seemed too good to be true- but figured it was worth a shot for something so cheap. Have to find another product now... oh well. Live and learn ;)There is not other way to install- we could drill a hole, but don't really want a hole in my closet door- besides, it's a hallow door so it wouldn't work anyway. And you could maybe super glue it... but how long would that last?	
- 1	I ordered these cups for my 13 month old and was disappointed in them. They leak from the top if they are sideways for any length of time (defeating the purpose of a sippy cup!) and she is easily able to use them to paint with the liquid inside. The only thing they really work for is in the car where she's only using them for short drinks	
1. 	I really didn't want to go the seperate potty route as our bathroom is tiny as it is.  This was a good compromise, it's stores fairly flat and takes less than a second to put up.  My daughter loves the 'ladder' idea.  Only drawback so far is that the non-slip grooves on the step are a bit deep so she's reluctant to step up when she's barefoot.	
- 1	I'm surprised by how well this is rated so I decided to add my two cents to the minority.The PROS:  Fits snugly on any seat. We have round and elongated and it fits both no problem. Also, easy to clean.  I also like the look of it; simple and clean. I put one in the guest bathroom and I can leave it there when I have people over.The CONS: By the time you get the seat cover up, the pants down, the seat on and plop you kid on the toilet he's already pee'd hisself.The slashguard - after watching my sons try to get up from it on there own I quickly realized they might end up eunuchs. Even with the stool and me standing there it is still dangerous; they have to be lifted.  When they try to maneuver around it, the seat becomes dislodged from putting there weight on one side. I was horrified to hear that some boys actually pulled their skin open and needed stitches. I was even more appalled by some reviewers saying that the parents should have been more vigilant. With all the worry and guilt inherant in parenting thats just a mean thing to say; and not trure.  The whole point of potty training is to get your child to go on their own. They can't learn if you are hovering every time.I bought the built in toilet seat instead. There are two seats in one so both children and adults can use it.	
- 1	leaded after a few months. ugh.  just use 3 swim noodles made into a triangle for each side. ut this is good fro traveling.	
- 1	To keep your ameda pump running well, you need to replace the valves every so often and if they tear. Ameda sells valves in 2-pk containers; these five came in an unmarked white bag - no Ameda name anywhere. The price was slightly better than the Ameda valve but the valves aren't as sturdy or firm.  They feel like they are made of inferior material as they are &#34;looser&#34; than the 2-pk Ameda. They are fine, I guess, and I cannot really tell if pumping output decreased with these valves, but it certainly hasn't increased and I am irrittaed that these valves are sold as &#34;Ameda&#34; valves while I am pretty sure they are a generic brand.	
1. 	These are perfect for my daughter's nursery to hold diapers and some of her stuffed animals.  They are sturdy and I loved how I could pick different bow colors.  I recommend these.	
1. 	We have tan leather seats in the car so this offered the best colour option and looked the least hideous.  So far, it has not damaged our leather seats. The only con is that the top piece is a bit small.	
1. 	This is not the cutest mobile, but I think that from a babies point of view it will be perfect.  I love that it can be changed around to offer baby a different view and that it can be raised as baby gains strength and height.  My only criticism is that the plastic arm holding it up could be sturdier.	
1. 	My grandson is just starting to teeth and I wanted something that would prevent him from chockinglove these! I have purchased 6 of them and additional replacement screens	
- 1	Horrible design! I should've listened to the other reviews. It will stay on my daughters Graco stroller as long as she doesn't touch it! The music hippo is cute and the toys catch her attention but bad design overall.	
1. 	Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.	
- 1	The concept of this product is good however its permanantly rolled up and the suction cups won't stick to anything but glass which you very rarely come across when going out to eat. We ended up just getting the disposable placemats that stick to any surface. This thing is useless!	
- 1	I wanted a cover that would protect my son from touching the germy shopping carts.  This cover was nice, however, it was bulky with the side pillows, and didn't cover the sides.  I'm much happier with the Infantino cover and recommend it over this one.	
- 1	My toddler son received this monkey lunch bag as a gift and we both loved it.  It's really adorable and just the perfect size for his lunch.  The zipper works well, and I like the pocket on the inside.  His school has a fridge that the kids can put their lunches in, so I cannot attest to the insulation of the bag.After a month of use, however, my love for the bag started to diminish.  The bag is fabric, and the fabric isn't coated either on the inside or outside.  So anything moist or liquid that comes into contact with the fabric soaks right into the fabric and you can't simply wipe it clean.  Spot cleaning does NOT work.Fabric bag + young kid + food/drink = gross and smellyUnless you have time to thoroughly wash the bag every other day (or even weekly) with soap, water and a good scrub - but if you have a small child, I'm doubting you have the time for that.  Or the energy.Not only does it start to look grimy after a few weeks, but I'm sure it is teaming with more germs than the average parent would find acceptable for their kid's food storage system.After a couple months, I ended up getting theCrocodile Creek Classic Lunchbox - Solar System 10 x 7.5, which you can spray with cleaner and easily wipe down with a wet dishtowel to get it reasonably sanitized and cleaned.  However, the Crocodile Creek isn't perfect either: the zipper often gets hung up on the bottom corners.  It might be frustrating for young fingers.  But overall, it's a better choice than the Skip Hop in my opinion.	
1. 	I have used the Medela double automatic pump for 3 months now and been very pleased. It is comfortable and fills the bottles up well. Since there is some setup involved and you have to be near an outlet, I thought I would get this manual pump as a secondary option. I will still bring my automatic pump to work with me and will use it a lot at home too, but plan to use this one for when I travel and don't expect to pump much, and for times when I need to be more mobile around the house.Just now, during my first time using the pump at home, I received a work call (I work from home some too) and I was able to just keep pumping since it was so quiet. Haha! I was also able to go to the door to let my barking dog in, then tend to my baby who woke up early from her nap, while pumping pretty much the whole time. Talk about multitasking - a requirement for all of us mommies!Glad I got this, and also glad I have the double automatic pump.Be sure to check with your health insurance before buying a pump, since many will cover part or all the cost. My double electric was completely free to me. :)	
- 1	I got this blanket today and it seemed small.  I measured it and end to end, including bindings, it was 25&#34; wide and 29.5&#34; high.  Certainly not 30&#34; x 40&#34; as stated.  If it shrinks even more when it washes, that's even worse.	
- 1	Fell apart within the first week of use. Inferior to all other bottle brush brands that I have used. Won't be buying again...	
1. 	I used these bottles on my baby, and now enjoy giving this BPA-free Playtex set to other moms. It's really a practical and appreciated baby shower gift. I'd definitely recommend this to a new mom or someone looking for a good gift for a new mom.	
- 1	A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	
- 1	I got this for my petite DIL who is pregnant and had existing back problems.We had heard that boppy body pillows provided good support.The pillow case is a thin fabric in an old-fashioned print, but is neutral and well made.The pillow itself is an odd design.  It is two nice fluffy pillows connected by a strange pillow-less section of fabric.  This floppy unstuffed portion of the body pillow is a mystery to us--what is it's purpose and why is it this way?The picture with the woman using the boppy on amazon shows a pillow that is stuffed all the way throughout, which provides SUPPORT throughout.I see from other reviews that other people received the same two-part pillow with the fabric void in the middle.As others have noted, the other challenge with this design is that it is cumbersome to flip over to your other side when you change positions (because of the floppy void in the middle).  The fact that it is a pain to change positions with is what caused DIL to quit using after one week and give to her dog :>(We're going to contact MFG and find out if we received defective product since photo shows a fully stuffed pillow.	
1. 	The only toilet lock I could find that works with toilet seats that are not flat however, my 2-year-old has opened it when she pulls hard enough.	
- 1	I really love the way these look. They are very cute. But they can only get one star since they don't stick to the wall :( I think the way they are packaged has meant that they come folded and curled and wont lay straight enough to stick.We put them up on Tuesday night. Pressed them down a second and third time. Yesterday my partner stuck a couple back and pressed them all against the wall again during the day, but by night a little S was missing (it seems a bit of a hazard that small sheets can end up on the floor) and as I nursed the baby at bedtime last night I could literally hear the letters pulling away from the wall, and another fell off. More down this morning.Most seem to be curling away from how they were folded in the packaging and some seem to stick fine (perhaps from the flat area). They should definitely be shipped in flat sheets instead. It's such a shame because they are so cute, but I will probably send them back, if I can.	
1. 	Much easier than swaddling, especially in the middle of the night.  My son loves it and sleeps much better when he's wearing it.  It has less give in it than the cotton one -- which apparently my son needs -- we tried the cotton one a few nights and then realized we got longer, more content sleep out of him if he used this one. Also works great for that transition to not swaddling by allowing you to wrap just one arm or swaddle loosely.	
1. 	Bought this with Amazon Prime days before Christmas and received just in the nick of time! Set up was super easy and fast and my son loves to sit in it, unlike his highchair we had him in before. Great!	
- 1	I am disappointed with this car seat. I haven't used another convertible car seat, but compared to how wonderful and easy to use our infant Chicco car seat is, I'm not liking this one. There are a few things in particular. First the &#34;recline&#34; function... We have it reclined as far as it will go, and in both my car(ford escape) and my husbands extended cab Chevy, our baby is sitting straight upright. Her head lolls forward when she's asleep in the car and she looks very uncomfortable. Also, there aren't any of those little pads on the straps, and the straps leave red marks on the sides of her neck. Lastly, the release button is very awkward to get at while using this seat rear facing. It is squished against the back of the car seat. I don't question the safety of this seat but I don't recommend it based on these reasons.	
1. 	No fuss, no muss.  It's basically a trash can.  It's no Diaper Decor but it absolutely does the job.  I also like that it has a little compartment on the lid for you to put a deodorizer disc.	
- 1	The problem with this monitor is that it doesn't hold a charge. I go to bed with a full charge at 100% and in the middle of the night I am awakened by the annoying beeping sound alerting me the battery is dying. I have a baby, I am awakened every night by him, why would i want to be woken up by this monitor TOO????  Why not keep the monitor in the charging unit? Because the manual says that if you consistently keep it on the charging unit, it will ware out the battery and limit battery life!!! Then I will have to buy a new battery. I have returned this item 3 times in case it was just defective and they were all like this. I finally had to buy a new monitor from another company who's monitor last 36 hours while in the sleep mode without being charged. Much happier!Other than that, I like the monitor but the charging issue was just a terrible.	
- 1	Extremely rough feel, even after washing.  Unsuitable for an infant's delicate skin.  Quality of product is inferior. I had to return it.	
- 1	Come on iplay....You go through all the trouble of making your green sprouts products BPA, metal, and chemical free and then you let China make it.  Resposibly made is not a concept that China understands.  What about producing it in the USA or Europe where standards are better. I can get a similar teether from Natursutten that is European made.  I will be returning yours and getting their's for just a few dollars more.  The money is worth it!	
1. 	I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend. They work as expected, no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts. I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair. During the daytime, this is not a problem.	
1. 	This is a great bath time toy - but I've not had any luck using the &#34;HOT&#34; indicator to reliably tell me anything. It always looks like it says hot, faintly. I assume the white would get brighter if the water was actually too hot?! Regardless, my almost 7 month old plays with this during bath time every single night. We sing &#34;rubber ducky&#34; and she splashes at the ducky and holds it and chews on it. It's a good size for her little hands.	
- 1	This thermometer consistently disappoints, and the last thing I want when my child is potentially running a fever is second guessing the results of a thermometer.  I ended up buying a simple rectal thermometer, and have used that with great success.  This one would say no probe was attached (when one was on), wouldn't register a reading, or would register a reading that was clearly wrong.  A huge disappointment for a relatively expensive thermometer.	
- 1	I bought these hoping to switch away from disposables but the second I leaked, it went directly through the pad to my shirt. No absorbancy at all. Don't waste your money.	
- 1	I have purchased several Bumkin waterproof bibs, one of them is the long sleeve one in yellow color. i must admit i purchased yellow robot one because it was cheaper than other colors, but when it arrived i realized that the quality is not the same as the sleeveless blue colored bibs i purchased earlier. material is rough, it feels cheap and almost scratchy. i regret not spending few more $ and purchasing a different color which i am assuming would have been a better quality product as well	
1. 	The size seems right - my 22 month old son holds it, and is able to put it in his mouth, but the bristles seem to be spraying out a bit from the limited use already, so I'm not sure how much longer it'll hold up. Seems well designed though, with a thicker handle. It's good that you get two - I pretend to use one while he uses the other since he has to have exactly what I have. Ofcouse, he ends up holding both at the same time as well.	
1. 	I love the color of this stroller and how it maneuvers and looks.  It's awesome.  I did buy the Joovy Rear seat though because for now I don't want my 2 year old on the sit n stand seat but wanted a real seat for him.  Later when he is a little older I can just remove the rear seat.  The only thing I do not like about this stroller is that there is no cup holder.  I bought the additional cup holder accessory, which was kind of pricey.  That is the only downside.	
- 1	We don't use this brush frequently, we mostly wash our bottles in the dishwasher.  Despite this the brush still broke at the next after 4 mos.  I knew it was coming because around 3 mos, the brush was already bent and wouldn't stay straight when you applied slight pressure.I would recommend a brush that does not have a twisted metal neck.  There are other brands out there that fit this description.	
1. 	This cotton sleep sack has been perfect during nights when it is too warm for our fleece sleep sack. Part of our routine at night is a bath and then putting on pj's and a sleep sack so I was glad to find this lighter one so we could continue our routine. My son is 10 months and around 20 pounds and the large size is nice and comfy for him. He has lots of room but doesn't get tangled in it and can stand when he wakes up (which he always does when he wakes up and calls out for me). The light blue color and cute dog pattern is adorable also. I would recommend this sleep sack as a great alternative to blankets (which we never use because of SIDS and the fact that he moves around so much I don't think a blanket would stay put anyways!).	
1. 	I read many reviews and decided that this was the best tub for my baby.  I have been quite pleased with it.  It comes with a hammock that securely clips onto four corners of the tub.  The hammock has a padded headrest and some mesh material for drainage and it is perfect for a newborn.  It washes up very nicely in the washing machine too.  When your newborn gets bigger and moves from hammock to tub, there are two different sides.  One has an incline and a pad for the back and the other side is vertical for when your baby sits up.  We are still using the inclince for our six-month old.  There is a spot for you to keep soap, shampoo and washcloths at the edge of the tub.  The tub is made to rest securely on the kitchen sink (it won't work with ours because we have three sinks with angled separations) and it has a drain plug at the bottom which will change from green to white if the water is too hot.There are only two minor problems I have with this tub.  Tub water goes down into two of the legs because they are hollow.  It is difficult to dry the bottom of these, and soap or dirt can build up.  I clean them out by putting a paper towel on the handle of a wooden spoon and wiping them.  The other problem is that the mat for our baby's back on the incline has slipped.Our baby is getting too big for the tub now (he's 30 inches) and he is starting to sit up well, so we will move him the regular bathtub soon.	
1. 	These are great because they are waterproof, don't stain easily, and are easy to get on and off.  I love the colors and I love that they are plain bibs.  They are fairly absorbent.  The only thing that is bad is that my dryer tends to melt the inside layer and then they are misshapen and I have to throw them away.  Not dryer safe on high heat!I have two sets and they are my favorites.	
- 1	When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.	
- 1	I'm really upset about the quality of this bag.  We purchased it to keep our Chicco Keyfit Carseat safe during a flight from Seattle to California.  After the first flight, we found a large rip near the handle (almost 6 inches long).  We've had to repair the bag with duct tape in order for it to be usable.I know this is the cheapest option out there for carseat travel bags, but I would caution others not to get this product.	
1. 	I use these in the morning with the first feeding because I leak on whatever side my daughter is not nursing from.  I use them more so the milk doesn't go to waste than to protect my clothing.  If I used them for protection of clothing or for sore nipples I would not have rated them as high as I did.  First, they are not made for really large breasts.  They set nicely over the nipple, but certainly do not cover much more than the areola area.  If I were to wear these out, my breasts would look like large mushrooms.  They are nice in the privacy of my own home, though.  The shell that fits on the breast is comfortable.  It is easy to clean and soft.  I would recommend these for the use of collecting leaking milk while pumping and feeding only.  I would not recommend these to wear out when you are going to miss a feeding and know you will leak.  Wear disposable pads.  Also, I wouldn't recommend them for the sore nipple problem either if you are large breasted.	
1. 	These are a must have for potty training mommies.  Keep them in your purse, glove box, change of clothes bag, desk drawer, etc.  They put your mind at ease when creating a germ-proof barrier between body and filthy toilet seats.  The four star rating is due to the difficulty in QUICKLY removing the adhesive strips. This takes some time which sometimes lead to accidents with an urgent toddler.P.S. Great for adults too...in case, one day you really need to sit! (smile)	
- 1	This is not worth your money you cannot tie the ends down. You can only strap around the headrest  in newer cars.	
1. 	Haven't used these yet because I haven't had the baby but looking forward to it!!! I can buy them cheaper somewhere else but still good product it seems like!!	
1. 	Got this for my 11 month old since our new house at bar counter tops. He loves this over his high chair because he can watch me in the kitchen better and feels like a big boy. We are using it for all meals now.My only negative is the fact the under arm supports are so long that there is a big gap between the chair and counter causing lots of food to fall to the floor. So I bought a summer infant tiny diner mat and completely solved the issue. It doesn't suction cup over the bars but I put it on the counter first with the caddy over it. This way the mat is definitely not going anywhere and the caddy still fits perfect. Then the food falls into the trough of the mat instead of the floor.	
- 1	This is a good idea for a teether since it's basically a bumpy pacifier that's easy to chew. However my son hated it. The actual raspberry part is way too big for a baby's mouth. We tried it a couple of times and he never took to it. Also, like many other reviewers, I wasn't too comfortable with the fact that the berry part seems to be glued on, posing a choking hazard. Overall not worth buying for us.	
1. 	My triplets, who are very different, loved these when they were babies. We didn't have the entire set but did have most of the items. This brand and these items are durable, bright colored, fun, wonderful toys so learn with and have loads of fun!	
- 1	I put my 6 month old in this and while she loved jumping and spinning in it, the bucket is so wide and she leans so far forward her head nearly smacked both door frames if I hadn't been sticking my hand up to block her! I didn't feel it was really all that jumpy, either, and the spring made an annoying sound. I'll be returning this for one that has a smaller seat area and a tray or a bumper to keep her from hitting her head. It was also tricky to get her into it, as well.  I don't recommend this at all.	
- 1	Seems very padded and safe, however compared to my other car seat the Dino Radian RXT, at least for my daughter, is much more uncomfortable and difficult to snap in.  The slots for the straps can be very uncomfortable when your child gets to be certain heights.  Also the straps often get twisted making it difficult to strap in your child, especially if they are getting fussy due to discomfort.  Is also quite wide, much more than the Dino Radian RXT (though that one does not have as much padding, it is a heck of a lot heavier, likely due to more metal in its framing).	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	
1. 	I love these bottles. I have been using them for about 2 months now. I breastfeed my daughter, but she has also had expressed breast milk in a bottle from the beginning as well. I tried the playtex nursers and she had a lot of gas. Then I tried the NUK bottles and she did well. She had less gas. I even tried the Playtex nursers with the orthodonic nipple. In the end I went through about 6 diffrent types of bottles. One of my big fears was that she would not want nurse anymore and want just the bottle. Then I found these bottles. I could not find them locally so I had to order them. I did eventually find them at Babies R Us. My daughter laches right on to these bottles.I have had no problems with gas with these bottles. On the box it recommends to only use the stage 1 nipples when you breast feed, but when I bottle fed her it would take her 45 minutes, so I did buy the stage 2 nipples and now she can finish a bottle when she is really hungry in 15-20 min. This is about the same time she nurses and I have not had a prob with her not wanting to nurse. She still perfers to nurse. The stage 2 nipples do drip a little bit into her mouth w/o her sucking which the stage 1 nipples did not do. Overall they are great they are easy to clean even though there is an extra part to clean.	
1. 	This is an good product, little loose for medela 5oz & 8oz bottles that we have. They almost dont fit the nipple rings of the medela bottles the nipples come out of the ring when my son handles them a little rough and all the milk starts pouring out. We had to use these nipples with Enfamil Nipple Rings/CapsEnfamil Slow Flow Soft Nipple, 12-Countthe only down side is these caps dont take or have any caps.But there is one big advantage of these nipples, which is they dont get stuck like other nipples. My baby is used to pinching on the nipple hard, other nipples get stuck due to vacuum and milk doesn't pass. This one doesn't get stuck because of the tooth inside the nipple. I wish it fit the medela bottle a little better. It is said to be good for colic babies not sure how exactly that works.I would recommend this if your kid has the same problem as mine. The only thing is that you have to be sure that it fits you bottle these are the standard ones. I think one good test is if the free standard nipples that come with those ready to feed Similac bottlesSimilac Advance Newborn, Ready to Feed, 2-Fluid Ounces (Pack of 48) (Packaging May Vary)or above mentioned enfamil nipples fit you bottles then these will fit your bottles as well.	
- 1	I bought this mat in the store for $6 I think. It's cute and really comfortable, but it's too easy to grow mold and mildew. I've been extremely diligent to dry it off after every use because I'm paranoid about bathroom mold, and it's covered. I tried scrubbing, bleaching, and machine washing to no avail. We only had it about 3 or 4 months before we noticed it. Buy something else, or you're going to be replacing this one every few months.	
- 1	This valve did not work on my medela breast pump (i have the dual pump).  i didn't return it because i was going to have to buy as much for the shipping as i did for the pump.  don't buy here.  just go to a brick and mortar store (like target) to purchase.  it's not amazon's fault... it's the supplier's issue.	
1. 	I love this bag.  Have not had any problems with zippers, it frees up my hands and it sits comfortable on the shoulder.  My husband likes it too, as it is not too childish.  It has lots of space, for extra set of clothes, 6 or so diapers, blanket, burp cloth, bottles, bib, etc.  We also have the larger messenger style for longer trips, it is great too.	
1. 	I used these with evenflo and medela bottles for storing and freezing pumped breastmilk.  They worked great!  I recommend for pumping and storage.	
1. 	This seat is much better than the &quot;multi-use bathing cushion&quot;. It's a lot easier to pull baby out of the tub, at a higher height, sitting comfortably, as opposed to being on your knees.  You can adjust the height, and there's no strain on your back or knees! It's a bit bulky in our small bathroom, but it's worth it.	
1. 	I, like MANY other people, couldn't decide between the Diaper Champ, or the more popular Diaper Genie. Well, I was sold on not having to buy special bags, so the Diaper Champ it was! I'm soooo glad I went with it! I haven't had ANY odor problem, and if the handle gets stuck, that's an indication that it's full...so just change the bag!Don't be swayed by the negative reviews here. This is an excellent product. I've had mine for almost a year now...it sits right in between my sons crib and changing table. I change the bag about once every 5-6 days, and it couldn't be easier. I definitely recommend!	
- 1	For baby carrier, all i can say is that you get what you pay for.I am just like any other mothers out there who is always scouting for cheap and good deals. I come across this carrier on amazon while I was in search for a good carrier for my newborn. I have heard good things about the popular Ergo baby carrier but being a student (mom), I have to live on a budget. I cannot afford a $100 sling (or so i thought). I was super elated when I found this Infantino Baby carrier for a fraction of the price and with moderately good reviews too. I purchased it without second thought.However, I have to say that the baby carrier served me well up until now, where my newborn baby is not so much a newborn anymore. She is a 7mth old baby weighing 17lbs. We were still using the infantino carrier for a stroll or grocery run in Walmart. We didnt think much of it until my husband keeps complaining of back pains. We realized that the carrier is actually hurting our back so much that we have constant back pain the next day after carrying our baby for more than 30 mins.My advise is that if you are looking for carrier for a baby who is less than 15 lbs, this maybe a good buy. But if you are looking long term (as in back pain surgery in 10 years time..) then it is more worth it to spend that $100 and save on the surgery in the future. We are purchasing our first ERGO baby carrier today and welcoming our way to a happier baby, and happier mummy and daddy.	
1. 	After a less than stellar experience with my son's infant seat, I really researched his convertible seat. This one is the only one that consistently performs in safety tests. This compnay makes airplane safety products too and is the #1 maker of safety seats around the world!! Yes, the price is a little high, but totally worth it. I feel very secure when my son is in this seat in my car and I love that it can be tethered to the cars structure for extra support. I always had trouble getting other seats tight enough in the car, but not this one. It is very easy to install and my next baby will have the new Britax infant seat.	
- 1	My husband and I bought 2 jumperoos - one by Baby Einstein and one called Luv U Zoo by Fisher-Price. We have about %95 of our baby's toys made by Fisher Price, so we thought we would for sure like it. We were wrong...The 2 good things about this jumperoo that Baby Einstein is lacking in, are these 2 features:1. The Fisher Price jumperoo has a motion activated music, with the option to leave the music playing for up to 20 minutes. Baby Einstein works only when pressed on the piano's keys (plays cute classic music but for only 10-15 seconds,or you can select it to say colors and shapes in 3 different languages)2. Fisher Price has a rest area for the arms on the swivel seat, which is great for younger babies.Although with the Baby Einstein's jumperoo the assembly took longer, the base was A LOT (!!!!!) more sturdy and didn't giggle from side to side at all. Fisher Price was so wobbly, it truly felt like a safety hazard to put our baby in it. The wobbly part was the 2 arms on the sides, it felt like it could snap off the base.This Fisher price jumperoo was so disappointing, we returned it the very next day.	
- 1	I already have a bottle drying rack, but I needed something else that would hold spoons, forks, and straws upright. I initially wanted the OXO Tot dishrack, because I thought this grass was weird-looking, and a bit pricey for such small dimensions, but I had to have something that was BPA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free. And Dishwasher-safe... OK, so I put it in the dishwasher--in the top rack, on mild wash setting, mind you--to sanitize it before I put my clean baby items in it.  And the grass came out warped! The grass no longer sits flat in the tray.  The corners are bowed. My dishwasher is only a few months old, and has never ruined any of my other dishware.  So, it's totally this product--Read: Made In China. Well, the baby items still went in and stayed upright to dry. Which is the only reason I gave a second star.  But, what a disappointment that the grass sits awkwardly now, after just the first wash! I would not recommend this at all.	
1. 	I purchased several different types of anti tip furniture straps, this was the most expensive, but seemed very sturdy.  I used both straps for a very large piece of furniture.	
- 1	I, thankfully, tested this product with my 9 month old BEFORE putting food in it and he was able to lift up the bowl within a minute. Nice idea but doesn't work.	
1. 	Allows our crawler to see through but not climb.The latches require you to push the plastic tab beside them.  This was hard to tell from the instructions.The top and bottom side feet extend to keep it closed, but the bottom one does not always retract fully when opening.  But the handle opens easier than another gate type that we have, so it's better overall, though could be better.I would buy it again.	
1. 	I was so pleasantly surprised by this baby mill! Here's some reasons why I love it:* It's small enough I keep it right on my countertop to blend up any fruits, veggies, or meals we're having.* The two cup bowl, blades and lid are all dishwasher safe!* It is so easy to use! Just place the lid on, lock it in place, put the motor on top and press down. You can pulse the food or keep pressing down to the desired consistency you'd like.* The price is pretty hard to beat, particularly since other more expensive baby mills don't seem to do as great a job.I really love this baby mill and am so glad I purchased it!	
- 1	I bought 4 separate bassinet sheets by separate manufacturers all for 30in long mattresses. My advice to readers is to buy 32in instead. The 30in ones all had problems fitting on 30in mattresses (the mattress ends up curling because the fit is too tight). This one's one of the poorer fitting ones of those 4.  Your mileage may vary if you are using it in a pack and play because then you don't have the height.  I'm using changing table mattresses so they have 1-2 inches in height.	
1. 	We now own two of these in the same color for our boys.  Easy to transport, packs up nicely and easy to clean.  Overall a great product and highly recommended.	
1. 	This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training.  It's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks.  It's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off.	
1. 	I don't know what I'd do without the Snugli.  Baby has ridden very comfortably in it since we came home from the hospital- he's now 4 months and 17 pounds and it works better than ever.  We've used the facing in and out positions, but have not yet tried out the backpack style, so I can't speak to that.  My son always slept soundly when riding in the facing in position.  Now he loves facing out so he can see everything around him.The waist and back bands do a lot to help support the baby's weight evenly, and I've never had trouble with back ache or strain as long as I have adjusted the straps correctly (I've needed to move them a couple of times as he's grown).  Initially it was a little awkward to get all the buckles and snaps figured out, but after a couple practice runs I had no difficulty at all.  The instruction manual was clear and helpful.  Also important- the Snugli is machine washable and has laundered remarkably well.I'd have given 5 stars except that the carrier has proved a bit too small for practical use by my 6'4 husband.  Even with the straps let out and adjusted to the biggest size it doesn't quite cut it.	
- 1	I thought the ELITE would be better than the current straight up Diaper Genie we have used for a year and a half with our first born but no sir-ie! The seal just isn't there and it stinks up the room with just one diaper inside. The regular diaper genie has been GREAT and I wish I woulda stuck to what I knew instead of thinking of &#34;upgrading&#34; to the elite. I	
- 1	I absolutely hate it.  I have used the original and new Boppy Nursing Pillows as well as the Mombo Nursing Pillow and this pillow cover is the most horrid I've felt.  It's like they chose the cheapest quality cotton to make this cover out of.  I've bought cheap cotton bandanas at the dollar store which were softer than this material.  True, it gets softer after a wash - but not soft enough....and you'd have to wash it a lot.  Then it shrinks.  It's just completely unacceptable.  When was nursing my newborn, skin to skin is very important so my infant and I are topless.  Then the nursing pillow is right up against your bare belly and the baby is laying on top of it.  Your breasts are in contact with the pillow too.  This is a time for softness and cuddles, plus, you'll be spending hours upon hours like this - you want the softest, most comfortable pillow possible!  The Boppy pillow uses cotton and that one is softer than this.  I just can say enough how completely put off with the feel of this fabric.  I do NOT recommend.	
1. 	Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.	
1. 	I am so happy I thought to look on Amazon for bibs rather than paying a lot more for less quality at Target, Babies-R-Us, or Wal-Mart.  These bibs are wonderful for my little drooly guy.  They're sized for 3-12 month old babies--and fit my chubby 7 month old fine.  There is a waterproof layer sandwiched between two thin layers of terry cloth.  That thin layer is all I've needed to stop the horrible drool-rash my little guy was getting on his chest.I do still need to change them when they get soaking wet--but they do the job for much longer than the other bibs I've used.The colors are great--and match a lot of the colors I typically see in baby boy outfits.Velcro closures and PVC and Phthalate free!  Length is to just above my 7  month old's belly button.Can't be beat.  Highly highly recommended.	
- 1	I bought this unit with high hopes.  I did a lot of looking and research and thought this was a reasonable choice.  Since I have had the unit it has gone through three power supplies.  The company will send out a new supply but they are located in California while I am on the East coast, so it takes a few days to get somebody from the company to talk to you, then a couple of days for them to ship the item, then a week or so traveling through the mail.  So for almost two weeks you are stuck without the unit and not able to use it!  This has happened three times now.  I thought I was being smart and actually purchased a back up power supply for the next time.  Well the next time happened last night, so I plugged in my back up supply and it doesn't work.  So now I'm thinking maybe this time it's the unit itself that has stopped working.  Unless I got a bad power supply when I ordered the back up.  I guess I should have checked it out and not assumed anything.  So now I'm waiting for them to call me back and start this entire process over again but in the meantime I don't have a working monitor for my daughter.  I would look at another company.  I know as soon as I can afford to buy another one I will be moving on to one of the other ones.	
1. 	These are so cute and my grand-daughter loves them.  She lines them up on the counter and talks to them.	
1. 	I'm glad customers have a chance to review these items. Before registering for any baby products, I read every review. The reviews prompted me to either buy or not buy an item. So I feel it just as important for me to review this item as well and let you know what I thought about it....This bottle is perfect for my newborn! It's very true that the shape of the bottle nipple is very close to a women's breast. I am both breast feeding and bottle feeding. My daughter who is only two weeks, does not have any nipple confusion. She takes the bottle without any problems. Also, the 4oz bottle size is perfect for newborns - not too big and not too small.	
1. 	I really like this sheet!  It keeps the rest of my son's crib sheets dry, so easy to take off and clean. I have two so I just wash one and use the other.  Especially great for those nighttime leaks when you just need to change baby and the sheet and get back to bed!	
1. 	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.	
1. 	My daughter loves this bib.  It is of adequate size to prevent food from getting onto her shoulders when she turns her head from side to side during a feeding.  She also really likes the teether.  I've had two of these for several months now, they are constantly in the washer and so far, have held up really well.  Only thing is, the packaging says nothing about BPA free plastic on the teether part.  However, when I purchased mine, the sight claimed they were BPA free.  I haven't let it bother me too much because she chews on most of her toys and only a few of them claim to be made of BPA free plastic.  Give these a try if your child has trouble hanging on to her teether.  This one is guaranteed never to hit the floor because its fastened to the bib itself.	
1. 	Holds adult weight.  Terrific value.  We purchased organic mattresses to go along with it.  It matches the DaVinici mini crib.	
- 1	Easy buckle harness in the front. How about the back?? Terrible hand-tie design is clumsy and time-consuming and does not fit tall backed chairs (which we have at home: 35h). I can understand a 1-size fits most issue; however, I do hope they revise this design with buckles on both the front AND back. Time saving features for parents are a MUST. I give it 2 stars for modern fabric choices. I returned this item.Also see my reviews for the BambinOZ travel chair (my final pick) and Snazzy Baby travel chair.	
- 1	Battery case must be removed with tiny screwdrviver, lots of patience, and the aide of gravity. hold the toy right side up and undo the screws using the screwdriver upsidedown. Add 3 AAA batteries! It looks like you only need two batteries.  Very akward toy. The batteries won't fall out as it might seem they would. 6 has a fountain children adore. More money yes but so worth it, especially in comparison.	
1. 	Love these! Thank you....It's a universal color. Wish I would have bought these for my daughter when she was an infant. They aren't took bulky, easy to wash (I throw them in a pillow case in the washer) and they're easy to put on and take off. :)	
1. 	Only reason haven't given it 5 stars is baby is not born / hasn't worn it yet, so I'm not sure how it will hold up.  But it definitely seems to be well made, substantial fabric (cotton/acrylic blend) and nice and soft. The pink color is pretty accurate to the photo, maybe a shade deeper, not quite as pale, but close.  Can't wait for baby girl to wear it.	
- 1	I wanted a cover that would protect my son from touching the germy shopping carts.  This cover was nice, however, it was bulky with the side pillows, and didn't cover the sides.  I'm much happier with the Infantino cover and recommend it over this one.	
1. 	Don't read negative or positive reviews. Just TRY this bottle. Just get 1 bottle at the store and see if it works for you. Try different nipple. Just find what works for you. Thats it.It's different for different babies...We tried Dr. Browns, Playtex wide nipple nurser and then Ventair. The Stage 1 nipple was too slow and my baby would suck for 30 min and only get half an once out of 6 oz! But then I got the Stage 2 nipple and it works great! It says Fast flow but I would say it is medium. My baby chokes often when she drinks from Dr Browns.. She never choked drinking from the Ventair.	
1. 	Really love this bundleme. The color is beautiful, and fit our red stroller very good. It helps me very much, after i got this, I can take my baby out everyday in the winter. Useful and good item.	
1. 	THIS THERMOMETER IS QUICK AND ACCURATE.  IT IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY.	
- 1	This is a cute idea, but the execution and overall usefulness leave much to be desired.  My daughter purchased this when her son was transitioning from his infant bathtub to an inflatible tub that would fit in the regular bathtub.  She thought this shower spray would help with the bathing process and that it was cute.  Although difficult to attach to the faucet, the Sassy did fit onto the 20 year old fixture and did not leak.  The spray was not forceful which was a positive as her son got used to being bathed in the big tub.Unfortunately, that tub in which the Sassy was being used was the one in the guest bathroom.  Thus, whenever she has guests the Sassy Shower Spray must be removed from the faucet or the pressure from the main shower head would blow it off the faucet and cause damage to the Sassy.  Additionally, there is the question of durability since the Sassy must be removed and put back onto the faucet repeatedly.  It is plastic and does not feel particularly sturdy.I would suggest purchasing one of the hand-held shower heads on Amazon rather than the Sassy Shower Spray.  Those products are of higher quality construction, do not require removal for someone other than the baby or child's usage, and provide greater value for the consumer.  However, if your infant or small child is the only person using a particular bathtub or if you need something to fill an Amazon order so that you get free shipping, this might be something you consider.  Otherwise, there are much better products on the market.	
- 1	This is a waste of money. It makes an awful buzzing sound like the motor is broken and it is very slow and soft. I would not buy this ever again and would have returned it if my husband had not tossed the package on me!	
- 1	I should have listened to all the other reviews about this product. I read them and thought, &#34;eh, how hard can it be to watch it and make sure it doesn't get too hot&#34;. Well, when you are sleep deprived and it's the middle of the night and you fall back to sleep the answer is HARD.  There is no signal that the bottle is ready you have to just keep checking it. Hate this bottle warmer with a passion.	
1. 	I love the baby trends line and this clock matches perfectly.  I got the brown and blue clock. The ticking may be loud to some in other reviews, but to me it sounds like a normal hands clock and it doesn't seem to bother my son.  Before bed he starred at it for a few minutes, due to the new ticking sound and then went to bed like normal.  Mine came with all three hands (some said there's didn't come with a seconds hand). Packaged very well for shipping, no issues getting it out.	
- 1	Bought this based on all the good reviews.  Live in a large single family home, no phone or electromagnetic signals except for cell phones which are kept far from the monitor and receiver, yet for whatever reason the receiver will make crackle noises at regular intervals while on.  These are so loud they can be heard upstairs in the baby's room.  Can't turn the volume down or we wouldn't hear the baby.  HATE this thing.	
1. 	We used this carrier recently on baby's first trip via airplane. It was great carrying him around in the airport and having my hands free for luggage and other stuff. The carrier is sturdy and comfortable. I was able to sit on the plane with him strapped in asleep, which was nice. We used the carrier with him facing him forward as well. The nice bonus with this carrier, and I suspect with other carriers, too, is that you don't have to take him out of it when you go through the metal detector at the airport security gate, since the carrier has no metal parts. This is especially wonderful if your baby is already asleep and you don't want to disturb him/her just to get through security.The only downside with the carrier that we've found is that it's pretty difficult to adjust it for various baby sizes. The carrier did not hurt my back at all, and I'm fairly petite with an average-size baby.	
- 1	I was surprised to find how disfunctional this bib is after reading all these reviews and purchasing. Unfortunately my son does not like wearing it, I think it irritates his neck. Also, it doesn't seem to catch any food. The front part of this bib is somewhat molded inward (not sure if it was from the packaging or what) so it doesn't catch anything. On top of that, when he moves forward in his highchair it presses on his tray and is really useless. We're going to try a different kind.	
- 1	NO I would not recommend this at all to any one with a baby the TEETHER part is poorly made and it's just cheap feeling was very dissapointed!!! To say the least ! KC and can not reccommend as a shower gift or a baby rattle of good quality sorely dissapointed. KC	
- 1	My newborn loved the vibrations created from this. The only disappointing factor is that it is battery operated. Perhaps these manufacturers make these items battery operated for safety reasons, but too many items as battery operated, making the cost of these types of items that much higher. We have a Fisher Price Pappasan, and the thing takes 4 C batteries, and it eats through them like nothing. Have you seen the price of an 8 pack of C cell batteries? In the past 4 months we've spent around $30 on batteries for this vibration pad, and about $100 on batteries for the Pappasan. Make sure when you buy an item like this that you don't mind the extra expense of batteries. Oh, and this device eats through batteries.	
1. 	Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly	
- 1	I returned them because they didn't cling onto the window smoothly. They had lots of air bubbles that wouldn't come out and it just looked so tacky.	
1. 	This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.	
- 1	might work, but my baby didn't accept any pacifier at all! I also tried a Avent model, but she didn't accepted too.	
1. 	I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles. It is fast and easy and I can't imagine going back to boiling bottles again. A must have for working moms.	
- 1	The top of this mat is so soft it's almost silky.  When we leave it on the floor in its spot, it is a hazard for anyone walking by - adults as well as my 1 year old baby.	
1. 	I am a breastfeeding mom who pumps three times a day at work to have milk to bring to the daycare provider.  I ordered two sets of these to add to the two that come with my pump (6 total), as well as extra membranes, valves and shields so that I can pump and then throw the parts in a baggie each time I use them to be cleaned and sterilized later - saves me time from having to either wash parts in the sink at work or from using the expensive wipes you can use without soap and water.  Has worked great and been a huge benefit to me as a frequent pumper!!	
- 1	The picture of this gate makes it seem as if it would be easy to get by it using one hand to open and close it.  Not true.  We are very disappointed.  You can't step over it and you can't open it with one hand with a baby in your arms.  It is only good for an opening that you don't need to get past easily.  But if you put it at the top of your stairs and you're trying to get down the stairs with a child in one arm and one free arm, it is useless.  I do not recommend it and can't figure out why it got such good ratings.	
- 1	I tried this on my Britax car seat. Here are the issues:- Its hard to put on while holding an infant- We live in the South and it does not deflect the heat, in fact I feel like it makes the seat hotter than without-It feels cheaply made	
1. 	We've tried many types of bibs, and these are our favorite. They are flexible, so they can fit behind any highchair tray without bunching up (unlike plastic Baby Bjorn bibs, for example). They are easy to clean, and generally a simple rinse will do. They hold up nicely -- we have some similar bibs that are made from waterproofed canvas that seem to become increasingly warped the more we wash them. They come in many patterns that are pretty unisex, so we can get more than one child's worth of use out of them. Lastly, they are fun and pretty and there are tons of options for patterns. Our daughter actually likes them because they have cheerful patterns, and that's saying a lot since she prefers to go bibless most of the time.Pros: Flexible material, easy to clean, durable, cheerful patterns, fun unisex optionsCons: I can't think of any... seriously!	
1. 	These cups are very cheap and work good. After my 20 mon son chew up so many soft spout sippy cups, I decide use this one. It works great, no leak and last longer, but spout also soft enough for him to bite down. Wish it come with more cap than just one.	
1. 	I love the color of this stroller and how it maneuvers and looks.  It's awesome.  I did buy the Joovy Rear seat though because for now I don't want my 2 year old on the sit n stand seat but wanted a real seat for him.  Later when he is a little older I can just remove the rear seat.  The only thing I do not like about this stroller is that there is no cup holder.  I bought the additional cup holder accessory, which was kind of pricey.  That is the only downside.	
1. 	Why lug a huge travel system around if you don't have to? This little product works like a charm, takes up a LOT less space than a full-sized stroller, and is a small fraction of the price that a full travel system will cost you!It worked perfectly for me for the first year. I loved it and used it nearly daily with no problems whatsoever. It also has a very decent amount of space for items in it's basket. It actually has more room down there than the full-size stroller I got when my son outgrew his infant carseat. I'm also very tall, and this has a wonderfully adjustable height, unlike the compact umbrella stroller I have, although this one is almost as compact.The only problem I foresee for anyone is if they like to run. This stroller would be difficult if you went out for a jog with it, because you would surely end up kicking it. But, for normal use, it's perfect!	
1. 	Most of the places I looked charge $20 just for the shields.  You get the bottles and the steam bags with it for $5 more.  It is a no brainer to spend the extra $.  The steam bags are wonderful!!!  I can sterilize everything in 1 minute and 30 seconds.  I have a 1.5 kw or 1500 watt microwave.  It is soooooo much easier than having to boil every thing.	
- 1	I've had 3 other monitors, and this is by far the worst. And the others were even less expensive, so you can't say it's good for the price. There is always a loud static sound, no matter where you are, and the 'out of range' beeping is super annoying and went off when I was in the next room! How is that out of range? This monitor is definitely being returned asap.	
1. 	I was a little hesitant to spend so much on a pillow that I couldn't first try out. However, after reading all the reviews (and spending many sleepless nights rearranging my body pillow and multiple other pillows), I decided to go for it. It has been worth every penny. I wish that I'd discovered this pillow years ago--it's helped with my ongoing back pain. It not only supports my back, but also my growing belly and aching legs. It's not too flat nor too fluffy--it's truly perfect. I take it with me on road trips because I really can't sleep without it. I only wish there was a way to cram it in my suitcase on flights.	
- 1	The spoon tip turns white if the food could be described as anything warmer than luke warm. For beginner babies that is an appropriate temperature. However, because the spoon is so sensitive, we ended up feeling it with our hands every time anyway.	
1. 	The breast pads are soft and they absorb well.  I still leak through the pads when my breasts are VERY engorged (but I think that would occur with any similar product).	
1. 	and bought a diaper trash system.  As a first time mom, I was pretty naive.  I don't wanna waste money on THAT.  I'll just throw away the baby diaper trash every day.  As a matter of fact, I threw it away TWICE a day and the trash still reeked of a horrific stench, courtesy of poop my daughter generously expelled as a result of her growing and adventurous appetite for solid foods.  Just being in the vicinity of one poopy diaper caused gag reflexes.  So I purchased this one (off Craiglist for $10 bucks with extra refill) and since then, I am in heaven.  The bag holds plenty of diapers so that I don't have to throw it away daily.  Maybe every 3-4 days?  And the stench?  Completely gone.  I throw in a lot of soiled diapers AND keep the pail in the baby room and still no smell.  Previously, I left the garbage pail OUTSIDE the room.  The pail is easy to use and I dont have a problem with using it.  Of course I have yet to see how many days one re-fill will last and they do seem pretty expensive (hence the 4 star rating instead of 5), but its worth not having a wave of stinky poop violate my nose.  So Little Munchkin...hit me with your best POOP!!!	
- 1	We installed this on our 32 Samsung in July 2012. My husband said the installation was straight forward and easy. We were very happy with the product and I'm pretty sure it stopped our TV from falling over a few times.In August 2013 we moved to a new house and when we went to move the TV we found one of the plastic connectors had snapped in half and the strap was no longer connected to the back of the entertainment center. Needless to say we are unimpressed and are looking for another strap kit.	
- 1	I got this as a Christmas present for my then 2 month old. He is now almost a year and we have played with this thing maybe twice. Literally. It's kinda annoying. We bought a leap frog dog that's awesome and we play with that more. I was looking for extra Christmas presents to buy and thought this would do. It's much smaller than expected. Maybe it would work great for some people, but if I had the choice to do it again, I wouldn't buy it.	
1. 	Never feel left out of the kangaroo cosplay crowd again!  You have no idea how embarrassing it is to walk into a room of kangaroos with a baby in your arms. Problem solved.	
- 1	For some reason my 2 month old hates it :( Wish he liked it as he has a small flat spot... It's now collecting dust unfortunately. And secondly, the company says not to use it in the crib which is exactly where I wanted to use it, so had he liked it, I wouldn't have been able to use in the crib (Of course I could do whatever I wanted but I would never risk anything )	
1. 	My son loves this. He stares at the fish for as long as we leave him in it. It has a lot of different sound options as well as lights, moving mobile, etc. so you can mix it up and baby doesn't get bored. Also he seems comfy because he is always sleeping in it.The only thing that worries me is that if you have it on some of the higher speeds, and even the lower ones now that he is bigger the swing has a lot of movement at the legs. It sometimes looks like its going to tip. So I keep a very close watch when he is in it.	
- 1	The pillow seems like it would be comfortable, but I wouldn't know because I never used it. Once I took it out of the package, I noticed an overpowering chemically odor. I realize my sense of smell is heightened with pregnancy, but the odor reminded me of the smell of just-varnished floors, a smell I came across pre-pregnancy as I looked for low-VOC hardwood stain and topcoat products. This makes sense, because the tag on the pillow lists the foam insert as being made of 100% polyurethane. Yes, polyurethane is also used as the clear topcoat on floors and is known to emit toxic fumes in both its liquid and foam forms.While I didn't have time to look extensively into the science of PU emissions, a quick search came up with this statement from a seemingly reliable source: the levels of PBDEs in polyurethane foam pillows are among the highest in your house and the direct exposure can lead to liver damage and affect thyroid function. Further investigation wasn't necessary to decide that the pillow had to go back - the odor was repellant enough.Also, the cotton cover is low quality, fairly flimsy and rough. The weave definitely didn't contain the odor/fumes.	
- 1	I ordered this for my 2nd baby. I thought this would work very nice for a new born.Installing was already pretty difficult and the quality of the materials is poor. It is not sturdy.The music is not suitable for a newborn. It is not soothing and soft.The quality is so poor of this rocker. After installing it, I just did not want to uninstall it, put it back in the box and return it.Don't buy this, look further for something else. Especially for the money. This is way too expensive for what it is worth	
- 1	I cant even explain to you how upset I was with this product. It kept falling off the wall in the bathroom.And this is kind of a purpose of it, no?	
1. 	Safe your money buying cheap bibs and buy this one. It saved us a lot of baby clothes from being ruined. Too bad we didn't have it from the beginning. It covers baby very well, cleans easy, almost doesn't get stained and a pocket catches all miss mouth food.	
1. 	MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE TASTE AND THE BRUSH ON HER GUMS VERY CUTE AND GOOD PRICE WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHER MOMS.	
1. 	I used the sling for a tiny bit, but found that the seat holds the baby in place quite well.  When he could sit up on his own, I just let him sit in the bottom portion of the tub, where he could splash and play.  We didn't really use the toys, but the tub itself is perfect.  Later we got a tub from IKEA, which he loved until we let him go free in the big tub, but we loved this one while we used it.  We had a cheaper tub for the first month or so, and he was constantly sliding down the seat into the water, and freaking out.  As soon as we got this, he loved taking a bath.	
1. 	These work so well. I constantly get compliments on them from everyone when we go out to eat--and when people come over. My daughter is now 20 months and she'll keep them on during most of her meal, but it is the first thing to go once she's almost done. The food that falls into the bib, most of the time, isn't wasted, as she picks it out and eats it. They're awesome. So glad we have them!	
- 1	I read hundreds and hundreds of reviews about this product, 99% of them raving about how great it is.  It was NOT great for us.  Now, I did already spend the first several weeks of my young son's life using the blue suction bulb the hospital sends home with you, which he hated.  So he was probably already jaded about having his nose suctioned.  But he was so congested and miserable, it had to be done.  After reading the reviews about how other babies LOVE this aspirator and how much better than the blue bulb it was, etc etc, I was very hopeful it would make his colds so much better for him.  My husband and I have tried this aspirator at least 10 times now, changing variables each time.  We'd hold one side closed while suctioning the other side, we'd leave both sides open, we used a humidifier all night and try suctioning in the morning, we tried sitting in a steam shower bathroom and then suctioning, we tried using saline drops first, we tried not using saline first, we tried everything we could think to make it more productive and useful.  Only once did I get a small booger out, which was already sitting just inside his nostrils.  He screams and cries as soon as we touch his nose with it.  It's not any better than the blue bulb, sadly.  My son was about 2 months old when we tried it, and he's just over 3 months now, just to give a time frame on how old he was.  The item itself was exactly as described, in perfect condition.  No problems with that.  It seems to be of adequate quality, just not what I'd hoped as far as baby reaction and results.	
- 1	We purchased these lap pads to use under our bassinet sheet for any accidents.  They are SO small that you'd have to use all 3 to really cover a decent area.  Even if there was an accident, the material was not at all absorbant, in our opinion.  We have yet to find a use for them.	
- 1	This temperature reading on this camera is about 3 to 4 degrees higher than the temperature actually is in the room.	
- 1	Impossible to fillImpossible to secure coverNightmare to cleanOverpricedRidiculous productReturned for a refundAmazon has awesome customer service and refund policies but stay away from this product	
- 1	Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.	
1. 	i was not fully awake (caring for a newborn and all) when i ordered these and thought i was ordering extra breast cushions for my pump (which would be nice) so clearly i did not read carefully and was surprised by what i got. However, i am thrilled because i also was looking for something like this (a different name was recommended) and these work great. when i pump or nurse i leak on the other side. When nursing i would soak myself and my daughter and pumping was not much better, at least my little girl wouldn't be soaked. :-) using these i typically catch an ounce in them which is worth so much to me. my daughter doesn't seem to notice that she isn't getting soaked, she didn't seem to care before but i sure did.i'm so happy with them that i came back to order an extra set for my emergency pump kit for the car.i do enjoy saying its my best accidental purchase so far :-)-Traci (using shared hubbys account)	
- 1	If I could give this product 0 stars, I would for this reason. I called Blooming Bath customer service today for product information. I had used the bath about 3 times, and after reading on the package that it was made with polyurethane foam, I wondered if there were any flame retardants used in the foam. Lo and behold, the foam contains toxic and potentially harmful flame retardants, which is not mentioned anywhere on their site. Feeling guilty for giving my baby virtually a chemical bath, I tossed it away immediately and purchased the non-toxic Boon Naked bath. Blooming Bath is just not worth the money. People need to know that this product IS treated with chemical flame retardants.	
1. 	This is a great bouncy seat. My daughter loves it and it puts her to sleep almost every time. She doesnt seem to really care for the massage part but she loves the music. The great thing is the music is actually calming and not annoying. The only thing I would change was to have it recline a little more. Great product!	
1. 	she loves them. she uses them all the time and its made by a company she loves. i am sure she use them even after the babys all grown.	
- 1	We got this cradle and swing as a gift and unfortunately had to return it, because of the horrible screeching noise the motor was making... It also seemed like the motor was too weak (it's really tiny). We tested it with some weight in it and again, the noise was horrible and it seemed like the swinging motion slowed down (vs the empty swing) even though the batteries were brand new. Also, you can't plug it in into an outlet... I don't really know which cradle and swing to pick now (especially because it seems like My Little Lamb has the best rating out of all available swings on the market), since according to reviews all of them are making some kind of noise...	
- 1	you must adhere these to the glass for a full 48 hrs before you use them. we did that. followed the instructions precisely. and then what happened as soon as we tried to use them? they popped off the glass! they need a better adhesive to actually work.	
1. 	I was tired of of putting blankets on my daughter and figured this was easier.  It's easy to put in the car seat but I thought it actually went on the seat in replace of the original car seat cover.  It only has a band that goes around the top and sits on top of what's already on the seat.  There's nothing that attaches the bundle me at the foot.  The original reviewer was right when they said the top is really long when you unzip it.  Overall though I think it's a great product to keep her warm so I don't have to mess around with sweaters and blankets.	
- 1	After owning a couple of Graco pack n plays over the years, I expected this one to be even better based on reviews. With a Graco I can have it up and functional in 2 minutes. This thing took 2 hours to put together the first time. And if you want to fold it down to move it, it takes about 30 minutes to get it to fold up. Once it is up it is great. But the purpose of a pack and play is in it's name--you need to be able to pack it up. Because it is so difficult to maneuver I can only give it 2 stars and I am thinking of replacing it--which I shouldn't have to do because it is so expensive.	
1. 	Easy solution to cracking... Don't wash the bristles!! If you really think about it, do you wash the bristles of the plastic comb and brush set that comes in your babies med kit??  Sugarbooger really needs to take that out of the direction label.	
- 1	I found that this seat pinched my child's legs/hind area on the sides where the seat unfolded. It also has some foam on the backend  (I assume so it doesn't slip on a toilet seat) that just didn't seem to get clean when I would try to sanitize the seat. I ended up throwing it away.	
- 1	We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.  It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.  The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.	
- 1	I thought this would be the perfect diaper bag for us, but it has too many inner compartments, which results in too much material and actual means less space inside for things.	
- 1	I was excited to get this item, but it broke  during the first use and the amount of weight was not the issue. It was a bummer.	
- 1	I never used this product and ended up just throwing it away. I don't think that there is enough ventilation in this to make it truly safe. I know that I could just be a crazy parent but I'm not comfortable putting this on my child's carseat when it seems like a large plastic bag with a few small holes for air to get in. Not happy with this product.	
- 1	My 9 month old has zero use for this toy. She likes the winkle but not this. It's made well	
1. 	he likes chewing this.  we let him have it for several minutes at a time, which produces a lot of saliva thus 'washing' his teeth.  we will probably get 1-2 more since he wanders around the house with it in his mouth and would also get one for a friend of his.	
1. 	My son loves to play dino world just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.	
- 1	im not really a fan of this car seat.for one, it doesnt fit in the top part of a cart at the grocery store. i know you arenot supposed to, but lets face it, everyone does. so it really annoys me.i also find it hard to get in and out of the base. i almost never get it the first time/in one motion.oh and its frickin heavy. very very heavy.the only thing i like about it is that it's cute on my B-ready stroller (which i love)it's not a bad seat, it does clean easy---but this is my 4th child and i have had better seats in the past	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
- 1	I purchased this video monitor for a friend- we opened it up at the party, and it never worked!  I was so embarrassed. The monitor did not recognize the video feed at all.  If you're spending this much on a video monitor, I would recommend any of the Summer monitors.  They may be pricier, but at least they work.	
1. 	Perfect for my 20 month old, who is approx 26 lbs. Warm and comfortable for my little guy. Great purchase for parents who do not want to use loose blankets in their little one's crib.	
- 1	It fell apart on me after 1 wash on the delicate cycle as per the manufacturer's recommendation. I also didn't dry it per their instructions.  I took it out of the washer and the seam was completely ripped open where the zipper meets the fabric.  I would NEVER use something without washing it first before using it on my infant, so I'm not sure why Boppy would make a product that can't handle a simple wash in the delicate cycle.  Would not recommend.	
- 1	A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	
- 1	I was getting a little distracted by all the reviews for higher prices bath toy bags.  This is awesome and does the job.  I am happy I went with this one! Holds lots of toys... more than we have for sure!I am editing about 2 months after I purchased this bag.. IT KEEPS FALLING DOWN! I had to change to 3 stars.  It still does what I need it to do, but it is annoying always having to put it back up.AFTER A YEAR... I hate this thing.  It is always on the floor of my shower.  It is a piece of junk.	
- 1	I would give this product 5 stars for touch and feel. Very soft. Easy to wear and wash. However they are awful at containing any amount of leak. I go through all 6 pads before morning is over. And forget about them working over night. The smallest amount of milk soaks right through to my bra and shirt. I have gone back to disposable pads	
1. 	I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the sheet is expensive and hardly a sheet at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!	
- 1	UPDATE: 6/9/2014:  Replacement delivered via FedEx Ground on 6/6/2014!  Thank you, Philips.  Now, we'll see how long it operates.UPDATE: 6/4/2014:  After waiting three weeks and sending two emails requesting a status update on the warranty replacement, I called Philips again.  No order had ever been entered for the replacement even though the documentation had been received.  The CSR said she would enter an order for a new monitor to be sent to me.UPDATE 5/14/2014:  Contact with Philips this morning yielded different results.  The CSR, Deborah, listened carefully to the issue and then told me the warranty begins when an item is shipped - NOT when it is manufactured.  Philips will honor their warranty with respect to this item.  I will update again, when necessary.UPDATE 5/10/2014 BEWARE - Philips Refuses To Honor Their Warranty Claiming This Is A 2011 Model ... :  This was the original title of my updated review.  This item was received in August 2013 as part of the Amazon Vine Program.  It operated nicely until last week and then it stopped transmitting voices.  Following all troubleshooting suggestions yielded no results - the unit was still inoperable.  I called Philips on 5/10/2014 and was informed by their CSR Liz that since this was a 2011 model, it was likely an overstock purchase and they would not honor the 2 year warranty.  Further, the CSR talked continually and never actually listened to the issues.Additionally, if you fail to register your monitor within 30 days of purchase, the CSR stated it was Philips policy not to honor the warranty.  Therefore, if you receive or give this as a gift, register it immediately.Although I received this at no cost, I still expected Philips to stand behind their product.  Their refusal to do so is the complete opposite of Fisher-Price's handling of an issue with one of their products received through the Vine program.  I recommend purchasing some monitor other than a Philips Avent since this is a purportedly 2011 model and is outside Philips' warranty coverage, regardless of your date of purchase.ORIGINAL REVIEW: The Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor is an excellent addition for your child's nursery or for grandparents who have frequent little overnight visitors. The unit is compact; its sleek, contemporary appearance and lovely pastel robin-egg blue color are very attractive. Its practical features and clear sound capability elevate it above other baby monitors currently on the market.Set-up of the Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor is fairly easy - if you read the directions and follow them carefully. To link the parent and base units, you should hold down the power button for two seconds. If you exceed that amount of time, the units do not link; I learned that the hard and frustrating way.Both the sound quality and transmission power of the Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor are outstanding. The two-way capability is a real plus in the middle of the night if the first responder needs assistance from the parent who has stayed in bed. It is also useful when the child is older; the parent is able to tell the child something without having to play the sleep-delaying game of mommy/daddy, I need you. Grandparents having a little visitor who talks incessantly before finally succumbing to sleep will find the Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor provides an excellent source of entertainment.The lullaby function is pleasant sounding. The melodies are familiar ones and done in a soothing manner. They are not loud, raucous, or overly stimulating. The ability to control volume further enhances this feature. If you choose to use it, the nightlight function provides a soft, non-distracting light.There are several small improvements that I believe would further enhance the Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor usefulness. The time shown on the parent unit is in military time - e.g. 1 PM is shown as 1300 - giving parents the option of choosing a 12-hour clock or military time would be nice. The various control buttons are not visibly marked - the markings are raised, but white like the buttons. It would be helpful to have them marked so that one does not have to memorize their location and function.Overall, the Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor With Temperature Sensor is an excellent choice as a baby monitor. I highly recommend this monitor for your child's nursery or for grandparents needing a baby monitor in their home.	
- 1	I purchased this for my newborn expected to arrive next week and spot tested it on my hand and my husband's... My husband reported a burning sensation and after washing my hands twice I can still smell the extremely strong floral fragrance. I'll be using virgin coconut oil to moisturize my little one. This purchase is going back ASAP!	
- 1	I only use this go pod when we're at a soccer game. I bought it because I was looking for a chair to place my 5 month old in while I washed the dishes. It turns out that when my baby sits in it, the go pod sinks in. Another thing that I didn't like about it was that the material is falling apart at the corners.	
- 1	Upon adjustment, this mirror slowly shifts while you're driving so eventually what you've lined up to view, is no longer viewable or centered.  Therefore, we returned it.  I do not want to be constantly adjusting the mirror after each car drive!  I actually went back to the Jeep mirror, which works better provided the straps are long enough for your headrest.	
- 1	My baby is 3.5 mos old, and I breastfeed exclusively.  I bought this for nursing on-the go, but I have to say, I don't get it.  I have very few shirts that open at the top for nursing, I usually have to lift my shirt to nurse my baby.  But even for top opening shirts, there is no way to hide the nipple when the baby's feeding.  Not to mention the fact that once babies reach 3 months old, you WANT to make it so they can't see anything because they get so distracted by the world (and your face, and your voice, and anything that moves or looks more interesting than a blank wall...).  I've found the Hooter Hiders and Udder Covers apron style covers with boning in the neck to be a lot easier to work with.  They work with any kind of shirt you're wearing, you don't have to have two hands to put them on, and they keep baby focused on the task at hand so it doesn't take all day.	
- 1	It's okay.  Cheap, made terrible.  It does what it's supposed to do, but if a strong wind comes along, forget it!	
1. 	This chair made my life easier!  Easy to clean, and basically I can put it anywhere: on the floor, on the chair, and best of all on the go!My husband loves to dine out.  This chair made my daughter feels eating out as comfortable as eating at home.  It fits many different shaped of chairs out there (as long as not a sofa! =p)And by having her own table, she does not really touch the restaurant table which I like to avoid in any case (due to hygiene reason).  And if we want to watch TV, I can put her on the floor with this chair (so me watching and feeding her at the same time =)).This is great to have!	
1. 	I just wanted some lids so my bottles would fit in the cooler that came with my Medela Pump In Style. I had two Medela bottles that came with lids, so I thought I'd just order some more of those lids. But they were really expensive! So I found these and they were a lot cheaper so I got them. They work great. They fit our bottles (Gumdrops and Gerbers) perfect and I've never had any leaks. Just what I needed!	
- 1	This thing is adorable, but I wish they'd but a few more dollars into the frame. The frame is hollow bent tubing, and while they say that it can support a baby up to 25 lbs, I feel like you'll wind up with this thing bending slowly towards the ground if you're baby is heavier than a softball. Between the vibration and the low weight allowance to start with, I worry that this could rattle apart, especially if your baby is a big squirmer.That said, this is super cute. I love how the butterfly wings double as a wrap. Despite the picture of what is clearly at least a 6 month old, this is intended more for newborns, as the height allowance won't get you much past that. The toys are on velcor rather than hooks, so your baby could pull one down with enough effort, which I actually like. The overall design is colorful, and it does only take about 5 minutes to put together. The battery case is annoying, as it is screwed shut, which is totally unnecessary and requires additional tools.Overall, a really cute option, and better designed that others I've seen, but for $45, its insufficient for what it can deliver.	
- 1	These toys are extremely hard and do not allow comfort for my teething baby. There's no give when you squeeze the toy. The plastic material is just really tough.	
- 1	This pump was okay but not great. It is quiet and it works well. But the flang didn't fit properly and they don't give a size choice. I didn't bother with trying to find another size for Spectra since it was too painful even for the wrong size. However it did get out more milk than my Medela hand pump did at first. It's a good pump, just not for me.	
1. 	This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the things with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with things to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.	
1. 	this is much easier and safer to keep nasty shopping cart germs away from your child.  my only problem is keeping my child in the front of the cart, she has to be part of the action.  its a little bulky to carry around, and not very easy to put back in the bag, but would purchase again because the others ive seen still have places the baby could touch and get germs.	
1. 	So easy to use and works well.  Not bulky, easy to install, soft and comfortable.  Works with our Britax B-Agile.  7 month old enjoyed it from the get go.  Versatile.  We've used it in 50 degree to 30 degree weather.  We can cover our daughter up almost completely and add a hat so that she's very toasty, but she can pull her hands out or tuck them in depending on her comfort.  We fold up the stroller with this attached.	
- 1	I've heard a lot of good things about this pillow.  I wanted this inflatable travel version bc of it's portability.  It took longer than I expected to inflate, and then had a hole in it!  Wasn't able to properly test it out bc of the hole and I returned it.  In the meantime, I also purchased a regular version (not from Amazon).  It's very stable and solid, and so far, I really like it.	
1. 	My children are 18 months apart in age. I did not want to buy two full sized cribs (and in our previous house, we wouldn't have had the room!). I bought this for my son and he happily slept in it for well over 1 year. The wheels are so nice to be able to move it from one room to another as needed. I bought a smaller mattress, smaller sheets and a smaller bumper to fit this and make it cozy for him. At 16 months (30 inches and 22 pounds), he still fits into it just fine, but I've since moved him up to a full sized crib as his sister is in a toddler bed!	
- 1	We had high hopes for this product.  After receiving it, we attempted to take off the bumper piece that goes between our childs legs, after following the directions (turning 30 degrees and lifting), a piece of the plastic locking it in broke off.We returned and ordered a 2nd one, thinking it was a fluke, but the same thing happened, only this broke on the 2nd attempt.We will steer away from this product, buyer beware	
- 1	When I first started using this product I loved it! It was so nice to be able to pump directly into the liner, rather than pump into a bag that then needs to be transferred to the liner (what a mess!).However, there were several cons to them:1) the sealing disks start to leak after several uses2) if you want to build up any sort of supply in the freezer, plan on spending a LOT of money because you cannot just buy extra pieces - you must buy a whole new kit, and each kit only provides storage for 4 bottles!3) if you have a double breast pump, you have to buy 2 kits in the first place cause it only has 1 pump adaptor!I like the playtex premium nurser, and wish the storage kit was more economical (and even if not economical, I'd like it if they didn't leak)I recommend you save some money and buy the Gerber storage bottles, which come in a package of 4 and are very inexpensive. I haven't seen them online, but you can buy them in BRU. These are more expensive than buying the Medela or other brand storage bags - but those bags are such a pain IMO. The bottles are great because you can easily pour them into the liners.	
1. 	This was my first sling and my first experience with baby wearing. I registered for this for baby #1 and a friend gave it to me at my shower! My baby is now 8 months old and I've been using this since he was 3 days old. The sling has come in handy so many times at the store, at church, in class, on walks, in restaurants, doing household chores, and just because. :)  (I uploaded a few pictures so you can get a visual).I love that this ring sling is both practical AND beautiful! I got the fern batik print and love it. The fabric is very durable, and the shoulder and rails are nicely padded. As some mentioned, the padded rails can make tightening the sling a little difficult at times, but once my ring sling was broken in a little, the padding softened and it's become much easier to adjust.This is a great sling for those new to babywearing or who want to test out a ring sling without spending $50+! Some of the slings I was looking at are upwards of $100 - while I would love to someday have such a high quality sling, this one does the trick nicely for now. :)A few tips and techniques I've learned:#1 - Positioning: SAFETY FIRST! Please be sure that your infant is positioned high enough for you to easily ensure he/she can breathe easily, especially if you are wearing your newborn! Close enough to kiss is what I always read. It can be a little tricky sometimes to get your baby up this high, but I found that if you tighten the sling a little more before putting baby in, it's easier to maintain that visibility.#2 - Don't pull on the tail. When you go to adjust the sling, don't pull down on the little tail to tighten things up. This makes it hard to get the proper fit. Instead, pull each side/rail individually UP and across your body, until things are snug and positioned correctly. You'll probably have some extra poofiness at the end of the sling and it won't end in a nice sleek little tail, but you can always wrap the excess around the rings after you've adjusted. :)#3 - Spread out the back! Make sure that the shoulder padding is spread out nicely across your shoulder, not bunched up at the neck, owch! Also make sure that the ring sling fabric is spread out nice and wide across your back, and that it's not twisted. Spreading out the fabric means a much more comfortable carry, and it won't stress your back so badly.#4 - Switch sides! Be sure to wear the sling on alternating shoulders so you don't over-fatigue one side of your body. I admit, I didn't always do this - because of breastfeeding complications involving an abscess, I couldn't have anything pressing on my right breast where I had an incision, so I would always wear the sling on my left shoulder, keeping baby more toward the left side of my body. Once I healed, I went back to switching shoulders.#5 - Grab a friend and keep practicing! It was helpful for me to have my husband there to help me spread the fabric in the back and across my shoulder, then to hand me baby so I could put him in the sling. If you're having trouble initially, ask someone to help you til you've got the hang of it. Everyone's body is different and every baby is a little differently shaped, so it'll take you some time as you figure out the most comfortable position for you, and the best positions you want to use for your little one.#6 - Don't give up!!!  There is definitely a bit of a learning curve in babywearing, and this sling is no exception. Your muscles will take a bit of time to grow accustomed to the extra weight so you might be a little sore (if you're really really sore tho, look into your positioning and technique as things might not be quite right in that area!) Do your own research and look up how to wear your baby safely. I watched YouTube videos, read tutorials, and did tons of good ol' Google searches on different positions in the ring sling (newborn, cradle carry, hip carry, forward facing, etc.) Above all, have fun with it and don't get discouraged if your first few attempts are less than perfect! Before you know it, you'll be whipping your sling on like nobody's business. :)	
1. 	this toy:is easy to put togetherdurableeasily (and securely) claps shut to transition to ride-oncolorfulhas cute musici cannot think of anything i dislike about this toy. it even has little area in the front for baby's feet so you can push them.	
- 1	My newborn is just over seven pounds, and the newborn size is rated for 6-12 pounds.  The wings (part you swaddle with) are very oversized for her, to the point where there is no Velcro left in order to close it once I have her wrapped up.  I have also had issues with the product bunching up over her face, I assumed this is due to the poor fit, but it seems others had the same issue.  This product is also very overpriced, especially since it seems I wasted my money on something that isn't functional.	
1. 	7 months along, it gets tougher finding ways to sleep more comfortably through the night.Pros: Curved and contoured so that your neck and legs are supported.  Also, allows you to flip from side to side without having to rearrange the pillow which you would need to do with a regular body pillow.Cons: Material of the pillow is not the softest and they should improve that for sure.That's it.  It works for me :)	
1. 	My son spits up after he is fed and he is a heavy drooler. I was using terry cloth bibs and they worked, but would soaked after a few minutes and then it would soak into his clothes. I was changing his bib and cloths about every 30 minutes to prevent a rash. I bought these hoping they would help and they do! My son will spit up or drool all over these and his clothes stay dry. I still have to change the bib after about an hour, but that's far better than having to change his clothes too. Plus he stays dry so I don't have to worry about a rash.The velcro is a little rough, and I'll never understand why a manufacturer would make the roughest (hook) side face the skin, but you can always just put the bib on backwards so the loop side is facing the baby's skin. That way if it's not completely covered it will not rub the roughest part on their skin.I do wish the terry cloth part of this was a little thicker, but otherwise I love these and have purchased 2 sets.	
1. 	This is one snazzy shopping cart cover.  One lady referred to it as a totally fabulous situation when she came up to us in the store and gestured to it.This cart cover COVERS everything!  Your baby will not touch anything on the actual cart.  Any licking or chewing will happen to the cart cover only, THANK GOODNESS.The pillow is nice, helps stabilize littler babies, protects bigger ones from having accidents with their faces hitting the front bars of the carts.  And it is tethered to the cover, so when baby thinks it would be funny to launch it out onto a nasty floor, it doesn't work out as planned.  There are also several little loopies that you can use linkadoos, etc. to attach toys with.  There is a little band you can slip a sippy cup in.  And the back pockets are FANTASTIC.  You can use that as a diaper bag!And you really can operate this thing with one hand...the zipper is a little tough so I don't use it, but you just flop this thing in that cart, insert baby, do a few snaps with the straps and you are OFF!It is just a very nice, comfortable situation for your baby and for your piece of mind.  And it looks REALLY cool too.  I highly recommend.	
- 1	This is awful. The small holes around the caterpillar and plastic circle that goes around the ball makes the holes underneath very small. It was truly upsetting to have to jump out of the shower because my screaming 9 month old had her finger stuck in one of the holes. I threw it in the trash.	
- 1	I have been using Dr Browns ever since my son was born at the recommendation of his pediatrician.. Started off colicky and then Acid Reflux.. I ordered this set from Amazon recently as we needed extra bottles to juggle between home and daycare. THESE LEAK..and guess what - the bottle cover and cap do not fit snugly into the Dr Browns dishwasher basket I have from BRU... imitation bottles,,hmm thats a first!	
1. 	I'll start with the con---it's heavy and the parent organizer cost extra.  Now the positives are it fits my Chicco car-seat perfectly! It's great for my NB son and 2 1/2 year daughter. she sometimes sits and sometimes walks.  When she is to big to sit then I can still use the stroller. Not like the doubles that I would  be pushing a huge empty stroller around.  great for those with two young kids (just not twins).  I also like the material-durable feel and easy to wipe. Very little assembly required- I did it myself in 20 mins and no tools.  Ps- I was able to purchase this for 99$ from joovy website with free shipping.  So lookout for special offers. AND yes there is little room for child on bench when front seat reclined-but my DD doesn't seem to care and can still sit.  Maybe a chubby child would have difficulty.....	
1. 	I keep this attached to links and keep with my babies stroller. She has two bottom teeth that are a few millimeters in, and loves chewing on this. I like that its multipurpose, it's fun to chew on and it simulates the feeling of having your teeth brushed.	
- 1	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.	
1. 	I have not had the problems that others have listed.  My warmer does shut off after a few minutes of warming and has never boiled the bottles.  I have found that it does not warm chilled bottles using the amount of water recommended.  I usually have to warm it twice or use more water than recommended.  Luckily, my baby is not to picky.  It seems to do the job plus is reasonably priced.	
- 1	I loved the idea that there was a place for her to hold the teether to be able to chew but this thing is huge and heavy. She just ends up dropping it and going for something smaller to chew on.	
1. 	We Just Bought this travel swing-because the baby will spend sometime with us we thought we could use a small swing, not some big Swing (like you could travel with that!) the pad seem comfy for baby! like anything makes a baby happy! we have a EB playpen! and this swing! that basicually what we need and we got huggies gift pack for our house! about bats! why dont you go out and buy some when you need some! its alot cheaper!  anyways both EB and Swing was easy set up, and we havent taken them down,as far as we know this play yard and swing will suit us just fine! i hope you read the manual! to make sure all parts there!! best swing and play yard!! ;) we love them so FAR! the best thing about the travel yard and travel swing is perfect for us! specially in the first few years! i always had hand-me down swings and play yards! but this is a great buy! we got these cheaper at toy r us!! on sale! 100.00 bucks for EB and i think about 30 bucks for the travel swing! oh yeah by the way the people that does not think to set up a travel yard isnt easy YOU just have to make sure its locked!  we also bought the link-a-doos at target for 12 dollars...good luck! my nephew loves this swing and he'll sit in it  at 11months old and baby #2 is due in aug!! so we'll be using this swing again for granny's house!	
1. 	These wipes are a life saver. I travel significantly for work and these make cleaning breast pump parts in my truck a breeze.	
1. 	These sheets appear to be nice, quality, crisp percale sheets so as that was as expected. However, the color was much darker than the photos. The color is more of a turquoise than the light aqua image on Amazon.	
1. 	I used this for breast milk and baby food. The cubes were a little under an ounce. The lids were not very secure, but secure enough to keep freezer odors out. The cubes do not pop out easily and I had to run the tray under hot water to get the cubes out.	
1. 	I love these cups!! Great for toddlers. Makes my little one feel very independent. I use it at home and in the car. Great for taking snacks to grandmas house, too.	
1. 	Nice bib.  Rinses clean and dries quickly.  Fits my baby well at 18 to 20 months.  Very good for particularly messy eaters.  Should fit her well for at least the next 6 months and possibly longer.  Pocket is only good for catching liquids that drip down...not really good for food particles because it doesn't stay in an open position.  Ties behind the neck so baby cannot remove easily like velco bibs.  Also, can get the neck fairly snug because of the ability to adjust the size of the neck opening with the tie closure.  I don't know that I would recommend this for babies less than a year...would probably be too big.	
1. 	In my opinion, this is one of the best baby gates on the market.  I purchased 2 of these 3.5 years ago and just purchased another one. We have them hardware mounted and they are very sturdy.  These are the ONLY gates that my 3.5 year old son can't get out of.  He has a toddler bed in his bedroom and if he gets up before I do, he creates all kind of disasters around the house.  We purchased several cheaper hardware mounted gates, to try to keep him in his room.  He figured them out and was out of his room in less than 10 minutes. This is the only gate that can keep him in there and SAFE!  We also have this mounted at the top of the stairs and its very sturdy.  Its extremely easy for parents to operate. The gate swings nicely and there is an audible snap, so you know the handle has locked the gate into position. I also love the clear plates. You can see right through and see what your child is doing.  Its unobtrusive and just an attractive gate.  Its also very reasonably priced compared to those other metal looking gates.  This is just a fantastic overall gate. I'd recommend it to anyone with a child, especially a sneaky toddler that can escape other gates.	
1. 	We have two of these. One for the car and the other is in the house. He loves this toy. Everyone should buy this if you have a baby.	
- 1	First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the puppy is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the puppy's mouth.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.Third, the puppy is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the puppy doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the puppy into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place.	
1. 	What a terrific invention!!  We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.  Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!  Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to snack on the go.My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can.  I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!	
1. 	Accidents happen with little kids, this is a really easy way to make sure the bed is kept clean and dry especially if you have a loft or bunk bed you don't want to climb up to, to tear apart.	
- 1	I bought this for an upcoming trip because I wanted something that could pack in my luggage.  Once I got it, I tried putting it on my kitchen table, but wasn't able.  I think our table might have been too thick for this chair to be compatible.  So we ended up returning it and instead got the My Little Seat Infant Seat.	
- 1	We are looking to replace a 4 yr old Summer monitor that has become a bit crackly. We ordered this and a Lorex. Both are going back due to horrible audio quality. Both have the speaker on the back of the monitor, and the ridiculously flimsy kickstands on both units are useless. The sound has to be turned all the way up to have any hope of hearing the baby before they become so upset they are screaming, but with the volume up that high, there is an annoying hissing noise instead. With our old Summer monitor, we can easily hear or child's every breath, if we choose to. Isn't that the point of a monitor?	
1. 	We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. She loved this seat and so do we. It allowed her to be in the same room as all of us and be able to be at our level (on the floor) while we played games with her brother. Our 3 year old son also loves it. He of course uses it as a rocking chair. Its a very versatile gift :)	
1. 	This is a very useful set for a new mother.  I love that the bottles are PBA-free, and that the nipples are designed for a nursing baby, to help the baby go between breast and bottle.  These bottles actually vent air in from the bottom as baby drinks, which prevents a vacuum buildup AND prevents air bubbles going in from the nipple through the liquid (which puts bubbles in the liquid which go to baby's tummy and has to be burped out!)  Bottle design has come a long way in 24 years!	
- 1	We purchased these bottles for our primarily breastfed baby based on the wide based nipple and good reviews. His latch on the nipple mimics breastfeeding well, and he has been going back and forth between the bottle and the breast successfully since 1 week old.However, both my husband and I have found that because of the way milk pools between the inner and outer nipple, it is essentially impossible to feed the last 1/2 oz or so. Even when we let it drip back down into the bottle and then quickly invert it again--you just can't get that last bit of milk to stay in the inner nipple long enough for him to drink it.I'm not willing to sacrifice 1/2 oz of milk everytime we use a bottle. We have retired these bottles and are now much happier with Tommee Tippee.	
1. 	I've been using these for years and have yet to have a problem with my children getting into the outlets.	
1. 	Our baby doesn't love these, but they do a great job of removing those pesky boogers. A good friend warns that this can become addictive.	
1. 	I just recently received a 2013 Maclaren Volo in solid black as a gift. I really love it as a second stroller for public transportation & quick trips. I purchased this organizer in charcoal, the charcoal cup holder by Maclaren, and a black/charcoal Maclaren seat liner.I love this organizer as it doesn't cause the Volo to tip, & the stroller closes with this attached. I use the 2 bottle holders for my son's Pura Kika sippy cups, & they fit inside nicely (without the silicone sleeves). The middle pocket is perfect for my iPhone 5, and the large mesh bag is great for quick access to toys, books, hats, my wristlet, etc.In the bottom basket I store the rain cover & mosquito net, along with an A&A; swaddle blanket, a sweatshirt, & Skip Hop Pronto. I clip my KK water bottle to the handle of the stroller with a Built 24-30oz. bottle sling w/clip, & use the Maclaren cup holder for my iced coffee. I definitely recommend this organizer & the Maclaren cup holder for your stroller. They make the already fabulous Volo that much more convenient!	
1. 	Wouldve been perfect from newborn up. My son is 29inches long and 19lbs; wish it was a bit bigger but it still holds my son and hes getting used to kicking them legs and spashing in the water while i wash him; which is good.. i like this better than the big bulky plastic tubs.	
- 1	I prefer the medela brand. I think this one is messier when trying to get the pumps in and out and I always spilled. Also my zipper broke after just a few months.	
- 1	I am kind of disappointed... This tubeside seat is not as efficient as it seems to be.. Not adapted to every kind of bathtubs.	
1. 	Im glad I purchased this. It's a perfect mobile bed for a baby when you don't want baby in a huge crib or far away from you. My Booba can sleep comfortably right next to me on the couch with this basket.	
1. 	This carrier is the best!  We are on child #5 and have had a carrier for each one and the last one is definately the best!  I researched and considered carefully before purchasing this and all reviews and reports were accurate.The ease of use is remarkable.  I can get baby in and out all by myself.  From the day after Luca and I arrived home from the hospital, we were out for our daily walks.  I sing in our church choir every Sunday and Luca is in his Bjorn close to me and we have never missed a Mass!  It is always in the diaper bag when we shop because he ultimately ends up in his carrier.  Even at age 9 months we use it often!  Now he sits forward in it and charms all he sees!Unfortunately I have yet to figure out how to nurse baby when in this.  I do recall reading that you could but I have tried and find it impossible, at least for me.You put your arms through the straps and the front of the carrier is open, you then take the front piece and snap it on (very easy) You can then place your baby on you and hold him/her with one arm and pick up the front of the carrier and bring it up over baby sliding the built in post-like fasteners into their respective color coded openings on the straps.  Baby is safe secure and mom/dad has 2 free hands!Great great product!	
- 1	I was trying to find something to keep my sons pacifier in his mouth and believe me, this is not it. It holds the pacifier at such an odd angle that it ends up making it pop out. Completely useless.	
1. 	They absorb well. However, you will have to wear a padded bra in order for the seams on these pads not to show and/or look pointy.	
1. 	well... my wife did not liek the included shields that came with her swing pump and these fixed that problem, if you or your partner have smaller nipples then this is going to make a pump better for you	
1. 	this item is great for putting on tables at fast food restaurants.	
1. 	I like this blanket because you can sit outside and the morning dew isnt going to get your butt all wet! The baby sees this as a boundary and tries to scoot off of it :)	
- 1	Its too flimsy to make a real difference...if you are looking into co-sleepers because you are afraid to sleep with your baby in the bed you are better off getting an Arms Reach co-sleepier bassinet, because this product won't instill too much sense of safety	
1. 	This is soft and does its job well.  I have never had any issues with it.  It also gives just a little bit of poof and could service as a sheet by itself, although I use it under a sheet.	
1. 	Our oldest is 3, and this diaper pail has been doing its job, right next to my bed that entire time (now containing the stinky diapers from our younger son for the past 19 months).In light of the 600 other reviews for this product, I'll boil it down to these four points:(1) It really does contain smell, despite its simplicity. I have a very sensitive nose, and the only time I catch the odor from within is if I purposely hold the two flap doors open and take a whiff, or when I'm changing the bag and compacting the full one with my knee to squeeze all the air out (definitely an outside task -- stinky!).(2) Price the bags before hand, because as others have pointed out, they're the real expense over time.(3) Our secondary flapper door was hanging open the past few weeks, probably the result of a loose spring affected by corrosion (the air stays moist inside this pail). I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.  Problem solved.(4) It's pretty durable. Our oldest regularly climbs and sits on this -- says it's his rocket. He hasn't managed to break anything, despite it being very conventional construction (i.e. lightweight, not overbuilt, though I hesitate to call it flimsy).	
- 1	Okay, so maybe I didn't read all the fine print carefully enough. But the gate has swing in the title, and in the description it also says pressure-mounted. I thought I was getting a gate that would swing while pressure-mounted to the wall. When I received it, I realized it only swings if you use hardware to drill holes in the wall. If you pressure-mount the gate, it works just like any other cheap, plastic gate that you have to step over each time (creating another hazard for your baby; what if you trip over it while carrying him/her?) Also, when I did try to pressure-mount it the green locking mechanism didn't work properly. I ended up returning it!	
1. 	Like a lot of previous reviewers, we started out with a more conventional high chair. I'd wanted to try a hook on chair before, but when you are a new mom and there are all of these images of standard high chairs everywhere it's difficult to consider other options.I bought the Chicco Caddy and brought it home. It was easy to attach to our table, and comfortable for our 2 month old. He really seems to enjoy sitting at the table, and being a part of the family when we eat. It's very handy to put him in while I do work in the kitchen as well.Can we talk about what a huge space saver this is? My gosh! It folds up and can be tucked away in a cabinet. Ta-da! I can't understand why anyone would go with a standard high chair!We have taken the Chicco Caddy with us multiple times to friends' homes and restaurants as well. It is very easily portable and a cinch to attach to most any table. There is no unfamiliar high chair to wrangle our son into, and he has his own comfortable spot in a new place.One issue I had initially was that there is a space between the table and the edge of the Chicco Caddy. Food will fall through that space, and get all over the fabric edge of the Caddy. Minimal clean up, but still kind of an annoyance. I purchased a Summer Infant Tiny Diner, and have found that to resolve the issue perfectly. It functions as a little placemat and over laps the space between the table and the Caddy. The food trough catches a great deal of what would normally end up in our son's lap.The two products work beautifully together, so I recommend getting a Tiny Diner to go with your Chicco Caddy.**Update** Our son is now 13 months old and pretty feisty. He has plenty of room to move in the Caddy and will use it if not strapped in securely! Some users have complained about cleaning difficulty and I sympathize. The first two times I laundered it, I had a difficult time getting the fabric separated from the frame, and then reassembling. I think a learning curve coupled with the fabric softening a bit has made it much easier to disassemble and assemble. A year after the initial purchase I am still happy with this product. We use it 2-3 times a day, and it travels with us often.Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Green	
1. 	As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub.  Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer.  The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water).  Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us.	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs. I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!	
1. 	This changing table pad fit on our changing table perfectly. It comes in 2 sizes so make sure you measure! It has attached straps if you want the extra security for wiggly baby. Also screws to attach (although I'm not sure where you'd attach it). It seems to be plenty cushy. The plastic covering is perfect to clean quickly if there's a mess. This is a great product for the price. Although I have not used another changing pad, I'm perfectly happy with this purchase.	
- 1	I received this from my mother-in-law (she bought every conceivable accessory for our stroller).  At first I liked this because it gave me more storage and cup holders.  The only function that I actually used was the cup holders, which don't work as well as a hard cup holder would. While I used this bag, it caused more frustration than anything.  It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it.  The final straw came 6 months after using it.  We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back.  As a last attempt, I took the bag off, and miracle of miracles!  The stroller folds up fine!  In my opinion, don't waste your money, just buy a standard cup holder!	
1. 	One of my favorite gifts I got at my showers! Its light, handles extremely well, inexpensive and can be reused again and again with different car seats. Highly recommend it!	
- 1	Granted, I know this is a soft mirror and given that... they can get scratched, dented, and the like... BUT the quality of this mirror is terrible.  I bought one recently to see if I could replace the Fisher Price one I had been using (the Fisher-Price Deluxe Auto Mirror With Mirror & Lights... which is a great mirror but sits a bit high so the view out the back window of my Subaru Outback is blocked more than I'd like).  At first I thought the Baby In Sight mirror was a decent mirror (3 stars-ish) -- not as secure as the Fisher Price one I have but not bad.  However, as soon as my baby managed to sneeze on the thing and I had to clean it... well, my impression changed completely.  Even using a soft cloth (as directed), I managed to scratch the mirror.  Before I did any more damage, I grabbed a camera lens cloth to clean the rest of the mirror's surface.  Well, the whole thing ended up scratched -- so bad that it looked cloudy!  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, how much softer of a cloth are you supposed to use?!!  No matter how carefully I tried to be while wiping it the silver mirror surface came off easily.  Thankfully, BRU has a great return policy and so I returned it *immediately* for a full refund.  My recommendation -- don't bother with this brand/style... go with a Fisher Price type as they are much more durable products.  (And believe me, chances are that at some point your baby will sneeze, spit up, or the like in their car seat and the mirror will get it!)	
- 1	I don't think I will be switching from the Playtex Dropins I have been using.The re-sealable bags for the Steribottles are easy to use and do help keep them clean. Sterility of the bottles and the nipples is ensured by their being stacked, one on top of the other (think Dixi Cup dispenser). The bottles themselves are 8oz and graduated. The nipples are fast flow.The procedure to unseal and reseal the bag to get out the bottles is straightforward, although probably not necessary. Once you open the bag it is no longer sterile. The need to carefully and only partially unzip the packaging for the nipples is tedious. The nipples leak very little when the bottle is inverted, but when feeding, the flow is very fast (too fast, much faster than a Playtex fast flow nipple).The biggest surprise was that once you put the nipple on the bottle, you can't take it off. I discovered this while testing it empty and had to waste a bottle and nipple. This means you can't top off a bottle, or add something to an already made bottle. Forcing the nipple off the bottle breaks the sealing mechanism and renders the bottle useless. The bottle is recyclable, but not reusable. There is a lot less trash with the Dropins.I see no reason to switch.	
- 1	Our LO doesnt seem to like using this, I think because the silicone part is too tough.  He can hold it well but doesnt like chewing on it.	
1. 	I bought this for my grandson, 6 mos so just sitting on his own. Was looking for something that would not take up a lot of space, and that would work at the kitchen bar.This booster seat has 3 heights, and when placed on a barstool (secure with back) can be adjusted to just the right height - enables him to hang out in the kitchen when we are cooking but not be underfoot. And enables him to eat at the counter with the rest of us.Just what I was looking for!	
1. 	I bought one of these a while back when my daughter was teething (she is 15 months now, and almost all of her teeth now!) and they worked great with ice cubes. When she started eating more solid foods, we put bananas in there, and even some apple slices. I like how the mesh only allows a small amount of food to come through. The only downside to these, are how messy they are. But kids are already messy, and it's better than straight handing them a banana. She loved sucking on the ice cubes, and at times, it would be the only thing that would help her teeth. On a side note, make sure you put them in water RIGHT AFTER you are done using it. It will become way too hard to wash them otherwise, and I had to buy a whole new one after I made the mistake of leaving food in it .	
1. 	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.	
- 1	This diaper bag is cute. That's all there is to say for it! I got it for my first baby and could only use it if I had a second bag to put all the baby stuff in that wouldn't fit in the diaper dude.  the front zip pockets are tiny, as are all the compartments. I spent 60 bucks on this and now I use a reusable grocery bag that cost $2 because it's so much better! If I had that $60 back I'd go buy a nice normal Graco diaper bag like all my friends have. Grrr.	
1. 	It's great not to have the extra piece of furniture around the dining table. Chair is comfy and easy to clean.I didn't even try to use the white tray because of the other reviews on how easy it is for the kids to throw it on the floor.Bought an extra one to keep at grandmas.	
- 1	I think I bought it from Babies R' Us instead of amazon but definitely wouldn't buy again.  It may seem trivial but the foot pedal is a really nice feature to have when you are trying to hold a baby on the changing table and throw away a really nasty diaper.  Also we could never get the bags totally full...once they start getting full it gets difficult to close the lid because the twisting mechanism doesn't work as the bag gets heavy so we ended up with a lot of wasted space in the top of the bag.  If the pail was made of heavier plastic and the twisting mechanism was hardier so you could open and close the lid easily and fill the bags I would prefer this diaper pail.  But based on its current construction, I prefer the diaper genie with the foot pedal that we bought when this one broke.	
- 1	Wow is this item the pits and a waste of money. It's like a pillow not a mattress. My 14 lb baby sank right in the middle rendering it useless. I tried the Carter's velour cover and it was way to small. Fits the pack and play but what a piece of crap. The plastic cover over the foam/pillow whatever it is also way to big for what's inside. Bad manufacturing from start to finish. Save yourself the hassle and put a thick quilt on top of what comes in pack and play and that works much better and feels more like mattress the baby uses when at home.	
- 1	I thought I would love this to help do quick crib changes for when a child is sick, or has an accident/leak... however it is really annoying for me to weave the elastic around the crib slats to fasten the buttons-- really doesnt save time, and since our mattress cover is waterproof I dont really need another waterproof layer.	
1. 	This gets into all the cracks and crannies of my baby's bottles and I also use it to clean my pumping things. I would recommend it.	
1. 	Great item. Has nice sounds and is very very soft.Our boy likes it a lot as does his cousins (gifts).	
- 1	I have been using this stroller for a year as a full time nanny/baby planner, and I have never liked it. Here's why:- Short handles: I'm 5' 7 and I hate hunching over this thing.- Short seat: He was too tall for this stroller before turning two! And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it. That's pathetic for a stroller- Skinny seat: no winter coats here - especially after baby turns one.- Small, practically inaccessible basket: hard to get to, and holds very littleI could go on...	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and used it as just a bench until she was 21months. Potty training has been a breeze so far! The side compartments are great for storing extra underwear and clothes! Which I do often since I take the potty to the sitters house! It is the perfect height for her to get on and off of by herself and the pull out drawer makes for easy clean up! I couldn't do without it! Thank you Boon for making potty training a little smoother!!	
- 1	Unfortunately this monitor didn't come on when. Our baby cried. Luckily we discovered when I just happened to turn the screen on and our baby had just started crying. Not safe as didn't work as expected.	
- 1	First off, I love the Tilty cups and so does my 8 month old. However, these lids just don't work very well. I'm not sure if they are intended to go over the original sippy lid or replace it, but either way doesn't make sense. If they replace the lid, you have to find a place for the sippy lid to go while you travel, which is a pain. Plus then they have the awkward sippy top sticking out still. If it goes over the sippy lid, it doesn't seal at all and pops off all the time. Either way, the little tab is perfect for getting caught on things and pulling off. This sort of works to just keep the sippy spout clean, but serves no purpose as far as containing liquid if you want to put the sippy in a diaper bag. I really hope they would redesign this lid!	
1. 	I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.  My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.  I also needed a new infant tub.  I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).  It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.  This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.  I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.	
- 1	No way to turn then on/off therefore they all come &#34;activated.&#34; The package  was opened when i got mine so they all just fell out. I think they lost  potency by the time i got them as there wasn't much going on.	
- 1	I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.	
1. 	I love Bumpkins bibs!  Washable, lightweight, quick-drying, great for home, restaurants, travel.  Never had one stain, used them with beets, tomatoes, paint, food color, Easter egg dye, you name it (although after a few years, the white trim is just a little off-white now, but that is to be expected!).  I use this model for an art smock, but would absolutely bring it along for Christmas dinner or any other dress up occasion with a messy meal!  I have three different Bumpkins styles, this one, the one like this with short sleeves, and the regular bibs.  I absolutely love them, best parenting investment ever!	
1. 	I really like this bed, so does my 2 year old!! It's beautiful and seems to be a good quality product.The ONLY reason I gave it 4 stars is because there is NO WAY I could sit on the bed and read my little girl a bed time story. I realize this bed is for toddlers and is built accordingly. But I would like to be able to sit next to her and read or rub her back to calm her down. On the other hand, it is pretty close to the floor-which is where you have to sit to comfort your little one..	
1. 	When we had to buy my daughter some new bottles, we tried an old version of these and liked them so much we bought these when we were expecting again.Pros:- Hard cap on bottom protected the bottle when our daughter dropped them--fewer shattered bottles.- Wider mouth on these makes it easier to pour in powdered formula with limited mess- Bottom cap makes cleaning a breeze.- Extra nipples and valves mean less worry about them getting lost or ruined.Cons:- If you shake the bottle up and down to mix formula, you will likely break the seal on the valve.  You can shake from side to side, you don't have this problem.	
1. 	This is a must have for all moms and dads.  I have used everything in this little kit so far, except for the dropper.  I keep it in my diaper bag at all times!	
1. 	This is one of the best investments that we have made!  We have two that keep half the house off limits.  It's aesthetically pleasing, durable, reliable and easy to operate.  It's also tall enough to discourage our two golden retrievers from jumping up on it or trying to get through.  My husband and I are fairly tall and it's nice not having to bend down at all to open them.  Our son (now 16 months) hangs onto them and shakes them with all his body, like a prisoner trying to escape and it's hopeless- he will not get through no matter how much he may try.The only reason to not give this gate 5 stars is that the installation process, however easy it may be, is very sensitive.  You have to make sure that the bottom of the gate is exactly level, otherwise the swing-closed mechanism may not work smoothly.  We had to re-install one cup that holds the pressure mount in order for the gate to swing closed on its own like it's designed.  Also- the installation requires you to drill screws into the door frame (or wall or wherever you install it) and this will leave holes once we eventually take the gates out.  We don't mind because we know they'll be there for at least a few years until we're done having children.	
1. 	My son was a very light sleeper and any little noise would wake him up. I bought this thinking that it wouldn't work but was worth a try. It actually did help him to stay asleep. He would sleep for hours at a time as long as the machine was on. It actually helped me to relax too bc we slept in the same room. I don't like things hanging on this crib so I liked that this machine can be put anywhere.I put it on the floor under his bassinet then on a short stool next to his crib. I haven't had to use it lately but I keep it close by just in case.	
1. 	This is a great and sturdy gate that makes it easy to attach toys to the inside for play. The only complaint I have is they are hard to connect/disconnect.	
- 1	First of all I own three Thirsties Fab Fitted diapers and several Thirsties Duo wraps and have had no leaking problems with either. I purchased three of these pocket/all-in-ones in size medium for the babysitter to use. I washed and machine dried these diapers three times with my other diapers and covers (cold water prewash w/ vinegar, hot wash with All Free and Clear, super rinse) before I tried them out. I stuffed them with a hemp insert and a cotton gauze flat fold for nighttime. My poor little one woke up about five hours later in a puddle! The diaper had leaked out the back. I stuffed another diaper that same night and tried again. Another puddle :(. I proceeded to check the final diaper for repelling the next morning and it seemed to be doing it's job. I then checked the seams and made sure the diaper fit properly. I decided to do three more washes and see if that helped. I washed and machine dried three more times and tried again. This time during the day with no inserts. It was soaked after an hour! Maybe I had mineral/soap residue. I stripped the diapers by themselves using 1TBSP Dawn soap in a hot water wash with three HOT rinses. Machine dried. Stuffed for overnight and got to change the sheets.....I washed the diaper with my diapers as usual and it reeked of ammonia when I took it out. I have finally given up. My Fab fitted diapers are made of the same material and I have never had to strip them and have not experienced any lingering odors. It also wasn't my inserts as I have NEVER had to strip my flats or my hemp and they are very absorbant. I am so confused. Some of the other reviewers have had great success with the diaper and I am glad. It is a great (in theory) diaper for a great price.	
1. 	This swing was great when my daughter was an infant.  She has since outgrown it.  It is one of the few swings that gives you the option of swinging from front to back or side to side.  My daughter was facinated with the fish mobile and would always let me know when they stopped - unless she fell alseep first.  She was a fan of the ocean sounds, but there are others to choose from.As far as the problems with the sound, that only happened for me when I needed to replace the batteries.  With new batteries, it works great.The speed - I thought the faster setting would be to much for my baby until I saw her in a swing at daycare.  She was swinging on high speed and loving it.  I started using the faster setting at home after that.The only complaint I have is that the sounds do not play long enough.  But, you will find that no item play long enough when you have a fussy baby that is right on the edge of falling alseep when the music stops.	
1. 	I got these bibs for my drooling baby girl.  I perfer solid colored drool bibs so they don't distract from all her cute outfits.  I love the colors also, they work with most all her clothes.  They are very soft on both sides with the waterproof liner in the inside.  They don't make that crinkle sound when she wears them and they lay nice and flat on her chest.  They are for babies 3 to 12 months with the neck.  My baby is 6 1/2 months and they fit her nice.  I only use these for drool so they stay nice.  I've not had them very long, but long enough to run them through the washer AND the dryer several times and they still come out nicely.For 10 of them and the price it's worth it because I have just had the hardest time finding anything like them in local stores.  Drool bibs are hard to come by with the waterproof lining as all the stores only seem to sell the cotton ones; which we all know a little drooler will just soak right through anything else.  Love and recommend these bibs.	
1. 	This product is a godsend!  I use it on a carpeted area for our 7 month old infant, so she can crawl around to her hearts content and be safe from wall outlets, small objects, etc.  I am also planning on getting an extension, to make her play area even bigger.  The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.  There should be an easier swing open type gate on this thing, so that mommy or daddy can quickly enter and leave the play area.	
- 1	We were not even thinking about getting a video monitor for our second baby after having just a simple audio monitor with our first because of the price of all of them.  But then we found this one.  It got pretty good reviews... and was only a little bit more money than any decent audio monitors.  We have been using it for a couple weeks now and are not that impressed. It is nice to be able to see our almost 2 year old while she is sleeping (or not sleeping) in her crib.  It has decent night vision set up so we can still see her in the dark. However, the parent unit does not keep a charge for long at all! We keep it charged for all of the day except for her nap, which is maybe up to 3 hours.  It doesn't even usually last that whole time. The other complaint we have is that it interferes with our internet connection randomly.  My hubby started complaining about that part a week or so ago and I thought he was crazy until it started happening to me over the last couple of days.  Overall, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but will keep it because it's too much of a pain to send it back at this point.Update: 12/28/12This is definitely not worth the money I paid, and I am already wishing I spent a little more money in the first place to get a nicer monitor.  The antenna's cheap plastic has broken off and now the monitor is useless.  It doesn't have any signal.  I have ordered a much nicer Motorola monitor to replace this. I would definitely NOT recommend buying this, but do plenty of research and spend the extra money!	
- 1	I purchased this toy for my 6 month old granddaughter to encourage her to continue crawling, however, the toy does not serve that purpose.  It does not catch a young child's attention and the &#34;noises&#34; it's supposed to make to draw attention are barely audible.Would not recommend it.	
1. 	I received this as a shower gift and put it on my daughters crib. Ever since she was born she has been using this. I love the way it lights up and plays different music and bubble sounds. She is 1 now and still plays with it. She turns it on and off and makes the little things move. Sometimes my husband and I hear it in the middle of the night on her monitor. The music makes her go right back to sleep. When she turns it on in the morning it keeps her busy until we get her milk ready and come to get her. A very good crib toy to have !!!	
- 1	We got this when our little one still preferred to be swaddled but was now occasionally rolling on to his stomach. We were hoping this would prevent him from rolling. Learned how to use it to keep baby on his side which he preferred however he did not like being restricted to one place. He fought it each time he realized he was in it. Like the idea and hoped it would work for us. Probably would work for younger babies.We had to go cold turkey with not swaddling real quick.	
1. 	This is so much easier, and smaller, than purchasing a high chair. Also great for traveling. Once my little one grew out of his bumbo chair he was ready for this one. I use a plastic mat underneath the chair to keep things clean.	
- 1	Do not like this product at all, I need to return it.  Very cheaply made and difficult to use. I do not recommend.	
1. 	Baby sleeps in this every single night. The velboa is just the softest, nicest fabric. I really prefer it to the fleece. It doesn't get as hot, and it's just softer. Perfect for baby.	
- 1	My timer was defective in that LED screen for the top function (the diaper change button) was not complete...meaning you could not discern the digits (was it an 8 or 0?). Otherwise, the other functions worked and I was able to see how much time elapsed.  Overall, though I stopped using the timer fairly quickly for a few reasons.1. I had a newborn and when she was yelling/screaming crying for her bottle or permanently attached to my breast...I just forgot to press that button to start the timer over.2. For some reason, I envisioned a product that would not only keep time between feedings, diaper changes, etc. but would also keep track of the sleep time during the day, etc. or the number of diaper changes & feedings per day.  BUT it only tells how much time has elapsed from the your last feeding, changing etc. Maybe I am asking too much, but I don't see what differentiates this product from a multi-use timer.  It's essentially several times on one device. Overall, it is a good but for all the raving reviews I just expected more.I came back and edited this review because I wanted to add that they company has fabulous customer service.  I emailed the company to inquire about getting a replacement for the timer. The president of the company emailed me back promptly on a Sunday asking for my address.  He did not ask me to send back the defective timer and must have shipped the replacement priority or overnight because I received the replacment in no time.	
- 1	I originally chose this spout cover over because it was cute and unique. However, after opening the package, I realized it is also very flimsy. It is made of a very light weight foam material, not plastic. I decided to give it a try anyway and now regret it. The first time my son pulled on it (and of course he is going to be curious, he is a one year old!), it began to rip along the top seam. I imagine it will soon be unusable. I was very disappointed because it looked so cute. The only way this would hold up is if your child never touches it, and anyone with a small child knows that is highly unlikely! Considering it was designed for a child's protection during bath time, I would have to say this is quite a failure.	
- 1	Nothing fits this stupid stand.  We bought it because we wanted a place for baby to sleep in the living room.  Actually I kind of just wanted infinite baby sleeping options.He sleeps in the swing just fine.  The swing is totally worth the investment.  This, on the other hand, is relatively affordable but is now taking up valuable real estate in our apartment.  Buy a swing, or a bouncer - skip this one.	
- 1	This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth.  I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain.  I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing.  The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours.  It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away.	
1. 	Perfect for newborn to toddler! It smells great and is a gentle enough cleanser to wash newborn skin, but cleans my toddler son's skin really well after a day at the park! Highly recommend.	
- 1	I bought this after reading all the nice reviews on this, however I hate this product after buying it cz the lid sucks! It is impossible to remove the lid. I literally hurt my fingers opening it or spill formula out. I assumed I need to rotate the lid to move from one compartment to the other, but the lid does not rotate at all! I am very disappointment and am already browsing for a better formula dispenser now!	
1. 	I bought this as a simple inexpensive pail to use for cloth diapering.  I use thePlanet Wise Diaper Pail Liner (White)and it fits perfectly.  So far, I love this pail.  It's the perfect size: not too big not too small and the odors are fairly well contained.  The button action top is very simple to operate with one hand.  The only drawback I find is that the opening for the diapers is small (about the size of an adult man's fist).  This hasn't been an issue for us as we use prefolds, but I could see it being difficult with bulkier all-in-ones.  Also, as our baby grows and dirty diapers get smellier, I don't anticipate this keeping all smells at bay, but since we wash the diapers every two days I don't foresee an issue.	
- 1	This item cost me $10.00 I wish I would have been able to try it before buying it. Very disappointed with the product, It actually had some good reviews so I was very excited to buy it and hopefully make bath time more fun (by keeping the water out of my child's face) and unfortunately this product does not do that.	
- 1	Not really impressed with them mostly because my toddler has chewed off tiny pieces of them already. I can easily see how one could choke on a piece. They are what they are...	
- 1	This smelled VERY toxic and I had to air it outside for days before use. Do not plan on using straight out of the package. Using it takes a long time, I ended up never using it.	
- 1	This rocker is great as it has different recline positions. However, it is noisy. When my son is asleep and he moves, it makes creaking noises that wakes him up, which is a problem for me when I'm trying to get things done around the house as he naps. I have to stop and put him back to sleep.	
1. 	I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend. They work as expected, no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts. I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair. During the daytime, this is not a problem.	
- 1	For the price it's not worth it.  I was really trying to find a walker with all swivel wheels but I guess they don't make them anymore.  Only the front wheels spin 360 degrees while the back ones only go forward/backward.  Kind of hard for babies to understand the mechanics of his first car, I mean I told him it was going to be a 4 point turn to get out of that corner but he didn't &#34;get it&#34;.Also, there are indentions in the back of plastic where you can imagine the rear of the car having lights, etc.  Well they don't even provide you with stickers (like they do on most plastic toys) and also on the rear view mirror, they could have a cute mirror like silver sticker on it, but they just leave it black.  how boring.  If it's because they are afraid the babies will get it wet or peel it, they do have one sticker on it already on the little play tray so why not give more?I returned this walker for a refund and looking for an alternative.  I also received a black car instead of red.  The red looks cooler.	
1. 	Perfect for our bar height table and chairs	
- 1	This product was simply too bulky and ugly for us to keep in our home.  Although we really loved the concept and our daughter loves to use her kickboard in the crib, there was no need for this additional purchase so we returned it.	
1. 	We love this swaddle and now buy it for everyone we know having a baby!!	
1. 	My youngest (6 months) and I bedshare and this product worked really well on my queen size bed.  I felt really safe a night knowing he wasn't going to roll out of bed.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	Friends in my playgroup recommended this to us for my five month old because she was getting her arms out of the swaddlers.The first order I made arrived with very bad stitching--the thread was coming out at the hems in a bad way, as if the sewing machine malfunctioned. Ordinarily, I'm okay with imperfections, especially when it's a homemade product or from a small business. However, this was more than an imperfection and I worried that the blanket would ultimately come apart. I returned it and got another of the same type. There are still imperfections in the stitching, but it doesn't seem as bad as the previous blanket.The blanket itself is somewhat cumbersome to put on...I have to put my daughter on the floor and spread the blanket out wide to get her in. Then I have to roll her from side to side and really work hard to tuck the straps in underneath her back. It's difficult to get her in and I won't use it if she's sleepy because it will wake her up. However, once she's in it, she stays in it--no getting out!Because you wrap one side of the blanket around her chest multiple times,It's too hot to use in the summer. However, it's perfect for the winter.	
1. 	Big fans of halo sleepsacks because of the quality and upside down zipper.  So much easier to just change their diaper and zip them back up. OR, in our case, to unzip slightly to check if their socks are still on without making a big fuss over the zipper and waking them up too much. The cotton ones seem to shrink a little bit after the dryer (gentle cycle wash, low heat dry).Follow the length and weight guidelines for size... not age.Preemie: 14 to 19 in, Birth to 5 lbsNewborn: 19 to 23 in, 6 to 12 lbsSmall: 23 to 26 in, 10 to 18 lbsMedium: 26 to 30 in, 16 to 24 lbsLarge: 30 to 35 in, 22 to 28 lbsX Large: 35 to 40 in, 26 to 36 lbs	
1. 	This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them and they came out soft and didn't shrink much although I did have a small tear between the fabric and elastic in one corner. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.	
- 1	This product had so much potential. I followed directions but found the clay way too hard to make a decent handprint. I was unwilling to press my fragile sons hand hard enough into clay to make a visible print. This was a waste of money.	
1. 	My son is 20 months old, he LOVES this turtle.  Every night before bed he says &#34;turtle&#34; and runs over to turn it on.  Then he turns off the light and we both say &#34;wowww&#34; at all the stars on his ceiling.  The stars show up bright and clear, especially on the green light setting.  It's a great buy :)	
1. 	Sleepsacks are great. My newborn goes through phases of not wanting to be swaddled. This fit her well at 3 weeks 9 lbs & still does at 5 weeks 12 lbs with some room to grow.	
- 1	this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies. after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!	
1. 	I coupled this with the summer infant changing pad and baby is much more comfy. He used to be crankier with the other stiffer folding change pad and I decided to get the contoured pad with this plush cover. Baby likes it. I like it, it is very very soft and it seems soothing to him when he is on it bare skinned too. I bought this in blue and it is a darker blue than pictured but I don't mind that. So far it has not fell apart in the laundry as well which is good. The material is thick enough and feels sturdy enough. The elastics holds the cover well onto the changing pad and fits as the picture shows on a 2 sided changing pad.  BTW this one is cheaper than many of the others I've seen but feels and performs just as well if not better.	
1. 	These are ok and worked great for me but be advised, if you don't have inverted or flat nipples and are using them solely for cracked and bleeding nipples, the baby could suck the ends of your nipples through the holes.  It also leaves the baby choking on milk from too fast a flow.	
1. 	This bed was purchased for our first grandson who has not arrived yet.  The only problem was when it was delivered by UPS the box and the bed was damaged.  They had this bed picked up and another delivered within 2 days. Our son put the bed together and it looks so nice and sturdy.  Our grandson, Autry will love it as much as his parents we hope.  GREAT CHOICE :)	
1. 	These bottles are really safe, really high quality, and my baby loves them. They are well-made and because they are from Playtex I can trust that they are made with quality and safety in mind. I would never hesitate to buy or recommend Playtex products like these to anyone. 5/5 stars.	
1. 	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a stay open feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.	
1. 	These are really easy to use and are great for the stove.  However, I am unable to put all five on because of their size or maybe it is just the spacing on my oven.  I have four on, but I was unable to put the fifth one on because we have three knobs right next to each other.  Since this was the case, I did not put one cover over the oven knob.	
1. 	Received the crib recently, came less than a week after I ordered it, and everything was packed very nicely.We put it together last weekend and it looks gorgeous.The only issue was that some of the bolts did not easily work with the screws ... so it took a little bit to get the bed put together. We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material. I know it is a soft wood - so we'll need to be a little careful with it.It looked really high when we put it together, but now that the mattress is in it's fine.Very pleased with this choice.	
1. 	I started to prefer these bottles when my daughter was born in 2005.  I've had 2 more children (one in 2008 and the other in 2012), and each time we will try out different (and pricier) options before confirming once again, these bottles are the ones we prefer to use.  I can always find these at any grocery store, our babies have never had issues with spitting up or gas, and they do not leak.  My infant easily goes back and forth from this bottle to breast.You will have to disassemble these down to clean them properly.  Some prefer this, I find it a little annoying to keep track of so many pieces.I continue to purchase these for my son and have given this Newborn starter kit as a gift.  It comes with five bottles (2 stages) and 2 variations of the nipple (including slow speed which is critical for new babies and a faster flow as they become more accustomed to eating).  It's the perfect variety to get a new mom started.	
- 1	This didn't fit on our door rendering it useless.  I would imagine it would not fit on many doors since you can't have any molding on the door jam if you want to use it.	
1. 	This item works well. I found my lost brush after I bought these, still they work well.	
- 1	I loved the idea of this product but it is not worth your money. I should have listened to the other review that mentioned that the tweezers are in the closed position. You have to figure out a way to open them up and keep them open to be able to get anything. It would be much better if they were designed like normal tweezers where you just need to squeeze in order to close the points.	
- 1	I have had this product less than 2 weeks and the inside liner is pulled apart on the seams already.  I have never been more disappointed in a product.  I haven't really even used it to carry to capacity only a few bottles back and forth to daycare so I was really disappointed to notice that the inside was already ripped.	
- 1	This was a waste of money.  We couldn't get baby to stay still in it.	
1. 	We tried Avent first and my son never could drink from that big nipple very well.  I breastfed too he was good on both the bottle and breast.  When we used bottles Dr. Brown seem to cause less gas and he enjoyed them better.	
1. 	I was so pleasantly surprised by this baby mill! Here's some reasons why I love it:* It's small enough I keep it right on my countertop to blend up any fruits, veggies, or meals we're having.* The two cup bowl, blades and lid are all dishwasher safe!* It is so easy to use! Just place the lid on, lock it in place, put the motor on top and press down. You can pulse the food or keep pressing down to the desired consistency you'd like.* The price is pretty hard to beat, particularly since other more expensive baby mills don't seem to do as great a job.I really love this baby mill and am so glad I purchased it!	
- 1	I bought these shades because they are wider than any other I've found in stores, but that's pretty much all it has going for it.Pros:1) Wider than the ones I've been able to find in stores.Cons:1) The suction cups are useless.  They always seem to fall off either when I close the door or just randomly as I am driving.  I cannot even get the bottom suction cup to stick so the shade is left to dangle-- which could be a contributing factor to why it keeps falling off.  I had to use the top suction cups for a Brica sun shade and left it dangling and I never had an issue with it falling off.2) Cheaply made.  Thin and flimsy.  The Brica one I had previous to this was much sturdier, but I had returned that one because it wasn't wide enough.Update: However, the plus side to it being cheaply made is that the hooks are so thin that it bypasses by window's safety feature of automatically rolling back down when it detects something in the way.  I had originally avoided trying the hooks because with the Brica sun shade, the windows automatically rolled down when I tried to use its hooks.  But out of frustration of the shades falling down, I gave it a shot and my windows closed.3)  The side that faces outside to everyone else is white so it makes the logo stand out.  It's not even a good looking logo either.  Fortunately the logo is near the bottom so I just pull the shade down pass the window so it doesn't show.	
1. 	So far, so good.  My daughters room is chilly so she use to fuss A Lot when I'd change her.  Not anymore!  The wipes are nice and warm now and this warmer seems to be keeping up.  I've had it going for a couple months now and I've had a couple annoyances with it.  #1 annoyance is having to keep moisture in it (absorbent sponge in the bottom).  It's not major but I tend to forget about it.  Generally when you need to refill the warmer, you need to remoisten then pad in the bottom (as a busy parent, that's not always convenient and easy to forget about).  Oh, which leads me to annoyance #2, which is that it doesn't hold a standard stack of wipes. It takes about 75% of the Huggies pre separated stacks of wipes. Overall, I like it and my daughter appreciates it.	
1. 	We love this booster. My 3 year is still using it and I think he started using it around 18 months or so. We have solid oak chairs and didn't have the problem of other reviewers. It sits in the same chair almost all the time and there's no residue. Maybe it has more to do with the chair finishing. Your chair does need to be made of something to grip this chair, such as a wooden chair. I tried to take it to my dad's house and he has cooshy leather chairs, and it didn't work. It cleans extremely easily, holds him securely, and works better than I could have expected.	
- 1	My Newborn baby(who came long and about 8 pounds) dropped in the sling to the bottom hitting the stupid bump and when we remove the sling the stupid bump made it 'again' hard for us to adjust our son in the tub , this tub is not right for you if ur baby isn't small or tiny !We are not pleased with this tub Surely because of the BUMP!! it might be a good tub if the remove the bump and change the quality of the sling to make tighter so it will be much safer	
1. 	This is a must have for parents! What baby doesn't head straight for the power strip? It is easy to use, plesant on the eyes (it is white, not off white like the photo) and IMPOSSIBLE for babies to open!	
1. 	We bought a set for the bathtub, and one for the playroom and my little girl really gets a lot of enjoyment out of these.	
1. 	These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields. I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable. I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort. I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher a few times, too and they distorted a little but it didn't really affect their use.	
- 1	This thing barely sticks to the table and my nine month old baby very easily pulls it of of the table.  I will not buy again.	
1. 	This arrived super quick!  I ordered it on Tuesday night and it was on my doorstep on Friday afternoon.  It arrived in perfect condition.  It was pretty easy to put together, it only required a philips screwdriver to put it together.  Make sure you have plenty of room to put it together and two sets of hands.  I tried to put it together by myself and some of my boards banged together and it did leave some marks.  But other than that the product arrived perfect and the color was beautiful, I ordered espresso.  I am very pleased with the crib.	
- 1	Didn't fit our oven because the handle was in the way.  It would help if the product description included something about this.	
- 1	I have to send this stroller back, because of major problems I had with it.Firsts of all my 7 month old son fills the sit and he is 28 inches tall and 19 lb.Secondly sun shade is a joke! Doesn't give much protection and when I adjust it to the front it falls down but itself. I also purchased the additional shade, but here it goes third flow- it is ok for me to push stroller, I am 5'6. My husband is 5'11 and he hits the back wheels with every step he takes, because they not spaced far enough apart (seriously- only 8 3/4 space between the back wheels).Overall stroller seems durable, but I better spend more money and go something we both can use.	
1. 	Being a new mom after many years is a wonderful feeling! I love the ease of using these bottles. It is must better to just toss the liner when baby is done instead of cleaning bottles every night. It makes being a mom so much easier! I would highly recommend these to any new parents.	
1. 	PROS:Colors are bright and eye catching! Extremely cute!Keeps EVERYTHING off of my daughters clothes!!!Does not seep through!Easy to rinse! In the sink and hang dry!Drys quickly!Less mess in your kitchen and to have to clean up!CONS :Cant think of Anything YET! Will keep you updated!	
- 1	This is a USELESS product. Can't smell anything. Doesn't do anything to contain odors. A complete waste of money! I should've listened to the reviews which stated this! Don't buy it. Period. Zero stars if possible!	
1. 	I wanted to give this a rating of 3.5 but thought overall I'm happy with it and it's closer to a 4, so it got the 4/5 stars. We bought this dresser to match our Storkcraft crib and glider. Once assembled, they look BEAUTIFUL as a set in our baby's nursery. However the process to getting the dresser assembled was a frusterating one.. Like others who have posted their feedback, the instructions were terrible!! Had they been a little clearer from the get go, we could've shaved off some valuable time putting it together. Once we figured out the basics of which piece was which, and not really looking at the instructions but figuring out for ourselves where things went, assembly went much smoother. I'm not a particularly handy person,'but was able to figure it out after a few frusterating moments (some pictures dont match the pieces, some holes are not where the pictures say they should be..)Our dresser came with all the needed pieces, and with all the holes drilled for us in the right places (just didnt match the instructions) except for the back where there were no holes and we had to put the nails in ourselves.4 things we did NOT like:1. No holes for back pieces to be put on, you need to drill your own holes into the side edges to get the back piece installed or you will crack the wood. Luckily it's the back and so we didnt care as much what it looked like, ie if the nails were crooked.2. Back pieces didnt fit properly to cover dresser back, so we couldn't nail one piece in place (the one behind the cupboard door part) so now if we open the door and push a little on the shelf inside, it pushes the back board b/c it couldnt be securely installed. Thinking of just staple gunning it in place.3. The drawers are very shallow. The front of the drawer is deceiving because it's much taller,'but the actual drawer is a lot more shallow.4. The drawer runners are short (unlike the pic in the instructions thay show they should go all the way) so you can't open drawers fully. Someoen else mentioned if you want, you can buy longer runners and switch them out.All in all i'm happy with how it looks, and is doing the job we bought it for. Now will see if it stands the test of time.	
1. 	Our daughter uses 2 sippy cups a day.  I was disappointed when a couple of our valves broke.  There are slits in the ends of these valves that allow them to both keep a seal & to allow the liquid the flow.  A couple of the slits broke & the sippy cups were no longer functional.I went to a big box baby products store looking for these.  An employee told me that these were not sold because Playtex wants to sell more sippy cups.  She suggested that I had to throw away my cups & buy completely new cups.  Instead I came onto Amazon & found these.  I was so grateful!  We now have extra valves in case more break.	
- 1	One friend recommended this for our baby registry  as a must-have. I can use it five times in a row in the exact same spot on the baby's (or my) forehead and get five different readings. Our pediatrician actually said not to use it, which we found out after buying it. If you want an accurate result or are truly concerned for an infant's temperature you should be doing a rectal temp.	
1. 	It was great to know that the replacement parts were so inexpensive. These made it possible to have extra parts in my pump at all times.	
- 1	But I'm not surprised that neither the medium nor large fit me. I am a 34E/F and wear a medium Bravado seamless nursing bra (for reference) comfortably. This was impossible to fit properly. The medium was the right band, too tight/not enough fabric up top. The large was so loose I could pull it up over my breasts without unzipping! To make matters worse, the holes are cut within 2 of the band!? Wrong orientation for nipples, medela. I am ticked that nursing bra companies think they can get away with lumping sizes together... A 32G and a 42A are NOT the same size!!! Looks like I get to save my $$ and butcher one of my sports bras, yay.	
- 1	We bought this video monitor, set it up in our infant's room before she was born.  It worked great initially.  After our daughter was born, we turned it on and the video display was grey- only a shadow of an image day and night.  Because it worked initially, we got rid of the packaging, so can't return.  Thank goodness the sound is good- we will use for that- a very expensive audio monitor...	
- 1	I needed a monitor for my child's room who is about to transition from a crib to a bed.  The video is grainy in any light.  At night, I couldn't tell if my child was standing up and moving or if it was just the video pixelating.  The video would go in and out and while I could see my child crying, I wouldn't hear it on the monitor sometimes.  Very frustrating and promptly returning.  The loud beeping when it was out of battery after 2 hours was also very annoying.  No mute on that.  Bought the Lorex LW2004 instead and the video quality is far superior in the dark and all the functions actually work on it.	
1. 	My husband and I were beside ourselves with our newborn trying to find a bottle that she would like and wouldn't create extra air. She was very gassy!We tried everything... Dr. Browns, Tommy Tippee, and Gerber and none of them worked... plus the Dr. B and Tommy Tippee are much more expensive. She finally liked the Playtex Ventaire!! The key is the WIDE nipples... I am nursing as well and you have to get the wide nipples.The only thing is the fast nipples (which is what they come with) are way too fast... (we started her on these bottles at 4wks... I had to buy the wide MEDIUM flow WIDE nipples and they work great). She's now 7 wks and the fast nipples are still too fast... we just tried this am! Good luck to you but definitely give these a try.	
- 1	I hate these. I much prefer the  NUK shields.  These don't stick, they slide around all over the place and are really hard for the baby to use.  It got SO messy feeding my baby with these, I felt like it wasted milk because it got everywhere.  Hated these.  The NUK ones are so much better and the nipple part is exactly the same shape, but the silicone is softer for baby and sticks better to mommy!!	
1. 	The mattress is still wrapped in plastic as the baby will be born in May and my child care will begin in July.  It fits the DaVinci crib thank goodness.	
1. 	I use these at night when I nurse to catch the let-down on the side baby is not eating from.  It's a great way to build up a little extra for bottle feedings.  I hate wasting precious breastmilk!	
1. 	This exersaucer is my duaghter's favorite, and I couldn't live without it!! She is always, and constantly, entertained by it. We began using it when she was 4 months old and she is now almost 7 months and she uses it all day long! There isn't a day that goes by that she doesn't play in it! The toys are very safe, she pulls and tugs and chews on them, without any problems. I've even washed the cloth flag and frog because she saturates them, and they wash easily and hold up beautifully. Cant' say enough about it!	
1. 	I've always used Gerbers and to be honest, I never know what I'm going to get when I open the package, but I do know that I'm disappointed in the absorbency of Gerbers and started looking for something better. I've had the Kushies for a couple of weeks now and I'm pleased with them. They don't appear to be thicker than Gerber, but they do feel denser. They are also larger. So if you fold them down, it's like having a double diaper without the bulk. The Kushies are also softer than Gerber. The cost is more than Gerbers, but I only need to use one of Kushies to two of Gerbers. Less laundry with Kushies as I'm only using one. I will buy more of the Kushies.	
- 1	i have to first say that this seat is very sturdy and safe which is obviously paramount when it comes to car seats.  however, this seat is a pain and almost every time i use it i mutter to myself something about how much i dislike it.  first i would say that the seat is heavy and cumbersome and i am sure that there are seats out there that are lighter and smaller.  next i would say that the carry handle does not move into a back position easily at all; i am constantly trying to click the round circles in in order to move the bar back to get my son into the seat.  lastly i would say that the pull strap to tighten the shoulder straps is pretty tough to pull.  again, this is a safe seat but i feel as though you can find a seat just as safe without all of these drawbacks.  it also doesn't help that the seat is so expensive and yet i get frustrated with it every time i use it.	
1. 	I bought this for my granddaughter who is just over a year and is wanting to &#34;do it herself&#34;. She gets about as much in her lap as her mouth.  This is a big help to save some of the food from hitting the floor.	
- 1	You get what you pay for. These towels are thin and not very absorbent. The certainly don't keep my little one warm when he's just out of the bath. Save your money and buy one nice hooded towel. You don't really need more than one.	
- 1	Doesn't fit on all water bottles.  It's easier to just teach your toddler to drink from a water bottle.  I would not recommend.	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
- 1	I was on bedrest at the hospital for most of my pregnancy so I bought a lot of my baby gear online without being able to see the items in person.  I wanted to love this stroller but when I finally got home after delivering the baby, I found that this stroller was HUGE!  It was impossible to load this in and out of the trunk while recovering from a c-section.  Not to mention, it barely fit in my trunk.  I have both a hatch-back sedan and and SUV.  It barely fit in the hatchback and took up most of the trunk space in my SUV.  I saw a lot of the same issues that other reviewers complained about.  The wheels wobble when walking at a brisk speed, the storage basket falls of its supports, and there is very little shock absorbance at all when going over gravel or thick grass.  Purchasing this stroller was a big mistake.  Since it was too late to return it, I gave it away (I posted it on Craigslist for weeks for $80 and nobody ever responded) and bought a Britax B-Agile travel system.  Now I'm happy!	
1. 	I bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was BPA free. When I got it home and opened it I saw the dreaded #7 recycle code on the white part. I contacted Baby Bjorn to clarify. Here is what they said:BABYBJ&Ouml;RN and Plastic Safety: When it comes to the material used in the production of our products, we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety. To guarantee the safety of our plastic products, all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Kitchen and Bathroom products are tested by Specialized Technology Resources (STR), an independent global provider of quality assurance testing. All plastics used in the production of our Kitchen products fulfill the demands of the European (EEC),and the American (FDA) Standard for plastics, and are classified as food-safe. Through testing, all of our Kitchen products have been designated PVC-free, phthalates-free and lead-free. Recent studies by health organizations such as the National Institute of Health have raised concerns about the safety ofBisphenol-A (BPA) in plastic products. BPA is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic.Polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach BPA. Polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any BABYBJ&Ouml;RN baby products and all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN products with a plastic component are BPA-free. More specifically, the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN plate is made of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic which is certified BPAfree. While both polycarbonate and ABS, along with other plastics, have a recycling designation of 7, there is no knownhealth risk associated with ABS.I decided to keep it and see how it goes, even though I prefer using glass or stainless steel items. I like that this one is NOT made in China, like so many things tend to be.	
1. 	We went through several brands of bibs before settling on the Bumkins brand  These are far and away the best. Where we had issues with the others of developing some pretty bad stink, these ones are super easy to wash and clean and take a ton of wear and tear, coming out victorious.  Bib 1 - toddler 0.	
1. 	This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!	
1. 	I just love carrying the baby around in my Baby Bjorn. It soothes the baby when he sleeps. I can take him out in cold weather and feel his body heat against my sweater while covering him under my coat.	
- 1	The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing.  It was given to me as a gift, a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due.  In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times.  Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy!  The boppy is collecting dust.  Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up!  I still can't stand the boppy for nursing, but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up!	
1. 	I've had my Kidco for 2 years and I've not had a problem yet...although I'm known to take really good care of things.  I do not put the blades in the dishwasher, I wash with soap and water and boil in water to sterilize.  Sometimes I throw the plastic compartment in the dishwasher if I'm feeling a bit lazy and won't need it right away.  I make larger batches of food and freeze them so I've never had a problem pureeing anything smooth.  I do steam most everything before I blend which may make it easier too.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  There are no bells and whistles, just a simple design.	
1. 	My son has been using this seat and loves it.  I think two greatest things about this potty are how soft it seat is and how good the guard is.  I will agree with some reviewers that say the guard is hard plastic but my son works around it and doesn't complain.  Would definitely purchase again.	
1. 	I took the side attachments off (it's great to have that flexibility with the product) and just use it to store diapers and have the wipes warmer sitting on top. It's convenient and easy and saves space, which is a premium in my world!	
1. 	With all the bells and whistles out today on baby products, all you want is for your baby to be safe and comfortable in their tub.  This is definitely the case with this tub.  It is contoured perfectly to cradle your newborn and the padded backrest keeps him/her from slipping.  I did not use the cradle, although it is a nice feature, because I felt it made my baby too cold.  This simple design works perfect and fits on single and double sinks.  I love that I will be able to use it into toddlerhood.  The plug and built in wash basin are convenient added features.	
1. 	We bought a house that for all the other dumb stuff the sellers were asked to do after our inspection both personal and VA, they didn't have issue with the openings between the rails on the stairway. My older daughter could not just fit her head through but her whole body with no effort!  They are the typical late sixties rails and are metal. Before you scoff and say how you would just replace them with code wooden ones I implore you to look up the cost of a single family home in the DC Metro area of Potomac and you will likely gulp as you swallow your words!  So this netting is a much more viable and affordable option. Easy to install and very sturdy if you attach it properly. Once my girls are old enough I will get rid of the netting and gates and maybe even reclaim the living room as an adult room. Until then this item is a great purchase to keep children safe.	
- 1	It's a cute bag that holds three bottles in one side and food in the other side; however, on the bottle side the inside lining ripped all the way across within two weeks so the cold packs won't keep the bottle cold any more.  Waste of money.	
- 1	This chair is cute and minimalist.  But upon receipt, I noticed that it has the standard flame retardant label affixed. So I contacted customer service to find out what type of flame retardant was used (something safer like hydrated silica or the conventional halogenated ULTRA TOXIC flame retardant) and got no response.  Toxic flame retardant has been found to negatively affect children's neurological development.#  Why it's used in high chairs is beyond me. This probably means that Inglesina is using the toxic form. Not what I want my baby on for 2-3 hours a day.	
- 1	This stopped working correctly, shortly after I got it.  When I try to use the ocean or white noise sounds, the machine shuts off after just a few seconds (even after putting in new batteries.)  Also, it no longer starts up in the same mode that was last used, like it used to do when I first got it.I'm unable to return it, because the person who got it for my baby shower bought it ahead of time, so now it's past the window of time where I'm able to return it.Loved it for the short period of time that it actually worked.:(	
- 1	I bought these toilet seat covers because we were going on vacation. They are nice and cover the toilet well. Unfortunately, the tape is USELESS. There are 2 pieces of tape at the front of the cover. However, ALL public toilets have U-shaped seats and there is NO SEAT at the very front. So, there is nothing for the 2 pieces of tape to stick too. So, you can't stick the cover onto the toilet. Also, I don't think you can flush them which is annoying.	
- 1	Chose this one explicitly because it has a tension mount but when it arrived it needed to be screwed into the wall, which we can't do as the wall in question has marble edging, which I'm definitely not drilling into.Disappointing...	
1. 	Really they should hand these out at the hospital. Ever tried to change a crib sheet in the middle of the night while your kids has either puked or peed on it. No one is happy, everyone is crying. This simplifies all of that and still lets you have and see your adorable sheet set you overpaid for. The snaps are so much easier to deal with and the sheet is super absorbent. We have two so if there is an accident - one gets replaced while the dirty one is washed.	
- 1	I got these to bottle feed by normally breastfed 2 month old while I am at work.  I was previously using Dr. Brown's #1 nipples.  The flow from these nipples is too fast.  My baby kept gasping from too much milk.  It is also a little annoying that they have a wide mouth because you can't interchange the tops with the other bottles.  I think I'll stick with what I already have.	
- 1	If I could give this product zero stars, I would. Although it has excellent features, the monitor doesn't work. It consistently would lose signal and beep. With a new born baby, I don't need more reasons not to sleep. Not to mention the nights when it just completely stopped working, with no way of knowing that until you wake up to your baby crying but not hearing it through the monitor. Luckily we have a small enough house I could hear him anyway. Which is another reason why the monitor should NEVER has lost signal in our small house.	
- 1	Not what we were looking for at all. The product is sturdy but did not keep my infants head in place.	
- 1	Everything about this stroller just irritated me. The instructions were wordless pictures that had arrows pointing in the wrong directions at times. When folded down into a conveniently thin design that could be easily put anywhere, the thing came up to past my knee cap. There were too many parts that didn't end up on the final product, which was just a little unsettling for me. I refused to put my daughter in something that claims to be finished, and yet has 30 bolts, screws, and pieces strewn across the floor all around it. To be honest, everything was just too much. I hated this product, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry.	
1. 	I was a bit sceptical about buying this at first because I didn't think it was that safe but I'm going on vacation with LO soon and I needed something and this got good reviewsa so I tried it. Its fantastic! She loves being right at the table with us and it is VERY sturdy! Can't say enough good things about it	
1. 	We ordered this to use with the co-sleeper. The color matches exactly the sleeper,we ordered the toffee, but its kind of a dull color, the green would have probably been nicer. The sheet fits snugly and is easy to get on and off and once washed it soft and not to chaffy for the baby. Overall a good product.	
1. 	My son is little so it may not be good for larger kids starting to potty train. He's about 27 pounds age 21 months.Get some of those disinfectant wipes and clean it out each time and you're good. (Wear gloves and wash your hands after too.)Fits in a small space in my small bathroom without an issue.	
- 1	What I received was NOT a Medela plug!! The sticker on the package said Medela, but that is not what I received. It wasn't even what was in the picture. Thankfully I was able to call Medela and they replaced it for FREE with the proper adapter. Not only was it not what it said it made my pump work at half power!!	
1. 	Feeding himself (and the dog) is a must for our 10 month old.  These bibs work great as a catch-all and keep most of the food off of his clothes and off the floor.  They are easy to clean and are a big hit in our household.	
- 1	*Update*3/29/14 1 StarI'm updating this review because the second time I used it, the bag came apart where the zipper for the main pocket is.  I only put it in the washer this time and had planned on line drying it after my first one had issues.  I looked at the washing instructions on the bag itself this time and it says machine wash cold, tumble dry.  This is exactly what I did for BOTH bags and they BOTH came apart.  I am currently contacting Skip*Hop about their warranty.  You would think a brand like them would take greater pride in their products.  Clearly this one just missed the mark in the quality control department.  Bottom line is, this is hand wash only, and I don't expect it would survive a year or more while a child is in diapers.3/21/14 3 Stars-I was really excited when I saw this was available for preorder to match my Skip Hop diaper bag.  I ordered two right away and was happy when I finally got them in the mail.  Fast forward two weeks later when I finally got to use one, it worked perfectly.  I really like the dry and wet side, making diaper changes on the go just that much easier.  We are currently in newborn diapers, and thus this bag holds several, but it will be interesting to see how many it will hold once we are in larger sizes.The only down side is that the white inside part WILL MELT if you put it in the dryer.  When I first saw it I thought the inside waterproof layer felt a little cheap, but I didn't read the wash instructions at first. I guess I was just too excited because it's just so gosh darn cute, but boy did I learn my lesson.  Once we finally got to use it, and then wash and dry it, my husband pulled it out of the dryer and it looked like our dog had gotten to it.  He hadn't of course, but boy is it ruined now.  I would have happily paid a little extra for something I didn't have to fuss with come laundry time.  Luckily I have some water proof fabric left over from some baby projects and I plan to fix it myself, but buyer beware, DO NOT DRY THIS PRODUCT!	
- 1	I used this straw cup to put my toddler's water and juice.  It leaks quite a bit especially if you don't screw it tight enough.  The unit is also difficult to clean with so many parts to take apart.  So not so toddler friendly afterall.  Recommend the Skip Hop Zoo straw bottle.	
1. 	these are perfect! they are a tight fit in our 7 year old outlets. they take a lot of work by an adult to get out much less a child. i think maybe the people who reviewed them as being too loose had older homes where the outlets may be different.	
- 1	I thought this would be perfect for misshapen windows. It was at first - as far as the fit. It easily covered the passenger windows...for a few days. It slowly pulled itself together to a square barely 8x8 inches. I switched back to the sun shades the hospital gave us for free!And sun protection?? Nada. None. What? Who thinks this is blocking sun. The bare window blocks more sun than this product.This had potential but is an unfortunate miss.	
1. 	I couldn't get the suction cups to stick to the wall and ended up having to nail it up but it works great	
1. 	I always hated the way a newborn shudders when you use a cold wipe on their little bottom.  Wipe warmer to the rescue.  I purchased this three years ago for my daughter and are now using it with my newborn.  Although it is not a necessity, it certainly is a luxury.  My 3 month old definitely knows the difference when I use a cold wipe away from home.  It is important to check the pad frequently and keep it moist to avoid drying out the wipes.  Other than that, it is a great product.  You don't know what you are missing until you use it and then you won't want to do without it.	
- 1	We got each of our toddlers one of these for Christmas. One turtle and one ladybug.  One of the colors on the turtle went out the 2nd night and we returned it and got a replacement.  It's been working ok so far.  But then last night, 2 of the colors on the ladybug stopped working.  We haven't even had it 60 days!!  I wrote the company and they said the LED lights should last up to 3,000 hours...but they don't and you can't replace them.  I can understand one bad egg but two?  I'm sad because my kids love those and they are so cute...but they're turning out to be a total waste of money...	
- 1	This drying rack is very cheaply made and didn't last a week.  Spend a few more dollars for something better.	
- 1	I really like the material of these bibs.  It makes them so easy to wipe clean.  However, these do not work for us because of the pocket.  The pocket sticks out so much that it won't fit between my daughter and her high chair.  She is one now so maybe when she gets taller  the pocket will be above the tray enough so she can wear it.  But for now they are useless for us.	
- 1	I really REALLY wanted to like this shell and this brand.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the diaper inserts by Alva- amazing.  The shells, however, are less great.  My daughter peed once, and the whole back of her pants were soaked- I don't think the shell material is waterproof... Also around the leg holes, there is a single elastic whereas other diapers (Best bottom) have 2.Again, great diaper inserts, but i'm going back to my Best bottom shells...	
- 1	Folk is normal size but the spoon is too big, it's strange... it is very cute and case is nice, everything is good except this part...	
- 1	Didn't suck, poor seal, totally useless compared to the cheap blue aspirator from the hospital. I threw this away after two attempts to use it. The second star is only for ease of cleaning.	
1. 	he likes chewing this.  we let him have it for several minutes at a time, which produces a lot of saliva thus 'washing' his teeth.  we will probably get 1-2 more since he wanders around the house with it in his mouth and would also get one for a friend of his.	
1. 	These are great cups.  My toddler loves them and they appear to be a great quality.  I don't put them through the dishwasher becuase I am not sure if the print on the outside would come off.  Easy to drink from but doesn't spill easily.	
- 1	As you can see in the picture the bottles are (supposed) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones. I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free. I wanted them to be completly clear. When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind. If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund. But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear (non BPA free) ones anymore :( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind, but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this.	
1. 	i used similar-looking bibs that i'd gotten from babiesrus, but when i tried to rinse them with soapy water, the plastic separated from the fabric over time. These bibs are washable, waterproof (like cup-upside-down-on-bib-but-clothes-are-dry waterproof) and i love that they velcro on the side.	
- 1	en serio, como se les ocurre hacer un bobo sin tapa, por dios cada vez que el bebe los quiera usar hay que lavarlos, es imperdonable un error como es.	
1. 	My daughters had cups like these when they were young and they were great for playing in the bath tub, wading pool and sandbox.  My 20 month granddaughter loves her set just as much and has gotten a lot of use out of them.	
1. 	We have a Fisher Price Jumperoo, a Kolcraft walker, and the Baby Einstein Entertainer. At first, I was convinced the Entertainer was best, then it seemed like the baby liked to jump more. Then when we got the walker, it seemed like that was all he wanted.Over time, the Entertainer won out. The walker is still interesting, but my 6-mo old son figured out all its tricks pretty quickly. He still likes the walking, bumping, grabbing at things in his extended reach. But that jumperoo's time was really limited. Now, he can stand it for just 10 mins before he wants out.I am glad to have all of the products, they all served their purpose. But I'm especially glad for the Entertainer's longevity. There's a LOT of activity here. My son played with two toys for a very long time, then moved on to two other toys, then realized his ability to spin in place, then realized that some toys reached his mouth to chew on. He's really circling back to some of the earlier toys now.Since it extends a bit it's grown with him and, though he can stand nearly by himself, it's still supporting him properly when he wobbles.When I realized that the product (the little soft blocks) had undergone a recall (they used to have plastic on them) I was freaked out. But then I checked and that was back in 2005, and they fixed the problem. I'm so glad it stayed on the market. This is one great toy.	
- 1	It says that X-small will fit a woman size 2 and 4. Not true!!!. I'm barely 2 and the x-smal didn't feel comfortable if you are carrying a baby. I felt like my baby couldn't breath. Also it is very complicated to use, you really need to take a tutorial. In my opinion is expensive, difficult to use and wrong sized.	
1. 	Better than most of the crap child-proofing products out there that I've bought. Makes me feel better about the low windows in my 4-year-old's room.	
1. 	Even though my preschooler is 4 years old, I still use this when we go out to public restrooms.  This way, I don't have to freak out about him touching every where.	
- 1	We loved this seat until today our baby girl was choking on something while we were driving.  Of course, we stopped to help her and found that she had chewed off and swallowed some of the black felt used for padding on the arm straps.  This is completely unacceptable for a car seat!  The item should be recalled immediately.  Even if your child doesn't choke on it, the material cannot be good for them to eat.	
- 1	returning these because they were absolutely gigantic. I could fit my 16 year old  in this if I wanted to. the newborn is very small and then the medium it's probably 10 times the size of a newborn size.	
- 1	I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!	
- 1	My child is breastfed -- she's still using a size one bottle nipple and she can down a bottle in less than a minute an ounce. The first time I gave her this cup she drank out of it just fine, but she sucked so hard that the nipple collapsed. There are two small slits in the top and apparently that wasn't enough for my child.	
1. 	I really like this changing pad. I like that it has a full four-sided shape. Some reviews say that it's difficult to find covers that fit it, but I bought 2 Carter's changing pad covers and they work perfectly. It seems large enough to hold my baby for a while, and it has a nice strap to help keep her fastened in there. Overall, a good buy.	
- 1	The nail clippers,hairbrush, and comb are great but I did not care for the rest. It would be cost effective to buy the items seperately from this company.	
- 1	I gave this diaper 2 tries and then got rid of it. The sizing is definately on the small side. The large barely fit my 26lb girl. The rise was fine, it just didn't want to wrap around very well. It was only absorbant enough for about one pee (by the way, make sure you have a waterproof cover over it). I just didn't like that much bulk for so little absorbancy. I found that (in my own opinion) for a good low price fitted diaper, Green Mountain Diaper Workhorse fitteds are much better. They're made out of a prefold, so there's many layers of absorbancy instead of cotton filling like the Dappi contoured.	
- 1	I wanted to like this bottle but using it was a nightmare. It leaked all over the place, from every seam, no matter what position it was in. I thought I was going crazy. Who would make a bottle this poor in quality and at this high cost per piece? I asked my iron man of a husband (6'4 and a professional firefighter) to tighten all parts to make sure I wasn't going weak and it still leaked everywhere. My mom tried it too, but formula dribbled horribly, even with the warming cap still on the bottom. Once its off, just go ahead and get your mop out. Geez Louise. We never actually fed our newborn son with the bottle, so I cannot even comment on his acceptance or rejection of the nipple. I would give it ZERO stars if that were a rating option. Very disappointing, especially at this price.	
1. 	This wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it is very cute. The part of it that makes the sounds is a bit bulky. Its very soft and has a velcro tab to wrap around the crib and there is a timer for the sounds to play.	
1. 	I bought this pillow when my pregnant back started aching at around 14 weeks.  I have used it every day since then!!! I love cuddling with it and now that I am about to give birth I find the pillow that much more supportive! I highly recommend.  I also recommend you get some kind of pillow case for it as it comes with a cover, but it is extremely difficult to take off and put back on when you decide to wash it.	
1. 	We've had the Dekor for 8 months now and are very pleased with it.  It's easy to use, looks good, and mostly keeps the stinky diaper smell out of the nursery.  I mean, you have a bag full of poopy diapers....I think no matter what trashcan you use some stink is going to get out.  But I love that with the Dekor bags you can just cut it off wherever you want and toss it in the trash without feeling like you're wasting a bag.  One thing that could be made better, though, is to have the lid swing all the way open when you're changing the bag cartridge out.	
1. 	My mother bought me this to help me sleep during my pregnancy. This is my first pregnancy so very quickly I found it hard to sleep on my sides 100% of the night... I usually flop between each side or end up on my back.I am not that far along right now so its hard to sleep with the pillow. I know it will be a lot better when I can rest my belly on it once I am bigger. but for now since I am still able to roll on my back i find myself in akward positions on the pillow and waking up with a sore shoulder.the cover is very itchy and you are going to want to take it off and wash it in some hot water with fabric softener to get that scratchy feeling out of it. And be patient when trying to shove the pillow back into the cover.The other plus is my cats totally love it! It is big though, so if you are sharing a small bed with someone it will be an adjustment. Luckilly we have a nice king size bed so there's room for the pillow and everyone else.	
1. 	It is for my baby,and it is fit for our baby, maybe i will buy more and more.I like it.	
- 1	Not sure if it is clear in the description, but this wedge has two pieces of foam and a zipper up the back.  The zipper can actually be felt at the bottom front of the wedge.  I can't really lay my son in the middle of this wedge, because the zipper from the back causes a hard bump at the bottom, front, middle of this wedge.  Also, there is not much of an incline with this wedge.  Overall, just not a great product and I wish I would not have purchased this.	
- 1	Material is very rough and  cheap .after seeing it I didn't even use it on my baby's skin coz it felt so harsh and rough just touching it so I was worried it would cause him rash .I wasn't expecting a lot considering the price but just a softer cloth but this was a huge disappointment.I have kept these for cleaning his toys now	
- 1	I bought these cups based on the reviews here. My daughter was just weaned and I wanted to try a bunch of cups to figure out which were best. I had to teach her with a different brand straw cup, but she can now use these cups fine. She still leaks a bit from it, so if you want something leak proof, this is not cup for you.Edit: I am changing my review after getting tired of having my daughter pull the straw out and spill stuff on the floor. Buy a nuby or munchkin.	
1. 	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months. She laughs continously when I turn this on. It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready. My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib, it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little, however a little padding under it has solved the problem. I have never used the remote, so I can't comment on it.	
- 1	We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.Wrong!!The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.The woman who answered at Customer Service kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was just ducky but your service was DOA!Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White	
1. 	I really miss the old seat that didn't have the attachment. This seat does the job and you will not need it long. I think it a must since baby tends to fall over a lot in the tub when they first begin to sit up.	
1. 	I love munchkin brand. They come up with some great ideas. These work wonderfully. It took my 2yr old a couple tries to figure this out but she quickly picked up on it and it is working wonderfully for us	
- 1	I have two year old twin girls who have made it their mission to figure out child safety locks. Some locks take longer than others, this one took them under an hour. Not the most creative design, but might do the trick for an unmotivated toddler.	
- 1	One friend recommended this for our baby registry  as a must-have. I can use it five times in a row in the exact same spot on the baby's (or my) forehead and get five different readings. Our pediatrician actually said not to use it, which we found out after buying it. If you want an accurate result or are truly concerned for an infant's temperature you should be doing a rectal temp.	
- 1	We bought this without really taking time to research it because we were in a rush over the summer and needed a booster to use at a relatives house who doesn't have one.  I wish I read the reviews first, because I would have bought the on the go booster instead.  Oh well, that's the beauty of heindsight I guess.  :-PThis seat serves it's purpose.PROS:Hard plastic seat and tray is easy to cleanStraps, once assembled and fastened, stay tightTray is removableFolds up for storageGood for light use, I wouldn't use it everyday- read the cons and you'll understandCONS:Tray is HARD to remove, you have to grasp and pull the sides JUST SO to get it to pop off (I have to struggle to stiffle an array of 4-letter words quite often when trying to take the tray off)It's cumbersum to set up and fold down and you'll need both hands to do both (we use the on-the-go booster at my mother-in-law's and I can open it with one hand, plop my daughter in the seat, strap her in, and strap the booster seat to the chair easily).  First you need to untangle the straps, make sure they're going in and coming out of all the right places, THEN you can put your toddler in first and attach the booster to the seat next or vice versa.  The removable tray is nice, but again, a struggle to take off more often than not.  To fold it back down, you'll need both hands once again to push buttons on either side of the seat to pop up the seat and fold it in, then put the tray in with the rest of it, and spend another minute or two organizing the straps so they don't get tangled up with each other or come apart from the seat itself (even after the straps are assembled going in and out of all the right places, they just fall back out if you're not really careful).This seat isn't bad for us, we only use it at relatives houses who don't have a booster seat, so it's not too much of a hassle.  (It's only been used a half a dozen times in the past year)  But I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to use it more than once a month.  The removable tray is nice, and it is easy to clean, but between the hassle of removing the tray, having to use 2 hands to set it up and fold it back down, and the straps that fall out way too easily when not fastened, it's too much hassle for everyday use.  If you need a booster to use more often, I'd recommend the on-the-go booster seat.	
- 1	What can you say about these really? They were around $3, you get 2 pairs, they are organic cotton, they are sewn together rather sloppily and for some reason they all have bows - which is awkward if you have a boy baby. I removed the bows from ours - but then didn't even end up using these as they were a little large and kept falling off of his hands anyway. By the time they fit he didn't need them anymore.So basically - they are sloppy looking and don't really fit and there is no way to customize the fit. I much prefer these:guavamitts 1 pack neutral baby mittens : dots (cream). Not only do they look 100% better, but you can customize the fit around the wrists. Yes, they cost 4x as much but you might be able to actually use them while your child still needs them. They are made out of bamboo and organic cotton so they are also very soft - and reversible so it can match your child's clothing.	
1. 	Glad I went ahead and bought the bigger size. I find it much more comfortable and I'm getting more milk	
- 1	Material looks disposable and I'm not sure if I will use it. I would have preferred something thicker and pay a little more for it.	
1. 	My son graduated from crib to 3-side bed super early so the pack and play had to go be replaced for travel all too soon.  This is super light weight, easy to use and a good step up from a pack and play.  It doesn't take up much room in the car and he quickly recognized it as his place to sleep.  I do recommend adding a sheet.  It's the same size as most cot sheets (like for school), so we use the set that we had to purchase for daycare.	
- 1	This snail was great at first. My 8month old very quickly learned how to start it and loved it.However, the batteries soon wore out and now only last a day or two.There is something wrong with the motor design for this to happen.It does need an ON/OFF button.	
- 1	I bought this thermometer to have on hand for our newborn because I thought this was as quick as they come.  I wish I would have found the much quicker (less than 10 seconds) thermometers first and not wasted time and money on this one.  It takes too long for us and doesn't seem to be accurate (seems like it reads cooler than the actual temp).	
- 1	I bought this item hoping to have a gentle light and soft music or ambient noise, what I got looked like I brought a 60&#34; TV into my son's crib. The light is extremely bright and the music is far too loud. This item did not soothe my baby, it stimulated him. Instead of having something soft to listen to and relax, but instead the bright lights and loud sound stimulated my baby into waking up, standing up in his crib, and just playing with the soother. It clearly is too stimulating for a soother product. This is the first amazon item I've purchased that I'm returning.	
1. 	Keeps our plugs covered and our LO can't get the plugs out of the wall which a plus :) Would recommend	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift and I was very excited about it at the time. Unfortunately, once my baby was born I found out that it was absolutely worthless!  I was disappointed at first because the white noise was so quiet, then a few days later the music stopped working, and then the light wouldn't turn off unless you unplugged the whole thing!  Eventually the music started skipping like a scratched cd. So basically the only thing that I can use it for is for the mp3 plug in, so it's junk and I never use it.  I'm bummed that my poor friend spent money on this stupid thing.	
- 1	I bought this bathmat for a number of reasons.  I usually love Safety 1st products, I have the matching faucet cover in that bathroom, and my son's bathroom is froggie-themed.  It seemed like the perfect no-slip mat, but it was too good to be true.  It doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub at all.  Weirdly enough, it does stick to the walls of the tub, but not the bottom.  I could live with that, since my son would be sitting on it to keep it down, except that it came shipped all rolled up, and after two weeks of pressing it flat, it still will not stay unrolled.  The moment I put it in the tub (dry!) it begins to roll back up, and add water and there is no chance it will stay down.  I am very disappointed - I had to go out and buy another mat.  I have ended up using it as wall-art, stuck to the side of the tub, and is very cute.  But it serves no purpose besides appearance there.	
1. 	Pretty good bib.  It works well at keeping my sons sleeves clean, but I did find a different long- sleeved bib I like better.  I prefer the version that has Velcro rather than tie strings and the elastic around the ends of the sleeves on this bib make it a little bit more difficult to get on a less than cooperative baby.	
1. 	These bibs are very durable and nicely cover the whole front of our 13 month old daughter.  Also, the sleek fabric is easily wipeable (and don't stain), and because the bibs are not hard or plasticky, they lay nicely and don't bunch up in my toddlers face while sitting. Love 'em!	
- 1	This product is not versatile nor effective enough for me to recommend it.  We got it as a gift and I tried using it every day for about two weeks and my baby would just look at me thinking are you crazy mom!? there is NO way I will sit still in this!  She would just squirm around trying to get out.  It is much too slow to do anything for a baby and is bulky and ugly and heavy as well!  I got a lot more use out of the Baby Bjorn Sitter which is a little more money but my baby likes it, sits in it for at least 10 minutes (that is a lot for her!) and it folds flat and does not require batteries.	
1. 	I like the idea of using this in my dishwasher to keep the baby's things separate, but to be honest, I usually on use the bigger basket..	
- 1	The 1st 4 or 5 times we used these bottles they worked perfect then each time we were feeding baby afterwards, breast milk began to leak from the air holes in the top.	
1. 	This product really does fit ALL toilets. We used it on the road at a hotel, and it fit on the hotel's elongated toilet. I highly recommend it.	
- 1	Works fine, but after 20 months the screen stopped working... I can no longer see what's going on when trying to adjust things. Also the buttons are confusing if you are fumbling with it in the dark.	
- 1	Hair sticks to these like no other.  Our baby didn't find them interesting at all.  A sophie giraffe  was much better.	
1. 	I had a few plastic bibs for my baby that were trimmed in ribbon/cloth even at the neck area. That meant that every time I fed him and food invariably stained the cloth trimmings, I would have to wash the plastic bibs and wait for the cloth bits to dry. These babybjorn bibs are great because they are all plastic, very easy to put on and take off, and can just be run under the sink or washed out with soapy water after the meal Great purchase.	
- 1	Purchased this for our Prius. It worked really great until it stopped working. Not really sure what happened, it was a hot day so maybe that had something to do with it. We kept trying to put it back up but after a few minutes it would just fall down again.	
1. 	Found these online cheaper, but I found that even with the &#34;Y&#34; cut...the cereal still had some problems coming out. So I had to cut them a bit more.	
1. 	This base is a great price on Amazon!  I borrowed the carrier from a friend, and I needed an extra base for my husband's car!  Amazon came through with flying colors!	
1. 	I used this for breast milk and baby food. The cubes were a little under an ounce. The lids were not very secure, but secure enough to keep freezer odors out. The cubes do not pop out easily and I had to run the tray under hot water to get the cubes out.	
1. 	I was given a full-size high chair as a shower gift. It was so large and bulky that I dreaded pulling it out of the corner and setting it up, and cleaning it afterwards.  So I bought this seat.  It works very well. Only took about a minute to get a perfect fit on our dining room chair.  I love that it is super easy to clean and is very compact.There are 2 reasons I didn't give this 5 stars, but I still love the seat.#1. The lift-off tray is useless. It doesn't snap all the way around the main tray, so my son flips it (and any food on it) on the floor within seconds.  So we only use the main tray that actually hooks to the seat.#2. I wish the tray would swivel instead of snapping completly on and off.	
1. 	Love these bibs. They clean up so easily. They are great for first foods when it's pretty liquid and just slides down the front of the bib. Our baby loves to suck his food off of the bib. It's a really nice texture for babies. I always just wash it off, wring it out, and strap it onto the high chair to dry out. Works great and is always dry by the next time we need it.	
- 1	I gave these away.  After going to the trouble of making baby food, I don't want it spilling and leaking everywhere.  The little tray idea was a great IDEA, but it takes up so much space in the freezer, its just not practical.  The lids don't stay on consistently.  Some were great, some weren't.  I reused old baby food jars that I washed in the dishwasher to sterilize instead.  Avoided the issues of plastic that way, anyway.	
- 1	I bought this for my baby who is teething. Unfortunately, he wasn't interested in it at all. However, my 2-1/2 year old loves to play with it! Ah well. I'm thinking it's the textures on the teething part of the toy that he wasn't thrilled about. Maybe if they were smooth.	
1. 	This gate is very simple to install, but time-consuming to get the perfect fit. I'd say it took me a solid half an hour the first time.  I recently moved it to a doorway and spent just 15 minutes (since I am now an experienced baby gate installer).  It is tension mounted with no hardware or tools required.  It does come with a little plastic wrench, which is useful for the final tightening once you have the gate in place. It does take quite a bit of elbow grease as well.I expected the gate to swing closed more easily. You have to stop and use your hand, foot, or knee to push it all the way closed - at least on mine. I do find myself using my hands most the time to make sure it's closed, but if I do have my arms full it can definitely be operated without my hands.My baby girl is 8 months old and spends a lot of time standing at the gate (and pulling on it).  I like that if she has her hands on the gate, there is nowhere for her fingers to get pinched as I open it.  Well, there is one place she could; if she ever messed with the foot pedal near the bar that it's connected to.  I have found that if I get my foot too close to that bar when operating the foot pedal, I get a good pinch.I am using the gate in a doorway and the door is able to close normally.  The braces come off the doorjamb just ever so slightly, but it is still secure.I have also used it in a hallway with one extension. In the hall, the top two braces were affixed on the wall, and the bottom two on floorboards, which come out about 1/2 and I still got a secure fit. The hall is 38 and one extension did the trick, but the extensions are about $16 so it could get expensive if you needed to make it wider.  The manufacturer recommends only going up to 44.  When I removed the gate from the hall there was damage to the wall under one of the top braces - it removed paint and texture.	
1. 	Works well to pad our Bob Revolution SE for our 5 month old. It can be reversed for the quilted side as well.	
1. 	This is a great pail. It doesn't hold a ton, but it doesn't smell bad and the top easily pops open when you push the foot pedal. Is not unattractive in the nursery either.	
- 1	Well when i first opened it up I almost sent it back right then. It was a cheaper feeling plastic than I was expecting and it seemed like it could be difficult to clean just because of the depth of the holes. But i gave it a try for a week. I only used the pressure grips because we cant put any holes in anything. It worked well for 2 days but then it started to not stay tight in the door way and we had to move it down to the second notch on the handel to keep it tight. Then the baby was standing up holding onto it (9mo old) and just the pressure of her pulling on it allowed it to fall on her twice. She was fine and its just plastic but still, this should not have happened. I dont know if the pressure grips and the type of paint on the doorway made it not hold (it is glossy) but we have a ten dollar wooden pressure gate from walmart that holds up just fine, and its been 2 months. so i went a head and bought another one of those.	
- 1	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old.  We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs.  I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy.  It worked great at first.  When he turned 4 months old I had problems.  I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it.  IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV.  With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier.  Never used it since	
- 1	Great idea, but did not hold up. We have a 6mo old and wanted to use this with the baby gate. saw a snag in the cover material that morning and thought maybe the gate messed it up. Well come to find out my little man scooting about on it pulls the plastic top up from the foam and it rips, leaving fun flaps of plastic he LOVES to pull at. The cats walking on it have left it dotted with holes as well. Very disappointing. No idea how one could expect to use it with a toddler	
- 1	I didn't like these towels. They are very thin, and my baby felt cold in them. Although I give it 2 stars cause I'm a rainforest fan	
1. 	This was the only blanket that my little one didn't kick out of. She used it until she was five months old and way too old to be swaddled. It's light weight, so she didn't get too warm, but also easy to tightly wrap. No annoying velcro in the wrong places, just soft stretchy fabric and plenty of it. I now buy this for every pregnant friend.	
1. 	I had extremely sore nipples even with a proper latch and my lactation consultant in the hospital suggested pumping.  She told me don't even bother with an electric pump if I had this one.  I was skeptical and bought a playtex embrace as well just in case.  Weelllllll, this pump works 100% better!!!  Just this morning I pumped over 7 oz for my 2 and a half week old (almost 3 feedings!!!).  With the embrace I was only getting maybe 4 oz.  Even though it didn't take as long because it is a duel one.  I'd rather pump a lil longer and get more!  Also the isis pump doesn't hurt as much as the embrace does.  However, I did have to take the massaging let down cushion out of the isis because i wasnt getting much with it and my nipples are too large for it.  The best thing about this pump is despite all the articles saying I wouldnt be able to feed him breastmilk for every feeding I'm able to and I'm also able to freeze half of what I pump every day since I pump way more than enough!!! My milk supply has even gone way up since my milk first came in just by using this pump.  I can't say enough good things about it!!!I havent had any problems with the pump losing its suction or anything breaking.  It's easy to clean...if you wash it in warm soapy water after every use you wont have any problems with the silicone parts wearing down or turning colors.  I dont wash my baby items in the dishwasher.  I trust my hands more.Like I said I use only this pump full time 10-12 times a day and have never had any problems!!!	
- 1	The only positive thing I can say about the swing is the color and jungle theme is super cute. It always looked like my baby was uncomfortable. If you look at the product photos the baby looks sort of uncomfortable also. It does not support the baby very well. I also did not like the swing settings! The instructions state if it swings to fast you can hang a blanket to slow it down! I do not recommend this swing!	
1. 	This cover works fine and is pretty soft for cheap, thin polyester. It doesn't stain, but I've learned to put old burp clothes under my baby's bottom when I see that she's had a blowout so that I don't have to wash these changing pad covers every single day.	
- 1	Of all the bath toys we bought for our son, this set was the most susceptible to develop mold for some reason. It also feels not as well-made.	
1. 	The cloth diapers are great as burp clothes or anything else you need to use them for to soak up wet stuff.  They are at least twice as soft and thick as other cloth diapers.	
- 1	It sure looks like this had good reviews.  148 great ones.  BUT, when you add up all the one, two, three, and four star reviews you have more people UNHAPPY with this product than not.And I am one of them! ! ! !As said in other poor reviews, you get what you pay for.The gate itself is super narrow.  Try carrying a child - a sleeping one - or laundry through this gate.Using the extension piece (practically required) makes the gate itself loose; the extension piece is held on only by tension and it makes the whole gate wobbly and unreliable at best. I don't trust this gate to hold up farther than I can throw it, and I am 100% positive that we have installed it both correctly, and as tight as humanly possible.You have to retighten it every week or so, otherwise, it gets even looser AND the latch won't meet the gate edge so it can't stay locked shut.Please spend an extra $20-$30 and get a gate that is SAFE and RELIABLE.This is not it.  Wishing I had bought something else.	
- 1	When baby #1 was born, I bought Levana's Safe N See Monitor.  Within weeks, the battery stopped working.  The company sent me another one, which worked for a week, but then that one went kaput.  Even though the battery stopped working, and the picture quality was abysmal, I really liked the voice activation (vox) so we kept using it.When baby #2 was born, I thought I would check to see if Levana made any improvements and to see if I could add the old camera to the new model.  Lo and behold here is the improved version.  I bought it and can happily report that the battery holds a charge.  However, you CANNOT add a second camera (after an hour with tech support going over the steps again and again I gave up).  Worse, this unit CONSTANTLY blacks out (loses connectivity) and beeps ALL NIGHT LONG.  That's right, while your babies are finally sleeping and you think you might be able to get some rest, the unit LOUDLY BEEPS at 11.30PM, 12.20PM, 2AM, 3.30AM, 4.15AM... you get the picture.As per Levana, something must be wrong with my wifi.  If that were the case, why does my original Levana monitor not lose the connection/ beep?  Orly the new advanced monitor has an issue.Overall I've spent $2560 with Levana for substandard monitors.  Yes their VOX is great, but the low overall quality of these units should be a deal breaker for anyone.I would like Levana to take both these monitors back, and issue me an Amazon voucher so I can buy another brand.	
1. 	I got one of these while I was in the hospital because my baby made one of my nipples bleed and it was too painful to nurse. The lactation consultant gave it to me to help me out and I could not thank her enough. I tell all first time mom's to get one now because it's well worth the money if you experience any soreness. I ended up buying a second to rotate them for washing.	
1. 	I just bought this because my daughter is getting too big for her plastic tub. She loves it! It is very soft and seems very comfortable for her, and she stays warm. Dries quickly. Highly recommend!	
1. 	We needed to install a gate at bottom of stairs with spindles that where square and round...and it worked!  It's really resting mostly on the square part of the spindle.The Y brackets attached without a problem.  It puts just enough pressure to keep the gate in place without hopefully causing any permanent damage to the antique spindles.We are using the spindles with the Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, Model 31041.	
- 1	I recieved this as a gift at one of my baby showers. I thought it was going to be great, but it is a big old mess. There are way to many folds and pockets, took me 5 minutes just to get it onto the cart. And the folds into a handy compact. Yea right, I'm not sure a genius could fold this thing back up into the little carrying case it claims to fold into. It is very cute, but not very user friendly.	
1. 	This little crib is really well made, cute and just the right size for small babies.  The mattress that comes with it is worthless, however.  I bought the mattress that is recommended to be used with it.	
- 1	It did not fit well on a Britax Roundabout or a Marathon.  I would not recommend it for those car seats.  Seemed well made.	
- 1	I was kinda dissappointed with this brush. It splatters water and soap all over the place when you pull it out of the bottle. I don't feel like the bristles really scrub it clean. And the nipple brush isn't a brush at all. Its a pointy piece of rubber. Not sure how that's supposed to clean a bottle nipple. I like that it has a stand but you have to make sure to drain the water out of the bottom tray or else it gets gross. I've tried a lot of brushes and the one that I've found works the best is &#65279;The First Years Double Sponge Bottle Brush. Its cheaper and works 100x better.	
- 1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.	
1. 	This gate is awesome because it is big enough to span the space I needed it to fit in.  The gate seems a little flimsy, but, one month in, it seems to be holding up ok.  I anchored the gate to the wall with heavy duty dry wall plastic screw anchors.  I'm not sure how long this will hold up for, but for now it's a life saver.	
1. 	I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.	
- 1	My son is on the large size. He is 37 tall & 39 pounds. These seat is too small for him. The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard. The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks. He hates it. He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole. This one will be placed on Freecycle. I only recommend this for those training very small children.	
- 1	Unfortunatly it is very difficult to get the frozen food out of this tray.  It makes nice size servings for a baby who is just starting to eat.	
1. 	We bought this crib to replace our old drop side crib and it is made really well and super sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  My favorite part is that it is low enough to the ground that I can sit on the floor and pat my daughters back with my arm through the slats.  This was an excellent purchase.	
- 1	The product itself is fine. I ordered this particular set for the brackets. I wanted to stick them in the lid of our diaper pail. Our pail is really a kitchen trash pail and doesn't have a place for deodorant disks. The adhesive on the brackets is pretty weak. So they fell off after a few opening and closings of the lid.	
- 1	I like the look and feel of this seat, unfortuantely that is the only positive things I can say about it. First, the seat does not fit properly on a standard size toliet, I've tried every possible orientation. It slips and slides all over the place, not helpful when trying to convience a toddler that the toliet is a safe place. Second, the potty whole for lack of a better term is really small, if my toddler was able to use it, I'm not sure all the yuck would not get all over the seat. Lastly, my son hates the pee-pee shield on the front. I think this is a good idea to have with a little boy, but because the whole is so small the shield ends up scrapping and agiating him. ALSO, this shield should be removeable, you just don't need it for a little girl. Needless to say, I'm now looking for a new potty seat. :(	
1. 	This play yard is not bad but it is not sturdy when the door is open. My son really enjoyed walking while pushing the whole fence across our living room floor. He was able to climb up and around it no problem by the time he was 10 months old. It is light weight which is nice when you need to transport it but not when you need to keep a child in one place. We ended up just using it outside at that point.I would highly recommend you buy the panel extension kit as it is not very big. With the two panels it seemed to be just thh right size for my son and all of his toys.	
1. 	This monitor is wonderful.  We get clear reception all of the time.  There is no annoying static or humming like many other monitors.  Best of all it is one of the most affordable monitors on the market.  Talk about getting a lot of bang for your buck.  The monitor has noise indicator lights, so when you can't hear the monitor (ie volume turned down, or you're vaccuming) you can see if baby is fussing.	
- 1	The size is too small. Also it's not really flannel,but cotton flannel which is much thinner than I expected. It might work better as burping cloths.	
1. 	I got this one for my ds(kid #2). He is 21lbs and 31 inches and fits into JUST FINE. In fact, we use this on a daily basis and totally got rid of the highchair. He can not get the tray off at all. Maybe people were talking about the removable one. We don't use that part or the cover as the tray is so easy to clean. People complain of the back coming off. Well, IT'S SUPPOSED TO. When your child gets too big, you take it off and usebackless like those plastic ones at restuarants. The straps attach so easily. The legs adjust easier too. I like it better than my dd's who has the safety 1st one. She fits in his too as she is ALWAYS sitting in his and putting the tray on only to lock herself into it. I have used for both in restuarnts. My 2 year old uses it when we go to places w/o booths as I don't trust the ones that don't strap down on regular chairs. I love this seat and would recommend it to everyone. May even buy it for a friend's shower	
- 1	what a waste of my money! this cup holder would not fit my stroller (Britax B-Agrile) and now im stuck with it! buy this only if you have a tiny framed stroller!	
- 1	As soon as I got it and used it, the handle broke off. Not worth the money, even though it is really cheap.	
- 1	I like that this has the spoon and a lid, but it doesn't stick to my high chair tray.  I've tried dry and wet.  I've cleaned the tray and the suction.  I also tried to bend the suction cup to make it more rounded.  Completely useless as it doesn't work!  The one star is for the lid and the spoon that fits into the lid. Well, that and I can't give no stars.	
1. 	the best feature is the sling. it holds a newborn perfectly. my baby likes to hang one foot off the side and dip it in the warm water. there is a place that holds shampoo/baby wash. i'll be using this when my baby is a toddler too. another great feature is it has a groove in the back, where you can use it in a sink, or lean it against something to dry. it has a drain too. i don't use that though, because i put the tub on the floor. it's the best tub, and very affordable!	
1. 	Huge. Can be taken apart and used in multiple places at once if you don't need to make a giant baby playpen. Cheaper then buying multiple ones for different locations. A little difficult to take apart, but it's sturdy.	
1. 	Gave these to a friend for her baby shower and they were exactly what she'd wanted.  I asked her opinion about them a month later and she said that they were great because a) the baby took to them right away, b) they clean up perfectly and are dishwasher safe, and c) they seem to cause less spit-up and upset stomach.  She also appreciated that they are BPA free.  She highly recommends to other new moms, and I recommend this as a nice baby shower gift to give that new mom in your life.	
1. 	This is a great bath time toy - but I've not had any luck using the &#34;HOT&#34; indicator to reliably tell me anything. It always looks like it says hot, faintly. I assume the white would get brighter if the water was actually too hot?! Regardless, my almost 7 month old plays with this during bath time every single night. We sing &#34;rubber ducky&#34; and she splashes at the ducky and holds it and chews on it. It's a good size for her little hands.	
- 1	Terrible sterilizer....bottles smell burnt after every use. Unit always look dirty inside and out no matter how well you clean.	
- 1	I registered for a bunch of these for the newborn phase and boy do I regret it! I used them a lot longer than I would have liked to because I needed to increase my stash of other diapers and didn't want to use disposables in the meantime. Every time my son had a wet diaper the pee wicked onto his clothes from either the tag in the back or the leg gussets.  The one pro is that they fit for a long time, so if you are one of the lucky few they work for (I read a lot of positive reviews before choosing these) you will get your money's worth.  The XS still fits my son @13.5 lbs. I plan to use them as swim diapers this summer because I cannot in good conscience sell them to another unsuspecting mother. DO NOT recommend unless you really enjoy doing laundry or changing baby's outfit every time you change his diaper!	
1. 	I use this for the baby all the time for sleeping in. It is nice and soft, zips up the front and is a cute pattern. Good price on Amazon too. I would recommend it and would definitely buy another one.	
1. 	I tried the regular version of these bottles, too.I babysit a friend's 5 mo old boy, he tends to spit up.  I thought these would be perfect to try with him.  He definitely spits up alot less with these bottles, there are far fewer bubbles in the bottle, too.  I gave his mom the pack of regular bottles and I keep these at my house to use with him when  he's here.  She loves the bottles, too, and says these are all she uses now.  It definitely makes for far less laundry when the baby doesn't spit up nearly as much!  Personally I prefer the wide bottles, they seem easier to hold but that could be because I'm dealing with my 2 kids at the same time as the baby.I used a much more expensive brand with my last baby who is 4 now.  Wish I had known these existed, they're far easier to clean and much easier on the wallet.  :-)	
1. 	Perfect weight, has held up to daily use and washed at least once a week for the past 5 months +.	
1. 	This is a good bib. My daughter did not like it, so it didn't work well for us.  The strap around the neck is very stiff and the bib doesn't bend at all.  She doesn't like how stiff it is.  It might work well for others, though.	
1. 	This bouncer is GREAT! My son was 3 weeks old when we started using it and he LOVES it... At times, he wouldnt sleep in his crib or his bassinet so we were able to pick up the seat and put it inside his crib and he slept peacefully... This is a great seat and it's the best bouncer I've come across...	
- 1	It collects water under the &#34;grass&#34;. It is also very prone to mildew. I would much rather see a small dish towel near my sink for drying bottles than this bulky piece of hard plastic.	
- 1	We bought this for our UB Cruz stroller (which we like a lot), and it seems like UPPAbaby never actually tested this organizer on their own stroller. With the seat forward facing (the most common direction, and the only one that allows you to fold the stroller), the organizer makes it harder or impossible to change the seat angle between upright and reclining. The only way the seat can move past the organizer is if the organizer is at the very top of the frame and the handle is extended to the longest position.The organizer is held on with velcro, so it needs to be reattached every few days when the velcro loosens. It also tends to slide down the frame.The entire organizer is much larger and heavier than it needs to be for the limited function it gives you -- a cupholder and a couple of small pockets.Another reviewer said that UPPAbaby told her they would pass along negative feedback to their design team. They didn't even bother to do that when I wrote to them.	
1. 	We bought this gate to keep our cats out of my husband's study - keeping the door closed in the hot summer months makes the room quite hot (with all the computers, etc.)The gate works wonderfully - the cats have jumped the shorter version (one of them hurting their leg in the process.)  The taller gate is just the ticket.  I recommend it highly.I've just picked up my second one of these gates to block the stairway at my new house (my cats are old and I don't want themwandering around the top floor.)With the addition of the recommended bannister kit, it took only about half an hour to set this up on the stairway.  I don't know if it is sturdy enough to keep children out, but it certainly works for my cats.	
- 1	The old saying holds true with this product -- you get what you pay for.  While, I like the, LED lights which signal noise in your baby's room, I am not comfortable using this digital monitor with a small infant during the night. Battery life isn't great for this product. It doesn't live up to the static-free claim either. And, while the volume control function seems to work okay, but the product overall makes me a bit nervous.Best use might be as more of an intercom with an older child.I'd recommend paying a bit more and getting one with higher review ratings - Overall a disappointing product.	
- 1	It isn't worth buying at the moment. The company has redesigned these bags and are releasing them soon but the version I have is TERRIBLE! After one wash something (not sure which part of the fabric) started sticking together...after a few washes it could only hold a few diapers. Plus, I don't like the way it holds onto the ring inside the Ubbi pail, it doesn't stay put.	
- 1	Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for these sheets. I like the fact that they are flannel to keep my toddler and baby warm. BUT they shed bad. I washed them for the first time and my dryer was full of white lint. I was extremely disappointed with that first off and then I noticed how warn down they looked because of the rest of the material had shed off. I really wanted to return because I bought three sets, but am just keeping the two I had washed and sending back third. Worth the money? Maybe, but I would have rather spent more and got long lasting flannel sheets, not these wash away disappointments.	
- 1	I read excellent review about this item and decided bought it. When I received the package I was very happy, but when I tried to use the product, the blender doesn't work never =(&#8230; That was very disappointed for me, because I had my baby ready for his first baby food and the blender never work, was broken inside.	
1. 	Bought this when my twins were a month old and they are transfixed by it. They stare at it when they are awake and love to look at the pictures. I hope they are learning something, they just love it. I also bought a small portable one for them which they also love. I like that I can change the pictures (although I find it a little tricky). I have been holding off buying a mechanical mobile since they are so into this mobile which seems low tech but is so stimulating.	
- 1	I have never used any other toilet lid locks, but this is so hard to install I have never been able to use it. I have just resorted to keeping the bathroom door closed all the time.	
- 1	While this is probably not the product's fault, neither of my kids will let me get this on their head.  Hair washing is still horrible.  Waste of money for me.	
- 1	I bought this because it was a cute idea. It's cute to wear and my little guy liked to gnaw on it. But then I realized that it could potentially be a choking hazard if one of the beads came loose. We no longer use this product.	
1. 	Ok.  As new dad, I can tell you this is great.  I'm not metrosexual enough for a diaper bag, even one that is somewhat masculine.  I do keep one in the trunk for emergencies.Having said that, I love this thing.  It's easy to pack essentials for changing, and my wife and I have used it so many times - back seat of our car, in a courtyard, on a family member's bed.  Plenty of room to store newborn or size 1 diapers.  Plenty of room for wipes, hand cleaner and diaper creme.There's a stap to attach it to your stroller, if you don't want to put it in the basket.	
- 1	I bought this back in June when I was 6 months pregnant, I expected it to fit my carseat since there was nothing on Amazon or JJ cole website saying any exluded baby seat types. Well it doesnt fit in my car seat and its way to late to return it. I guess this is what I get for assuming that this product would fit. I have the Chicco Key fit seat. It is terrible. Also the zippers will not go up after I take them down. It took 5 people to try and get them to go back up. I will not recommend JJ COLE to anyone. So now Im stuck with this terrible product.	
- 1	These membranes do not stay flush enough against the valve to keep the seal, which means the pump won't work. I tried several of them, and only 1 consistently worked.  Buy the name brand version instead.	
1. 	Really soft and useful bib for your little one. Its  easy to clean and takes care of mess unde the table.	
1. 	This is the second potty that I purchased for my son.  The first one, was one that goes on the floor. His bum bum was too big for it, so we went with this one.  He enjoys climbing up the step and sitting on the real toilet like a big boy.  Potty training is a job in itself, but he doesn't shy away from this and fits perfectly on it, even for a bigger bum bum.	
1. 	Our son loves this bath tub! I love that it is his own inflatable tub within our tub. Makes me feel like he is a lot safer bathing.The duck is super cute and fun for him to play in.	
1. 	We use this on the bottom of our back stairs.  The height is perfect so when an adult walks down they don't feel like they would flip over it.  Easy to open and love that auto close!!  Great quality and sturdy too.  My little guy has tugged and pulled on it and it has not moved!  Love it!	
1. 	I found these small bottles the best way to store breastmilk and you can feed directly from this bottle by simply putting a nipple on or transfer easily to another bottle.  They store well in the freezer and fit easily into our bottle warmer.	
1. 	These bottles really work! I was skeptical at first, but my son actually seems to have less gas after eating from these bottles. I found the same results from Avent bottles, but those cost more. The only downside to these is that each bottle has 5 parts, so if you don't have a dishwasher they would be pain to clean. You should also know that if you plan to pump into these bottles you will need an adapter.	
1. 	Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.	
1. 	I purchased this for my small 9 month old and it's huge.  It's made of really good quality materials and will last a long time.  But it's big and made for larger/older kids.  Which is fine, she'll grow into it, but don't think you're getting this for a beginner eater.  The sleeves are nice and will fit snug on her wrists and the tie in the back is long enough to tie in a bow.  It's going to be a really great thing once we grow into it!	
- 1	Having read the other reviews, I feel the need to clarify a couple of things. Honestly, when I read 7 or 8 reviews that all use the same cheesy language (wireless freedom! crystal clear sound!), written within a few days of each other, and all giving a product 5 stars, I get really skeptical really fast about how genuine those reviews may - or may NOT - be. For the record, I bought the Samsung Secured at a Target in Orlando, while on vacation, after my Sony Baby Call spent an unfortunate evening with an electrical storm. I am evaluating the Samsung based on previous use with a Baby Call, Summer Secure Sleep, Safety First Glow & Grow, and Safety First Crystal Clear.1) Wireless is both a half-truth and not really an advantage over anything. Why? Because most baby monitors on the market right now have the exact same DECT wireless technology. This monitor works on a battery, which needs to be plugged in regularly to charge. Yes, you can unplug it and walk around the house during the day, but if you are going to use it at night, you will need to plug it in or run the risk of it dying while you are fast asleep. The piece that goes in your child's room is not wireless. Every basic monitor available right now functions this way.2) Sound quality is not the only aspect of a baby monitor that matters. This is easily the quietest monitor that I have tried thus far. What is the point of decent sound quality, if you can't actually HEAR it over the dishwasher, shower, or other children? Despite the glowing reviews, I found that my child still sounds far away over this monitor. There isn't much true interference, but there is a buzz that is constant no matter where I try to use it (including our hotel on vacation, our home, and my mother's house). I also find it annoying that the receiver takes a good 10-15 seconds to pair with the transmitter, every time you turn it on. Meaning I don't ever have instant sound. Not cool, Samsung.3) The cost. Seriously? It's a standard monitor, with no advanced functions or video capability, and yet it is 2-3x the cost of comparable units. Why the ridiculous price tag???On top of those issues, I find that the green lights on this monitor are VERY bright. I have to turn it to face away from me at night, or the lights will keep me from sleeping. Not a very pleasant discovery for a sleep-deprived mother of young children. Especially given that the already too-quiet monitor is even more difficult to hear when facing away.Bottom line: There is no ACTUAL advantage of this monitor over any other I have tried, and in fact, it falls short of my experience with the Baby Call. Given the inflated price tag, in the end, you really are just paying for the name. Do yourself a favor and try a Sony Baby Call first. You will see a number of reviews (including mine) that mention interference, but in the case of the Sony, you can (in most cases) simply adjust the channel (as opposed to the Samsung, which only gets so loud). The sound quality really IS great, and oh yeah - the Baby Call is HALF the price.	
- 1	I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter.  It tries too hard.  There is way too much going on and she gets overwhelmed when reading it.  At 9 months she would still rather read the more simplistic Squishy Turtle book.	
1. 	My baby wears one of these every day, and they are holding up well.  I like how they don't have cutesy sayings or pictures on them; they can just blend with whatever outfit she has on.  One word to the wise: the velcro is very strong (which is a good thing!), so make sure you have the velcro clasped together when you wash them.  Otherwise they will snag everything else in the wash.	
1. 	these are amazing bibs! great size for 6 months. love that they are waterproof. have great coverage and are super cute! favorite bibs!	
- 1	I purchased these for my daughter to use in the baby's room because they matched the bedding set and other items she'd chosen.  Overpriced is the least of the complaints I have about these. The colors are muddy compared to the bedding and the vinyl smell is overpowering.  I opened the package and set them out to air for 3 weeks before giving them to the kids to put up in the baby's room.  They set them out on a countertop to straighten the folds out and the cheap vinyl odor was still so bad it dominated any room they were in.  Noxious as the smell is, I suspect it's probably giving off some kind of airborne pollutants that are not healthy for a newborn to be exposed to.  Needless to say, they haven't been used.	
1. 	We purchased this bouncer simply because we had the aquarium swing (which is fantastic).  We figured our daughter would enjoy seeing the same fish that she sees in the swing.  She really enjoyed the bouncer.  The vibration pack could be a little less intense-our floor really moved with it!  We stopped using the bouncer though recently as her fidgeting around made me nervous because there are no sides.  The Fisher Price bouncer we borrowed for the first few months, had a canopy cover that went around the sides and made us feel better.	
1. 	So, at first glance I thought that this booster seat would be uncomfortable for my son because it has not cushioning, but that's far from a concern now. My son loves his seat, seriously!  I love that it is very safe.  It snaps to the chair really tightly, it snaps to my son, and the table snaps as well.  I also like that it has a cover.  I really like it, and I recommend it for anyone to buy :)	
- 1	Just like all the other reviews have said, this bath may does not stick to the tub.  It floats.  I tried everything to make it stick to no avail.  This product is crap!	
- 1	This turned out to be a huge waste of money.  The parasol doesn't stay in one place and doesn't provide enough shade, so basically it doesn't do what it is supposed to.	
1. 	Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents.I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic!	
1. 	I purchased these after reading the reviews on how hard they are to remove so I was not too surprised by how hard they are to remove - lol. You just need to figure out how to take them out and find a gadget that can help depress the safety - a screw driver works well for us. We bought two types, put these in the areas our son has a lot of access, and on outlets we dont use much. We used a cheaper, easier to remove style on the other outlets.	
1. 	Yes these pads are thicker than most.  I usually put them over my fist and try to shape them rounder before I put them in my bra.I like these the best because they don't have the plastic liner on the backs.  This is important to me because I don't want liquid locked in between plastic and my skin.  Also, I don't feel as if they are as hot.I wish I could say they were too small but I have found them to be the perfect size for smaller women A-B cups.  I have never had a leak-through and have been very pleased with the success of these pads.	
1. 	My one year old loves these!  We have been searching for a way for her to enjoy her snacks while on the move since she is now walking.  These hold in the snack even if she shakes them up and down! I do wish the colors were all the same price, instead of a cheaper price for various colors, so that way she could have a more girly cup, but its no biggie! I would definitely recommend this to all my mommy and daddy friends!	
- 1	I returned this. It didn't fit and it was really scratchy.	
- 1	The formula doesn't stay in its compartments. I started out with four compartments of formula and ended up with two nearly empty compartments and two nearly full compartments. I no longer had properly measured out formula and it was a disaster. I tossed it that day.	
- 1	I bought this monitor with the thinking that if it was made by Motorola, the picture would be great. I was completely unimpressed. The picture was incredible grainy and disjointed. I returned it the next day. Ended up buying the Summer Complete Coverage Day and Night. More expensive, but well worth the money. The picture is so clear that I can see my baby breathing on both the flat screen and handheld. Go that route!	
1. 	This stroller frame was the perfect item to start out with for our infant. We were pricing out strollers and systems for the early months of our son's life, and knew that he would be outgrowing whatever we purchased within a few months and didn't want to spend a lot. A friend of mine had the SnugRide car seat and this stroller frame and couldn't say enough good things about it. I registered for the SnugRide car seat and then we bought this frame shortly afterwards. It has been a dream! Very very easy to use - you pop the car seat on top, fold in the two tabs and you're ready to go. It also folds up very easily - you can do it with one hand! It's also very lightweight and fits in the back of an SUV with plenty of room to spare.The only downsides that I can see are the following: the frame is what it is - a frame - so it's not as sturdy or fancy as some of the more expensive stroller systems. There aren't any shock absorbers, so it's not great on rough terrain. Well cut grass is about all it can handle. The other thing is that it is rather hard to maneuver with one hand, so trying to open a door and push the stroller through the open door can be challenging.The basket underneath is huge, so you can fit a diaper bag and a purse and whatever else. The cup holder is okay, but not very deep, so any drinks that are full are liable to fall over, even a small bottle of water.So, for what it is, it's totally worth the purchase. My son is 3 months old and just about to outgrow his car seat, so we will be moving him to the big stroller soon, but for this price, it was one of the best purchases we made!	
1. 	Are you ever at a party, and wish that you could see adults fumble with a baby gate and look foolish?  Its always hilarious!  Then buy this right now, dont even think about it.  Don't go look in your bank account to see if you have the correct funds, just stack it on top of your growing credit card bill and GET THIS GATE; I cant recommend it enough. Seriously it keeps nonsense OUT: place all unwanted things in your life on one side, you get on the other.  Oooohhhmmmmmm (yoga bear) life is good.  put out the incense! thats so 90s	
1. 	I ordered these to use with my Harmony manual pump and they fit great.  I realized I needed a smaller flange when my nips bothered me after pumping for only a couple of days with the 24mm flanges that come with the Harmony.  Well since using these 21mm flanges, I've had no problems.If pumping is irritating you, try this size. Chances are you may need to go down, and not up!	
- 1	In general, I'd sanitize everything before giving it to my baby boy. Since there's no clear instruction on this teether, I put it in the steam sanitizer to clean it. And afterward, the teether became twisted due to the high heat. I guess if you don't sanitize it, it would be a great one...	
- 1	I got this thinking my son (who is just shy of being 2 years old) might like to use it rather than the big potty, and it would be great for use on top of the big potty. We now use it only as a step stool.The size of this thing is terrible. The foam ring is just too small to be useful for sitting to either pee or poop. His pee goes all over the outside of the foam ring. His bottom just hangs off too much to even think about using it for poop. You can't really use it without the foam ring. My son just wanted to play with the foam ring. His first reaction was to try and bite the foam. Well, he left teeth marks. The box says the foam ring is waterproof and cleanable, but it doesn't seem like it would hold up after a few uses / cleanings (or bite marks).I wouldn't use this on the big potty, for reasons stated above (foam ring too small) also, I'm not sure how sturdy it would sit on our elongated toilet bowl.My son wasn't very interested in using this potty at all, so now we use it as a step stool. It is working really well as a step stool.	
1. 	I bought this blanket when my first baby was born - 4 years ago.  I used it for my baby's tummy time, took it to the beach numerous times, then I used to protect my bed from my daughters night time accident.  Now I have my second baby, it is again used as a play time mat-tummy time mat.  I guess I am supposed to wipe clean, but every time it needs to be cleaned, I just throw it in the washer and hang dry.  I washed it countless times and it still looks good.  Color has not faded, no ripping, it might have lost a little bit of shape, but it looks like I can use this for couple more years.  I love this blanket.  I would highly recommend it and I would buy it again when I need a replacement.	
1. 	This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!	
1. 	These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands). I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack. I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns. My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with MONKEY BOY or POWER DROOLER all over them. They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials. To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars. You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby. Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin. Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin. Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.Edit on 3/27/2013:  I am now using the very same bibs on my 18 month old daughter.  So these bibs have been in constant use since November of 2009, well over 3 years, and still look great...colors are still bright, terrycloth hasn't pilled, waterproof layer between the terry layers is still fully intact, and they come out of the dryer essentially flat (not curled from the low heat).  Velcro still super sticky.  I haven't had to throw a SINGLE ONE out...really amazing.  I'm pleasantly shocked at how well they've held up!	
1. 	I received two of these for my baby shower.  I thought I'd love them but I just like them.  I like that it zips from the bottom up, it makes diaper changes really easy at night.  I like that it takes the stupid out of swaddle- in the middle of the night the last thing you want to do is waste time wrestling with a too small receiving blanket when you just want to go back to bed.  I like that it's warm, we don't have to keep the house too warm at night when he's in one of these.I don't like that the fleece gets ratty after a couple of washes and gets pilly.  Our son is only three weeks old and these things already look rough.  I also don't like that it's really hard to burp the baby when he's wearing this, you basically have to take it off of him to get a good burp- more than a slight annoyance in the middle of the night.  I also find that the arm holes are really snug.  As I mentioned before our son is only 3 weeks old, but he was a big baby and over 10 lbs at birth.  He's not a fat baby though and the arm holes are really narrow and can be difficult to put on when he's not feeling like cooperating during clothing changes.  We have these in the small size which should fit fine for his size.So, I would recommend these, but sometimes the cons outweigh the pros.	
- 1	I really wanted to love this bottle. I like the feel of it in my hand and I like that you don't have to shake the formula to get it to mix. But - and this is a huge one - it broke after less than a week's worth of use. My husband struggled to close the cap and when he passed it to me, there it went. I like the bottle so much that I went on a scavenger hunt for another but couldn't find one. I took that as a sign.	
1. 	My wife and I chose this Playtex feeding system for our first child.  We had some standard bottles, also.  We found that the Playtex system avoided the baby ingesting a lot of air when sucking.  Therefore the baby got more nutrition and we had to do less burping.  I highly recommend this system as a baby shower gift.Be careful putting these plastic bottles in a bottle warmer and dishwasher with a drying coil.Gunner  March,2012	
- 1	The concept of this is amazing! I was so excited to give it a try. Try was all I did, however, because it was not as expected. The tray is 4 pieces that snap together and its flimsy at best. The snap together sections leave openings which pinched my daughter's arm. Also, the foam insert felt cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled by the thickness of the Bumbo but this foam part falls out and was very thin. I returned it.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the diaper weenie so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.	
- 1	I meant to purchase the &#34;gauze&#34; style which are thicker and more absorbent than the &#34;birdseye&#34; style. These are also smaller, so I would definitely recommend getting the gauze. We use those all the time as burp cloths for our baby with reflux!	
1. 	My husband and I just put our crib together and we love it. It arrived quickly and none of the pieces were damaged. We didn't have any problems with the finish scratching and we had it together in a couple of hours. I can't wait to use it (I'm not due until May).  I will update after the little one has used it for a while!	
- 1	We have had two of these now and while it does cushion the tub, the Elmos, fish, and shells come off after a few months and the mat looks very dingy.  Other than that, it's ok.  Our second mat (which we just got earlier this year) only has 2 shells left on it.  Disappointing.	
1. 	Ok gate, my son figure it out how to open it at 18 mo old, so went to plan B and did tie a scarf on the lower part of the door to keep it shut! Overall sturdy but you can find better considering Customer Service does not exist in USA, Canada only without toll free number, not good!!!!	
- 1	I was very excited when I found this item online.  It looked perfect and we especially liked it because it was easy to travel with as we were tired of putting pillows up in hotel rooms. We got it b/c we were transitioning our son from bed rails to no rails.  he currently uses one on only 1 side.  When we got it, we had trouble inflating it so we thought it was defective and returned it.  We received another one in the mail, but after inflating it (easily), it seemed to only last about 8 hours.  We tried each day and the same thing happened - the air only lasted about 8 hours before getting too soft.  Needless to say, we returned the item entirely.	
- 1	I purchased this after reading the other reviews. However, upon receipt, I quickly realized that this is much wider than the picture makes it look. If you have a LOT of room, this is not an issue, but the width of this, once assembled, is bigger than our outdoor swingset. Also, you need to be aware that you cannot just slide baby in and out of this seat like most bouncers. You actually have to unclip the seat from the frame every single time, unsnap the fabric, unvelcro it, lay it out, place baby on, like you are changing a nappy, and then do it all back up again. Then, with baby in your arms, you have to reattach the seat to the bar one handed. If none of this deters you, then this is probably a great bouncer.	
1. 	Some crib sheets are really thin and the mattress pattern underneath shows through. This sheet is thick enough that the mattress doesn't show through and feels nice to the touch. Good bright color for our dragon theme nursery.	
1. 	These shields are amazing! I've used them to breastfeed my DD since she was born (now 2 months old) - BF without them is incredibly painful for me, even with a very good latch. My baby has a super powerful suck and also tends to bite down as she falls asleep while nursing (as she often did in the first weeks) and without the shield, i'd get painful damage. Wearing the shields has made the experience bearable. They are super easy to use and wash and sterilize quickly and easily.	
1. 	My son needed more freedom but our living room was not baby friendly.  I had two choices - get rid of my glass top tables and take everything down or buy this gate...I went with the gate!  I purchased this as well as the extension.  I did move the coffee table and setup it up in the middle of the room.  My son was so happy!  He had his own space with his own toys and could be around everyone else without getting in trouble.  It was easy to setup (already comes assembled) and the extensions attached without a headache.  It is very durable, very sturdy, and kid friendly.  We are using it now to protect the Christmas tree since our son is old enough to walk and move around the house on his own so it has continued use after your child outgrows it.	
- 1	This may sound pathetic, but after buying this product I find myself too lazy to use it. You have to take time to stretch the elastic edges around the seat. It's quicker to just throw a blanket over the seat. I've actually decided to spend a few hundred bucks and just get the windows tinted. It's so hot where I live that we're all sweating by the time the AC cools off the car.	
- 1	While this might be a great toy for a young baby that doesn't move around much, it is not working so great for my busy 5 month old.  It is so light that she tries to play with the toys and pulls it over, or tips it over.  The front and back are not separate as they appear in the product photo, rather they are joined by material and only open so far, and it doesn't always want to stay open to sit on the floor.  I tried it in the crib once, but the Velcro straps to hold it on were too short to fit over the back rail of the crib, and it just seemed to big and bulky to have it on the front where I am trying to reach in and out with baby.	
- 1	I am not a fan of this combo. Yes it looks nice and of course I love the jogging stroller but it is really big and bulky. It is great if you plan on keeping it outside your house and don't ever need to put it in the car. But if you do have to out it in the car don't expect to fit anything else in there with it. As for the car seat.. It is terrible for new borns. I used it to fly home when we had to evacuate Japan after the earthquake in March, and my baby was only 2 weeks old, well it didn't really fit in the seat like the sticker on it said it would. In order to get it to fit the seat we had to lean it forward a lot which was terrible since my son could not hold his own head back. It just through his head forward. It also did that in my car in the states. I had to run to the store as soon as we arrived and buy a new car seat. Another issue with the car seat was that it was to snug. It was hard to put my baby in it and take him out. Every time I took my son out he would be covered in sweat.I think the stroller is great as long as it is only used for running and not traveling, as for the car seat DONT BUY IT!!!	
1. 	This changing table cover is perfect for just about any changing pad. It is incredibly soft and the pink with polka dots matches our room perfectly. The strap holes are a good enough size to fit just about any strap. I would definately recommend this product!	
1. 	Sturdy, good size, well-made, and (apparently) comfortable for twin babies to sleep in.  This bassinet has come in very, very handy --my life would be a lot harder without it.  This is highly recommended.	
1. 	We got this as a shower gift, along with several other play gyms.  After looking closely at all of them, we decided to keep this one and returned the others.  I'm glad we did.  This one is perfect.  We already use it for tummy time.  The mat is soft and when he spits up, it wipes off easily.  I like the mix of soft and plastic toys attached and the fact that they all come off easily since my little guy cant reach them yet.  After tummy time we roll him over and he loves to stare at the lights and butterflies.	
1. 	The listing doesn't specify that 6 do come in a package. YEA! They work wonders when you are storing your breastmilk right from pump to bottle. It has a tight seal to prevent any milk spilling and you can just add the nipple when ready to use for feeding. A must have for breastfeeding moms.	
- 1	The tray was hard to get lined up and it did not work well to feed my kids with.  I ended up selling it at a garage sale	
1. 	we actually use this to barricade our entertainment center. theres lots of expensive things make it up and my 1 year old seems to be attacted to that. this playard works perfectly.	
- 1	I hate this bowl! My husband bought it for our daughter and I can say we NEVER use it. Ended up throwing away the spoon and fork because my baby is teething and therefore chews on everything, she ended up easily ripping the rubber off the ends. They are also super small. The spoon is dipped in so much my baby has a hard time getting everything off it, the bowl is an awkward shape and makes it hard for her to get food out. Over all ends in a very frustrated and hungry baby... she does great with other spoons and bowls. So now this bowl just sits on the shelf. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money	
- 1	They are just plastic, no padding or anything.I suppose you could use these over pampers but that would means that the pampers you purchased would be totally crap.  These cannot aid in any type of potty training or prevent accidents, everything leaks right through.  I placed these over a pair of big boy underwear leaked both times.	
1. 	As PPs have stated, this feeder is in 3 separate  pieces for easy cleaning. The BSF is very durable feeling and the plastic bits are easy to rinse off and throw in the dishwasher. It is a bit heavy, but not excessivley so. The mesh pouch also seems durable and is not as difficult to clean as other similar products. I soak mine in hot water for 15 or so minutes then finger rub the debris off/out before machine washing it. There are seams along the inside and at the ring of the pouch and most debris seems to get caught in the seam allowance. It is easy for baby to grasp and hold and the trouble it takes to clean it is well worth the enjoyment he gets from it. I highly recommend this product over similar ones.	
- 1	Got this pack in pink as a baby gift.  Washed them for the first time last night in prep for baby girl to get here.  Washed on cold, gentle cycle and put on low in dryer.  All the stitching came apart and it is very very cheaply made in Pakistan.  Avoid.  It is also not very soft at all and I wouldn't want this on my baby's soft skin.	
- 1	I bought this tub because i liked the idea of the shower part and roominess of this tub but unfortunately the shower part is useless, i broke within a couple uses and when it did work it was just not worth the extra money. My suggestion is to buy the tub that looks like this with out the shower part.Good Luck!	
1. 	This chari is VERY convenient for carrying around.  It fold and is light weight.  Also, it ties securely to every seat we have used.  The down side is that the seat is made of cloth, so the baby sinks in a little and it is not always the most condusive seating position for eating.  Putting a towel under our daughter has helped prop her up.	
- 1	Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...	
1. 	I've used these sleep sacks with both of my kids, each born at complete opposite times of the year as the other, and I love them.  They do get a little bunched up sometimes but nothing that I've constituted as dangerous and they keep the kids warm without getting in the way.  The only thing I wish is that they made a long sleeved version so I didn't have to put on a long-sleeved onesie to keep my kids' arms warm.	
- 1	i thought my baby would really like this because the buttons are easy to push and it's lightweight but i can't get her into it.  There is no on/off switch and the volume is insanely low on this.  you can barely hear it	
1. 	Bought this with Amazon Prime days before Christmas and received just in the nick of time! Set up was super easy and fast and my son loves to sit in it, unlike his highchair we had him in before. Great!	
1. 	I researched every monitor I could find and finally decided on this one for my daughter's room.  I guess I'm one of the few lucky ones who got a great monitor on the first try!!  This one works great.  It is so sensitive...you can hear a whisper.  It is crystal clear, with no interference.  I can hear every move and every sigh my daughter makes.  I highly recommend this monitor to everyone!!	
- 1	Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib, and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails.  It didn't even stay on for a day.  Money down the drain, since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover.	
- 1	Glad we only got one of these. I've had my fair share of sippy cup reviews with three little ones. I preferred not to use this wobbly, hard to put cap on without spilling milk (handles get in the way). Also its germ infested...you need to pop off the dome slider that covers the straw, otherwise mold grows in there (even when run through the dishwasher). There also is a film of milk left behind (unlike any other cups) and this takes forever to dry because of its shape. Also mold grows in between the weighted base and clear cup...doesn't effect its use, just gross.	
- 1	We actually tested these vs the Joey's hemp inserts. These ones absorbed 3 oz of water, the regular Joey's (single insert) absorbed ~5 oz of water (almost 6 oz), and the Joey's premium (a thin double insert) absorbed nearly 9(!!)oz of water. They're all nearly the same price and about the same size, so I wouldn't recommend these. I've been told before that organic cotton (they're all a cotton+hemp mix) is more absorbent than regular cotton, and now I believe it! :)	
- 1	My advice on the Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer is to not waste your time or money. Yes, it is affordable, but in this case you are getting less than what you paid for. It is cheaper than cheap. You are better are spending a few extra bucks and purchasing a bouncer of better quality. I suggest Fischer Price bouncers.I purchased the Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer for my (currently 3 month old) niece. I babysit her once a week and her parents are always lugging their Fischer Price bouncer over, so I thought it would be more convenient to purchase my own. I found the Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer on Amazon, and thought I had hit a gold mine. It is super affordable, looks adorable, and the overall star rating was decent. I unfortunately, didn't take the time to read the reviews and instantly regretted it when the Bright Starts Bouncer was delivered.My only pluses/pros for the Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncers is that it is extremely affordable, easy to assemble, and the hanging toys are adorable. Let me start by saying that I wasn't expecting to have to assemble it quite so much. Every aspect of this bouncer needed to be assembled. The assembly and instructions were easy and it was relatively quick to assemble. This product also takes three C batteries, which are not included (of course). On the other hand, this product unfortunately is an epic fail in every way.My first problem with this product is the pad in which the baby lays. Once I attached it to frame and secured it in the back, it was so extremely tight that I could have bounced a quarter off of it. I was actually afraid it was going to rip when attaching it, or when I put my niece in it and it got stretched by her weight. There is not an indentation for where the baby lies, as it appears in the picture. I figured it is possible that this might stretch after some use, but I am not sure with any amount of washing if the pad would continue to fit with time. It barely fit at first assemble. More importantly, I was afraid for the safety of my niece with how taunt the pad is and the extreme angle of the chair. I was afraid she would have slid down, or get an extreme wedgie, and even more so that with any movement she might fall forward (like when she starts to try to lift her head).My second issue with this product, one in which I never saw mentioned in any other reviews in the sound of the vibrations. The chair has one level of vibrations and two levels of music, a softer level and a louder level. Unfortunately, even at the loudest music level, I could barely here the music when the vibrate setting was on. The vibration was SO LOUD. I could literally hear whatever was oscillating inside the plastic box to make the chair vibrate. Some babies may find the sound soothing, I certainly didn't want to listen to it though. It was LOUD, and it seemed to defeat the purpose of having music. I mean if you can't hear it over the vibration, then why have it?Lastly, I had issue with the toy bar. The toy bar location is not adjustable. This would be fine, except that since the pad is so tight/taunt and the chair angle so extreme it literally makes the bar inches away from the babies face. It was just too close for comfort.In the end, I returned this product. I didn't see the Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer lasting the few months that my niece would be using it. I was more so worried about her safety in using. And despite being affordable, it wasn't even worth that. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product even for the price. I suggest spending a few extra bucks and get something safe, durable, quiet, and fun for the child.	
- 1	I hoped against hopes that this would do well for us.  We ordered this for our infant son and it just never had the same reading twice and that was with my son steadily sucking it and not spitting it out.	
- 1	I bought this bouncer for my 4 month old daughter because I wanted another seating option for her besides her swing or Boppy lounger. I thought this bouncer had a good concept with the interactive toy design. However, once I put together the bouncer and let my daughter sit in it, I saw that she couldn't even really reach the monkey and butterfly toys at the top.  She also couldn't get the push and pull feature of the toy bars.  I don't know if she's still too young and only knows how to bat at the toys but it just seemed like to me that she got bored very quickly sitting there staring at toys that she couldn't play with.  Perhaps an older baby may like this better but according to the bouncer description, you shouldn't use this on a baby that can sit up on their own and that's the only way I can see any baby being able to reach up for the high toys.  Also, the music and monkey sounds that comes on when you move one of the handles gets really annoying after awhile.  It would be good if there was an off button for the music rather than having to just remove the battery.  Lastly, I thought the toy bars could be moved to the sides so you can easily take your baby in and out of the chair but it doesn't.  That means you have to lift your child from the top and slide their legs out from below the toys.  Not a big deal but another annoying part of the toy design.  I ended up returning this bouncer as it wasn't worth the money for the badly executed design of the toys.	
1. 	We had been letting my son fall asleep with us in a family bed, but after a year of this... my husband and I decided it was time to at least let him go to bed earlier than we did so that we could have some alone time. Putting him down in his crib (in our room) didn't work... he'd cry and cry. Enter the Leap Frog Dreamscapes Soother. After about two nights, he stopped crying when being put in his crib... because he was looking forward to the Goodnight Toes story. I only wish we had bought this sooner. Thanks Leap Frog!	
1. 	We have a one (large) bedroom apartment so my daughter was going to be in our room one way or another.  The bassinet we had was aweful and she ended up sleeping in bed with us all the time.  I visited another new mom who had this product.  What a great idea!  I bought it the next day.  My daughter slept in it!  She is so close that when she starts to stir, I get to soothe her right way.  No more getting out of bed to check if she's breathing either (new moms know what I am taking about!)  I wish we had it as soon as we got home from the hospital!  One note:  even if you don't think you'll need the leg extenders, you probably will.	
- 1	I like the bib but the Velcro is very had/tough and leaves scratches all over the back of 4 month old baby's neck. Would give four+ stars if they were buttons or softer Velcro.	
- 1	I bought it thinking: &#34;oh well, it is Baby Einstein, it has to be good&#34;. Wrong.It is a very hard plastic to play with, specially the &#34;worm&#34; in the middle (my baby is 5 months old and smacks pretty much everything she has in hand).Babies won't be able to put it in their mouth and if the &#34;worm&#34; hits their head, oh boy! Crying time!It might be good for an older baby (to push back and forth like a regular ball) but not for babies learning how to grasp.	
1. 	Works great.  Easy to carry in my purse for whenever I need it.  Easy and fast to put on shopping cart.  Great product![...]	
- 1	They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick. It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated !!! Think of nightime feeding !!!!	
- 1	We bought this item as an alternative to another silicone feeder which we really liked. However that other silicone feeder just wasn't big enough for our growing boys. We like that this one was bigger and held more fruit. The bad part is, this feeder has no method for locking handle to silicone. It has a plastic ring that clicks everything together, but within seconds of using it for the first time my (at the time 11 month old) sons were able to take it apart and mashed up banana was everywhere.In addition all feeders for infants/toddler should have some opening for a tether or lanyard so that the feeder can be held/attached in place. As soon as my sons are done with their feeders they are thrown or just dropped and when we are using them in the stroller that means the feeders are generally. After the few times this happened and we lost feeders we finally started looking every 5 minutes or so to make sure the boys still had them.Overall I was disappointed in this products use, but the size was good.	
- 1	I us a baby food mill and the consistency that it grinds the cooked food into is too chunky for the tiny hole in the spoon. It is a tiny hole. If you plan on only feeding finely pureed mush to your baby for several months on end, this might work. MIGHT. Really tho, the hole is so small that getting even mush through it smoothly enough so that it flows into the spoon instead of shooting out of it at high velocity.In other words... It's a yuppy toy that doesn't quite hit the mark when it comes to taking a good concept and fleshing it out into a usable product.	
1. 	These nail clippers are of superb quality.  Perfectly sized and precision aligned, the sharp cutting edges make easy work of trimming your baby's nails.  If the alignment were poor, they wouldn't work.  Dull edges and they would tear or imperfectly cut.  These clippers have neither defect.  Try them.  You'll learn that Pigeon makes quality baby items.  You'll not be disappointed.	
1. 	This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining (5 stars), theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Glacier(4 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds(2 stars).  Here's her general intro:I'm 5'5 and around 130 lbs.  Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.  Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!  There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.  We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Bjorn:Both DH and I loved this carrier for the newest babies 8-12 lbs.PROS:* It holds them close or hanging loosely away depending on what babe likes and how tight you pull the straps.* Once you become used to the fasteners, it is super-easy and quick to put on and can even be put on with one hand while holding the baby (if pre-clipped in some spots).* It is easily adjustable from mom to dad sizing.* The clip in the back on the arm straps keep the carrier from getting looser as you carry.* The stiff supporting body keeps the wee babes upright and their breathing passages open.* The face-out position is very simple to configure and can be done without putting the baby down, while still wearing the carrier.CONS:* Like I said, we loved this carrier, but really only for babies from 8-10 or 12 pounds (which lasts about a month with my kids) because of the weight put on the shoulders and upper back. DH can use it longer than I can, because he's stronger and larger.* There is some debate about facing the baby out and the stimulus received, but neither of my children minded much, probably because we mostly took quiet walks around the empty neighborhood, park, or around the house.* Also, some say it isn't great for hip development to hold babies by their crotches.	
1. 	Love these. They do exactly what we wanted them to do. I like the pockets at the bottom. My only nitpick is that they don't cover the headrests of each seat and if you have a tall forward-facing carseat (like the Diono), the top of it presses into the headrest. If you have leather seats like we do, it will leave a pretty deep dent that the mat doesn't protect the seat from. Otherwise, great mats. We would recommend them and will definitely get another for baby number 3!	
1. 	Very cushioned.  They stick fairly well, but a toddler could peel them off if motivated.  I'm not wild about the brown color, but this is a case where the safety and thick soft material outweighs my aesthetic sense.  We have even used this around a rock fireplace base and it stayed stuck.  The longer guard is easy to cut for whatever length is needed.  I've reordered and used this product for two houses and I will reorder again if I ever need more.	
- 1	Go to target, walmart or babies r us. Its only $30! I bought mine last month. This is way too expensive.	
1. 	It's a thicker material than some other covers, but that helps it to stay in place when the wind blows.  It's also a bit wider than some other covers.  I like the extra coverage.	
- 1	I had major trouble breastfeeding.  I bought all three sized shields, trying to figure out which one would work for me.  I bought this before I saw the lactation consultant, after reading the Medela specifications on how the shield should fit.  I showed this to the lactation consultant and she said that this would be too small for me.  And it was.  It did fit with room around my nipple, but I found that the large shield helped me pump more milk.  I think that the medela diagram is a little misleading, because when you pump the nipple expands, so I would reconmend going up a size, not down.	
1. 	I love this system.  My husband is a stay at home parent and he never is confused about which bottle in the fridge he should use.  I find the bottles attach to my Medela pump perfectly.  It doesn't take up much space in the fridge.  The bottles have never leaked, even after dozens and dozens of uses and runs through the dishwasher.  We have also found that the caps/nipples from the cheapo Gerber bottles fit on the MilkMate bottles without any leakage.The only thing is that the bottles only mark to 4oz.  Not a big issue for us, I just fill to the neck.  We also have never freezed these bottles so I do not know how they work in that situation.	
- 1	I guess either the bugs in Hawaii are extremely resilient or this product doesn't work. Maybe both. After looking more closely at the contents, I'm convinced my baby smells more like a flower to be eaten.	
1. 	It is a good product.I wish it was higher but it does the trick since my baby has had reflux for few weeks. I'm content with the wedge.	
1. 	This cotton sleep sack has been perfect during nights when it is too warm for our fleece sleep sack. Part of our routine at night is a bath and then putting on pj's and a sleep sack so I was glad to find this lighter one so we could continue our routine. My son is 10 months and around 20 pounds and the large size is nice and comfy for him. He has lots of room but doesn't get tangled in it and can stand when he wakes up (which he always does when he wakes up and calls out for me). The light blue color and cute dog pattern is adorable also. I would recommend this sleep sack as a great alternative to blankets (which we never use because of SIDS and the fact that he moves around so much I don't think a blanket would stay put anyways!).	
- 1	these are cute and artsy but there are so many options out there! i love the My First Touch and Feel cards so much I regret not buying a few packs of those instead of this one set. they may be cute as a gift but i don't recommend them. cards with color would probably get more miles.	
1. 	Our son loved this thing.  It wrapped him nice and snug around his arms.  I credit this for his sleeping for 4-6 hour intervals when he was an infant.  Its better than some of the other swaddlers that bind the leg area, which I read is not good for the baby orthopedically.  This is in the top 5 must haves for new parents.	
1. 	The paci seems nice.  Shaped more like a bulb and less like the orthodontic ones.  My little one refused to use this paci, but he is very particular when it comes to these.	
- 1	These say they are compatable with Medela, but apparently not with the Medela hand pump.  I couldn't get any suction, therefore no milk.  I had already thrown the box away or I would have returned them.  I'm just glad they were cheap!I wish they would have worked because it would make freezing and storing easier.	
1. 	This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it for keeping our new grandsons diapers.  It holds the whole box.	
- 1	My baby is long.  25.5 inches at 3 months..his toes touch the bottom. He can no longer fit in his swaddleme and so I bought this in hopes of continuing to swaddle.  This wrapsack does not have an organic fabric option, so it is rough and less stretchy.  The top buttons close (shoulder straps) with a since snap button each...weak!!  My baby can bust through his swaddleme..this wrapsack doesn't have a chance. Returned.	
1. 	Great product!! Easy to move around, up and down grocery store aisles etc. Very lightweight compared to the travel systems.  I am glad that I bought it, enabled me to spend more money buying the jogging stroller I wanted.  This is great for trips to the grocery store.	
- 1	This 1 star is simply for the description of the product. The ADEN by aden+anais brand is of lesser quality and is 3 inches shorter in both length and width than the original aden+anais brand swaddle cloths. There is a big difference. I just wanted to make people aware that they're not ordering these: http://www.amazon.com/aden-anais-Muslin-Swaddle-Jungle/dp/B002SW3B0O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1366406922&sr=8-2&keywords=aden+anais	
1. 	We started using this bed rail for each side of her bed (don't forget to order TWO- it only comes with one) since she left the crib. We believe this has saved her from falling countless times. She is old enough now to even tell us so. She doesn't want them off, even though it makes climing in and out of bed more of a hassle for her. Excellent product at an excellent price!	
1. 	With 4 of us it gets a little much to have everyone in the bed when we travel, this was perfect for my 3 year old when we traveled for the holidays and even when we moved and had to wait a few weeks before getting an additional bed for his room.	
1. 	I loved it until it was stolen out of our pickup truck.  I guess it was popular.  It was fast and easy to use.  Great for restaurants.  Cleaner too.  I hate using high chairs.	
- 1	These shrink up pretty small, almost unusable as a burp cloth for this reason. The fabric is so stiff that it doesn't drape well and it just feels like a piece of cardboard. I love how the Aiden and Anais burly bibs drape over my shoulder nicely and they are pricey yes but so much better.	
1. 	I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).	
1. 	I read the reviews on many drawer chests before purchasing this one for my 5 month old son's room. I was a little apprehensive before I received it because of some negative reviews, but I am pleasantly suprised. This chest is very nice for the price I paid. It was not that difficult to put together, just need a screwdriver and patience. It took about 3 hours to assemble. There aren't any scratches on the finish, it is also pretty sturdy. The drawers are on metal tracks which makes them open and close very smoothly. I can see us using this for at least several years to come. It came with an anti-tip over attatchment that is very important as my little guy learns to pull up on things and walk. All in all, I am very satisfied with this chest, it was worth the money and I would buy it again if I needed another.	
1. 	The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.	
- 1	I really wanted to love these pouches, but they are too hard to use and keep clean. We gave up.	
- 1	The bag is really cute and great for travel.  I cloth diaper my son and used this bag when I was out and about.  Unfortunately the bag tore in the wash the second time I washed it and it was never put in the dryer.  Yes, its adorable but its not going to last long.  Once you touch the bag you can tell its not very durable.  I gave it two stars because it's a cute bag.  Guess I'll have to figure out how to fix it. Definitely not worth the money in my opinion.	
- 1	I bought this for a trip to the beach, it lasted a whole 30 seconds before my son ripped the foam blades off.  :(	
1. 	I just received these blocks and I'm very pleased with how they look and feel and smell (yes - they don't stink like a lot of kids' toys do these days).They are so beautiful and are a nice size. They are very classically decorated and in soft colours. I especially like that they have so much on each block - you can use them to practice math or to learn about animals as well as the letters of course.I'm tempted to get the lower case ones as well!	
- 1	it mix formula without the bubbles... but it broke after a couple weeks.  I know for the price the product is not going to last forever but a couple of weeks?	
- 1	Prior to Britax I tried Bell Cocoon, and I generally liked that seat.  Britax rated up to the same weight, but is significantly more expensive and has more features such as an adjustable back height and reclining back.  I thought the materials are good and the build quality is solid.  The seat fits my 17 frame Diamondback Menona, and is not an obstruction in any way except blocking the rear blinking light behind my seat.Initially, I thought the way the seat connects to the bike was interesting, as it required much less installation than Bell Cocoon did.  Basically, all that is somewhat permanently needs to be attached to the bike is the lock that you see in the picture at the end of the chrome posts.  The lock comes with an adapter and three sets of 2-each inserts to accommodate for the various frame tube diameter.  There chrome bars are then inserted into the lock and a spring loaded latch is supposed to catch and prevent them from coming out.  The seat is then can easily be attached and detached.I had problems with the spring loaded latch actually catching the notches.  It worked well on the ground, but once installed it would not latch.  I tried everything I could think of to fix the problem.  Moving the lock higher or lower on the frame, trying both #32 and #35 adapter inserts, and making sure the lock is not skewed.  Nothing worked.  In one position I was able to move the latch into closed position by hand and that's when I noticed that, when the lock is installed and tightened, the spring that moves latch into the closed position did not seem to operate properly.  Inserting the seat also required a lot of jiggling it, which was causing the bike, supported by a kick stand, to almost fall.In addition, this may be just an appearance, but it seems to me that Bell Cocoon provides better side protection than Britax.Overall, I liked the idea of how the seat attaches to the bike, but it did not seem to work in my situation.  If it works correctly on your bike, and the price is not an issue, this seat may be a good option with some good features like minimal installation and seating position adjustments.	
1. 	This is a hit.  Baby loves these.  Whenever we have them out around other kids a little older, the bigger kids want them too.  Great for the tub, playing on the floor, high chair, beach... well, we obviously travel with these.  We know they will always offer consistent entertainment for out little one. The colors were different than shown, but still bright & cheery.	
1. 	We purchased this for a special baby who visits us a few times a week.  This chair folds up small enough to store on a shelf where I keep large pots and is easy to strap to a chair for a quick meal of strained whatever.  Said special baby loves to sit at the table with everyone, something a stand-alone highchair might not allow so easily.  Clean-up from our special, but messy, baby guest is a breeze.  I just take the chair and tray to the sink for a quick wipe/spray, although I could put the tray into the dishwasher.  Five stars for sure!	
1. 	Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby.  Had one during her first year.  Now having a second baby and ordered three more!  They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier!  Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby doesn't mind and it still serves it's purpose.	
1. 	This is a great product for helping infants to sleep in cool/cold weather! I like the fleece ones since they aren't as stretchy (and escapable) as the knit swaddlers and they are toasty warm. We used one of these fleece swaddlers almost nightly from month 2-month 4 to help our daughter sleep.	
1. 	I got one of these as a gift for my baby shower and thought... it's a toothbrush, what's there to say?  I ordered a couple more from Amazon since at least I knew what these were.  Well then we take little one into the dentist since she has 7 teeth and a few more coming in and they give use new toothbrushes.  That night I used the new toothbrush since her first one was all chewed up and she is screaming bloody murder.  I'm thinking that it has to be the new toothpaste... so back to the no fluoride toothpaste and still screaming.  Then I notice little drops of blood at her gum lines.  My poor baby was being hurt by the stiff bristles of the other toothbrush.  Well it's a no-brainer that I put those away for when she's older and opened up one of these and no more screaming kid.  Happy, smiling tooth brushing once again!  I know someday I need to go to a stiffer bristle, but for now these soft bristled brushes will be all I use.	
1. 	This was perfect for newborn grandchild. Daughter was very pleased getting this as a gift.  Made baby bathing safer and less stressful for everyone.	
- 1	1. Too heavy to lug around in diaper bag.2. Too big to fit in average size diaper bag.3. Gets activated with the slightest bump - not good if baby is not ready for a bottle!4. One time use then you have to pull out a pot and boil the thing, then lay it to cool.I wouldn't have bought this product if I had known what a pain it would be.	
1. 	This changing pad cover is so soft and looks really nice.  It also washes and dries without shrinking.	
- 1	Could work for some, but my baby will not put these in her mouth.  She does like the Soothie brand.	
- 1	Some people rave about fuzzy bnz but I did not like them.  They ran small.  They have the snaps but they are much smaller than other brands.  Once my baby was around 9 months the diapers seemed small even with the adjustments let out.  They also leaked.  They worked well when she was newborn and not urinating much but around 6 months a fuzzy bunz could not be left on for half an hour.  They leaked around the legs every time.  If she poo'd it too would leak out the legs.	
- 1	It's hard to use, and then you finally do use it, it doesn't work. I suppose the plug on the bottom, designed to help you clean it, would be a useful feature if it were at all possible to get the thing dirty in the first place.Get the same one they gave you in the hospital, a basicBulb Syringe Aspirator, if you want something that actually works. You can also find them at some drug stores.	
- 1	Maybe our crib is smaller than other cribs...not sure.  All I know is that this thing was a waste of my money.  I had a nice Pottery Barn bumper on there until my son started rolling around in his crib and started rolling near the sides.  I bought him breathable bumper since i am scared of SIDS.  I have a SNUZA monitor and video monitor as I am a total SPAZ about it however, I was very bummed that this bumper didn't hold up to my baby.  My husband and I tightened this bumper on several occasions but my son was able to push his feet down on this bumper and manage to get his feet and leg stuck in the crib.  After many nights of my son crying because his leg was stuck in crib, I reluctantly put the  old bumper back on.  Since putting it back on, baby and I have slept better.  I think in theory these bumpers are good but ours did not hold up to our baby who likes to put his feet on everything.	
- 1	I love Uppababy but I am very disappointed with this cup holder (as well as the previous model for how bad it looks). I can not believe that I have to remove the cup holder from the stroller every time I need to collapse it.  It is very inconvenient.  I ended up getting the Diono cupholder for my Vista.	
- 1	I bought this mirror to suction onto the back window of my sedan since my infant is rear facing in his car seat. It would be perfect if it would only stay suctioned onto the window. I have tried cleaning the window and wetting the suction mount, but to no avail. The mirror sticks for about 20 minutes or until you hit a speed bump.	
1. 	I would actually rate this about 3.5 stars.Pros:  The white portion of the product is soft and flexible, so if your child falls into it, it's going to hurt LESS than hitting the hard metal faucet.  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt at all, just less chance of a more serious cut or injury.The water fans out in a waterfall, so your child can sit further back from the faucet and still be able to play with the water as the tub fills.Cons:  The resevoir for the bubble bath sometimes leaks, from the outlet where it's supposed to come out, but occasionally around the sides too.  Not enough leakage to make a big mess while the Boon Flo is on your faucet.  If you want to remove it for your own bathtime, however, the flip-top where you pour in the liquid has a VERY loose seal, so you have to be careful where you store the Boon Flo when not in use, as it will leak.Also, I usually only get two or 3 bubble baths out of how much liquid the resevoir holds before I have to refill it.  Maybe my brand of bubble bath doesn't suds as much as others.Overall, not bad.  My daughter loves the waterfall, but the bubble bath dispenser could be better designed.	
1. 	I LOVE my Boppy!  Everyone asked me, what's a Boppy. I figured it was just for feeding. Boy was I wrong. I breast feed my daughter, so I used it right away in the hospital. I also used it while in the hospital around my belly as an arm rest, since my tummy didn't work well as one any more. When I got home I found laying her in it was perfect, kept her upright so I didn't have to worry about her choking on her milk after feeding, since she has acid reflux the doctor suggested keeping her upright for at least 5 minutes after feedings... I have taken many good pictures of my little one as a baby, held her perfect. Now that she is learning to sit up, its a perfect helper.. I would definetly recomend this to any new parent!	
1. 	We tried Avent first and my son never could drink from that big nipple very well.  I breastfed too he was good on both the bottle and breast.  When we used bottles Dr. Brown seem to cause less gas and he enjoyed them better.	
1. 	Before we got this, my baby was soiling multiple cloth bibs a day.  This bib saves laundry time, catches dribbled food and spit-up equally well and rinses off with ease.  Its light weight makes it easy to toss into a diaper bag for travel, and the pink color is cheerful.  Highly recommended.	
1. 	This keeps my daughter busy.  It's not as good as some of the other teethers, but it's simple and fine and you can't go wrong.  It fits nicely into a purse pocket.	
1. 	I had a hard time figuring out how to review this.  The bottom line is that it is sturdy, allows my son to sleep right next to me safely, seems durable, and is attractive.  The pockets are great.  My son still sleeps in it at seven months old, though our co-sleeper days are numbered due to his steadily increasing mobility.  He still sleeps swaddled, so it still works for us for the time being.Unfortunately, the co-sleeper didn't serve the purpose I bought it for.  When my son was a newborn, he would only sleep while being held, and I ordered this in a sleep-deprived haze hoping that it would help.  It didn't.  While this does allow you to comfortably sleep and rest with a hand on your baby's back, count on your baby being one or two feet away from you while in the co-sleeper.  For those facing similar struggles, I would see if your baby will nap while lying one foot away from you on a regular mattress before buying this.  The co-sleeper didn't help us through my son's exhausting first couple of months.  Of far more help wasThe Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer.  I bought it used for a few bucks -- money well spent.By the time my son was ready to sleep in this, he was done with the frequent night feedings and willing to sleep in his crib, so in that sense the co-sleeper ended up being superfluous.  And when my son is crying because he wants to be held, he doesn't care that I'm just a foot away -- he wants to be held.  The co-sleeper has, however, provided us with some extremely happy nights and mornings.  My son has torticollis and it's best if he can sleep with his head tilted a certain way, and this allows me to check his position whenever I happen to wake up during the night.  And it is just wonderful to fall asleep while watching my sleeping baby, and so much fun to wake up next to each other.  For these reasons, I LOVE the co-sleeper.  But is it a must-have, especially if you're on a budget?  Probably not.As for the pack 'n' play function, it's a sturdy and solid pack 'n' play.  Assembly and disassembly really is tricky, though, so much so that we left this at home when travelling recently.  The joints on the pack 'n' play tend to stick, and we always end up needing to really wrestle with it.  When we are done using this as a co-sleeper, I plan to leave it out permanently as a playpen in our living room -- we will only break it down occasionally, and the neutral colors will be nice.  But a replacement for our super-portable Graco pack 'n' play, which sets up and breaks down in minutes?  For us, definitely not.Two more quick notes.  Pack 'n' play sheets fit the co-sleeper mattress just fine, in my opinion.  I actually have our Graco pack 'n' play bottom with a quilted sheet on top of the Arm's Reach mattress, adding a little softness (though the Arm's Reach mattress is OK) and bringing my baby a little higher and closer to me.  Also, I debated whether to buy the Mini Co-sleeper when I bought this, and I'm glad I went with the full-sized version.  We wanted to keep our son in our room with us for at least the first six months of his life, per AAP recommendations, and it was helpful to us to have this in our room instead of the big crib.  I definitely would not have felt good about having my son in the Mini for more than a few months.  The full-sized co-sleeper is truly the size of a pack 'n' play, which means it takes up a lot of room next to the bed, but that also provides plenty of room for the baby.  My son is a big guy, and he will definitely outgrow this in terms of his mobility before he gets too heavy for it.I hope this review is helpful.  We are on a budget and have made extremely careful choices, so I would never have purchased this if I had known how little it would help us during the newborn stage.  I don't think this is a very good value -- our Ikea crib is rock-solid, highly rated by Consumer Reports and Baby Bargains, will last until my son is a toddler, and cost 2/3 of this co-sleeper.  The fact that the playpen assembly is so cumbersome is very limiting.  On the other hand, it's hard to put into words how wonderful it is to have my son nearby, now that he's willing to sleep there.  If you have a newborn who is willing to sleep in it, this would be so helpful during those early months.  If you have room in your budget, it is really wonderful to have.  I hope to use it for future babies and feel confident enough in the product that I will probably loan it to friends, because I think it will hold up really well.UPDATE: Just transitioned my 8.5-month-old son to a crib full-time, with little fanfare (knock on wood).  I'm leaving up the co-sleeper in case there are tough nights in the very near future, but his gross motor skills are developed enough now that he needs to be in something with higher sides.  My son still sleeps tightly swaddled; otherwise we would have had to have moved him out of the co-sleeper earlier.  When I first posted this review, I wrote that my son has finished the late-night feedings, making the co-sleeper feel superfluous.  As it turns out, though, the co-sleeper has been extremely helpful for the last few weeks -- teething, his first cold, and ramping up solid foods have caused his night sleep to be disrupted, and having him nearby during these stages helped us both get more sleep.  I am pleased that we were able to use the co-sleeper for this long, and pleased that it still looks almost brand-new.	
- 1	Ordered this for my bottle-refusing 3 month old. It was exactly like the Tomee Tippee bottles she was already refusing. There is nothing special about this bottle. I'm sure it's fine, but I feel it's overpriced.	
1. 	We just spent a few days at Disneyland and this container was great for bringing snacks with us.  We were able to use the divider and put 2 different kinds of puffs + 1 kind of yogurt drops.  Worked perfectly.  Lid stays on.  Sturdy (our little guy threw it multiple times). Great container!  Could also be used for just 1 kind of puffs.  Fill it up!	
1. 	I love the print and love that it's cotton. The terry cloth corners are also great for wiping up and cleaning up. It also does a great job keeping us covered. The only down side to this cover is that it gets a little hot for both me and the babe, which is a bummer.	
1. 	This product was very easy to use and required very little effort.  The instructions are clear and are helpful (I noticed a review that a woman rolled the dough too thin, but the directions clearly say not to.  Maybe they have altered the directions to help alleviate any problems since she purchased hers).  I too had enough left over to make a handprint which I was happy about :)  I am so glad to have this keepsake of my baby's adorable little foot.	
1. 	I love boon products and this is no exception, a great bath organizer and holds a lot of stuff.  The frog is huge but it looks great in the bath and holds a lot of toys plus soaps and washcloths.	
1. 	I used the sling for a tiny bit, but found that the seat holds the baby in place quite well.  When he could sit up on his own, I just let him sit in the bottom portion of the tub, where he could splash and play.  We didn't really use the toys, but the tub itself is perfect.  Later we got a tub from IKEA, which he loved until we let him go free in the big tub, but we loved this one while we used it.  We had a cheaper tub for the first month or so, and he was constantly sliding down the seat into the water, and freaking out.  As soon as we got this, he loved taking a bath.	
1. 	This changing pad cover is super soft, easy to put on and take off, and an attractive color green.  I would buy again.	
1. 	After making the purchase, I read bad reviews about the product, try to cancel the order but it was impossible. When the mattress arrived breathe relieved that my baby would not sink in it. I thinkit will serve for one year.	
- 1	It did not work well for our Britax car seat. It wouldn't stay in place. I tried it on our city mini stroller and worked better on that. Although, it's not for the child anymore... More for the adults!	
- 1	These membranes do not stay flush enough against the valve to keep the seal, which means the pump won't work. I tried several of them, and only 1 consistently worked.  Buy the name brand version instead.	
1. 	This mat is great, but the only problem we had was that the mats smelled really BAD (chemical smell) initially.  We aired them out for about a week, and then the smell was much less toxic.	
1. 	Great bottle brush! Even includes a micro cleaning brush in the handle for little hard to reach crevices in bottles.I love that the brush head is so stiff as it really scrubs the bottom of the bottles well.Definite must have for any parent who is bottle feeding!	
1. 	When we had to buy my daughter some new bottles, we tried an old version of these and liked them so much we bought these when we were expecting again.Pros:- Hard cap on bottom protected the bottle when our daughter dropped them--fewer shattered bottles.- Wider mouth on these makes it easier to pour in powdered formula with limited mess- Bottom cap makes cleaning a breeze.- Extra nipples and valves mean less worry about them getting lost or ruined.Cons:- If you shake the bottle up and down to mix formula, you will likely break the seal on the valve.  You can shake from side to side, you don't have this problem.	
- 1	I can't get these to stick in the windows. Oh well.I do, however, put them together and stick them in the top of the rear window, moving it around depending on where the sun will be coming in on baby. They have to be together to be thick enough to stay put, wedged up between the window and the &#34;ceiling&#34; interior.	
1. 	This body pillow is super comfortable but beware...it's huge! We have a California-size bed and it just barely fits on my side. I still like it a lot though. It's also pretty versatile in the different ways it can be used. Just keep in mind, if you sleep in a Queen-size bed this pillow will take up most of the room.	
- 1	This carrier is well made. I just didn't like all the work to get my little situated. It's almost like you need someone to help you to get it on in a reasonable amount of time and safely. I returned it for a baby bjorn carrier instead.	
1. 	He does not love it, but he chews on it and bangs it all over, so I guess he likes it :)	
1. 	We love the bumpkins bibs and I was actually using an old one as an art smock. I was happy to find the same one in a larger size.	
- 1	If this thing sat up for more than two seconds it would be wonderful. The velcro doesn't hold it closed tight enough to hang from his pack and play either.	
1. 	We use this to organize creams, wipes and diapers on the changing table.  It keeps the area clear or clutter and we use it every couple of hours, so I can't complain.  If I could change one thing I would want it to hold a few more diapers.  I would recommend this to a friend and would purchase it again.	
- 1	I don't recommend these at all.  If you're looking for a washable trainer, spend the extra $ on something that works and get some from Little Beetles or Imse Vimse.  These are no more absorbent than a pair of regular cotton underwear.	
1. 	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.	
- 1	Bought this for storage and washing of bottle items.  In my cleaning, it's been completely useless.  I couldn't store or wash Dr. Brown bottles in it, which is the type of bottle I have.  I opted to simply wash bottles by hand and sterilize in the microwave.  If you have smaller/wider bottles, this may be a better option for you.	
1. 	We have a one year who has been wearing these bibs since her 8th week...  got a bunch of them as hand me downs, along with the usual outfit coordinated bibs (which always seem tiny) and have exclusively used these over all the others.  The colors match every shade of pink in her wardrobe, and the other colors match when you don't want so much pink.  Stains come right out with Shout for food matter, and never had an issue tossing in the dryer on low heat.  Since we got them without the original packaging, never knee they were hang dry recommended.  Still, as long as the velcro ends are matched up, they don'get stuck to other items.  And the velcro is such a great, strong one that our daughter can't rip these off like she does the wimpy decorative ones.  And they are the perfext thickness for using with the Playtex Binky tethers--clip on easily and remove easily without marring the bib material.  I swear, these are the only bibs anyone needs.  Buying more because a few have gotten misplaced at daycare (aka put in another kid's cubby and the parents didn't want to return them because they're that good!).  May buy the boys colors too for even more color matching potential to outfits.	
1. 	Excatly what I needed. plenty of spares for my pump. I pump a lot and these membranes wear out pretty fast due to heavy use and abuse :)  Cheaper to get them in bulk so I always have spares on hand. These should last me.	
- 1	This thing is very hard to figure out. One setting gets the bottle too hot too fast, try another setting for 15 min's and you still have cold milk! I tried to use it for 3 months... finally gave up. Save the money. Warm water in the microwave and stick the bottle in that... Sometimes we need to listen to our mom's and grandma's - they didnt have these and we turned out fine!	
- 1	Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working.	
1. 	If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.	
1. 	Here is my comparison of the Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Cover to Safety 1st Swivel Outlet Cover.  We have two of each and all have been installed for between 2 weeks and 2 months.For Mommys Helper Safe Plate:Pros:Doesn't feel flimsyEasy to plug in/ unplug itemsEasy to installLooks niceIncluded screws fit and match the color of the outlet plateCons:Slightly more expensive than Safety 1st Swivel Outlet coverOnly replaces single screw outlet coversMight be slightly easier for toddlers to figure out than swivel coversI've never heard of Mommys Helper before	
- 1	This was okay for the price. It's nice that they sell this trial pack, so I didn't make the mistake of buying a bunch of them. The prefolds that came in this set are small. Unless your baby is tiny, you won't be able to fold them around your baby (we usually wrap prefolds and flats around her and use Snappis to hold them in place), only fold them in thirds. The diaper cover is a one-size. It comes loose around my DD's legs all the time and is a bit smaller than her Thirsties Duo Wraps (also the adjustable size with snaps). The cover is very flimsy. I also have more leaks and blow-outs with the cover, even if I use a better diaper. Bottom line:  This set stays at the bottom of my stash for emergencies.	
1. 	This dresser/changing table has been amazing!  Most of the cloths for our little girl that are the current size fit in this dresser.  I use the drawers fir cloths.  The shelves I have out baskets in.  The top shelf I fill with diapers.  The bottom has a basket full of miscellaneous baby stuff.  A changing pad, heated wipe holder, and lotions, creams and a small basket fit on the top of the dresser.After our baby outgrows the changing table she will use it as a greaser in her room.Assembly was not too hard.  I took us about two hours.	
1. 	The description lists that the machine allows 2 sounds to be combined... only some sounds can be combined... you can combine most of the water sounds with bird sounds or other beeping type.  The thunder sound in good but the womb sound is more like a broken radio.  We've been using the machine with our 14 month old for the last few months and he sleeps longer when it is on and goes to sleep sooner.  My main issues with it are those described above and that it doesn't have a memory... when yo turn it off then back on it goes back to a default, not the combination of sounds and volume level you had it on last.	
1. 	These are helpful when you have a high bed. It worked well to increase the height. It makes the co-sleeper more wobbly and when you pick up the co-sleeper, the extensions can fall off so you cannot place it down without it being re-built. Would still recommend if you needed to increase the height.	
1. 	I bought these thinking I was going to store milk in the bottles but ultimately ended up not pumping into the avent bottles despite purchasing the converter kit for the Medela pump.  They work as promised and are good value but I am now not using them.	
- 1	I have a 14 month old and I carefully read the reviews on this product before purchasing.  I ensured the surfaces were very clean and dry before installing and let them sit for 48 hours before using.  This product seemed to work fine for the first few weeks, but now they are falling off every cabinet and drawer in my house, breaking in different places (some at the junction of the clear & white plastic, some where the adhesive pads are joined to the cabinets).  Also worth noting that ssing as a toilet lock did not work for more than a day or two.  Very disappointed.  I am now ordering several alternatives to try.  Do not waste your time on this product.	
1. 	It's well designed to fit a number of bottles and all the accessories.  My only problem is that the bottles take a while to dry.  I sometimes have to let them air dry off the rack.	
- 1	Now that my son moves a lot, the insert moves too and the adhesives end up sticking to his skin and irritating it. He's also had diaper rash which he doesn't get with Seventh Generation disposables.	
1. 	I don't agree with the dimensions listed on Amazon's description.  It does come with 4 pieces that are about 12 inches long...which will cover one side of your crib.  However, I don't know what the 1.5 x 5 part is.  I measured the ones I have and the inside of the plastic measures about 3/4 of an inch...and the outside of it is around an inch.  The plastic is fairly flexible.  I have the Aspen 4-in-1 crib and it fits my rails just fine.  My 11 month olds have not pulled them off....yet ;)  There is another listing for this same product, http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Crib-Rail-Teether/dp/B001JBALRQ/ref=pd_sbs_ba_5 , you might be able to get an idea of the size/shape of the crib rail it expects.I covered just one side of their crib at first, but this seems to work and I just went out (to a local store) and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib.I recommend this product, however, you need to measure or consider your crib rails - they need to be on the skinny side.Update:  After several months of use, I noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails.  It is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail.  I hardly noticed until I looked at it harder.  I still like what the product does, however, I'm disappointed that it has ruined the wood.  My cribs are cheap anyway, but still, I take good care of my stuff.  I don't know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that (I didn't).  I thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about.	
- 1	The way the pocket hangs, it closes up on itself, so it doesn't catch spills very well. Stick with the OXO roll up for travel.	
- 1	The actual item is fine. It is well made but doesn't fit on the handles of an umbrella stroller. It would only fit if the handles were horizontal, not angled. My complaint is strictly on the description of the item which didn't advise this design issue. Alternately, it would take only a small design change to accommodate different angles of handle (like a grommet that would allow it to spin relative to the velcro straps).  I gave it away.	
1. 	Overall I love this mobile.  The music is great quality, although i wish it had an even lower volume setting.  the remote works great and what i love the most is that the box can be set to activate the music manually, or that the music can only be activated by the remote.  my daughter loves the animals and it is really very stimulating in color design and motion.  the reason i took one star away is that on each arm there are 3 shapes that slide around, making too much sound for my daughter.  it startled her every time when she was about to fall asleep, so i took a rubberband and fixed it around the shapes so they wouldn't slide anymore.  since then, it works like a charm.  i have not had any technical problems with it so far, 3 weeks of use, so i keep my fingers crossed.over all it's a very nice mobile, and having two kids, i've been through quite a few, still haven't found the perfect one, but this is the closest i've found to perfect.	
1. 	I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.	
1. 	This tub is amazing! It has the sling for infants and can be taken out as they grow into toddlers. Very user friendly. My granddaughter is very small and can still take a bath in it with the sling. I know she'll be able to use it for a long time.	
1. 	It did not take my husband very long at all to put this crib together. I love how thick and heavy all the parts are and that our baby will be able to use it for quite a few years once it turns into a toddler bed. My only complaint is that when I put the mobile on the crib, the finish got scratched off. I was disappointed that it got scratched before our baby even got here, but that's typical of environmentally friendly finishes like DaVinci uses and I was not surprised because other reviews had mentioned this as well.	
1. 	I love this swing!!! My daughter sleeps and plays in this swing. She doesn't really take notice to the mobile and lights b/c its kinda too far for her to look up but the music is very fun and soothing. I don't recommend running the mobil, lights and music at the same time though b/c the battery life sucks. It seems to last a good amount of time just running the music while swinging.	
- 1	The concept is simple, but the execution was lacking as a faucet cover.  Ok, so I purchased this product for the main purpose of deflection water so that it flowed better into a tub and second purpose to protect my child from bumping into the faucet.  This product failed in my mind on both.As a protector, it should do the job.As a water deflector, it's terrible. If you turn your water on high enough, water is deflected and sprayed in almost 270 degrees around the product. If you have a baby or toddler, your child's face will likely be bombarded with water.  The problem is with the placement design of the water deflector.  It needs to curve more so that when water hits the deflector, it's directed to flow smoothing, not splashed like when you poor water on flat surfaces.A positive is that the deflector has a tiny hole drilled so that any trapped water is drained overtime, leaving very little water to cause mildew.Another positive is that the installation is simple.  Just squeeze the top and bottom and slide into the faucet.  However, the product lacks a good snug fit design.  Therefore it slides right off with a slight pull.	
1. 	We chose to use these bags over a diaper genie, and glad we did.  Each little sassy bag can hold about four or five used diapers before needing to be thrown out.  This provides the convenience of not running to the trash with every diaper change (especially at night) but also forces you not to keep a weeks worth of dirty diapers in the nursery (as you would with the pale systems).  As an added benefit, these bags work very well for travel and we always keep a few in the diaper bag.On the negative side, these bags do give off a strong baby powder smell.  However, for me, it is only an issue for a few moments when I open up a new bag.  The smell quickly dissipates. But, I can see how it could bother some people more.Overall, this is a good cheap method of dealing with dirty diapers.	
1. 	I bought this one after reading lots of reviews of the first brands (including this) and also 'cause my sister in-law recommended it and was the best decision I made! I used it for 7 months and still works perfect. I must tell I really USED IT, I mean: 'till my baby turned 3 months I was pumpin every 2 hours every day! 3rd to 5th months every 4 hours every day, and 6th and 7th months 2 times a day.My only recommendation is that you look for the correct size of the breastshield since it comes with a 24mm that's a medium size: [...]I remember cleaning every part every time I used it and it was a job, but it's easier if you clean it with hot water and dishwashing liquid right away after use it. I only sterilized it once a day the first month and once a week after that and was enough.I totally recomend it!!	
- 1	I returned these as I just could not bear to see them on my crib. I'm sure they probably do their job, but they certainly didn't look nice. They were a lot bigger than I was anticipating. I ordered the natural fleece ones. Perhaps another color would have been nicer, but they were just so large. I ended up wrapping my baby's crib rails in satin ribbon instead. It looks much better and she doesn't seem to like biting it as much as the wood.	
- 1	We flew with our infant regularly, so I needed product(s) that would be compact and keep her entertained on the plane. Maybe it was just my daughter but she was not a fan...the zipper was fun...the clip was a little too much for her (and still is at 15 months)...it just did not seem like each little item was collectively age appropriate. My daughter could do the zipper at 8 months no problem and pull of all the little pieces...she could not do a button though or the clip...well now she is 15 months and can do the button with ease, not the clip and has no interest in the other pieces because she essentially outgrew them. The mirror is completely fuzzy and was since we purchased it, light does not even reflect from it very well. Not worth the price...there are so many better toys out there for travel!	
- 1	I was thinking that this would be really handy for outlets that I use more frequently and I am sure if could be if I had not had trouble installing it. I removed my old switch plate and replaced it with this one. However when I was installing it (using the screw that it came with) the screw broke off and the tip is now stuck in my outlet box. I now have to turn off my electricity and remove the outlet box to try and fish the screw out from the other end. In the meantime I have an exposed outlet which kind of defeats the purpose of getting a safety cover. Hopefully once I managed to get this item installed it will be smooth sailing.	
1. 	This fits our pack n play mattress very well. I love it for when our daughter sleeps on that mattress.	
- 1	I was super excited to learn about these testing strips but I have not used them more than 3 times in the past 3 months. I wish they would have varying shades for levels of alcohol detected to I knew exactly how much was in my milk. Instead, they turn dark brown even at the slightest bit that may not harm your baby, which causes you to waste milk. Now, I just use good old fashioned common sense. If I have a glass of wine, I wait an hour or two to feed my baby. If I feel buzzed, I pump and dump  and then wait to feed him for the next feeding.	
1. 	This toy is so pretty!  Even I like to sit and listen to the music with my baby :) My only complaint is that it is too loud.  I got it when my baby was about 3 months old and he was scared of it's lound music at first.  But now at almost seven months he really enjoys it.  I have to put it against the couch though becauce it slide on the carpet and he falls when he holds on to it for support.	
1. 	This is something I often buy for expectant parents; it will be great for many years to come! We use it at the beach because it's easy to get rid of the sand, and we use it on grass if there's been some rain. Folds up easily.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating.	
- 1	These are no where near the same quality as the Playtex VentAire Wide Bottle. I thought they were at least in the same family but I was completely wrong. The universal nipples that Playtex makes for all their bottles do not fit on these bottles. Also there are no meterings on the side so there's no way to know how much milk is in the bottle. These were so far from what we wanted we didn't even use them and ended up donating them to charity.However, you don't have to look too far to find the perfect bottle and they are somewhat related. The Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set is exactly what you want. They are so good in fact we went back and bought another set.ALSO BUYER BEWARE EVEN THOUGH WE NEVER USED THESE BOTTLES AMAZON WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN THEM!	
- 1	Love this diaper bag. Has enough space to fit everything inside. Love the way it looks has a thick strap so that its secure. Love love love love it. I would defiantly advice to buy it and suggest it to friendsMy son was born sep 17 and less then a month later the pin to close the bag broke off and because it was a gift from the registry and because we had a baby shower early because of complications with my pregnancy the return policy expired so upset really loved the material and pattern.	
1. 	I use this all the time when I store my milk in the refrigerator.  It does its job.	
- 1	I thought this was really cute, and I thought this was going to help my toddler get more comfortable with the shower - NOT.It takes some work to pump (no way a toddler could do it) and then the amount of water that comes out is negligible.My toddler did not like it and did not want it in the bath at all.I do not think there is a problem with this particular product, I think they probably all work like this.The idea is much better than what the product actually is.Don't waste your money.	
- 1	I read such wonderful reviews of this mirror, that I couldn't wait to get it.  My baby is only 2 1/2 months old right now, and I find this mirror an irritation.  It takes 2 people to get the mirror placed so that the driver can see baby's face (one person in the back seat and the other in the driver seat).  The smiley face on the frog takes up valuable space.  When trying to get baby's face positioned in mirror, the smiley face frequently cuts straight through baby's face, making her facial expression impossible to see.  Hubby and I worked for 20 minutes to adjust this mirror so that Baby's face was visible from the driver's seat.  Once the baby's face is visible and the frog's smiley face is around the area of baby's neck, the picture is warped so badly that I feel like I'm watching the movie Alien.  I CAN see if baby's head is in the proper position and see if baby is smiling or frowning, making this semi-functional when mirror is placed right.  The biggest problem is that when someone sits in the back seat next to baby, they may touch the hand or foot of the frog as they are buckling themselves in.  If they do, then it moves the mirror and the quest to get the mirror placed correctly starts all over again.  I give this 2 stars because I expect as baby grows, her legs will be long enough to reach frog's belly, and she may find the toy interesting to play with.  At that point, I seriously hope I don't need to see her in the mirror anymore.	
1. 	I have nothing but great things to say about this wipe warmer. If my baby needs a midnight change he doesn't even notice that I am changing him because he doesn't feel a cold wipe on his bottom! I highly recommend!	
1. 	Classic toy that my daughter plays with all the time.  When she was younger she loved to knock down the stacks of cups we would build for her.  Now that she is older (15 months) she loves to nest the cups inside one another.  They are great in her water table as well and I'm sure will be just as fun in sand.  The 2 smallest cups are pretty small and will most likely get lost under furniture, but such is life with a toddler.	
1. 	I wanted to pick up a potty in order to have an option for my LO when traveling. A friend told me to keep it in the car and you never have to find a bathroom. Great idea!  The only trouble I saw with this idea was having to clean up the mess while out and about.  That's the main reason I like this potty.  You can place a diaper in it and the seat will hold it securely in place. No mess to clean up!It also serves as a step stool and this has come in handy ( we use it at home when not traveling). LO seems to really like it too.	
1. 	The Bjorn is worth every penny!I purchased my Baby Bjorn when my son was two months old, and used it on a daily basis until he was four months old (my son went to work with me for two months).  It is much easier on the back than the Snugli carrier is - I still carry my 10-month-old, 21-pound son in our Bjorn at least once a week.I love it because it keeps my hands free, and my son starts giggling and babbling every time he sees it because he enjoys riding in it so much.  (I have to confess, there have been a couple of times when I gave it to him to play with because I needed to get some baby-free stuff done!)  I never worry about dropping him when he is in the Bjorn.Our Bjorn has been through the washer and dryer several times and is only showing a little color fading.  I would recommend unhooking the straps from the carrier before throwing it all in the wash - they can get really tangled together.	
- 1	cons -very hard to openonce opened - very hard to close.tried multiple time to close out multiple ways (to have the triangle aligned) but it always leakstoo small to return.. i won't buy it again.	
- 1	I'm sure they're great for others, but I simply could not get the hang of them (combined with a prefold) after 2 months. They leaked out the legs AND the back every sing time. From what I've read elsewhere, the elastic binding (otherwise known as FOE) and tag have a tendency to wick moisture.I'll stick to pocket diapers...only 3 leaks after 4 months!	
1. 	We have been using these bibs for the past 6 months for our baby. I love the size as it helps keep her outfits clean, and the little pouch is great in preventing most food from hitting the floor. (Although that makes our dog sad!) These bibs are super easy to keep clean, either through hand-washing or throwing in the washer.  I received/purchases other bibs and none hold a candle to the durability of the Bumkins bibs. Even after 6 months of use, there is no need to replace them at this time.	
1. 	This is an excellent mattress.  Good firmness and support but not too hard.  Baby sleeps wonderfully on it every night and most all naps.  Standard sheets fit it well, and it's light enough that's it's very easy to lift out of the crib for sheet changes.  Great buy!	
1. 	it's very cute and useful - from getting the straps into my baby's chubby neck since he has very sensitive skin!  i was worried it would be too hot for him, but it's not that bad.	
1. 	My daughter has the kind that just plug in and you have to pry your fingernail down between the plug and the fixture to get the darned thing off.  I have soft fingernails so it's really hard for me to do that when I want to use and outlet at her house.  I got these for my house and they are much easier to use.  All you do is squeeze the sides and push the top button and they pull right out.  It's great because they stick out a little from the wall so you can get a much better grip on them and don't have to use your fingernails to pry them off.  However, it would be a challenge for a baby to get them off because he probably couldn't squeeze the sides and push the button at the same time. I'm happy with the purchase.  I am a 57 year old grandma and if I can do it anyone can.	
- 1	I sheepishly admit to buying the Adiri Bottle for its design value first, effectiveness second. That being said, it's the first bottle we've tried, so we don't have much to compare it to, but pleasantly, it works well for us. I like the top being more breast-like in look and feel (for a hesitant one-month old baby that initially gave it the stink eye, but warmed up to it after a few minutes), and whether the petals are good in terms of baby taking less air (compared to other bottles), again unsure. But it does cause more burping than from the breast. A big turnoff for some will be that the bottle can't go into a bottle warmer (because the air valve at bottom will leak and/or the size of bottle), but we often store our milk in the breast-pump bottles or snappies containers and use these with the warmer.Addendum: After a few months (month 6), the babe drank less and less milk. I thought it was possibly a self-weaning, but turns out it was the bottle that was the problem. We switched to Born Free Glass Bottles and the babe seems to like this much better and  thankfully daily milk consumption went from 2oz to 23oz. Now I know why parents seem to have some many brands of the same stuff. . . . sometimes the babe just doesn't like it and parents are forced to try another . . . and another.  This was just my kid's experience. Yours might be different.	
- 1	These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.	
1. 	I bought a MamaDoo Kids Playard Mattress Topper for my Graco play yard and this sheet fits great over the mattress and it all fits nicely in the play yard. The sheet is soft and plush - which the play yard mattress definitely needs - it feels like cardboard. Washed and dried it in the machine and it came out great. I just ordered two more.	
1. 	I'm so glad I discovered these wipes. Before, I would wash my pump parts in the one kitchen we have at work. After one too many run-ins with our CFO in the kitchen, I decided I need to find a way to clean the pump in the privacy of my mother's room. It is embarassing to try to hold a professional conversation with someone when they've caught you with phalanges drenched in your breast milk! These wipes are perfect. Also, as other reviewers have said, one wipe can last for more than one use, so even though they are a bit expensive, you can get your money's worth out of them.	
- 1	This tub holds very little water before it starts spilling over through the folding areas.  Huge pain and sad because I was really looking forward to taking this on trips.  We ended up buying the inflatable ducky tub instead by munchkin.	
1. 	These cups are awesome they dont leak and my 3 year old loves them.  She can drink out if a big cup but it seems to spill alot. So these cups are a great exchange.  They've been dropped thrown and you name it and none have broke so far.	
- 1	I really WANTED to love this stroller. It's gorgeous. I have owned it for 90 days and am sending it back. It is fine for a short trip to the mall but nothing else. Considering the price I paid and the other reviews I have read (foolishly AFTER my expensive purchase) I cannot see why a reputable upscale baby manufacturer would be excited to call this their new and improved 2013 model. Here are my 2 issues (and why would they not be issues with a $250.00+ stroller??)The Very Small Canopy-  Seriously?? Is skin cancer a new and confusing medical issue to the London folks? Because it's been an issue here in the US for a while. Even cheap Walmart umbrella strollers have better canopies then this. I have seen similar strollers that have the whole brace tilt foward, which I stupidly assumed this did. Nope. Not a chance. When sitting in the upright position your baby will get a total of maybe 5 inches of sun coverage. But.....this is not a problem at all! Because you can call Maclaren and for an additional $45.00 they will send you a &#34;UV sun visor&#34; that clips onto your strollers hood. Does it match your very expensive stroller? Nope! In fact, it resembles a Hefty trash bag. But, it *does* have the Maclaren logo on it so everyone will know it was expensive! Yay!The Front Wheels/Dirty Hood Issue- Whenever you fold this stroller up the front wheels press tighly against the canopy. leaving remains of wheatever you just recently rolled through for everyone to see. After only 90 days this is absolutely disgusting looking.	
- 1	Both of my daughters slid right down the positioner.  So I stopped using it right away. I do not recommend this product at all.	
1. 	this is one of those things you buy and will never see.  It's pasted under the car seat and in theory it's protecting the seat from long term chafing from the car seat.  All I can say is it fit our suv well and was simple and easy to use.  The front pocket on it is a nice touch	
- 1	These I thought would be a great idea since they dont leak...and they really dont.  However, My son is 6 months old and could not suck through the nipples. They look nice but if he cant eat out of them, they are no use....I would NOT recommend these at all.	
1. 	I have mixed feelings about the monitor. I use it all around the house and have not had any problems. I dont' get any static in the house around appliances, phones, TVs etc. But I do get some when I use my breast pump. I can still hear the baby through the static though. However, we have tried to use the monitor outside in our garage while we were in the hot tub. With the hot tub and TV on it was all static. All the red lights were lit up and you couldn't hear a thing besides static. Therefore we may be looking for a new monitor to use outside.	
1. 	We use these to freeze purees. They are wonderful. Top rack dishwasher safe & haven't retained any smells so far. Love the lids	
- 1	I gave this product two stars because it does work to keep my daughter out of our cabinet but it is a pain to get the cabinet open when you want to get into it.  You have to take the entire contraption off the cabinet to get inside it.	
1. 	She loves these cups, but it is hard for her to get the watter maybe whe she grows up it would be easier, she is only 1 year	
- 1	I wanted to try something new and cheaper. Bottom line is this diaper is HARDLY even water proof. Spend your money on BUM GENIUS 4.0 Instead!	
- 1	I bought these sippy cups based on the great reviews, but I'm disappointed. Yes, they don't leak, but my daughter (2 yrs old) has a hard time sucking the milk/juice from them, like the spill proof seal is a little too tight. And even when she does get the milk out, there is always about a half inch left that she can't get out because the spill proof insert sticks out too much and doesn't allow the milk to funnel down... even when I tried to drink from it to see why she was struggling with getting that last bit out, I couldn't. Bad design... wasteful and it frustrates my daughter because she can see more in the cup but can't get it out.	
- 1	NEW:  I have no reason to love or hate this product.  I didn't pay for it.  You can clearly see that where it says its a vine review.  I WANT to love it, but honestly - I'm beyond grateful I didn't pay for it because I'd be going through the hassle of returning it.  There is nothing at all IQ about this unless its below 70.I tried doing what others suggested, adding more water and setting it for a larger amount which in itself significantly defeats the purpose of this IQ warmer but hey, I wanted to give it a fair shot.  I tried different bottles (Avent specifically).Still wrong.  The top is still on fire, and the milk cold.  Newest thing?  On the FOURTH try it just flashes lights and no longer allows me to select anything.  Broken after four uses?  Really?There are plenty of baby products out there that will actually make your life easier...this warmer is NOT one of them.------OLD REVIEW:  I want to love this.  I really do.  It seems so simple and straight forward.  Put a little bit of water in, pick a temp, pick amount, start.  However, there's definitely a learning curve and I haven't quite figured it out yet.  I read through the other reviews but I still can't seem to get a bottle just right my biggest issue seems to be that the lid and top of the bottle will be HOT while part of the bottle feels cold.Once I get it figured out, it really will make those late night bottles significantly easier, but until then its actually more of a headache.I'll update when I get it figured out.(BTW: I'm using Dr. Browns bottles - natural flow..4oz...maybe someone has advice on what I'm doing wrong or how to get it right?)	
1. 	A friend recommended this to me when my baby was 3 weeks old. When it arrived, we took the speaker out of the bear and attached it to the side of her bassinet. I don't know if we're just lucky, but our baby has been sleeping through the night since about 8 weeks (and only woke for one feed a night prior to that since about 4 weeks). It does get through a lot of batteries, but I definitely think it's worth it! I have been recommending this to many friends!	
1. 	These covers rock!  They hold the ickiest you know what in.  I never had a blowout with Bummi diaper covers.  LOVE THEM!Also the velcro is great.  It has not worn out after many washes.  We will be able to use these with the next baby.	
- 1	At first it was a really great product. Then I had to start replacing pieces frequently, and having to break-down the whole thing every few days to wash it was irritating. If I left anything together mold appeared. Eventually after only a few months I could no longer get any suction no matter which piece I adjusted or replaced.	
- 1	This was a dumb purchase :( Why did I buy a seat insert that has no grip whatsoever on my baby's bottom? It's made of the type of smooth plastic that offers no grip/friction, especially when submerged in water, so in order to bathe my baby, who doesn't have adequate head support, I need to use one hand to wash her and the other hand has to be placed- at all times to ensure she doesn't go under water- underneath her bottom near the seat's crotch area. If you want an infant seat bath insert, don't waste your money on this one.	
1. 	When I opened the box to find these Taggies soft blocks I was ecstatic. AppleBlossom likes them too. There are so many colors and textures! I love the different animals and the shooting star! Two blocks have a bell inside and the other two blocks have the crinkly material, both are great noises that really catches her attention and curiosity. Already she is grasping the tags and rubbing them between her fingers. These blocks are the first Taggies-type product she's been around and already I can tell they are a big hit. When she is more into holding the blocks I can easily see toting a couple around in the diaper bag, and they are no problem at all in size for that either.	
1. 	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you!  No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).  The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. These work alright but started tearing in the wash after the second wash. I previously bought OsoCozy wipes and have been using them for over a year (they look exactly the same) and almost none of them have torn up with frequent washing (I use these as diaper wipes). I would never buy this brand again and would pay double for the OsoCozy that won't fall apart immediately. My mistake!	
1. 	After reading the other review about the small size being &#34;so small it would fit a doll, not a child,&#34; I purchased the large size. The large size was WAY too big for my 1 year old! She is 15 months, of average to above average height, and will still be using the small for a long time. The child's legs need to be long enough to not just touch the floor, but also be able to bring their legs forward and back to be able to scoot it along. My 15 month old still needs a little longer legs to be able to scoot better. She is of average or above average height. I think the suggested ages are right. My child will be ready for the large at about 3 years old.	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
1. 	I can't rate on how easy it was to put together as someone got this as a gift for my baby already assembled:)how thoughtful! What I can say is this dresser is pretty good quality for the price. I know there are alot of reviews on other brands of dressers that say its made of flimsy cheap material; this dresser is not the case. Its heavy and stable. I got the cherry color and it is absoutely gorgeous! The only thing I am questionable about on the dresser are the drawers catch. I was told this is a safety feautre, but I am not sure if that is accurate or not. This dresser even comes with some extra doodads so that you can attach your dresser to the wall-great safety feature. Overall I love this dresser and am planning on getting the 5 drawer soon!	
1. 	We bought this for attaching to picnic tables when we go camping, and it worked very well.  We also tried to use it at church, but the newer plastic tables are &#34;hollow&#34; underneath, and that made it difficult to get the chair secured.  Some have mentioned that it does not work with a table with a &#34;skirt&#34;.  As you can see from the picture, it does work with a &#34;skirt&#34;, you just have to set the bottom locks into place in front of it.  The baby's weight does most of the job of securing the seat to the table, so even when we couldn't necessarily tighten down the bottom &#34;screws&#34;, I still felt that she was secure and safe in the chair.What I did not like:The carrying bag is too small.The back of the chair is very straight and I felt like she was forced to lean forward in the chair too much.One side on the one I purchased does not fold down very easilyWhat I did like:PricePortabilityEase of cleaningOverall, I'm happy with the chair.  It does what I need it to do and is a good product for the price.	
1. 	I make my own baby food and these come in so handy when defrosting the baby food I have made! They also are great for snacks and it's all in one bag. Great price and they are long lasting.	
- 1	You cannot pan with this product so when the baby rolls during the night, you lose him/her.We returned this and got a web cam.  We love it. Picture quality is better, you can pan/zoom, record video, set alerts to record ro email you when there is motion (if you want to use as a security camera), and you can watch baby with the sitter while you are away! Oh, plus it's $100 less than this!	
1. 	I think that this food processor is a bit small for when you want to do big batch of food but I love it because :1. It gives a really smouth purees2. It's easy to clean (diswasher !!!)3. Usefull even with toddlers who are not always comfortable with meat.	
- 1	This thermometer consistently disappoints, and the last thing I want when my child is potentially running a fever is second guessing the results of a thermometer.  I ended up buying a simple rectal thermometer, and have used that with great success.  This one would say no probe was attached (when one was on), wouldn't register a reading, or would register a reading that was clearly wrong.  A huge disappointment for a relatively expensive thermometer.	
1. 	This is a great product. It is built from very high quality pine, and is extremely sturdy. Assembly was straight-forward and the hardware included is excellent quality as well. Our baby moves around quite a bit during sleep, and this crib does not move one bit! As a result, she sleeps very soundly at night. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	
- 1	Transitioning my son off of the bottle onto a sippy cup, the born free traning cup was the only one he would take his milk in.  I went ahead and ordered 2 of the drinking cups since they were bigger, the description says that it is a soft spout but when I received them, the packaging said &#34;hard spout&#34; and my son will not take them at all.  I now have to order new cups with a real soft spout.  They also leak like crazy!!!!  Brand new, hadnt even tried to drink of out it yet and it was laying on it's side dripping out of the spout everywhere!!	
- 1	this was a big waste of money.  remote didnt work and the music was grainy	
1. 	These cover the whole outlet and are hard to remove, as expected. Can't beat the price for what you get!	
1. 	If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day (maybe 2 or 3) this is a great pump. I didn't know how to use it at first but after calling Medela's customer support line I was able to use it easily. I didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout the day (Your hands would hurt).But other than that I think is a great pump for the price.	
1. 	I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon.	
1. 	My daughter adored her gym until she was about 6 months old and she started sitting. It's perfect for tummy time so baby's little face isn't mashing into the carpet. My daughter LOVED the giraffe - she would stare at it and grin and jabber to it non stop. It was so neat watching her go from just lying there to reaching up and batting her toys around. The monkey falls down after awhile but you can knot his tale to keep him up there. My daughter like to pull him down though. My only complaint is that it doesn't store well. Once you set it up, it's really easiest to just leave it up until you're ready to pack it up for the next baby or yard sale. It's not difficult to take down and put back up - just not convenient if you need to do it often, which we didn't.	
- 1	I like that these are chunky enough so my fingers don't slip, but they aren't sharp enough to clip my baby's fingernails cleanly. The edges wouldn't cut at all. These are junk; I threw them away.	
1. 	This thing actually fits her mattress. I've struggled for nearly 2 years trying to put the sheets on her mattress over top the mattress protector, even ripping holes in several of the corners because the sheets simply do not fit. I understand they are supposed to be snug, but good grief. This sheet is WONDERFUL. It's pretty soft, and fits with those fantastic &#34;deep pockets&#34;. No more frustrating bed linen days!	
1. 	The cap does what it should, but it took a very long time to get here.  I'm a little spoiled by Prime, but it took well over a week.	
1. 	Our daughter is 32 months old (two years) and I bought this potty for her to use. My mother in law bought one too, I suppose she was trying to help, but it wasn't as good as this one. I strongly prefer it over almost all the potties locally available. The reason I like it so much is that the cup is under the seat and not part of the seat. The one my mil bought has the cup as an inset into the top and when my little girl sits on it, it sticks to her bottom and well, I'm sure you can guess what happens when she has used it...Unfortunately she stood on the lid of the potty and the seat cracked and I thought it best to get another, to keep her from getting pinched in the crack, but when I went back to the store to get another, they didn't have this version any more. The one they did have, that I got, is not as simple, now that I know I can get this potty here I will probably buy another.The only flaw, that is not the fault of the potty, is that we have the elongated toilet bowls and most potty seats that can be set on the toilet only work with the round toilets. We currently have four potties for our daughter, two here, and one each at my mothers and his. All four are different.Fisher-Price Royal Pottyis at my mothers house and I like it a lot, it too has the cup under the seat.	
- 1	When I opened the packaging I was appalled by the strong chemical smell of this mattress pad. I had to open the windows to get rid of the smell in the room even after I wrapped the pad back in plastic. I can't imaging my baby being in the same room with this product, let alone sleep on it! I also realized that there is no need to have a water proof mattress pad because most crib mattresses these days already come in a water proof cover. The non-waterproof cover I got was a much better choice for my baby.	
- 1	We have been using this bed rail for a little over a month. It is a pain to use. Forget about trying to get it up when your child is already asleeep as it takes at least 10 minutes each night and you definitely can't do it in the dark. We thought it would get easier with use. Instead after a little over a month, the thing is broken. One side won't fold down. The other side, we were able to fold it down but can't get it up again. We spent 20 mintes trying to get this rail up last night and it would not work. I will be reporting this to their customer service to try to get a replacement or my money back.  I will update on that process. But needless to say, I would definitely not recommend this product.	
1. 	I wish I had gotten this from the very beginning of my daughter's birth.  She is currently 8 months.  We just got it recently because we have been doing some sleep training with her where we were letting her cry for a while.  The video monitor makes the training so much easier to handle as a mother.  I also enjoy just watching my baby sleep which was something that I was able to do when she was a newborn when nothing could wake her up, but now I am too scared to wake her up with any slight noise I make if I went in her room.  It is also nice for babysitters so they feel more assured by noises they may hear from the baby's room.  The grandparents feel like they got to see her even though she is only sleeping.I definitely recommend this if you can afford the splurge.  This particular model the screen is nice and big but I've also tried the 1.8 one and it was fine too.  Actually the 1.8 one had slightly better video quality.  The color does not work on either one unless the room is very brightly lit (the manual notes this too), so unless you have a baby who doesn't mind sleeping in a bright room, you won't ever see color.One function I find lacking is a screen brightness option.  It is really bright and hard on the eyes when you flip it on in the middle of the night to see what is going on with the baby.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints.	
1. 	I don't know why everyone has these reviews saying they leak, etc.  I have used them for over a month now.  Dishwasher every time (on the top rack only - with standard wash settings, they will melt if used during antibacterial or heated settings).  They are extremely easy to hold and fill and they seem to be perfect.  I guess everyone has there own opinions on baby products...	
- 1	Nothing irks me more than this supposed baby monitor.  Because isn't the point of a baby monitor to monitor babies?  Not to work sometimes, if the moon and stars are aligned perfectly, and work only when it feels like working.  Not to beep endlessly and flip channels until I want to pull my hair out and throw the thing against the wall, not necessarily in that order.Now when this monitor works, it works well - it picks up every little sound clearly and I can hear my babies the instant they wake up. I rarely hear static.  Despite other reviews, it has a long battery life (7-8 hours).  I have twins, and set up this monitor in two different rooms so that I can hear the babies whether they are napping together or separately.  I rarely remove the receivers from their battery chargers; they just sit in my office where I'm working, which is incidentally 15 feet from either baby.  Since nothing moves, you'd think I'd only have to set it up once and be done, yes?Not even close.  What usually happens is one of two things:One, it will lose a frequency and search for a signal.  It does this whether I'm on the other end of the house or in the next room.  It loses a signal at least twice per day.  Then it starts endlessly beeping, during which I begin to imagine drop-kicking this monitor across several blocks and into the freeway, where it gets run over again and again by a convoy of tractor trailers.Two, it will flip channels so that it's suddenly monitoring the same room as the other device, and now one baby is out of communication.  It doesn't matter that the switch is set to room 2, because it's now monitoring room 1.  I have no warning this has happened, no beeps or even a flashing light, so unless I'm within earshot and hear her crying, that baby is out of luck should she need attention.  This happens at least once every other day, so I simply don't go out of earshot anymore.  To which I wonder, why have a baby monitor at all?  It's only out of morbid curiosity I keep it plugged in.I will try to reset the frequency (which you do by clicking buttons which also beep maddeningly) but usually this doesn't work, and it continues to beep.  I am actually surprised this monitor hasn't yet been embedded in my wall.Maybe today will be the day.	
- 1	This did not work for me at all.  I wanted something to carry my son around the house in when he was just a few months old (under 12 pounds).  He was not comfortable in it, and it did not feel good when I was wearing it.  I would not buy this again.	
- 1	Don't buy these if you need the bottles pictured--that's not what you get. I received newer bottles that aren't compatible with my pump, and when I contacted the seller was told the &#34;old&#34; bottles aren't available anymore. Really? Yet somehow they were included with the pump I bought 2 months ago! ARGH!	
- 1	We tested a bunch of different brands of cloth wipes, and these got the thumbs down for the following reason: the wipe is composed of two layers sewn together at the edges. When in use, the layers separate and smeared the poop. On the positive side, the edges are sewn together well and have not frayed or curled after lots and lots of washes. The winning wipe for us was Grovia cloth wipes.	
1. 	I bought one of these for my Graco Pack 'n Play and one for the mattress of a cradle that's been in my mother-in-law's family for generations.  The pad fit each mattress equally well, is nice and thick without being too soft, and stays put (so far!).  I don't have a wriggly baby yet, but I believe the pad will hold its position well.  I'm very pleased with the roominess of the pockets and the tension of the elastic.  A good solid product for the money.	
- 1	First i thought i was getting 16 cases. But from reading the reviews i came to understand i was getting 12 hard cases. I then found the one honest review from a few days ago, too little too late. I have just received my case- 1 hard sided case, i was expecting 12 or even 16. On top of that it took a long time to arrive. very disappointed.	
1. 	Wish it had directions for adults though like up arrows.  Countless guests I have to explain it to, so I just now leave off when I have guests over.  Other than that it is super nice.	
- 1	I purchased these sheets to go on the Graco Pack & Play On the Go Travel Playard. After washing and drying the sheet on normal wash settings, the sheet barely fits on the provided mattress and the mattress begins to fold up under the tension of the sheet. I realize these sheets are advertised as fitting a &#34;mini-crib,&#34; however they are cross-referenced with the Graco Pack and Play (along with the American Baby portable/mini-crib mattress pad which also DOES NOT fit) and many people have suggested they fit the Graco Pack and Play. Maybe it's the specific Graco model that I have or maybe they have changed size recently, but they do not fit mine. Back to the drawing board for me.	
1. 	Not all kits include scissor, digital thermometer, tweezer etc. This is one does. The compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling. Great value!	
1. 	These bottles are wonderful and really work to reduce gas. However, at the risk of sounding like a lazy (or exhausted) mom, there are a lot of parts that have to be taken apart and then put back together just right for cleaning and sterilizing. If colic is an issue, it is definitely worth it, but my daughter does just fine with drop-ins bottles.	
1. 	Nice cheap alternative for stars...(you can not see stars in city...:()I also enjoyed this with my baby...Some of the lights are not as bright as others...but still works.Also have moon in there :)Don't really give baby to play with it...Looking directly into hole is little painful as light is bright inside :D So we keep it away from baby.	
1. 	I liked the body rest but not the head reast...Read washing instructions...The body rest is very soft and comfortable...Nice color.	
- 1	According to 7th gen these are supposed to be the original wipes and not the new ones with all the chemicals but Amazon is sending the new wipes for this so it's the wrong wipes! When I ordered this I got the new thick rough ones with sodium benzoate and other junk!  Amazon has the the new wipes as anther item you can get but this specific item is supposed to be the old ones seventh generation brought back so don't order these until amazon fixes the problem!	
1. 	We have two of these things (one in F150 and one in Mitsubishi Galant). We never take them out and just swap the baby car seat into the base of whichever car we're driving (with baby). My only concern is it does &#34;press&#34; quite hard into the seats with the plastic corners and ultimately could lead to depressions in the seat long term. However, it is quite well designed and once you figure out how to adjust it (no red should show!!!) then you set it and forget it. The carseat pops down really easily and you can audibly hear the &#34;click&#34; of the lock/latch. It's quite forgiving and easy for my (5' 7&#34; tall) to get even into the tall truck. I usually just swing the car seat close and wiggle until it's in place. Would purchase again in a heartbeat...I'd recommend one for every vehicle, although we have swapped them into other vehicles (Toyota Venza) on the fly (less than 2 minutes) when I got a flat tire and grandparents picked us up on interstate...thank God these change out quickly as not a safe location for swapping. I do feel they're very secure, but at first it's supprising how the front end appears it could &#34;bounce&#34; up and down quickly with know restraint in the front.	
- 1	I got this because I love Boppy products and quite frankly it was cute. I have six children so I have been around the block with items like this.  What I like....It's cute.What I don't like, it is so slick that when I prop my baby up on the pillow for tummy time she slides off. They may have done that so it was more wipeable. Not sure but it didn't work for us, we sent it back.If you just want a blanket to lay your baby on it will work but I can do that with one of the 50 blankets we already have:)	
- 1	Purchased due to the many great reviews.  However, this is a not a product I would purchase again.  These liners retain urine moisture instead of wicking it away from baby.  I rather have the liners from Nicki's diapers instead.	
- 1	This is a beautiful piece of equipment. Of all the items I received at my baby shower, this was the one I was most excited about. It's very well designed and I love all the features - especially how cuddly the seat is and the fact that we could also hook in our car seat. The only problem for us was that our son really didn't like it at all. He would occasionally sit in it for 5 minutes or so, but most of the time he would start wailing the minute I got him anywhere near it. At his daycare, they have a Fisher Price Papasan swing and he LOVES it. We ended up buying one of those and sadly, the Sweet Peace is sitting in our basement in hopes that any future babies may enjoy it. The Sweet Peace is really nice, but if you can, try it out before you invest $$ since it doesn't work for every baby.	
- 1	We bought two of these seats to fly with since they are much lighter than our regular Roundabout seats. I would describe them as tolerable but not much better. I found it virtually impossible to get a tight fit in the car. Kneeling on the seat and pulling the strap as hard as I could managed only a loose fit, which my husband could only improve a little bit. Getting the shoulder straps even is also sometimes a challenge; sometimes you get one shoulder strap that's much tighter than the other side. Adjusting this  makes the process of buckling in two kids longer than it needs to be. We'll probably use the seats again when we fly (since I won't care much if the airline damages them!), but we'll definitely stick with the Roundabouts for everyday use.	
1. 	My baby was used to sleep with a blanket since a very young age (I know, it's a no-no, but grandma insisted!).She basically didn't move while asleep until she reached the 15 months, then the blanket was serving no purpose and somebody recommended a sleep-sack. I had a Halo product before so I went with the brand and I've no regrets.She is 18 months now, 23lb and 28-29&#34; and this runs very big on her (2T-3T), which I don't mind, it's a blanket, she doesn't walk with it, we take her out of it as soon as she wakes up.This also has helped her to link the SleepSack with sleeping time. She wears it for naps too. We love it. It's also very warm! Definitely for very cold climates (we live in Boston).	
- 1	I ordered and currently use the original version of the Adiri Nurser bottle, as that was the only bottle at the time my exclusively breastfed baby would take. Thank goodness he has grown past that phase and now will take the Born Free bottles I had purchased and received as baby shower gifts. This NexGen bottle is too much trouble. All the different pieces and steps to fill and heat it are so cumbersome and time consuming. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for all of that. They really need to rethink the design on this thing. It's also hard to read the amounts. I thought I would love it, as I like the look and feel of it but boy am I glad I didn't have to actually use it too long.	
1. 	My daughter really liked to use this product. She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more. I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it.	
- 1	This cup leaks like crazy and it's got a lot of parts to piece together. really wanted to like it but I don't and know it's been put away...	
- 1	I wanted containers to carry my pre-made food along. However, the lids will not stay on. I definitely do not recommend this product!	
- 1	The quality of this item is great. It's soft, warm and fits perfectly. BUT, the stupid flap that's in the front of the foot muff that's supposed to cover the stroller bar keeps covering my baby's face when it's windy. The wind blows the flap right over my baby's face, while she's facing away from me. I looked over at her and there she was, head in the blanket, flailing, trying to knock it down. So, back it goes. It would be great if Uppababy can make velcro attachments to the foot muff so you can secure this flap on youger babies who don't need it. It really doesn't do anything for smaller babies. I understand that it might wrap around the bar, but what if you're not using the bar? It's not safe on windy days.	
- 1	This swaddle is wonderful-- when you purchase it in a size small/medium. However, after ordering the size large after my baby grew I received this swaddle in what was marked as size large. It is definitely not a large. The large is actually identical in size to the small/medium. I eventually spoke with the manufacturer about this and I was told that they are having production problems and currently are unable to produce a true size large of this swaddle. So don't order the size large. This swaddle is wonderful though for a smaller baby (less than 15 pounds)	
- 1	This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this.  In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months.  It's a waste of money all around!	
1. 	Shows what happens when human beings put their minds to solving one of the riddles of nature: how to imitate a time-tested proven method of transfering nutrition from mother to child. Great Product!	
1. 	This is a very cute and soft chew toy for babies.  My son loves it, I love the fact that it is not plastic! It also makes for some cute photo ops!	
- 1	The concept is okay, but it doesn't begin to wrap around the front rail on my crib.  I'm not really sure how the Velcro is supposed to secure to itself through the rails either.  I'm returning it and making my own cover from a used pair of pants and tiring it on with shoe laces.	
1. 	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.	
1. 	...and yet my lavender scented candles are all I smell. This is a simple, fast and effective way to dispose of the smelly's in your little one's pants. As long as you dispose of the sausage regularly, there shouldn't be a problem. (Especially afer you take them off the breast and start solids)	
- 1	The product is a solid product but it is tight on my 1 year old so she cannot chew on it while wearing it and she doesnt like to chew on it because it is harder than the ones her other baby friends has	
- 1	I'm VERY disappointed with Britax over their car seat travel bag. It does NOT come with instructions on how to utlize it. My B-Safe seat's manual also does NOT explain how to use this optional bag.I discovered thru trial and error (NO thanks to Britax), that you need to place the seat upside down in the bag. Also, the seat base level (angle) should be tilted all the way forward. If you incorrectly place the seat and base into the bag right side up, you'll have the seat base's sharp edge painfully DIGGING into your back, and you'll be applying excessive stress to the bag and zippers. Why no instructions? How much would a piece of paper cost?The bag SHOULD have an internal reinforcement under the grab handle stretching the full width of the top of the bag. But it doesn't. Thus pulling the bag on its wheels or picking up the bag is an awkward and clumsy affair.The wheels do NOT feature pull over cover, for use during backpack mode. Thus, the back of your pants become horribly dirty from the wheels when you carry it as a backpack.The shoulder straps have MINIMAL padding. Very uncomfortable.The enclosure for the owner's ID card (located at the top of the bag) has no provision for retaining the white paper card. If the bag is placed on its side, the card falls out (a rather purpose defeating design flaw)I'm shocked that in year 2012, Britax did NOT design the zipper heads to accomodate a travel lock. Any time you would check this bag in rather than carry-on, attaching a (TSA-approved) travel lock is a must nowadays. In fact, when traveling abroad, many airlines require you to sign a disclaimer if your checked bags don't have locks.What could have been a great car seat travel bag is full of short sighted design flaws. I'm extremely unhappy with Britax's execution.Update: One week after receiving the bag, I put it to the test carrying my new B-Agile stroller. I traveled on United, on 4 aircraft. Now, there are 2 puncture holes in the main body of the bag. And, the reinforced material at the bottom has 2 areas rubbed on the verge of puncturing. In this day and age, there are nylon luggage materials that are highly resistant to abrasion and punctures. However, Britax did NOT use such materials in the construction of this bag. For the premium price, they certainly should have. I'm extremely disappointed.	
- 1	This was too big for our two month old and he was very uncomfortable. His neck is still unstable so I had to hold his neck the entire time while taking a bath rather than it whacking on the hard plastic. Also the protruding centerpiece is a good place to crush a baby's balls so watch out especially if he's too small to fit in the tub properly! I think this tub would be good for older infants or toddlers but not for our two month old. Hopefully in the future we can use it again.	
1. 	This diaper pail is easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't require any expensive refills-just regular 13 gallon trashbags. It doesn't keep odor in very well, but other diaper pails don't really seem to, either. I mean, it's poop. It smells! We have two of these-one for cloth diapers/laundry, and one for trash. They're a good size, and hold up well after continuous use.	
1. 	I coupled this with the summer infant changing pad and baby is much more comfy. He used to be crankier with the other stiffer folding change pad and I decided to get the contoured pad with this plush cover. Baby likes it. I like it, it is very very soft and it seems soothing to him when he is on it bare skinned too. I bought this in blue and it is a darker blue than pictured but I don't mind that. So far it has not fell apart in the laundry as well which is good. The material is thick enough and feels sturdy enough. The elastics holds the cover well onto the changing pad and fits as the picture shows on a 2 sided changing pad.  BTW this one is cheaper than many of the others I've seen but feels and performs just as well if not better.	
1. 	This is the best sleepsack out there. It's reasonably priced and it works great for us. So far we own 6 Halo sleepsacks in different sizes, and if I were to buy more, they'd definitely be the same brand.	
- 1	gets very weird after a little bit of use. but the design and the thought behind is great. machine wash does nothing	
- 1	The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.	
1. 	My kid hates brushing his teeth but at least this product has a good taste to it that helped the whole nightly process go smoother.	
1. 	This booster is pretty handy to have! My 7-month-old uses it instead of a highchair. The only problem is that the moment I place her in it, she removes the white tray. Not sure why the manufacturer didn't place the fastener elsewhere. I just don't use the white tray or green cover. The blue tray fits securely on and easily washes in the dishwasher, so it's really no big deal. I've seen people bring it to playgroups, restaurants, etc. It fits perfectly on our chairs and I can push her right up to the table and counter without the tray.	
1. 	I tried everything for my sons dry skin including aquophor, california baby, and cetaphil (which his pediatrition said was the best thing).  My son would freak out when I tried to put lotion on his face (most lotions contain alcohol).  I researched products and learned that many lotions (due to high water content and alcohol content) can dry skin more.  I decided to try Mustela because I will try anything or buy anything that will be good for my sons skin regradless of cost.  After just one use I could see a difference.  I have used it now for about 3 days and his skin is 90% improved.  This cream has totally changed the texture of the skin, it's now completely soft and smooth.  The only thing that remains is a little reddness from where it was extremely dry.  Eczema runs in the family.  I was so impressed after I tried it on him I actually used it myself and have to say that it is amazing!!!  A little goes a long way.  Using it only on his face 3 times a day I could see this one tube lasting over 6 months.  Also look into using a Charmeuse pillocase for your toddler since cotton will absorb the moisture from their skin while they sleep.	
1. 	I love this product.  Struggled with swaddling using blankets despite the nurses' best efforts to teach me.  First son tended to punch through the blanket, ruining my swaddle attempts.  Converted to this product when he was about 8 weeks old and fell in love with it.  Just had baby number two and this time I brought the swaddler to the hospital: so much easier!  This is now part of our standard gift pack for baby showers for friends.  Indispensable!I'd also like to recommend the Snuza Halo SIDS monitor: something we've used for both babies and so important for safety and peace of mind, check it out.	
1. 	There is not a large selection first of all for this kind of product on Amazon. However, after seeing and trying out other brands I know that this one is the more favorable one.PROS: Easy to install, i.e. did it with my daughter watching me and trying to &#34;help&#34; within three minutes while not reading the directions. Parts do not hang into the toilet..gross. Easy to unlatch even with one hand, does not interfere with the actual use of the toilet. =), My toots can not figure how to open the lid, thus she now leaves it alone!CONS: Does leave a small amount of space, that if your child was very determined, might be able to slid you smart phone or small set of keys in. But this has to be a very determined child. Still kinda gross having this stuck to the toilet bowl, but a better choice compared with the other brand that stick more into the toilet and are hard to use.	
1. 	Great product, easy to use. It was not good for my son though. He needed it to help him digest after his night feedings, but he wiggled too much and would roll off of it. The product was great, my son was just not a good baby for the product.	
- 1	This review is from: Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision (Baby Product)Customer review from the Amazon Vine Program (What's this?)I have used the Foscam baby monitor and I think it's a lot better (and it happens to be much cheaper): Foscam FI8910W Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision (Black).I like my Foscam much more because:1) Better security - that's essential2) I can pan and tilt it, another essential when using video baby monitors. This Philips Avent unit must be laser-like targeted to consistently keep baby viewable.3) Works with my iPhone - unlike this Philips Avent unit.4) Doubles as a security cam - again unlike the Philips Avent unit, because to be also a security cam it must work on an iPhone and also on Andriod, Blackberry and PC.This Philips Avent just doesn't compare well because it's so darn limited.	
1. 	This was my lifesaver when I was pregnant....and still is!!  I tried giving it up after I had my baby, but had a c-section, so still had a lot of back problems.  I was just about to start trying to give it up again...when I got a hernia and had to have that repaired.  At first my husband hated it, but now he leans up against it as well.  We have a california king bed, so plenty of room for it.	
1. 	My wife and I chose this Playtex feeding system for our first child.  We had some standard bottles, also.  We found that the Playtex system avoided the baby ingesting a lot of air when sucking.  Therefore the baby got more nutrition and we had to do less burping.  I highly recommend this system as a baby shower gift.Be careful putting these plastic bottles in a bottle warmer and dishwasher with a drying coil.Gunner  March,2012	
- 1	I'm on my second unit now(after three months) and this one is starting to die. Im simply going to list its short comings and you make up your mind.-The unit turns off more than twice every night, so you wake up to your child screaming from across the house, not weeping in the monitor so we can help before my 10 month old cant figure out why were not there for him.-The battery life changes from day to day but I'd say on average this battery lasts four hours or so.-The microphone occasionally turns on my daughter tells me and she can hear our conversations.-The range changes from day to day but somedays you can go across the house or somedays you can barely be across the room.--Every fourth or fifth time you turn on the monitor it either displays a dozen random colors, won't turn on at all or displays a garbled mess of the two cameras accompanied by a large popping noise! Yippee!So ask me if Id buy this thing again, I'd say absolutely not. I'd expect problems like this from a five year old monitor that's been on since it was taken out of the box, not a month old second unit that is used 8 hours a day.-Cheap Chinese Crap-  CCC	
1. 	I bought this product when it became apparent that our very colicky newborn needed to be in bed with us in order to be able to sleep.  I think she felt very secure in it and began sleeping through the night right when we started using it.  We also used it in her bassinette and then eventually in her crib to transition her into her own room.  She stayed in it for over 5 months and was a little long for it by the end, but was still very comfortable.  Definitely keeping this product around to use with our next baby!	
1. 	After getting the fisher price whale tub I realized the sling comes in very handy for infants who can't yet hold their head up! I returned the whale tub and got this one. It's perfect. First of all my daughter didn't like just being put into the whale tub. I guess she feels secure in the sling and never cried. It saves our ears the screams of our little one and now she actually looks forward towards bath time. All smiles from our little girl with this tub. Buy It. Save your Ears! Save her Tears!	
1. 	This is a MUST have for all parents.  It folds down very small to fit in any diaper bag.  Our child is almost 3 years old and is 31 pounds and it easily supports him.  You have to put the front lips of the potty seat in front of the toilet seat it is going onto.  This potty seat has worked on every toilet seat we have put it on... both elongated and round.  No problems.  The hinges open in a way that your child's skin cannot get pinched so do not be worried about reviews that said their kids skin was pinched.  There is no way for this to happen unless they are using the seat upside down which is impossible to do.  The only thing I wish this had was a cup in the front to block liquid from spraying out the front.  So if you have a little boy you will have to aim him down.  Our child is very secure on this seat and we love it.  A must have at a great price.	
- 1	We loved this at first, but after being in my car is some below freezing temps it stopped working.... both the music and the light.	
1. 	We opted to not buy a high chair with our child and use this instead. It's been great. We don't actually use the white feeding tray and just use the tray instead. We started using it when our son was about 4 months old and has been able to grow with him. Now that our son is getting older, we can leave leave the tray off and slide him up to the table for meal time. Such a nice way to transition.	
1. 	We have been using these since our baby was no longer interested in being swaddled. We started using the Medium size before she was quite big enough for it (at 3 months), and even though it was longer than we needed, it still fit well around her arms and neck. It wasn't too loose to be comfortable and safe. Now that she is on the verge of outgrowing the Medium, I've gone straight to an XL because again, even though it's longer than we need, the larger size doesn't pose any safety risks and is quite comfortable. She is a very wiggle baby and is able to get around her crib and even stand up in these without hurting herself or getting twisted up. We get both the fleece and cotton one so we can interchange them based on the weather. During the winter months, we used a blanket with the fleece sack and the fleece actually gripped the blanket so she stayed covered even when she moved around. In terms of durability, we wash them in the machine on hot and they've held up well for 6+ months. The ones she has outgrown are still in good enough shape to use for another child, hand down, etc. I really love this product.	
1. 	I am a professional nanny and have been so for several years. I have worked for many familes and most of them have had newborns. I have taken care of only children, twins and triplets and also worked as a department manager at a Babies R Us store in the past. Given all of my work experience, I have had many opportunities to use most of the baby equipment on the market today. Of all of the items available, I LOVE the Fisher Price Cradle Swings the best. They has saved me so many times when one baby needs me and another begins to cry. One of the best things I have found is that the side to side motion is great for babies with reflux. A child with reflux should never be left to swing back and forth because that motion will almost always bring up his/her last meal. The side to side motion is much more gentle for babies with these problems. Also, one child I cared for has a cleft palate and anytime she brought up even a little formula it would fill up her nostrils, causing a huge issue with her breathing. In order for her airways to stay open, we had to do anything possible to prevent her from spitting up. Going back and forth in a swing was never an option so I am so greatful that her parents agreed to buy a cradle swing when I recommended it. She used it constantly for her first 14 months. Some people feel that the swing moves too fast for small babies and i agree. However, this problem is always remedied by laying a light blanket over the babies feet and allowing one side to hang over the edge by about a foot, creating a lag in the swing. This really helps to slow the swing down until the baby has enough body weight to keep it slow. One thing I caution all parents on is to never leave your baby unattended in it if he/she shows any signs of rolling over. I have never seen a baby fall out of a cradle swing but with the papasan swing, it is possible for them to hang over the edge a bit and get stuck in that position once they are strong enough to partially roll over.	
- 1	This adapter had noticeably less power than my Medela version. Pumping is already hard enough with a decrease in suction.	
1. 	My husband used it with our 7 month old on a hike. They were both extremely comfortable. In fact, she took her afternoon nap in there.	
- 1	I order the wrap and tie and few day ago and I'm returning it. It has been a pain for us to find a good carrier because my husband has the body builder type with very very broad chest. So far, we tried the Baby Bjorn original and active but none of them really fit him, let alone having a baby in it. I was so desperate that I bought this wrap and tie. So far I do not like it at all. The fabric is not very breathable and seems to pick up every kind of dust along the way. We live in Texas and it's not summer here yet but I don't think the fabric is going to be good for the summer here. It fits my husband well enough but he has a little trouble putting it on on his own. The shoulder straps are not the best ever. The fabric makes it feels thick but then the padding is just not soft enough. I have back pain wearing this.I can't imagine carrying a 25 - 35 pounds toddler with this. Also, I do not like the position our little one has to sit while using this. The facing inward position makes him have to spread is leg very wide. I'd prefer a little more head support especially for infant but can fold down when my baby face outward. The design of this is also not very wearer-friendly. My husband refuses to wear it because it looks too girly. In a girly perspective, it's not cute enough. So far, I much prefer the Baby Bjorn original over this, even though Infantino wrap and tie is cheaper, only $30.97. I would pay a little more for a little more comfort.Pro: CheapCons: Fabric is stiff and not very breathable and seems to pick up a lot of dust.Hard to put on especially for someone who is busty or bodybuilder with broad chest and big armShoulder straps seems causing strain on wearer's shoulderBaby has to spread leg very wide. The facing outward position hold a lot of fabric between the baby legs ( there is already a diaper there that can cause discomfort...)	
- 1	This rattle is very cheap looking, like something that would be at the dollar store. I do not reccommend it.	
- 1	I bought these first in the 4105 model and thought I would try this model.  They are sized all wrong, way too big.  When I contacted La Leche League they ignored my concerns.  I would not buy these at all--get the other model # 4105, they worked great.	
1. 	Easy way to tighlty swaddle baby.  My newborn is so distracted by her own hands - she can't sleep more than twenty minutes without this.  The fleece is very soft - but also kind of warm.  It's nice for us because we just run the A/C at night and keep her bundled.  The noise helps her sleep - and the wrap keeps her nice and warm.** update - now that my daughter is 4 months old and still requires swaddling we upgraded to a bigger size.  She busts out of this swaddle constantly now (because of her age, not the new size) - however, she is 4 months old and that's a little old for swaddling :)  So if you child is determined to suck on their hands... this won't stop them!  Haha.	
- 1	These were not the spouts that I thought they were. Although, the picture looked the same. One side of the spout is larger, so it didn't fit my nuby 10oz cups!	
- 1	I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.	
1. 	Sleigh Toddler Bed - OakMy husband and I recently purchased this bed in oak for our 26 month old daughter.  It was time for her to have a Big Girl Bed that wasn't quite full-sized, but still gave her the ability to get in and out on her own.We're thrilled with the quality of the bed.  My husband was able to put it together in a reasonably short period of time (about an hour from unpacking to clean-up)--and came with all the tools necessary to put it together.  Aligning all the slats can be a bit of a pain because you have to put all 10 together on one side, and then attempt to put the other side on without them falling out or slipping out of place; other than that it went together fine and all the pieces fit together without any problem.It fits a standard sized crib mattress (not included), and the bottom slats provide enough stability for the mattress so that even my eight year old has been able to throw her weight on it (although I did tell her not to do it again).  So regular wear and tear from your toddler getting in and out shouldn't be an issue.I like that it is light enough so I can easily move it around, but it is sturdy and heavy enough that it doesn't budge when she gets in and out.  There is also enough room between the mattress and floor that you can easily swoop your arm around to remove lost toys that inevitably make their home under there.I was worried about the sharp corner on the guard-rail, with good reason.  My daughter has bumped her head on it a few times (I have no clue how), so we drape a large sherpa blanket over it and the mattress to add some padding--plus it gives a little extra protection for the sheet should she wet through her diaper.  That seemed to do the trick.  Other than that, there don't seem to be any other downsides to the bed.And the best part is our daughter fell in love with it, and enjoys going to bed in it (well, she isn't exactly running to go to bed; but she wasn't afraid of it at all, and actually enjoys taking ownership of it).  I definately recommend this as a transitional bed for your toddler who isn't ready for a full-height bed.  The quality is great and the price is reasonable.	
- 1	came very dirty. was not happy and when i called to exchange i had to completely reorder and get a credit.,kinda annoying.	
- 1	We were not able to install this safely due to a cross-threaded screw.  The company was willing to send a new one, but I decided to return the whole gate.  It was slightly too small without the extension that is included, and the extension made it too wide for our staircase, so we would have had to purchase a different extension direct from Regalo anyway.  By that point, I would have spent more than just going to Babies R Us and getting the more expensive gate.	
- 1	The cover is cute and seems to be well-made. However, my son hates being covered by it when he breastfeeds. He screams and fusses. I've come to the realization that it's just easier to breastfeed without it. Perhaps if it was a thinner more breatheable material it would work better for my son?	
1. 	Super soft! I like it and my kids too! And it is really not expensive. Easy to wash and to use.	
- 1	These do not cover any smells related to diaper pails or trash cans.  I bought them for my diaper pail but it did nothing for the order.  They also do not stay attached to their bracket when stuck to the underside of a trash can/diaper pail lid.  They constantly fall out and then I can't find them in the diapers, nor do I want to dig through dirty diapers to find it.  This purchase was a waste of my money.	
- 1	Interesting, to me, that these got such great reviews! I bought them based on the reviews.This morning, I threw them all away.Pros: They are pouches. You can make your own stuff and put it in them. GREAT for my 3.5 year old daughter who won't eat veggies. I give her the organic store-bought fruit & veggie pouches all the time, but they're expensive. So I bought these, and another kind (that I liked much better).Cons: I bought these less than 3 weeks ago. She's used them 2 or 3 times... at the most. 3 of them have started leaking at the zip-lock area. I spent so long trying to get them to close without leaking that I gave up and just threw all of them away.I never really liked them. Kind of hard to open the zip-lock area... there's not a lot of space to grip! And completely impossible when wet (I had to use little pieces of paper towel in each side to get a good grip. I never really felt like they got clean. A lot of gunk collected at the bottom. They took kind of a long time to clean. I didn't like how stiff they are, either. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't also gotten another brand that is super soft & malleable) (the one with the panda on one and something purple on the other - I liked these much better - although they were more expensive. But, I guess, not in the long run since they're still working great. Got them at the same time).  Some might like the stiffness... I don't know.I don't recommend them. I know I could probably return them, but quite honestly, I didn't want to deal with it. So I chucked them. I'm off to buy more of the other brand (Squooshi 4 Count Reusable Food Pouch, for those of you who are interested. I don't work for the company. They have their issues with not being great to clean and gunk getting in the zip-lock area, too... but at least they work! So far, anyway)	
1. 	Our little one loved being swaddled, however outgrew or was able to get his hands out of other blankets. Not this one! After first we thought it was too big, but tucking his arms in and wrapping him up, he loved it. Washes up great and just gets softer. If you are looking for help with getting your baby to sleep, this is worth a try.	
- 1	Got this at my baby shower as a present. I thought it was awesome because it's black and my husband would not avoid carrying it. But as other reviewers said it's pretty small (on an adult male back) - I would have gotten a red-purse diaper bag if I got it only for myself! Our baby arrived in November and by now, late February, all the inside seams are falling apart and a strap is broken both the buckle and the seam). I cannot believe how poor the craftsmanship is! Don't waste your money on this. If you want a backpack, buy a diaper pad and put it in a regular backpack that works for you, and it will be cheaper too.	
1. 	Nice bumpers. Very soft and easy to place. The only down fall is that they may be too soft. My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up!	
1. 	I bought this for my grandson, 6 mos so just sitting on his own. Was looking for something that would not take up a lot of space, and that would work at the kitchen bar.This booster seat has 3 heights, and when placed on a barstool (secure with back) can be adjusted to just the right height - enables him to hang out in the kitchen when we are cooking but not be underfoot. And enables him to eat at the counter with the rest of us.Just what I was looking for!	
- 1	This walker is cute but of poor quality.  We purchased it from Babies R Us and were disappointed when we discovered that the frame was damaged.  The plastic where you attach the back wheels had broken off, and you could see the orange shards of plastic at the bottom of the box.  I called up Kolcraft customer service and they agreed to send a replacement frame free of charge.  Great, problem solved, right?  WRONG!  First of all, they only sent the bottom orange piece, not the full frame.  So, I tried removing the orange part from the green part, and realized it's not made to come apart.  I ended up injuring my hand and had to wait for my husband to get home and deal with it.  He also injured himself, but succeeded in separating the two pieces.  Yay, everything's fixed, right?  WRONG again, chief.  The frame Kolcraft sent us didn't have any holes where the frame should snap together.  Weird.  And incredibly frustrating.  So, I made another call to customer service, sent them photos of the issue, and they made another promise to send the correct part.  New frame arrives, and again, it's the frame with no holes.  I call customer service again, send photos of the problem again, and they ship out a new piece again.  Third time's a charm, I guess, because this time they got it right.  This process took about a month.  Now my baby has a walker, and I'll admit, she does seem to enjoy it.  Another annoying thing about this walker is the way it adjusts... you pull a strap in the back to tighten up the fabric of the seat.  Strange.  You would think it would make more sense to have something that adjusts on the frame itself.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing another Kolcraft product, like ever.	
- 1	I used this once when my baby was about a month old and the carrier was really tight under his armpits.  His arms were forced upward, looking like a bird trying to fly.  So I tried it again when he was 4 1/2 months.  Now the openings for his legs are not big enough (facing away from me...like the bigger babies are supposed to sit in it).  His legs looked like they were losing circulation, so I had to take him out.  This product was not thoughtfully made in my opinion.  Not to mention, the clasps that open and close so you can  put the child in are not easy to use.  I wish I'd bought something else.	
- 1	This is the 2nd monitor we have purchased from the Summer Brand. The 1st quit working for no apparent reason in about 9 months because it stopped holding a charge, Even After ordering and replacing the battery (and customer service wasn't any help). We have had our 2nd Summer baby monitor the one from the picture. But this time we have only had it almost 6 months And all of a sudden i one morning the screen just stopped working. The picture is a big jumbled mess of digital boxes and the trouble shooting tips in the manual are not helping. I really liked it while it was working and i was just about to order a 2nd camera for another child but now i have decided to just try a completely new brand. This brand is too expensive for such a poor quality of life. I would not recommend.	
1. 	We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!	
- 1	I bought this because of all the great reviews and I was being cheap.  This does not work at all.  Do not waste your money - get the electric kind!	
1. 	A bouncy seat is high up there on the list of must-have items with a new baby, and this one does the trick really well.The vibration mode is great for soothing fussy or teeting babies, and helped our son drift off on many a nap. The activity arch is good, although the kick-to-start mode isn't worth much. First, I don't think any baby young enough to safely fit in the chair would be able to piece together the cause-and-effect. Second, if the baby does fall asleep in it, a subtle shift may trigger the music and lights, waking him/her up. Just run the continuous mode when baby wants a show.In the interest of safety, the footprint of the chair is deceptively large, making a mild tripping hazard for others who walk by it. This necessary design also makes the bouncy seat difficult to pack, which is a shame. Given how light the seat is, it would be ideal for trips to the grandparents' house if the legs somehow folded up for travel.Both the seat and the arch take batteries, but neither run through them very fast, which is good. The seat cushion has been washed many times and held up well, albeit with some fading.	
1. 	I love the Ventaire line of baby bottles but these are by far my favorite. The wide bottle makes it easier for baby to hold on to while the feeder is also able to hold on to assist the baby. I don't think Ventaire can get any better than these!	
- 1	Do yourself a favor and stick with Gerber spoons or another brand. These are NOT dishwasher safe!!!! I have used them for only a couple months (have a ten month-old who didn't start solids until 5 months). After just a month or so of use, the spoon color started to fade and bleed and change to a brownish yellow stain on each one. They are awful. I won't use them anymore because I'm worried about what could be getting into my baby's food. I highly recommend you avoid this item.	
- 1	I had the unit before and we loved it. But this one started leaking from the bottom after a few days of use. I might just have gotten a defective product but some of the reviews indicated the same issue as I was having	
- 1	I LOVE thirsties covers so when I saw they had an AIO I really wanted to try it out despite some of the reviews.  I ordered 2 and much to my disappointment the reviewers were correct. I used these on my 1 year old daughter and they leaked...maybe they would work better on a smaller baby because they do not have bladders that are as big as a 1 year old.  I definitely will not be able to use these out in public as I will have to change my daughters entire outfit everytime she goes to the bathroom.  I only will be able to use these at home when she is toddling around in just a diaper and I can check her frequently.  I cant believe how wet the cover got--its like there is no water proof coating inside the cover of the diaper.  Really disappointed as I really wanted to love these diapers.Alot of people were complaining about the drying time as well--not a big issue for me--my dryer managed to dry them almost completely and the little bit of dampness that remained would dry overnight if I'd leave it lay out on top of the dryer.  .	
- 1	Cheap material, I returned it.It is not sturdyenough to use ever day.I was even afraid tobrake before returning the stuff.	
1. 	I am a breastfeeding mom and I had a hard time to get either one of my daughters to take a bottle. I tried EVERY bottle out there, and Dr. Brown's bottles seem to be the ONLY bottles my daughters would accept. This may be due to the fact that Dr. Brown's nipples do not collapse when the babies suck, the nipple is perfect shape and size, the flow is consistent and the unique design eliminates the air bubbles, so there's definitely less gas than we experienced while trying other bottles.I took away one of the stars because of the minor problems we had with this set: these bottles require more time and effort to clean, they leak occasionally [no, I didn't fill them above the line and no, I did not overtighten them - have no idea why they leaked], the larger bottles do not fit in most of the insulated bottle totes that come with diaper bags or sold exclusively for baby bottles [and that was a little bit of a problem for us, because we only use bottles when going places, but we solved it by using a larger/taller insulated lunch bag from Ikea store] and the 4-oz bottles that come in this set will be outgrown pretty quickly. My younger daughter is 7 weeks old and she eats 4 oz per feeding and looks like she could eat more if only the bottle would hold more...I would recommend getting a set of 3 9-oz Dr. Brown's bottles as it looks like a better value and will serve you longer (you can pour as little milk or formula in a 9 oz bottle as you need, while 4 oz bottles will only hold 4 oz max, and will be useless in a couple of months at the latest).	
1. 	Finally!  A product that is easily adjustable for every type of vehicle!  I've battled my old car mirror for a year and rarely get the perfect spot to be able to actually see my child!  If i forget to push the carrying arm back then I'm out of luck and I would have to move my mirror to be able to even see her mirror every time.  Very frustrating!This mirror is wonderful!  I bought two!  I can see both babies faces in my mirror without having to move my mirror.  It took just a few seconds to attach them and position them properly.  Great product!  Highly recommend!	
- 1	The car seat was difficult to install rear facing.  I took it to the hospital near my home that performs car seat checks and they stated that it is one of the most difficult seats to install rear facing.  I drive an SUV and the seat in front of the car seat needs to be pushed forward to a point that an adult cannot sit there.  I was dissatisfied at this point of using the seat but we were working around the issue.  Today my child threw up in the seat and I need to take the cover off to wash it.  There is apparently an older version of this car seat in which the base is removable, the current seat does not have this feature.  The cover is seriously impossible to remove.  I just spent 15 minutes on hold waiting for a customer care agent to explain what I'm doing wrong...I spent 15 minutes on the phone with her explaining that I'm not doing it wrong, I just need to try harder.  To remove the round plastic pieces holding the cover down where your child's bottom would be you need to stick your hand in between the base and the seat and press the bottom of the piece through the top by pressing a lip that holds it in place toward the outside of the seat (this is an extremely small space, even with the seat fully reclined).  Once there you need to use great force (enough force that they recommend a screw driver or butter knife) to press the lip toward the outside.  Unfortunately to reach this plastic lip I need to bend my fingers around another large plastic piece - I wear a women's small glove and they barely fit - good luck bending a screwdriver around in this manner.  I'm seriously going to have to get a babysitter so I can drive my car (without a car seat and child) to purchase a new seat or deal with vomit smell.  Only buy this car seat if you won't be installing it rear reclining and you plan to never never wash it.	
- 1	We bought this for a trip I was taking by myself with my large, 34 inch tall 16 month old.  I installed it correctly and put my son in it.  It was very easy to install, but the red strap that fits around the seat was directly behind his head, making him keep his head forward.  Also, as another reviewer stated, the chest strap was right under his chin, which I feared would decapitate him in an accident.  Because there is no middle strap between the child's legs like in a carseat, they do slide down and the chest strap is literally at their neck.  I even brought drawer liner with us and put it under my son's bum to keep him from sliding out, but it didn't help.Lastly, the airplane seatbelt (we flew on American) didn't get tight enough to really keep him in place.  He's a large child and at 26 pounds is way over the minimum weight of 20 lbs.  I cannot imagine using this with a smaller child.I ended up bringing his carseat on with us and using that on the flight back.  I will be selling my CARES and getting this instead for next time.Go Go Kidz TravelMate - Black/ Orange	
1. 	The first one I bought was not working properly.  It always complained I've added too much water.  I replaced it and the second one worked fine.Compared with microwave sterilizers or electric sterilizer from other brands, this sterilizer is rather pricey, but I'm glad I've picked this one.  I set the sterilizer to 24 hours mode so the bottles are ready to use all the time (you still need to replace water inside every day).  When I was holding my hungry and crying baby in one arm, I was really glad that the bottle is already sterilized and ready to use right away.	
1. 	I love this idea and  so does my son. He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. He gnawed that thing to death. We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.	
1. 	It's very sturdy.  My little guy is a climber and it's never tipped over.  He learned quickly how to back himself down onto it.  We're still working on the process, so I'm not sure if the urine guard will work well or not.	
- 1	**UPDATE 8/16/12:  Well, FINALLY we received our new monitor, and so far it functions fine.  What still is grinding my gears is the total lack of customer service.  I contacted the VP of Sales, who had contacted on Amazon other disgruntled customers and asked them to call him personally, but I haven't received any follow-up from him yet.  I call that ALL TALK, NO ACTION!  I did receive a call from another person at Motorola, however every time I call and leave a voicemail, I get a return call the following Friday at 2:45pm PST (5:45 Eastern time - where they are located), saying he'll be leaving the office in 15 minutes and will return Monday.  When I call Monday, it's the same song and dance until Friday.  What a joke.  I've shared this review with my FB friends and pretty much anyone who will listen so that they will not inadvertently put themselves into the nightmare we did.  NEVER AGAIN MOTOROLA.**UPDATE** 8/2/12: Oh holy hell...did I speak too soon...  In regards to my return to Motorola due to the defective unit, it is now two months later, and we have STILL NOT RECEIVED OUR REPLACEMENT!  On June 6, I sent our defective monitor back to Motorola, including the cover letter requested, paid for tracking (as requested), sent the follow-up email (as requested) and NOTHING.  After approximately 15 phone calls, 10 emails, and everything short of threats, I received word today that the unit will be shipped.  I demanded overnight shipping, which took another 30 minutes of holding on the phone for that to be authorized, and am still without a baby monitor OR any form of an apology.  During this two month-long debacle, I have dealth with a variety of Motorola representatives who were either rude, lied, or simply non-responsive.  This includes the supervisor, Charlene, who I have left several voicemails for asking for a return phone call to discuss the total lack of customer service we received, and I have yet to get a response from her.  Needless to say, we are BEYOND ANGRY and disappointed and will NEVER EVER EVER purchase another Motorola product.  Due to the ridiculous time this has taken to get a new baby monitor, we purchasedSummer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/Whitesine we have, a UM, BABY that we need to MONITOR, and have loved it.  Don't waste your money on the Motorola monitor; not that (if it works) isn't great, but because if you ever have an issue, you will be disgusted by their lack of service, and most likely find yourself pissed off buying another brand anyways.This monitor has all the bells and whistles (except VOX), and is exactly what my husband and I (anxious new parents) needed when we moved our daughter out of our room and into her crib.  The screen size is excellent, the picture quality superb, and I find the menu to be easy to navigate even in the dark at 4AM.  The only problem is the camera (aka the baby unit) just stopped working out of nowhere after only a couple of uses!  I tried to pair it, which the users manual suggests if your parent unit loses connectivity with the baby unit, but it failed to pair.  I called Motorola and, unlike other reviewers here, had fantastic customer service.  I don't have a receipt for the monitor as it was a gift, however they authorized the return and replacement anyways.  I will update my review once the return process has been completed.  So long as the new monitor works and continues to do so, I would recommend this monitor.	
1. 	We called it Moriz and it is one of the best friends of our little one. Moriz is soft and it is easy to play with him. We where a little suprised that he is actually that small, but we like him.	
1. 	Child refuses to keep a blanket on. They are great on my now 16 month old who has figured how to take her pants (and occasionally diaper) off, but has not figure out the upside down zipper!	
- 1	Everything by Fisher Price is craptastic.  This swing in no exception.Despite the cheap materials (plastic and polyester) we expected the motor to work.I tried the swing with an 8 pound weight and it worked weakly.  Ahen with a 16 pound weight and the swing barely budged.I phoned Fisher Price.  They told me if the product is in warranty, they can send a motor.  If not, I will have to pay $50 for one.I have combed through so many swing reviews on Amazon.  Crappy motors are very typical of Fisher Price.  Some people have gone through 3 or 4 motors in a year.How many of these throwaways end up in landfills every year?  Makes me think they make these lousy on purpose.  So you can never actually use a swing with more than one kid.This swing is crap and it is going back.Mamaroo here we come....	
- 1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.	
1. 	Baby starts solids leads to intense (stinky) diapers. Two uses:1) At home --- Even the best diaper pales will not hold the stench down.  Get these and leave it by your changing table for the extra layer of protection.  Well worth it.2) On the go --- don't leave nasty diapers at your friend's homes (especially if they don't have kids).  These do the trick (but still kindly throw them in the garage or directly outside).	
- 1	dang these things are HUGE!!!!  im mean, i have large breasts,  but this is big. to be honest, i didnt even use it because it was SO big. i just ended up putting a cup to catch the stuff instead (at home)	
- 1	The product seems like a good idea if it wasn't for the following two CONS:- Makes the baby's head and torso hot and sweaty- The velcro left rash on the back of my baby's neck from rubbingI returned mine.	
- 1	This gate has been nothing but hassle. I wasn't going to write a review but then my 11 month old daughter (19lb) pulled on the gate, the latch came open and the gate swung out, causing her to fall and hit her head.We have the gate installed on the bottom step of our 36in staircase, between the wall and the bannister rail. Turns out this gate DOES NOT FIT that size stairway. The gate itself is only about 32in wide and comes with a 4in extender piece. So, if your stairway is between 33 and 37 inches wide, this gate will not fit. Which is a standard size staircase! We had to jerry-rig it with two 4x6 planks to make the stairway narrow enough to fit the gate.My next biggest peeve about the gate is that it moves. We did not use the screws to fix it to the wall because we live in a rental, and I specifically chose this gate because you can install it with or without permanent fixtures. How wrong I was! If you don't plan to screw the fixtures into the wall, don't bother buying this gate. Every time I lean on it, bump into it, my cat rubs past it or the baby grabs it, it moves so that it is basically leaning forward.At the top of our stairs we have the Munchkin Auto-Close metal gate and we LOVE it! We installed it easily with no screws and it is very sturdy.TL;DR - This gate is NOT good value for money. It does not fit stairways 33-37in and is not secure. If you can, spend a little bit more on a Munchkin gate and get some peace of mind!	
1. 	I bought this seat as a last resort for my 2 1/2 month baby because he didn't seem to like any of the other ones.  Putting the seat together was easy and quick.  The directions were very easy to follow.  I put my son in the seat and he became very excited.  Now every time I take him out of it he starts to cry.  The voice that speaks and sings is very soothing.  The volume is not very loud but I think it is perfect for his little ears.  He loves the hanging animals and very quickly learned to knock them to make the mirror light up.I know not every kid is the same but my son seems to enjoy it.	
- 1	We have been using these for 8 months now and I've still bought Plum pouches when I don't have the time to clean and fill these pouches.  Its as if the company didn't product test or put it before a panel of their target market prior to putting them on the shelf. Main problems:- The creases of the pouch on the bottom get food stuck in them and its almost impossible to get the gunk out. It does say dishwasher safe, however, it is impossible to get clean with a dishwasher since the opening on the top is so small.- The zipper lock at the top will get food stuck in it and will mold as well. I've scrubbed like crazy and still can get it out.- The spout placement also creates a little pocket where food gets trapped and the pouch can fold on itself in such a way making it hard to suck from.- I could spend about 10 minutes rinsing and scrubbing just one pouch- filling them is difficult because they are hard to stand up on the counter and pour your contents in while keeping the small top open. The company says to spoon in, however, the opening is so small that a spoon full of food scraps off on the opening.  They also say to put your food in a pitcher and pour in but if anyone is familiar with baby food, it isn't liquid. Blended peas don't pour.  So picture trying to stand up this light weight pouch on its own on the counter while you have a pitcher of food that doesn't pour so you have to give the food a push with the spoon meanwhile holding the pouch up from falling over as the food falls in and keeping the top open big enough. 1 hand pitcher, 1 hand spoon, 1 hand pouch?Next time I think we will try the throw away pouches...UPDATE: A representative from little green pouch contacted me to help with my situation which I thought was great customer service, no one wants a negative review on Amazon, right?... So she sent me a scrub brush that they recommend to get into the creases, a pitcher and a pack of the newest pouches, which is really generous.  I would LOVE to say that it all worked out and now I love the pouches but I would be totally lying. The special scrub brush they sent broke first use. It's also L shaped and swiveled in the middle making it difficult to push that brush and scrub the creases. The pitcher had a long slender little spout which is great for liquid but not baby food, so that didn't work either.  The upside is that the material on the newer pouches with the tabs on the top are alot more durable than the ones I bought a year ago.Sorry it had to be this way little pouch but you need to go back to the drawing board and TEST your product or I'll come out with something better.  Your product could be great with a bit more love.	
- 1	I ordered this robe and just after placing the order I noticed the prop 65 warning!!!Terrible on a baby product! sent it back ASAP.WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.Scary. And it would be a cute thing too.	
1. 	I just received this booster seat the other day and I like it very much. My 2 year old great grandson was here the other day and it worked great for him as a highchair (strapped to one of our kitchen chairs). Today I was babysitting my 16 month old grandson, and in addition to it being a nice highchair/booster seat, it was also a big hit as a safe little seat to set on my living room floor wherein he could just sit (whenever he chose to do so) and watch Veggie Tales (his favorite). Since there are many young children and babies in our family (who are frequently here) it is nice to have this as a backup in addition to our full-sized high chair.  Very sturdy yet easy to fold up to be very compact when not in use.	
1. 	Bumkin bibs are great.  They cover alot of area and the pocket catches the stray finger foods.  I wash (air dry) and it continues to look like a new bib.  This one was very colorful.  You can not find this print in the store.	
1. 	A friend of mine recommended this warmer to me and so I bought it and it did us good. It maintains the warmth and moisture for long. The moisture pad would dry out but you should soak it each time you refill the wipes, if not before.	
- 1	I put these bottles on my baby registry based on its good reviews and the fact that I wanted to avoid plastic bottles. However, when we started giving my breast-fed daughter an occasional bottle, she would finish 3oz of milk from these bottles in 5 minutes, choking on the milk. My husband held the bottle upside down to test the nipple, and milk literally poured out on its own. We thought the nipple was defective, so we tested another one - same thing!  We then bought different bottles, and now it takes the baby about 20 minutes to take in the same amount. She's much happier and so are we.	
1. 	I tried several different pillows and still couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep well. My coworker recommended this one and I bought it hoping for some relief. I have scoliosis and my back is messed up anyway but this pillow keeps my back from locking up and I can comfortably roll over during the night without having to reposition the pillow. After training myself to sleep on my back for 12 years it's hard not to be able to do that now. I am able to position the pillow so that my belly is supported in the front, but I am leaning on the back and it feels like I'm sleeping on my back. This thing is a total godsend. When I leave for work, my husband and dog curl up to it. :)---------Edit--------I have since given birth and don't need this pillow anymore. That said, my husband has stolen it and uses it nightly. We definitely got our money's worth.	
1. 	I did a lot of research before buying a car seat and this one is top notch. It has one of the highest safety ratings. I love this chair. My son loves it too. It not only looks good but is comfy too. It's easy to install, we have several vehicles and have had no problems installing it in any of them. My son is a big baby. This chair has the capacity to hold up to 65 lbs vs. a lot of other chairs which only hold up to 45 lbs. It is a bit pricey but well worth it!! This is a great car seat!	
1. 	My baby hated being swaddled when he first came home from the hospital.  And only this blanket works for my loves to kick little man.  My son is now 11 weeks old and we started using this blanket when he was a month old.  We only swaddle him at night and do not use a pacifier.  He currently sleeps from 11p-7a.  I have many friends having kids right now and tell people to buy this as a gift for the baby shower!	
- 1	I bought a nosefrieda (along with these extra filter packs) despite that nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that sucking the snot out of my son's nose is not a good idea.Turn's out, despite 1100 reviews and a 4.5 star rating (for the main product), that voice was correct. These little pieces of foam will stop the snot from getting into your mouth, but will do -NOTHING- to stop any microbes in your kid's nose. They are small enough to pass right though, and get lodged deep in *your* lungs.Let's think on this for a second. Your kid has a runny nose. why? Because he's harboring some kind of infection. You're sucking that snot out of his nose WITH YOUR LUNGS. Normally you wouldn't inhale these sorts of microbes that deep into your own airsacs because that's not how breathing normally works. They would normally get stopped in your sinuses (duh) or your throat, or at worst, your upper airway. This little device however will put anything in your kid's sinuses on a highway straight into your lower respiratory system.Anyway, long story short literally the *24 HOURS* after the first time I used the main product, *I* had a sore throat and a cough. This was 12/24. Went to the Dr today, Dr presribed corticosteroids & levaquin. So yeah. Like i said, Darwin awards.Honestly, this product should be recalled, along with the nosefrieda. DO NOT BUY.	
1. 	I love these little animals, just not as a bath toy. The squirtie hole is the same as the connecting hole making it awkward (impossible) to get the water back out. But, the plastic is soft, great size for little hands, and the little knobs where the animals connect are great for teething babies.	
- 1	I have tried several kinds of bath mats and this one so far does the best at staying in place. To avoid the brown slimy stuff that builds up from everday use, I hang it up when done using. I have had this for about a year and several of the fish & shells have fallen off and one elmo has almost completely detached. Seems like most products these days only last a year.	
- 1	This mattress was inexpensive and worked well for our first baby who was born in Oct of 2009. It fit perfectly into the DaVinci crib we had and I loved the waterproof cover.Our son only slept in his crib from the age of 6 months until he was 28 months and the mattress cannot be used for our second baby. It sags terribly and is no longer firm enough to be used safely with an infant.Very disappointing.	
- 1	Very nice design but they leaked more often than not. I did buy the large inserts and when prewashed they shrunk. Im not sure if that's the issue or I just need to buy the medium insert. Mom of a 3 month old	
- 1	This hamper is super-cute and went perfectly with the monkey/jungle decor in our baby's room.  However, this is a case of &#34;you get what you paid for&#34; in terms of quality.  I didn't expect it to handle industrial level use, but within the first couple of days the little plastic tubes that are used to give the hamper structure pushed through the ends and now the hamper won't stand up.  I was surprised that there was no reinforcement at the ends where the support pieces were supposed to go.  Oh well, I haven't thrown it out yet, I'm still working on a way to upcycle it into some sort of decorative item.	
1. 	I love this blanket, can throw in the washer and hang to dry.  Folding it up is easy and the strap is super convenient.  Tons of moms I know have these, that's the only potential drawback - they're so popular you might have the same one as someone else and have trouble telling them apart!  Definitely recommend!	
1. 	This is exactly what i needed! It keeps my baby station organized with the side pocket for my Peanut's powder, brush n. Comb, trash bags for used diapers, vaseline, ect. It's. Just big enough. I love it!!  AlohA!  Maui Grandparent	
- 1	The sizing is completely incorrect. I say go by your chest size because a small barely fit me for my newborn- once he gained a pound or two there was no way this would fit and I'm bigger than a 34 ddd. I should of gotten a medium but besides that my baby was extremely uncomfortable and unhappy even though his small size initially fit in there. I returned it and got the moby which I really like and it is easy to use.	
- 1	This was such as waste of money.  I should have just invested in an electric pump.  First of all the suction is horrible and I have to continually fix it as I am pumping.  Also the piece will fall off if you pump too fast.  Secondly, it takes forever to pump so it is not convenient.  You need to have an oversupply for this to be an effective pump.My main complaint is the suction.  It is weak and makes pumping ineffective.  I get more milk by hand expressing.	
1. 	i have 2yo twins who love using chopsticks, but as a wohm i don't have the time to endlessly wrap rubber bands around disposable chopsticks to help them.  i found these online and they're great!  even at 2yo, my boys are too old to use the stage #1 training bridge, but they love using chopsticks just like mommy and daddy and have gotten quite good at feeding themselves bite-size bits of chicken and sticky rice.  we're asian and trust me, these trainers have made my life much easier.  to boot, we can adjust the grip of the chopsticks to accomodate their little hands so my kids can really learn technique, and not hold them like little tongs.	
1. 	My new little grandson had problems with spitting up after each feeding.  So this was a life saver! The wedge is not that tall, so he doesn't roll off of it.  It's also as wide as the crib so it fits perfectly under the crib sheet.  Comes with a durable cover as well.  It's packaged as two foam cushions, with one already insterted into the cover.  You just have to insert the second cushion.  Once inserted, it's acts as one solid cushioned pad.	
1. 	The best drool-catchers I've found.  Soft, absorbent, chew-able (Important to the wearer.  I asked.), and with 10 I got one for every outfit and a backup.  They wash up nicely and don't get weird curly edges.	
- 1	It amazes me how this product made it the shelves at all! The top literally just &#34;rests&#34; in place. The design could be easily rectified if the top actually &#34;snapped&#34; off and on. I wanted to love these because they are so easy to fill and clean (I used my bottle brush) but they are essentially useless because my one year old certainly isn't going to sit and hold the top in place while eating. Booginhead: redesign the top and you would have a good product!	
1. 	My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it's comfortable. Haven't personally tried it myself! Easy to dump and keep clean so it's a winner in our book.	
1. 	Soft and the right size.  I do wish they would stop making nursing pads round and make them a little more breast shaped so you cant see them thru a shirt but so far every ones are still round.  They aren't too think but you can see them thru a thin shirt.	
- 1	UPDATE: After reading some other reviews here about getting parts replaced, I called about the warranty and received awful customer service! They told me that they can't do anything for me because I unscrewed the top off of it. The warranty on page 19 of the manual says nothing about voiding the warranty. She pointed me to page 3 where it warns not to open the unit, but it never says that this will void the warranty. All they offered me was a manual pump, when I paid almost $200 for a double electric because I need it and it failed from normal use after only 3 months.I asked what I was supposed to do in a situation where I rely on my pump to work, and all she could come up with was that I should have just left work then until they sent me a new one. I can't just stop working until they get me a new one! She also kept equating it to a television warranty, but obviously you can go longer without a tv than you can go without pumping. Considering that I know women who exclusively pump to feed their children, I am appalled that they make a product that people absolutely depend on, then claim they can't honor their warranty because I depended on it enough that I couldn't sit and wait. When I asked to escalate my complaint, SHE REFUSED. She told me she is the supervisor, and her boss doesn't handle these types of issues. What kind of customer service center has no path of escalating issues? Downgrading from 3 stars to 1 star over the horrible service.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using this twice a day at work for 3 months now, after using a hospital rental the first few weeks home with the baby. I love the features -- it is great to be able to completely customize the suction and speed each time. It's also so handy to have the button right in your hand to turn it on and off, with my hospital pump I was always messing around trying to get it turned off with my toe while I had the pumps in each hand. I also never had a problem with getting as much milk in as little time with this one as I did with the hospital pump.Unfortunately you can tell that this is among the cheaper double electric pumps. A gear inside keeps falling off of its post, at least once a week, and now my pump bag always includes a pen-sized screwdriver to get it back into place when it falls off. I don't know if a piece broke or what, because it looks like there's very little holding it onto the post. When I'm at work I hate that I am wasting time fiddling with the inner workings of my breast pump when I should be finishing up and getting back to work.In short, you can tell they put some effort into finding out what features would make it easier to use. I just wish they had made it with better standards for quality, I need to rely on this for at least another 7 months!	
- 1	These bibs are cheap but you get what you paid for.  The velcro comes off easily and the loopy side is very rough and sharp.  My husband tried to take the bib off of our baby once and it slipped and gave him a bad gash on his neck!  Our baby drools and spits up a lot too and it goes right thru the bibs and onto his clothes.  It's not worth it.  We'll stick with the Carter's ones from now on since their velcros are very soft and it actually sticks.	
1. 	We love the halo brand sleep sacks. We have used both the cotton and micro fleece ones. The cotton one is much thinner than the fleece one. Like the thickness of a tshirt. Comes on and off easily and lasts.	
1. 	Great gate! We bought three gates in all, and this was one of the easiest to install. You don't have to screw it into the wall if you don't want. It's just by tension. It's been up for about two months, and it's held up great.	
1. 	I wish we would have bought this to begin with.  We held off thinking that using hot water in a cup was just as easy.  It is faster than hot water.  Instructions are not exact you have to play with it a little bit to get your water amount correct for your bottle type and amount of milk.	
1. 	My 10 months old baby has now been using this one every night for the past 2 months, and probably still will for a while :)Very practical, it still allows her to roll over and sit easily in her crib. We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!	
- 1	I really wanted to like this cart/high chair cover. I love the Skip Hop brand. The pattern is really cute and it has toy loops, which are great. Unfortunately, the material is SO slippery that it won't stay put on any high chair or cart. I will be returning immediately.	
1. 	We bought these when my son was 6 months old. It's a year later, and he still loves them. He is able to figure out a million ways to use these cups and they are always a go-to toy for him. I highly recommend them.	
1. 	Can't say enough good things about this stool. I used one at my lactation consultant's office and found it really helpful. It gets your body in the right position and makes nursing so much more comfortable. It's well made and easy to assemble. I am not too tall - 5'3 with legs on the shorter side. Maybe if you have longer legs you don't need a stool, but I would recommend it to any new mom planning to breast feed. In my experience, anything to make those first few weeks easier - while you and your baby are learning to breast feed - is worth it!	
1. 	My friend and I were out shopping for a complete travel system to prepare for my new baby, and we picked out the Graco Travel System. Now, I'm an old mommy who had a second baby at age 43 (surprise!), and I have been so impressed with this travel system. The base is SUPER EASY to install, and the matching stroller actually folds up in ONE FAST STEP with a magic button making this the best stroller I've ever had. You can get one of the Graco travel systems in a variety of colors, and it's so easy to buy additional parts (in my case, I was here looking for a second car seat base and found it)!  Better yet, I had an Amazon Reward, and my total cost for this second base was ONLY $4.94.How in the world can you beat a deal like this?  I love Graco products, and Amazon.com ROCKS!!!!	
- 1	THESE ARRIVED BROKEN AND WHEN I TRIED TO INSTALL THEY DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL.  SO I DECIDED JUST TO RETURN THEM INSTEAD OF EXCHANGE SINCE THEY DIDN'T WORK.	
1. 	We bought this turtle for a 3-year-old and he loves it! He turns it on every night before he goes to sleep. His mom says it helps keep him in bed, and has helped with his fear of the dark. The turtle also comes with batteries, which is a nice bonus.	
1. 	I love these! My son does not do well with any other type of nipple. These are sturdy and thick like, they last a long time, and don't suck together during feeding. :) Never had a problem with this brand, will keep buying! I received mine 2 days after I ordered, brand new in packaging. No complaints. Thank you.	
- 1	So, my first impression was very bad with these liners, they kept bunching and making a baby thong and not catching anything but that was only when using a pre-fold and cover. When we switched to pocket diapers these started working amazingly. I lay it all the way out and let the edges lay over the out side of the legs and that holds it tight across the diaper and catches everything. So I love them now. I have never tried any others, so I don't have anything to compare them to. My son is also in the largest size of his one size Kawaii diapers and this cover almost the whole way from front to back of diaper.	
- 1	Would not waste my money next time. It ripped very easily. There are other brands with better quality. Did not like this one.	
- 1	It doesn't fit my 5 month old and I ordered the 6-12 month size...cute but I guess I will pass it on to a friend with a newborn because it's not worth shipping back.	
- 1	I bought these and I was actually disapointed because I love ergo...I thought there were going to be something really cool and that wouldnt get wet...pretty much all this is a  shoulder strap pad...save your self $10 and go buy some car seat shoulder strap pads from walmart.	
1. 	I do not own a Graco car seat (I have a Chicco travel system with infant carrier and stroller), but I swear by this product.  I use the SnugRider with my Chicco infant carrier; it doesn't snap in, but it fits in firmly and in the 5 months that I have used this product (multiple uses per week), I have never had any issues with the seat not feeling secure.  While travel systems are great, the strollers are big and heavy.  And with a newborn baby that is too tiny to sit in the actual stroller, there is no need to lug around the travel system stroller.  This is the perfect solution.  The SnugRider folds up great for easy portability, plus it is incredibly lightweight.  I had to travel across the country when my child was 8 weeks old.  I travelled with the infant carrier and this stroller.  I visited multiple tourist attractions and theme parks with this product and my infant carrier.  I was able to fit 2 diaper bags, the baby, and multiple bags of souvenirs in the basket.  I highly recommend this product!	
- 1	I purchased this bib after seeing my nephew with it.  He wasn't able to put it into his mouth like soft bibs.  However when I received it the bib wouldn't fit around my son's neck comfortably.  The string of balls that's suppose to wrap around and clip into 1 side wasn't long enough.  I don't understand how this is possible when my son is only 7 months and is lean and tall...not chubby.  I wish they made this bib in different sizes since it's wonderful in theory but just didn't fit.	
- 1	I was so excited to buy these clippers because of the light.  Well the light caused all the problems.  I can't use these clippers because I'm afraid I'm going to cut my baby's finger off!  I can't see anything I'm clipping because of the light.  The light casing blocks all views of those tiny fingernails and fingers.	
1. 	My son hated stiff bibs and would try to rip them off immediately.  These are our favorites.  They fold up very small for taking with you, and are very simple to wash.	
1. 	This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a bucket for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can wear the baby down in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!	
1. 	First let me say that I love the online reviews on this site.  I use them all the time before making any major purchases and they have saved me a lot of money, time, and hassle.  I have written several of my own reviews on other products as well.  That being said, I have to say that I'm really very baffled by the reviews on this stroller.  We bought it after much consideration and test driving at our local BRU store the other night. I have to wonder if the stoller we bought is the same one that so many others have complained about!  The main issue seems to be the flimsy cardboard back.  Well, on the one we bought, the back is made up of what feels like 3 sturdy plastic panels that I tried to purposely bend and couldn't.  Perhaps the design was very recently changed, but in any event, ours is definately not cardbord or flimsy.  We have used it for 3 different outings and my 13 month old is happy as a clam in it.  He's fallen right to sleep in it 2 out of those 3 times.  As for storage, yes, storage space is limited, but we're not dealing with a travel system here.  This is an umbrella stroller, folks, and I've yet to come across any umbrella stroller regardless of brand or price that has a large storage space.  Same with the cupholder issue.  We simply bought one at BRU for 5.99 and it fits great.  Problem solved.  Bottom line, I went with my gut on this one and I'm so glad that I did.  This is a great umbrella stroller for those of you who are tired of lugging that bulky travel system everywhere and want something samller and easier to deal with.  Plus, this one comes with a raincover so you don't have to spend onother $20 to get one.  Don't be mislead by reviews saying that this is a bad sroller because it's not.  It's sturdy, easy to use, and does everything a high-end umbrella stroller should.  We love it.UPDATE 03/31/2006Ok, we've been using this stroller frequently for nearly 2 months now and I thought I would go ahead and update my review. It disheartens me to see that so many have had a problem with this stroller. I think what's happening is that there are still a few of the older ones floating around out there that have the flimsy backs on them. Chicco fixed that problem and the newer ones are great. The back on ours is very sturdy and we haven't had any problems with it at all. My son is almost 15 months and weighs just over 20 lbs and is still very comfortable in the stroller. He'll sit in it for long periods of time and never fusses. In fact, he usually falls asleep in it. My point is, many of these reviews are not based on the stroller as it is now. Check it out for yourself and you'll see. It's a great buy for $90.00! We've thrown away the box and receipt, since I have no reason or intention to return it!	
1. 	After hearing a story from a friend about a preschooler turning on all the knobs on the gas stove and then going to bed I began my search for a solution and came across these simply knob covers.  They are easy to install.  You simply slip off your own knobs, install these with the front latch open, then close the case over the knob.  Toddlers can hit the knobs and spin them but they can turn the knobs themselves or accidentally turn on the stove.  They are easy to cook with.  With one hand you can pop open the top cover, reach inside to turn the knob and then close it again.  We have a commercial style oven.  The knobs are a simple, non-intrusive baby proofing tool well worth the investment.	
1. 	Matches the nursery with the bedding so perfect. They are pretty big pieces too, which is great! They are too precious!	
1. 	This crib came well packaged, encased in foam padding. The crib was easy to assemble and the instructions were easy to follow. It only took my 28 weeks pregnant self and a friend about an hour to put together. I love that the toddler bed rail was packaged in it's own cardboard box inside the main box. This will allow for easy storage until we are ready to use it. Very satisfied with our purchase so far!	
1. 	My daughter loved hers so much I had to purchase as a gift for my nephew.  Didn't ruin my walls or even leave a mark.  Provided hours of entertainment!	
1. 	My daughter is small for her age, so we have to use a smaller, cloth bib under this one to catch the mess between the bib and her neck.  I haven't had any issues with the pocket not catching food that slides down the bib.  It washes very well and has withstood many washings without showing any signs of deterioration.	
1. 	We use this chair at restaurants, bars and at home. So far we haven't found a place where the chair couldn't clamp on. Our son has been using it since he was 5 months old and loved being at the table with us. Easy to carry, easy to setup. Can't do without it.	
- 1	To tell the truth, I thought the gear shift on the side that makes sound would be a great incentive for my son to use the potty.  When you would go he could flush his potty and make car sounds.  That never happened, it became a toy long before he decided to go potty.  It would leak.  No matter what we did, have him sit, stand, whatever it would get under the gray seat, go along the top of the bowl insert, and ultimately end up pooling over floor.  The lid broke off so we ended up putting the lid under the potty to catch any urine that would leak under so I could wash that instead of the whole bathroom floor  all day long.  It also made it taller so it was easier for my son to sit down on it.  As a step stool both my son and daughter use it all the time to get to the sink and wash their hands.  It did fit great into the adult toilet.  It locked in tight so that I didn't have to worry about it coming out when my son got off of the big potty.  I gave it a two star because of the leaking problem.I went and got the munchkin arm and hammer potty for my little girl, though she hasn't gone potty in it yet, just looking at the design I now wish I had gotten that instead when my son was training.  I would have saved some money on both another potty and all of the cleaner I had to use from cleaning up leaks.	
- 1	This cup leaks and the lid doesn't screw on well after awhile. I won't buy it again. You get what you pay for.	
1. 	This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the things with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with things to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.	
- 1	I only buy toys made out of wood or other natural materials, and am painfully aware of the cost of doing so. Yet, I'd rather buy fewer quality toys than lots of plastic junk to trip over.Well the Haba discovery blocks are just too pricey and not durable at all. When I opened the box, I thought to myself - 30 dollars for THIS? To add insult to injury, my boy only was interested in the block with the bell. I read one of the reviews here pointing out the presence of arsenic in the bell (?). Had no time to research this claim, but hid the block with the bell anyway for peace of mind. Only a few weeks later, the corners of the blocks were all discolored from mouthing and chewing. I am hoping Haba paints are truly nutritious, or else my boy is in trouble. A year later, the blocks are rarely played with, and yet they look awful. Get some natural wooden blocks finished with beeswax (on Etsy perhaps), and pass on these. In fact, even painted Plan Toys or Maple Landmark toys hold on a lot better than Haba (and are cheaper).	
1. 	I love these monitors. The only thing I don't like is that the nightlight feature is a little too sensitive. It comes on if you barely touch it when turning the monitors on or off. Otherwise, I love the fact that it even has a nightlight. Also, these monitors are very sensitive so I can hear everything that is going on with my baby. Some people may not like this, but being a new mom, I love that they are so clear and sensitive. Great product!	
- 1	got this as a gift when my daughter was one mth old but I started using it she was 3mths old as there was no support for her head .....she liked hitting the lion but it would always bounce back and hit her in the head and its made from really hard plastic...i cut it off... she hated the chair...wouldn't stay in for more than 5 minutes...at about 5 months she used it to become a turtle....left her for a few mins and came back to see her creeping wioh it still strapped on...stopped using it immediately	
- 1	Basically you get what you pay for with this toy, that is, very little. It looked promising when I opened it up, but within just a few days through normal use (hanging on our son's car seat handle), the mirror got completely scratched up. We're not sure how it happened, it wasn't even in use most of the time, but now my son can't even see himself in the mirror because it's all cloudy. Not worth the money.	
1. 	it's cheap and comfy; my baby doesn't like any bib, but this one is the only he accepts; the other expensive ones became toys or trash .... never used them. I do recommend it 100%	
1. 	Once she could face-out at 3 months, our baby prefers this to other carriers. I like that it's quick to get on and off, and that you can do it without anything touching the ground. Plus, both me and my husband can alternate wearing it without a lot of strap adjustment.	
- 1	My baby liked relaxing in this chair (I called it his hammock), however the construction of it left something to be desired. It ended up breaking after about a month's worth of use. Also, not that easy to fold up. Hope they can make a better version of this in the future because it's great having the option of a fold up chair.	
1. 	I bought a changing table that came with a thin, flat changing pad.  This is one of the only covers that works.  Yes, you do have to put something absorbent underneath, but this keeps everything in place and looks nice.	
- 1	Great idea. The reality of it is fine, and would work in a pinch.  It does need quite a bit more gel-filling to be a viable cooling pack.  Not enough gel makes the plastic under the cover hard and uncomfortable, and get warm too quickly.Also my toddler son just isn't crazy about it being a pink bunny (and bunny ears are far to swing-able for a little one). We would have preferred to have been able to choose our character.  Bears are his favorite, and since the photos are of bears, I thought we would get one... but it does say they send what they send so I knew there was that risk.  Unfortunately, because of it being a hard we never use it, though I do keep it in the freezer, just in case... though I've found after this, he now prefers to just use a regular cloth-covered cold pack since it's softer and mold-able, and he can lay with it when he feels the need to.When one of my friends has a girl, this pink bunny is definitely going in the donate pile.	
- 1	I was really excited about using these since I liked the design concept, but they were a big disappointment. My baby would cry when feeding with them as the nipples were too hard for him, and they leak big time.Maybe other people will find their baby is happy using them since they're cheap, but you're getting what you pay for with these, and it's not worth it in my opion.	
- 1	I guess when they say &#34;colors may vary&#34; they don't consider the boy/girl factor. I have a boy, and would have been happy with any other color than pink, but that's what I got. Sending them back, probably not going to order another.	
1. 	Our car does not have a middle headrest and we have leather seats, so if I had read these reviews first, I might not have registered for this mirror. I'm certainly glad that I have it now! My husband rigged it up on one of the side seat headrests without too much trouble and it works just fine. It is at a bit of an angle, but who cares as long as I can see my son? If your car is like mine, be prepared for some fiddling, but it will work. It's on there very securely and hasn't moved in the three months we've had it.I love being able to glimpse at my son when we are driving around, just to see how/what he is doing. A friend of mine doesn't have the mirror and she turns around at every stop to check on her son (we can't help it - we're first time moms).By the way, we were concerned about it becoming a projectile in a crash, but, when we had the carseat installation checked by our insurance company, they said it was secure enough and not to worry. Especially if it kept me from turning around in my seat every few minutes!	
- 1	Wanted to love it, but the smell was horrendous, and then I think our cat walked on it. Dead within a month.	
1. 	These really are the greatest things ever.  So much easier than getting your little one into all sorts of outerwear every time you need to run an errand.  I purchased it in Stealth.  Highly recommend.	
- 1	This is the WORST babyproofing product we have tried. I wish I would have read the reviews before buying but I got these at a big box store. Once the lock was on I couldn't get it off. My fingers were sore from trying to get it to unlock. Finally, I had to unscrew the cabinet knob (which was a feat in itself!) to get it off. These are awful. Listen to the other negative reviews and save yourself some frustration and hassle and buy something else.	
1. 	Compact enough to throw in the stroller and big enough for a family picnic. Waterproof, yet soft & comfortable. A must have. Great gift.	
- 1	Like everyone else I am constantly trying to soothe my sons teething pain and find him whatever toys will help.  This one was too big for his mouth and almost seemed to gag him once he got it in.  I'm glad it wasn't very expensive.	
1. 	I got this set to edge our stone hearth, and the color is a nice neutral beige/taupe. The adhesive has stood up to 18 months of abuse by my toddler and pre-schooler. No lifting or peeling. The seams blend nicely together where the corners and straight pieces meet, and its discreet and doesn't scream &#34;BABY PROOFING!&#34; Highly recommended.	
1. 	If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.  I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).  The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.  It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.  I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.  The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.  I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.  It worked great!  I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!  :-)	
- 1	I bought these because they were less expensive than the ones I'd been using for 18 months (Bummis).  I use them because my child has diaper rash often and don't want our diapers to stain from the cream.  When I opened these I noticed that they were more of a mesh than a cloth-like liner and I'm not sure if they will keep the cream from touching the cloth diapers.  I guess I'll double-up on them for now because I've already bought them.	
1. 	I love this swing!!! My daughter sleeps and plays in this swing. She doesn't really take notice to the mobile and lights b/c its kinda too far for her to look up but the music is very fun and soothing. I don't recommend running the mobil, lights and music at the same time though b/c the battery life sucks. It seems to last a good amount of time just running the music while swinging.	
- 1	These pads are not very absorbent and they will not be useful for night time use. Unfortunately, even though I am not a fan of disposable things, it is best to use disposable pads for night time use. However, even if you want to use cloth/ reusable pads through the day, these are not very absorbent and they start to feel wet pretty easily.	
1. 	As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS:  The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure.  Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.  And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-)  (They do take two hands to open.)  Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened.	
1. 	We love this gate!  We purchased two, one for the top of the stairs and one for downstairs.  Let me tell you a few reasons why this will be the only baby gate we will buy.1.  You can take the gate part off when not needed, yet it is safe enough for the top of the stairs.2.  Even 5 year olds still cannot open it.  All other baby gates become useless as soon as the kids figure out how it works.3.  You can buy extra sets of hardware to move the gate around depending on the circumstances.4.  It's so cheap!These are just the top few reasons why we love this gate.  Give it a try.	
- 1	This product claims to be compatible with PC. Going through the instructions, it looks like this description might be technically true, because -- apparently -- once it is installed, you can view the monitored location from a PC on the internet by going to the right Motorola website.What they don't tell you as clearly is that the device CANNOT be installed unless you have an Android or compatible Apple device. Installation from PC is impossible.With my Android tablet (hopefully) lost or (perhaps) stolen, I cannot even install this device to test it from the PC.Really, Motorola? Was this necessary? If a device can be installed using an app, there is no reason you can't make a mini-program to do the same on a PC. Failure to do so is a disservice to your customers. Moreover, in this case you should not claim it is compatible with PC, as you clearly do.If I locate my Android, or get another one, I'll update the review to discuss functionality. Right now I'm severely disappointed in the unreasonable limitation on installation.	
- 1	This toy sticks to the highchair table which is great and it spins which is also great. This toy has the most awful music. You don't need to be anywhere near it to set it off either. It is particularly fond of going off when you are trying to get the pair of twins sleeping on your chest up to their crib. Please heed this warning- there are other toys that are much more household friendly than this.	
- 1	The Diaper Genie does the job of keeping odors away, but otherwise it is a real pain!  If you shove the diaper down and accidentally miss the clips you have to reach down and pull up the messy diaper and wipes!  Ick.  Particularly icky at 2 am.And contrary to what one poster says, a monkey definitely couldn't operate this thing.  The refill directions are lousy.  It took us over a half hour to figure out how to install the refill, and we're all college-educated professionals (and my dad, a retired mechanical engineer, couldn't even figure it out!).  It's hard to get the refill in, even when you do figure out the part that's ommitted from the instructions.  When you're busy with a newborn, the last thing you have the time or energy to deal with is a challenge like this!And why does the obvious dial at the top cut the liner instead of sealing off the liner for the next use?  Yes, you realize that's what it does after reading the directions.  But we have to tell anyone helping care for the baby not to turn the noticeable dial because it doesn't do what you think it will.If you do decide to purchase this product, don't turn the liner multiple times after use as the directions suggest.  The only reason they say to do this is so you'll run out of the liner faster and have to buy their refills.  One or two turns is sufficient once you get the diaper lined up in the Genie properly.I wish I had taken a better look at competing products.  I realize now there's a real reason other companies decided to come up with other models.  The Diaper Genie has some major flaws.	
- 1	I am not at all happy with this product. They fall off when the weather turns cold (below 30) or gets hot (above 80 outside). A total wate of money. I will be buying a different product.	
1. 	This gate/coral was a godsend for when my wife or I had to step out of a room and leave our little guy unattended for a minute or two.  This worked good up until he was maybe 2 or 2 1/2 I can't remember.  This worked great both indoors and outside in the yard.	
1. 	I got this for my kids for Christmas. They are ages 6,4,2,and 6 months. They love it! I have even tried it in my room and the stars are just the right dimness. As an adult night lights are too bright for me, but these had the perfect amount of dimness. I also like how it turns off after a while. This was a very good buy.	
1. 	Such a cute chair.  In case anyone is wondering, you can take the bar off.  We replaced it with the Tiny Love Take Along Arch which is a much better toy.	
1. 	After three months of filing my baby's nails due to one cut of the skin that had me swearing I would file until she was 18, I broke down and ordered these.  I am so glad I did.  It took me a while to get comfortable putting scissors near her tiny fingers, but they really are quite safe and once I got the hang of it, I can even do it with her moving around now.  It helps if I make some funny sound while doing it to keep her slightly occupied.  But, I am very glad I got these!	
- 1	I really love the design of this changer but am extremely disappointed in the quality. The wood is painted a black brown espresso color, and sloppily done. Globs of paint, and uneven coverage. The glue on the joints is exposed. The only wood on this unit is the structural legs and drawer glide. Everything else is fiberboard, with the exception of the triangle shelves, which are paperboard, and arrived bent and damaged. These boards are covered in a simulated wood grain paper. Much like contact paper.  The chemical smell off gassing from the wood paint, glue,or mdf is horrendous. I have had it airing out, with the windows open, for 6 hours now, and it still smells so bad that it is like sticking my nose in a paint can. The changing pad is very flimsy, smelly, and oddly shaped, with a triangular shape at the corner. The pad cover is a thin terry. Doesn't look like it will hold up. The canvas bins are a natural canvas color and are not very sturdy. My canvas bins from a big box retailer are far stronger. Super dissapointed. I really like the design, but they failed to meet even minimal quality standards.	
1. 	I quite enjoied these cups. we got them for my son when he was 4 months old but he had no intrest in them. As time went on he started trying to get liquid from them and had quite a bit of sucess. He still uses the cups now at 11 months but Im starting to hate them. The valves have started leaking and it seems like all my playex cups leak after a few hand washes. I love the cups and so does my son but ill have to buy new valves often.	
1. 	Love this rattle. Our daughter loves it so much I ordered this as a back up. She is able to hang on to it, spin it, and use it as a teether.	
1. 	I couldn't survive without this little pump.  I have a Pump In Style Advanced which I leave at my office, and that works well for pumping at regular intervals throughout the workday.  But at home, I really prefer the manual Harmony.  For me, it seems to remove milk more quickly and effectively than the double electric.  When I am at home and watching a baby and a toddler, I really prefer the manual so that I am not forced to sit in one place while hooked up to the electric.  I can easily move from room to room while still pumping, or sit down on the rug next to my kids and pump while they play!  For me, at least, it doesn't feel particularly labor intensive or make my hand too tired, and as I said I can drain a breast much more quickly with this than with the Pump In Style.It is easy to clean and quite sturdy...I've used mine regularly for 3.5 years now and it has held up well until I dropped the handle and cracked it the other night.  I ordered a replacement part directly from Medela and the customer service is good.  Replacement parts aren't cheap, but are certainly a better deal than buying a new pump.This has also gotten me out of a pinch in so many unexpected situations--stuck in a highway traffic jam with nowhere to pull off the road, I was able to pump a bottle to feed my hungry daughter.  Once when we were out of town and she was teething and refusing to nurse, this really saved me from painful engorgement.  It breaks down and packs into a tiny bag.  I've learned never to travel without it.	
- 1	I purchased this product to insert into a big Coach bag i bought to use as a diaper bag. It had no pockets so i bought this to use. While it fit perfectly inside, the product itself was emanating some horrid chemical smell! I kept it in my garage to air out and it did air out some, but it is still definitely a noticeable smell and I will not put this around anything that my son will come into contact with. Returning ASAP!	
- 1	I had lost my Zoli container and decided to purchase this one instead of replacing my Zoli. If you're using these as separate pieces, you can really fill them up cause they have curved bottoms and tops, so you can put more in, unfortunately when you join them together, you lose a lot of space, I can fit maybe 3 fig newtons in a container, and a few cookies in another, to me that's just a waste. So I will give this to another mother with a baby that can use it for formula or smaller snacks. I feel that this is not designed well at all. If you're looking for something to hold snacks for a toddler, I highly recommend the Zoli Sumo Snack Stack.	
- 1	I am so surprised that during the first and second wash, it piles badly, there are loose 'cotton balls' on the swaddle, and they fly all over the place in my laundry yard. I used a lint roller to manually remove the lint to wash a 3rd time and it is still piling, though not so bad anymore. I'snt it supposed to be pre-washed? I also noticed a chemical smell when it came in a box, it is also not as soft as I would expect it to be.This is an expensive item, for this price point, i expect much better quality.	
- 1	We bought these bottles a few months ago from a local store. Liquid routinely leaks from the sides of the lid, even when the flip-top is closed. We also had one bottle shatter when dropped from a few feet off the ground.	
1. 	We've had this turtle for four years and it's still working, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of similar products we've tried. I love everything about it: the design, the true-to-sky constellations, the three light choices, the auto off feature. Perfect for a nursery or an older child who's afraid of the dark!Update: We let a battery leak and it killed our turtle :(It was only 5 years old and I know it could have lasted much longer!We got the ladybug version for our LO and love it as much as the turtle!The colors are different than the turtle. It lights red, purple and green (the turtle had orange, blue and green lights).The light seems to be much brighter, but it could just be that the batteries are new.We'll be sure to check them regularly to make sure they don't leak.	
1. 	Love this sleepsack for my daughter. She always kicks her blankets off and this is perfect to keep her covered. I put her in a long sleeve onesie with the Halo sack. I will order a fleece one for the winter!	
1. 	My toddler son will NOT keep a blanket on no matter what. this is awesome love it!!!!!  Hope they make these in the future for bigger boys	
1. 	Coming back to purchase another set as we transition from bottles. Tried Nuby and another brand, but they don't work as well for our baby (struggles to get the liquid out). We have not had any issues with leaking, but I hand wash and don't microwave them. The description clearly states &#34;color may vary.&#34;	
1. 	I was given a set of bumpkins bibs like this for my son when he was born. Couldn't wait to get this set when I found out I was pregnant with a girl! They've ended up being the only bibs we've ever used! They are durable and can stand the test of time. I use one for every meal. After, I rinse it in the sink then I throw the bib right into the washer and air dry. My son is 20 mo old and we've only ever used the three bumpkins bibs! They still look new! They are a perfectly waterproof without feeling like plastic. I just can't give enough praise for these bibs!	
1. 	I had a tear in one of my membranes and couldn't figure out why I couldn't get my pump to work properly (at all actually). I'm so glad I had these on hand. If you pump full time, or even more than 1/2 time I'd recommend having them on hand. Especially if you are engorged and need to pump and one of these tears/stops working. They are inexpensive and needed to make your pump work!	
1. 	We had actually gotten this monitor for free through a promotional offer at Babies R Us. I was skeptical at first because it was free, but once we got it home it worked great! A little bit of static, but nothing compared to our other monitor.We had an expensive montior before this that had TONS of static and threw it right in the back of their closet once we got this one!	
- 1	I am not sure what the difference is between these and other wipes... outside of the expense.  It's not made with castile soap, and that seems like it would work better than these wipes.  I was not comfortable enough with the cleaning power of these to use without thoroughly rinsing all pieces of my pump.  I see how it seems easy, but now that I've tried these, they are pretty much a waste of money.	
- 1	For the price, at about twenty bucks, it isn't horrible. But it isn't as convenient as I thought...I bought aThe First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Rev and Go Sounds Potty Seat(which is cute, but no longer makes any noise and had the battery explode and leak battery acid onto the seat) to use in our upstairs bathroom and I figured this seat would snap off and be the seat for our second toilet once the little potty was outgrown...but you have to take off the entire top half - lid and green handles and all to place on top of your toilet seat. The thing is HUGE and not easy to store in the bathroom when not sitting on the potty. The step-stool feature is equally annoying because it is shaped, well, like a potty, not like a stool and is too short to get my son onto the toilet or assist with hand-washing.Basically, if you are not sure whether you child will prefer a little potty or the adult one and you need to break him/her into the idea, this isn't awful. I honestly wouldn't recommend it. It might be ok if you got it on super sale and it was for a grandparent's house where it would be lightly used, otherwise, keep browsing and find something else!	
1. 	The Warm Fuzzy seems to do two very important things for my 16-month old daughter: 1) It makes the BOB more comfortable for her. She fits better in the stroller and lasts much longer in it now that we have the Warm Fuzzy; and 2) It also seems to keep her warmer. The canvas material of the BOB can get quite cold during the early mornings and this does a fine job of blocking out the cold.My only complaint is that it's so expensive. The BOB is already a high-ticket item and this warm fuzzy, at least in our experience, seems to be essential.	
- 1	This is a horrible product.  Waste of money since I now have to throw them all out.My 17 month old just pulled one out without any problem.Useless and Dangerous!	
- 1	These would be nice if the spout was thicker. My son chewed a hole through it after only one use.	
1. 	I was initially concerned about spending so much on a play mat, but it is worth every penny. My 3-month-old daughter loves the rain forest gym and stays absolutely entranced with the brilliant colors, flashing lights and butterflies. This has also helped encourage tummy-time, which she hadn't previously been too keen on. I like the extra loops on varying levels that allow me to attach more of her toys. The only thing that would improve this product would be to have the butterflies spin on their own.	
1. 	For some reason I lost the original ice pack that came w/ my medela pump, but this replacement came on time and in new packaging, it's EXACTLY the same one that I lost the first go around and it fits perfectly in the insulated breastmilk storage bag that comes with my breast pump.	
- 1	Returning this. Don't need to spend this much money for a glorified seat and some chew toys.  My daughter (6 months) doesn't reach and she's 50 percentile. Have had older kids in this and it doesn't really bounce.  Will be going for the jumperoo or baby einstein instead.	
1. 	i find this super absorbent compare to the thin breast pads i have but i'm giving this a 4 star because the tape that's suppose to be attached to your nursing tank or bras doesn't really adhere to the fabric. again in terms of absorbency it does its wonderful job. it has thick layers it keeps leaks away from your skin. i love it. great deal for the price.	
1. 	I like this blanket because you can sit outside and the morning dew isnt going to get your butt all wet! The baby sees this as a boundary and tries to scoot off of it :)	
- 1	the bibs are too long for a 7 month old in a high chair !	
- 1	This product was only helpful the first couple of weeks of my daughter's life. She wasn't gaining weight like she should've, so the alarm would wake me up to make sure I would feed her in the middle of the night. Other than that, I thought it wasn't really useful for keeping track of diaper changes or naps.  As we were ALWAYS changing her diaper, and naps were completely up to her at that age.She never gained her weight, so we switched to formula, and the itzbeen wasn't very helpful anymore. After that, I only used it to tell me what time it was when my daughter was waking me up in the middle of the night since I couldn't see the alarm clock over our large mattress.Two stars because even though it was fairly useless, I was able to get some use out of it.	
- 1	Unfortunatly I wasn't so thrilled- I found them to be cheap and flimsy, the food doesn't stick to the stick part.	
1. 	Im glad I purchased this. It's a perfect mobile bed for a baby when you don't want baby in a huge crib or far away from you. My Booba can sleep comfortably right next to me on the couch with this basket.	
- 1	My 4-month old seems to enjoy stomping on this toy, and I think it's nice that it features various textures and qualities of sound.  However, I agree with other reviewers that it is extremely irritating that the songs repeat without stopping even after baby has stopped hitting the toy; though, once I did find a setting where the song would fade out after about 20 seconds -- wish I could figure out how to find that setting again.However, my main peeve is that this is very difficult to clean.  The instructions say to wipe with a damp cloth but if the fabric gets any stains or absorbs any grossness, you have a big problem.  You'd have to take off the entire back plate and disassemble the toy completely.  In order to take off the back, you have to have a non-standard (triangle) screwdriver, so I haven't been able to yet.  If I could get the back off I assume I could potentially wash the fabric part without messing up the electronic part.Because it's basically un-washable, I would not recommend this toy... I only let my baby step on it, never grab it, but now that he's starting to get his feet toward his mouth, I'll have to stop doing even that.  I'm glad that I didn't pay much for this -- I bought it secondhand (another reason it irks me that it can't be washed).Oh, and I agree there is no easy way to attach this to a crib or stroller -- I had to rig up an elaborate system of loops and pulleys to get it to stay on the footrest of his bouncer.	
1. 	Everything was as expected. Great bottles for a reasonable price - better than what I have found in local stores. I have no complaints and would recommend to others.	
- 1	Pros:1. Very soft, good for baby's teething. My baby loves to chew it :)Cons:1. Price is on the high side2. The item got an odd smell with it3. Color faded pretty fast4. Bits can be chewed off by baby, probably swallowed by baby too!	
- 1	My child is breastfed -- she's still using a size one bottle nipple and she can down a bottle in less than a minute an ounce. The first time I gave her this cup she drank out of it just fine, but she sucked so hard that the nipple collapsed. There are two small slits in the top and apparently that wasn't enough for my child.	
- 1	My kids played with these for about 3 days before at least two of them were broken.  One broke the very first day when my daughter dropped it on the wood floor.  And from her height at the time (about 30 inches) it was not a long fall for the toy!  Now, a few months later, all but two of them are broken.  If my kids were especially hard on toys, I wouldn't be surprised, but I have not had this experience with any of the other dozens of toys that we have brought in this house.  The manufacturer needs to work on better construction. Until they fix those issues, I would save your money!	
1. 	I love this blanket. ALthough I could never actually swaddle my son (he hated it), we use thsi all the time for his regular blanket. I use the green for the car, cover him in his carseat. Its light enough that I can double fold it and it fits nicely around him. We use the other on the floor when we have him on the carpet. They fold up nicely.I have washed both of the blankets hundreds of times and they have not faded. They are super soft and are my favorite blankets!	
- 1	We have a daily commute to daycare of about 25 minutes which is just long enough for my baby to get in a morning cat nap. I ordered the Brica Koosh'N Infant Neck Support hoping this would keep his head from slumping forward while napping. The neck support stays in place until he starts wiggling around, then the front of the pillow starts to separate, leaving a gap for his head to fall through when he does fall asleep. Also, the pillow does not support the weight of his head. It might work better for a newborn who 1) doesn't really move around yet and 2) has a lighter head. Such a bummer because it looks like a great design and had good reviews!	
1. 	These wash cloths are perfect!!!  Especially for newborns...but I also use them on my almost 3 year old.  I love that they are thin so they easily get in all the nooks and crannies of a newborn baby.  They are very soft so I feel ok about rubbing this cloth all over my baby's delicate skin.  The inexpensive price is also a huge bonus!!  I also love that these wash cloths wash really well.  I have washed them so many times and they still look like new.I highly recommend these wash cloths!!! *Great to add onto a baby gift!!	
- 1	I actually loved the concept of this activity gym and appreciated that the colors, while still playful, were not in your face blaring like many of the other activity gyms. The mat is easy to clean and I really like the toys (the bumble bee is a favorite!). Bonus because you can frequently rotate them or just give them to play on their own.All that said, if the structure is flimsy then all of this doesn't matter. The activity mat has NEVER looked like it does in the picture. It has always sagged and I noticed after the first couple of weeks, one of the plastic poles that holds it up had snapped in two. It still held up, but you had to be careful where you placed the toys. The design could have easily been made where you could at least remove the plastic tubes to duct tape areas that snap and put them back in, but alas they did not do this. (For reference - the tubes are similar to straws in diameter, but thicker, and are on both sides of the arch. That is the ONLY thing that holds the arch up.) Now with another snap, the gym is hard to hold up on it's own. Even before another piece snapped, 8 times out of 10, my babies (I have twins and would put them down on it a separate times) would pull it down on top of their head. Fortunately it is soft, but it is extremely disappointing.At this price, this should have been built much better. We got a few weeks use of it before attaching the arch, and the twins can still play with the toys, but there are better options out there. Even if they explode with colors.	
- 1	I wish I could give this zero stars. The handles get in the way so it's hard to screw the lid on. The threads on the lid and base almost never line up properly, making it leak constantly. I get my hands all covered in apple juice just trying to get the thing set so my toddler can drink.	
1. 	These are designed to cover plugs you leave plugged in, such as lamps or alarm clocks, so keep kids from pulling on the plugs/cords and damaging them or injuring themselves.  And that's exactly what they do.  We use several in our home and have had no problems.  They're also very easy to install with a simple screwdriver.Many of the negative reviews here complain either it is too hard to open (which is completely the point) or that it only holds small (aka standard) plugs, which should be obvious from the description and picture, so they're not really being fair.	
1. 	This bib works perfectly for my 6-month old, who's just getting used to having solids put in his mouth. It rinses off in two seconds and catches everything. I can't imagine using a fabric bib, or one without a nice, open pocket like this one. Baby would have half his dinner in his lap.UPDATE: My son is now 2.5 years old and this is the best bib on earth. We use it for every meal at home and even some meals out (it's a little big for that, but oh well). No other design could conceivably prevent food (especially applesauce or yogurt) from going into the lap. I have no idea why any other bibs are even still on the market, except for drool-catching and spit-up absorbing.LOVE THIS BIB! Get two. You will want two.	
- 1	I liked the matching oxo design, the stand with the water spout, and the color was smart, but the bristle is too soft on this brush. I bought a munchkin and kept the stand.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor at the Apple store.  It was really easy to set up and the picture quality is great.  It's nice to be able to easily launch an app and view the baby from anywhere, not just on the home network.  BUT - the sound doesn't work.  All you hear is a staticy white noise.  Not only that, but the volume on the white noise is inconsistent.  It would get super loud suddenly, then cut down to nothing.  At one point in the night, the sound turned off altogether.  Thankfully the baby's room is close to our bedroom otherwise I wouldn't have heard her crying.  I contacted customer support about the sound issue and they had said an update to the app would be released near the end of the month (March 2014).  I was skeptical since the issue had been reported before and was even in their FAQs.  I asked if they were positive an update would be sent since I had only 2 weeks to return the monitor to Apple.  They advised me to return it and get a replacement.  I returned it, but I purchased the Medisala Monitor instead and couldn't be happier.	
- 1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.	
- 1	I have never be so impressed with customer service but so (very) disappointed in the product.When I was doing my research leading up to getting a pump, I chose Ameda because of the glowing reviews on Amazon, and dreamed of short, fruitful pumping sessions as described by all the mom's that had their own Purely Yours pump. 10 oz in 15 minutes?! (said one review) That sounded wonderful.So I received my Ameda Purely Yours pump through Edgepark medical suppliers, cleaned it, and had it all set up at my &#34;pumping station&#34; in the living room for my next workday (luckily I only work 3 half days a week so I don't have to pump at work, just in the morning). When I got all settled down the next morning and &#34;hooked up&#34; to the pump, I was surprised to notice how little the pump was was getting even though I felt engorged. I never even felt my milk let down. Reluctantly, I detached one flange and just tried one side at a time thinking the suction just wasn't enough divided. I sat there for 40 minutes and only got 4 oz from one side (which I know should be a good amount, but I've dealt with oversupply since my son was born and I could literally feel milk still in my breasts) before frustrated, I had to quit so as not to be late for work. I told my husband he'd need to dip into my stash in the freezer because I hadn't been able to pump enough for 2 or 3 feedings.I tried a few more times with similar results before contacting parent care. They were very helpful and friendly, and sent me reducing inserts (as I though maybe that was the problem), and then, when the green light on my pump started flashing and then dying after being on for 20 minutes, she sent me a new AC adaptor,I thought these two changes would improve my situation, but they did not. It still took 40-60 minutes just to pump 2 feedings worth of milk (8oz total). Frustrated and sleepier than I wanted to be (because of a son who at 6 months still won't sleep through the night and being forced to get up an hour earlier just to pump), I called the Ameda support line and spoke with a lactation consultant, who helped me troubleshoot and narrowed down the problem to perhaps the valves. She sent me more, but that didn't help much more than anything else had. I tried some troubleshooting of my own and finally figured out that the real reason I'm having problems is that the diaphragms start great, but after about 15 contractions, they stop fully relaxing before the next contraction. This affects the power of the suction and the pump's ability to draw milk out.I told this to parent care, and they then sent me new flanges, new diaphragms, new caps, and more valves just for good measure. She mentioned the manufacturers had cut a bad batch of flanges and that must have been my problem.FINALLY I thought I had my solution. I washed all my new pieces, put them together, and the next morning sat down with optimism.Nope.The diaphragms were the still the issue. I had to constantly uncap the flange as I was pumping so it would relax all the way, which means I could only pump one side at a time. Parent care suggested the tube adaptor was pushed too far in, so I tried adjusting that to some improvement, but still not enough to be worth the effort.At this point I gave up. It amazes me how excellent the customer service was for such a poor product. I contacted Edgepark and will be receiving a Medela in the mail soon. For your convenience, I will update this review to compare the two products.	
1. 	All of my children have had dry, irritated skin in the winter time!  I have always come back to Mustela Hydra Stick with all three of them!  It is so easy to apply.  I use it on my 7 month old and I can still use it on my 6 year old.  Great product!  Nice, soft smell!  I just love it.	
1. 	Seriously, this is a fantastic play yard fence. I loved the first 8 panel set we got so much, I bought a second 8 panel (and a two panel extension!), so I could have one on each floor of the house. This makes a spacious, stable area for my son to play safely in, even if I'm running off to check on laundry or something.	
- 1	Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.	
1. 	Fits perfect by size to my changing pad and also fits my nursery - its very nice green, little lighter then in a picture. Will order another one in beige.	
1. 	We have just started potty training my 22-month old, and haven't used this chair very much.  It is sturdy and doesn't look like it will slide on the floor or accidentally tip over.  It is a good size for a toddler and comes in lots of great colors. I bought this because I read many lukewarm reviews on the potty chairs that sing and light up and do fancy things like dispense stickers...we wanted something simple and basic, and this fits the bill. My only complaint is that the inner bowl, while very easy and quick to remove and clean, can be a blessing and a curse: when my daughter sits on it for any length of time, it sticks to her skin, and has almost spilled when she stands up too fast.  That is the only thing to watch out for.  Other than that, it is great!	
1. 	While these containers are made for breast milk storage, we use them for food storage including yogurt and applesauce.We haven't had issues with the food leaking and we love that these containers stack so nicely.  Both in the fridge and in the cupboard.	
1. 	These storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula. I like making a few bottles at night then later at night as I need them I warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and I am ready to feed my daughter. I love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use.	
- 1	We have tried this a number of times with our little one, from about 8 months.  She is now 17 months, and still can't use this.  She gets a little out, but then gets frustrated.  I have tried drinking from it myself and have to suck really hard and sort of bite the nipple to get it to flow adequately. It seems like it is great as far as being spill-proof and could withstand a lot of throwing, but what's the point if it's too hard to suck on? What a waste of time.Editted:At 24 months old my daughter was able to use it succesfully, however it didn't last long since she chewed the end such that it broke and was no longer safe to use.  I have not seen replacement sippy tops for this, so that's the end of this cup.	
1. 	I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.  They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.  They worked great.  After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an old-fashioned type bottle.  It works though so I will stick with them.	
1. 	I find it very useful when I have to take milk or liquid with me that I don't need right away. Fits gerber bottles too.	
- 1	I figured with all the great reviews these bibs would be awesome. I feel like I really wasted my money. I used these with my daughter when she was around 6m old. She pulled it up and started chewing on the neck part. If I made it tighter she just tugged and tugged on it. Plus, I figured they would be bigger and a bit softer. They are too stiff and don't fit comfortably in front of her in between the tray and her body. She is now 13m and we still don't use them. Wish I could get back what I paid for them. The food pocket catcher is nice, but if it can't fit down between her and the tray it does no good. Now I'm searching for a good long-sleeved bib.	
1. 	You have to have these replaced every 1-2 months depending on how often you pump.  Every 6-8 weeks I feel as if my milk production has reduced - but then I stop and ask myself when was the last time I changed the membranes?  and a-ha!  Once I change the membranes - the production is back to normal.  SO it is not you, it is the suction that reduces.  To the human eye, they don't look worn out after 2 months, and you don't stop to think about it.  But something about their strength vs. elasticity that makes the difference.	
1. 	I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.	
- 1	Baby refused to use this. It's very cute and a good idea.  I wish I had had it for my first baby.  But he just won't take it. He's not really a pacifier baby- I waited too long to introduce them.	
1. 	My son got this for his first Christmas. It's got a hard back shell which illuminates the walls and ceiling and plush turtle body parts. He learned how to change the colors a month after he got it, when he was 1 year old. It's a great way to have a night light while you're putting the little one to sleep and the colors are quite soothing. The light is very bright if you look straight into the shell so try to keep your baby from doing that.If you'd like other reviews on the best gifts for a one year old or on what to put on a baby registry, visit the website, AllMomsAerPerfect.com. It's got down to earth reviews and suggestions on preparing for motherhood.	
- 1	I liked this at first. I admit I bought it because it was cheap. I did tons of research on baby carriers. I wanted something that did front carry (facing in and facing out) and back carry. I added the Beco Baby Gemini to my Amazon baby registry, but no one bought it. So try to save money, I bought this thinking it would be comparable. It is not.I've only used it as front carry, facing in. You have to wait until your baby has head/neck control before you can switch him/her to facing out. My baby has been at that point for a while now, but I barely use the Infantino Flip because it is painful to me and seems uncomfortable to my daughter. The padding near the top clip actually rubs/digs into her cheek. If I make the straps on that clip looser, she seems insecure. After wearing it for 10 minutes, my shoulder is killing me. The padding leaves a lot to be desired.I found I could easily put this on though; clip the back piece then dive into the carrier (put your head in, then put each arm in). It was much faster than the Moby Wrap a friend gave me. It beats lugging the carseat into stores. My baby plus my carseat (Graco snug ride 35) is just too heavy now that she's getting older (and she's only 14 lbs).I broke down and bought the Beco Baby Gemini. I tried a Ergo Baby (original) on in the baby box store. The straps on it were amazing, but I really want to be able to have the option to wear my baby facing outward (the Ergo baby carriers do not allow for this). I can always bring her back facing inward if she is overwhelmed, tired, wants to nurse, etc.You really do get what you pay for. If you don't plan on babywearing, or don't plan on baby wearing very long, this will do. If you want to wear your baby often, spend the money on something better; don't waste it on this.	
- 1	The toddler has a hard time gripping these because the handle is thin with a slight curve to it plus the spork like fork doesn't stab or hold food very well. We just switched let him use a regular fork and spoon instead. I wish I had not have bought these.	
1. 	These are great sturdy bottles!! I wish I got this set in the first place (rather than regular medela bottles)	
1. 	The lids to our bottles seem to forever be disappearing at day care.  It was great to be able to pick up some replacement lids without needing to replace the entire product.	
1. 	Our son is 9 months and has grown out of using a mobile now, but for the period from about three to six months he loved lying and staring up at it.  We'd change one of the disks every few days to keep him interested, and he clearly noticed the change.We can't give it five stars for the following reasons:1) the mounting mechanism is bulky and awkward.  It fit on our cosleeper but will not fit on our crib.2) The back of the mounting mechanism is an exposed plastic screw which rubbed a hole in our wall's plaster (the cosleeper and therefore the mobile were against the wall) and we didn't realize this till we took it down.3) The disks are extremely hard to change around without breaking them.  I ended up clipping a small amount of plastic off of each end of the connecting &#34;T&#34;s with a nail clipper.  It didn't affect their stability and made it MUCH easier to change them around.Our son still enjoys the disks sometimes.  We've put the mobile part away but left the disks out as toys, and he likes to chew on them.  The plastic is think and sturdy enough that they are not taking any damage from the attention.	
- 1	We have this sponge for our baby and thought it would be good for sponge baths in the first few weeks but he hated it.  It was itchy and very thin.  I wouldn't want to lay on it with no clothes on either.  I ended up ditching the cushion and folding up a big beach towel, it seemed more comfortable for him.  The cushion also wasn't very long, our son was 20 inches when he was born and was already a bit to big for it.	
- 1	I bought this toy for my 10 month old niece as a gift, but decided to buy one for my 23 month old son so that he could have a nice soft ball to throw around the house (he's got a good arm). The ball is nice and soft (even though the little jingler inside can be felt if the ball is thrown hard enough), it's great for learning to catch, and my son likes to fling it around by the tags. However, my son decided to carry the ball around in his mouth like the doggies do, and one of the tags actually cut his little tongue! Even made him bleed! I am PISSED that something being advertised as soft and comforting could do this. I touched the tags afterwards and they are actually quite sharp in the creased area... had to warn my sister about letting my niece put this in her mouth. Boo on you, Taggies.	
1. 	Definitely a worthwhile purchase and helps our 3 month old get to sleep at night and at nap time. I was using a babbling brook track on my phone to lull him to sleep, but that was impractical since I couldn't actually use my phone if it was left in the nursery for soothing purposes. The sleep sheep solved that problem, and he's cute to boot! I do wish it had better/more sound options, though.The ocean waves are my favorite because they are pretty loud and block out other noises. The rain is also nice, but it is too quiet in my opinion. We never use the maternal heartbeat because it is TOO loud and, while the baby might like it, it's pretty annoying to the adult ear. My husband likes the wales setting, but it's a little too spooky for my taste. I guess I'm pretty picky! Anyway, just buy this. Is it essential? No, not really, but it's a nice thing to have. Bonus that it doesn't seem to drain the batteries too quickly either.	
1. 	I have used this carrier almost everyday since my son was 2 weeks old, and he's almost 7 months old now.  I didn't think I was going to use it that much but it has really come in handy for those quick trips, that way I don't need to take the stroller out of the trunk.  We live in an apartment and I use it when I need to do laundry, which is downstairs.  I just put my son in it and take him with me.  I also use it to do my shopping so that my 3 and 1/2 year old can sit in the cart.  My son also falls asleep very quick in this.  It is fairly expensive but after seeing how much use I am getting out of it, it is worth it.	
- 1	My baby was fussy and spitting up at 3 weeks. Pulled out the Moby and fought the 12 foot long unmanageable contraption that when finally put together properly (which seemed to take much longer than I remembered when I tried it before baby was born) the baby screamed the whole time and in the end I was exhausted, muscles strained and the baby hated it and spit up all over me and him and the Moby several times.I have always been good with instructions and putting things together and taking them apart. I'm not one of those people that can't handle something complicated. If your are taller than 5'2 then maybe the yards of fabric won't be so unmanageable and suffocating. Overall a HUGE disappointment for me.	
- 1	These are a fun idea and cute design, but the set I got did not stick well at all to standard baby clothing.  Also, you cannot really tell in photos but the graphics were a little blurry.  Lastly, all the stickers were in the set I got but the plastic packaging they came in was completely open at the seam and some could have easily fallen out.  Overall, they do the job but based on the quality of the set I received I wish I had only paid a few dollars for them.  I would recommend a different brand if available.	
1. 	This is my favorite baby scent! I lightly spritz my son's clothing before he puts it on.. it lasts all day too! We get tons of compliments on how sweet my baby boy smells!	
- 1	I'm actually not a fan of these bottles, but for me, the problem lies moreso with the nipple. My son spent half his energy trying to suck the formula out of them. Even after going up a size, it didn't seem to make a difference. I gave up after a few feedings. Also, when he did manage to actually eat, he would still get fussy and gassy- an issue these bottles claim to reduce. In my opinion, there are better bottle options out there.	
1. 	When our six-month old was an infant, we bathed him in a typical baby bathtub, but he outgrew that one rather quick (he is a tall/heavy boy) and it was beginning to become uncomfortable for him, so we recently got this tubside bath seat for him. He sits inside a ring that holds him (up to what age, still remains to be seen), has room for his legs to stick out, while it gives us room to clean his head and back, and we can rotate the ring with him inside as needed.So far, he's loving it (I guess, the fact that it allows him to sit in water helps) as he can splash and play with his bath toys, while we can get him clean for his nightsleep. The two challenges we've found are cleaning his belly (since he's compelled to be pushing it against the front of the ring, trying to reach his toys) and getting him into the seat (getting his legs in the proper spots), but this last thing is something that almost ALL seating gear for babies have an &quot;issue&quot; with.In any case, two words of advice:1) Measure your bathtub, to make sure the seat fits it. I can see how some other reviewers might have had a hard time with this, since it doesn't seem to fit all sizes.2) If you get it, when you use it, never leave your baby unattended, no matter how safe or great it feels (which it does!)Otherwise, highly recommendable. Enjoyable for the baby, comfortable on the parents! :)	
- 1	I am in the process of returning this pump after 2 months of use (Dec 2012 - Jan 2013).  Too many times the milk is sucked up in the tube, and even spills because it is not letting down into the bottle - very annoying.  Not convenient for travelling either, as it has too many parts to walk with and the tube should be longer (the Deluxe Single pump is most convenient for travel purposes - just get a good brand battery).The motor's hum is tolerable but could be quieter (horribly loud on the single deluxe).  Very disappointed in the infamous Medela brand on this item.  I have to pump a lot for my preemie baby so I rented the Symphony and it works great with a low hum! (just not portable).  Currently checking out the knapsack one to see if I should buy it...	
1. 	these are much better than the 2 piece shields that came with my medela pump, they are easy to wash and very easy to use.	
- 1	As other reviews have stated, the LED indicator lights are bright.  Not just bright, but light up the entire room bright.  It looks like the police have invaded your bedroom.  My husband had to tape over the lights for the next few nights until we order a different monitor and can return this one.  It's ridiculously bright.In addition, the sound clarity is not that great.  Very crackly.	
- 1	These bottles are worthless. They leak. We have many bottles (maybe 15 or 20), and some of them leak more than others. The yellow tinted bottles do not leak, but the ones with the blue O-rings leak pretty regularly. We've tried everything we can think of, including getting the parts wet before we put them together. They still leak. And they don't leak every time, so I often let my guard down and assume they won't leak, and then I pour milk all over my son. It's bad enough with expensive formula, but when I spill my breast milk, it's awful!I am so dissatisfied with these that I'm about to buy a whole new set of bottles (another brand) for my baby that I'm pregnant with, even though I've invested probably $100 in these Avent bottles.	
1. 	Needless to say we have been trough many different bib brands. This one is by far the sturdiest and nicest of them all. My daughter cannot easily take it off (she tries, but then gives up fast because it is not that easy). It is super easy to clean (just rinse) and the pouch actually catches all the food so there is no more mess on the chair and clothes. Love this bib!	
1. 	You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a hospital grade breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE	
1. 	Love how soft these are and how useful they are for cloth wipes. They clean up well in the wash too! Highly recommended and cannot wait to buy some extras so I have them for my diaper bag.	
1. 	This works great for protecting your cars interior from a car seat base.  I am happy with this purchase and recommend this product.	
- 1	my son also had a hard time getting the liquid out of this cup, as it requires such a strong suction.it ended up in the back of my cabinet and we are trying to get him to just drink from a regular cup	
- 1	Bought this for my twins when they were a few weeks old. It stopped working when they were about 8 months. Disappointing that I have to purchase something else...I wish I would have originally bought the more expensive one...hoping something else will last longer!	
1. 	I hesitated to register for this blanket because it's so expensive, but I am so glad I did.  It's worth the money because we get so much more use out of it than the smaller, cheaper receiving blankets.  This is our favorite blanket for cold weather or air conditioned rooms, while we usually use the Aden + Anais muslin blankets (also expensive but worth it) in warmer weather.  I also thought about getting this blanket in a different color or pattern, but I am glad I went with the off-white flannel with chocolate trim stitching.  It matches everything, and when it's in photos (which is often), it's neutral, keeping the focus on my son.  The blanket is a great size (big enough for swaddling), super soft, just the right thickness (warm but not too heavy), and washes/wears well.  The only things I would change are the tags.  There are two, and while they are silky and soft, they are still annoying.  One is kind of large and has swaddling instructions, which I think is unnecessary to permanently attach to the blanket.  The tags are sewn in with the decorative edge stitching, so cutting them off might mess up the blanket.  They are centered on one side, which makes folding the blanket in halves awkward, and we're frequently adjusting the blanket so that the tags aren't near our baby's face.  Even with that minor complaint, though, I still give this blanket five stars.	
1. 	With my first child I for whatever reason decided I wanted the more expensive bottles becasue they had to be better.  I just had my second child and decided that I would use the basic glass bottles and thought I would give these a try also.  I was a little worried since it has a few different parts, but it turned out to be no big deal.  Compared to the other bottles that have 5ish parts to them, these were very easy to clean.  There is a small rubber piece that goes into the bottom that doesn't need any special tool to clean out.  My son likes the nipple, took to it right away after 8 weeks of no bottles.  I really like the width on them as it makes it easier to hold.  I can imagine when my son is bigger and can hold his own bottle this will be easy for him.  Have not encountered any leaking which is what I get sometimes with the glass bottles.  I really like these bottles more than I thought I would and would recommend them to anyone.	
- 1	My 9-month daughter loved a friend's teether that looked similar to this. I bought it in a store, but it turns out that she can't get the teether nubs to her back teeth. The ball is too hard. We were at a BBQ and everyone was laughing at how disinterested she was in this toy. I should have waited and looked on Amazon for the same one. Now I'm buying the second teether. This was a waste.	
1. 	This is a great first toothbrush. Our son likes to chew on it, but doesn't let us help him with it. So while it does get his few teeth clean, soothe his gums, and provide general merriment for him, it isn't preparing him to use a toothbrush. Overall, a good product. I'm glad we have it.	
1. 	Like so many other reviewers...my husband and I are SO thankful for this thing!  Our babies first few months would have been MUCH more stressful without it.  The vibration soothes her to sleep.  We have such a hard time getting her to sleep in her crib, but she loves this chair.  When she is really cranky and we just can't walk with her anymore, we can put it in her and bounce her with our hands or feet to make her happy.  We didn't start using the toy bar much until she was about 3 1/2 months, but now she loves batting at the toys and watching the lights.	
- 1	I received this 5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.  I loved how the birdies were projected onto the ceiling and I loved how sweet the music sounded. It wasn't too loud and my son loved it. After he outgrew it I took the batteries out and stored it carefully. Now that my second child is due to be born in a few weeks I took this soother out of the closet and put new batteries in it. The only thing that works is the music and lights. The birds no longer move and the light show does not project. Such a bummer. They just don't build things to last anymore. So while it did last for about a year with my first child it no longer works and I don't know why. I just think these baby items should last through more than one baby.	
1. 	We originally bought a Land's End diaper bag based on recommendations from the Baby Bargains book. I do not like that bag. Although it has lots of pockets, it was very bulky and didn't fit as much. So, off I went looking for another bag and found this one at a babies store in town. I liked that it was lightweight and that I could carry my purse, the baby's car seat, and have the diaper bag on my back without feeling overwhelmed. The bottle cooler keeps bottles very cold. The only criticism I have is that I wish that there were a couple more pockets in the bag. Otherwise, I love the bag!	
- 1	My sister-in-law has two of these (which she told me after I bought this that she got it much cheaper than I did) so I figured I would get one too. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a nursing cover.CONS:Since the neck part doesn't go end to end, it flaps under and over and basically cuts the cover aspect in halfThe neck isn't stiff enough to hold it open to see my daughterPROS:Cheaper than other coversPretty printCovers SOMETHING at leastMy daughter is 2 months old and we've only used it twice (I try and plan around feedings), so maybe I just need to practice with it more, but overall I'm not happy with it. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a better brand. I'll continue to try and use this one because I've already paid for it and I can't afford to just be buying all kinds of covers.	
1. 	I bought this for travel and it worked well. It's a lot of work to manual pump when you are used to a electric but it worked for the time being and is handy in case of engorgement while out and about.	
1. 	Really nice changing table!  I accidently cracked a piece of it while assembling, and the manufacturer sent me a new piece in a week or so.  Really easy to assemble.	
1. 	This is one of the best gifts we received!  We've used this bouncy seat every day since bringing our baby home from the hospital two and a half weeks ago.  The vibrations really calm her and lull her to sleep, and she already shows interest in the flashing lights and sounds.  We've even let her sleep in this chair at night when she's too fussy to sleep soundly in her cradle.  My only complaint - a VERY minor one - is that the straps on the 3-point harness are a bit too short on the sides that get threaded through the back of the seat.  They tend to slip back out through the seat back when the straps are unbuckled, which means fishing around and pulling them back through when it's time to buckle the straps again.  However, this really is a MINOR inconvenience and it doesn't detract whatsoever from my 5-star rating.  I would definitely recommend this learning seat to anyone with a new infant!	
1. 	This is the PERFECT toddler bed - it's inexpensive, it's sturdy, and it's absolutely adorable!  If you search the 'net, you'll find dozens of other rave reviews about this particular toddler bed.We just bought this a few weeks ago for our son's 2nd birthday.  He loves it!  It's close to the ground, and he can get in and out of it with incredible ease.Like some other reviewers said, the instructions were a little vague.  Like the pictures won't show you which way to put together each piece.  You need to think it through a little and make sure the holes for the side rails are both going the same direction, etc.  Just think ahead and anticipate what goes where, which isn't hard by any means.  If you've never put together furniture before, I can imagine it might be a little more difficult.But my husband and I having put together cribs, dressers, changing tables, etc, we found this one of the easier baby items to assemble!All in all, it's an awesome product, and I would definitely purchase it again!  Do NOT buy the cheapo ones at walmart, etc - those are poorly made, plus with amazon, you have the added benefit of no tax and FREE shipping, meaning you don't have to lug it out to your car and then to your house - they deliver it to your doorstep!I searched for hours for the best online deal for a toddler bed - this is it!  You won't find a better product for a better price!  Buy it and you won't regret it!Thanks amazon for yet another great buy!UPDATE 1/8/2010:We've had this bed for a year and a half, and it has held up FABULOUSLY!  As hard as our toddler can be on furniture (I'm sure you all know!!) I was surprised at how well it's held up.  He still fits great in it, and he loves that he has a bed sized right just for him.  :o)  A year and a half later, I would still definitely buy this again.  A really great toddler bed, especially for the price!!	
- 1	I am comparing this flannel crib sheet to a babiesRus.Trenb Lab:Positives:- nice and colorfulNegatives:- poor qualityBabiesRusPositives:- nice quality ( 4 washes and so far so good)Negatives:- bland colorsI ended up returning Trend Lab sheet since it did not even feel like flannel ( felt like a cotton sheet with the starch).	
- 1	Cute, sturdy bowls.  They are a wonderful idea, but they don't stay put.  These bowls don't even require pulling on from my infant, and up they come.  She thinks they're super fun to dump out.  I think the clean-up game isn't quite as fun.I wouldn't recommend these bowls, and I'm debating on just throwing mine away.Save your money.	
1. 	This was given to me as a gift, and I really like it because since I have back problems, leaning over to help my baby walk was very painful, with this I walked upright, so that's much better. It's only useful for a month or two, but for people like me, a month or two of back pain is a real pain!!!	
- 1	I bought this stroller bc I own the original Kolcraft Contours, which is a great stroller. This stroller on the other hand was cheap. It was short (I am 5'6) and even pushing the canopy up and down felt cheap. I immediately took it apart and sent it back. It was okay for the sale price I bought it for but I would much rather have my Joovy Kooper over this anyday. I'd say spend the extra and get something nicer. I am now looking into buying a Peg Perego Si.	
1. 	This baby book would appeal to those with a more modern or minimalist taste.  It does not contain cutesy pictures, rather allows you to place your own cute baby pictures in it.  All the pages are a solid cream color.  The left page is for the pictures, which are self-applied with the provided photo corners.  Therefore, you can put virtually any size pictures.  The page on the right cover a different topic.  Some of these include one for mom, where you can put your name birthdate, places you've lived, schools you attended, hobbbies.  There is one for daddy.  There is a page for how mommy and daddy met.  One page is about how you found out you were pregnant.  There is a place to write when or if you found out the gender of the baby, and how you felt.  There is one for the baby shower.  There's a page for the baby's family tree up to his/her great grandparents.  One page is for the day baby is born.  There is a page for baby's firsts.  There are spots for birthdays for the first few years.  I'm not sure what it would take for me to give it all five stars, but it just didn't make me flip with excitement. Overall I'm completely satisfied with the book and it suits my needs.	
- 1	I got this bib because my baby was messing with the flimsy plastic ones too much and I thought the inflexible design would work better and catch more of the mess. The bib doesn't fit my baby while he's sitting in the highchair because the bib is too long and there isn't enough of a gap between my baby and the high chair tray for the bib to rest. It ends up resting at an angle on top of the tray. It also makes it impossible for himn to bend forward to reach food on his tray because this bib gets in the way. Overall I'm dissapointed with this purchase. I guess I'm stuck giving my baby a bath after every meal.	
- 1	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.  Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.	
- 1	My baby is not a pacifier baby.  This may be why the feeding system did not work.  He just wouldn't suck on it.My baby is 5 months old and is breast and also bottle fed (Dr. Brown bottles).Hope this helps :)	
- 1	This is the SLOWEST thermometer ever made. Seriously. It took nearly a hundred years for it to take my baby's temp. It creeps up by about a tenth of a degree each second, starting at about 96 degrees. Yikes.	
1. 	The only negatives are:1. The two plastic pins that are supposed to stop it from opening in both directions, do not work at all. The gate goes right past these and could open down the stairs if not for the handrail on the stairway that it runs into.2. It is easy enough for our 41/2 year old to open and close although we all have to pay attention to ensure the bottom side sets into its holder (i.e., just aligning the top latch does not ensure the bottom latch is in place).Having stated the negatives, I think I would buy this again. It works well, the latch is very easy to use compared to another latch system our friends have, and our 4 1/2 year old learned how to use it within a minute or two and has never had a problem since. Our 13 month old can stand against it and I have no fear of it giving way. I was only able to hit studs on three of the four points (both top and bottom of the latch side and bottom of the hinge side). So I had to use a wall anchor on the top hinge side. So far despite our 4 1/2 year old occassionally putting more weight than we want him to on it with the gate open (he would swing on it if we didn't tell him not to) the one wall anchor has not shown any signs of pulling out.	
1. 	I had been using those common baby bottle type brushes with the foam/sponge on the ends.  I tried one of these and am happily replacing those old spongy ones.  The bristles on the bottom and along the curve make it so it actually cleans the bottom of the bottles and other kid cups.	
- 1	Quite useless	
- 1	my baby girl had the worst colic and gas while using these bottles. i was so upset because i invested in about 20 of them. i'll admit i was atracted the pretty colors and neat design first of all, which is why i registered for these bottles. my baby could barely suck any formula out of these and would become tired and frusterated and would take an hour to eat a 4 oz bottle. reluctantly i tried the Dr Browns bottles and thank goodness i did. they are fabulous, she finishes her bottle in no time and is much happier and no gas. too bad Dr. Brown's bottles are not pretty but who really cares when you have a happy baby who eats and is not up all nite with colic ??  I found the price of both brands of bottles to be about the same and both have extra parts to wash, but Dr. Browns are worth it.For those of you that do like the Vent Aires i have one caution i would like to mention: do not skip the removal of bottom ring and disk when washing to save time... grime builds up on the disk and ridges in bottom ring if you dont wash all parts separately ( i found out that husband and other care takers didnt know that all parts had to be removed when washing and ended up with some gunk in a few of my bottles) Also make sure that the disc is perfectly fitted into the bottom ring before screwing onto bottle and adding milk b/c it will leak (found that out the hard way)	
1. 	Waterproof, and large to cover most of my son's clothing.  Pocket catches some of the crumbs and chunks, but not all.  We LOVE these.	
1. 	I love the Playtex nursers. They are so easy to use and maintain sterile conditions. You simply drop a new liner into the bottle and attach and clean nipple and it is ready to go.  You can mix the formula right in the bottle, shake it up, and press all the air out by pushing up on the bottom of the liner until the formula squirts out the top. This makes it so the baby doesn't get a lot of gas in his/her tummy.	
- 1	I have to say, I hate this thing.  It's unfortunate that there's only 1 button for power / scanning.  Half the time that I hit the button to scan a temperature, the thing turns off.  When I actually do get it to scan, I get 10 different readings each time I take it.  So it does absolutely nothing for me.Based on all of the high reviews, I can only assume I'm missing something....but simply taking a temperature shouldn't have so much room for error!	
- 1	These trainers are not well made!  They left red marks on our child and are extremely loud.We have purchased store brands and did try Gerber as a trusted brand first.  I came across on amazon.com what are called Dappi's.  I am glad I listened to those reviewers and purchased a 3 pack for the cost of the Gerber 2 pack.  I would strongly suggest if you are in the market to look into Dappi's and give them a try.  There is a huge difference between the two.	
- 1	We bought this hamper for our son's jungle themed nursery. At first I was happy with the product it was cute and I thought it was durable. Not 6 months of use later the hamper is falling apart. Not as durable as I thought. It's ripping and the sticks you use to keep it up, keep popping out. Now I have to go out and buy a new hamper. Honestly I would like my money back b/c this item was a joke. We only used it to put dirty clothes in it and then we would empty the basket when it was full so I could do laundry. Not work the money. Listen to other reviews, I wish I had.	
- 1	Do not buy these bottles unless your babies can absorb formula through their skin. The lids leaked within just one week. Further, the bottles are not finely graded, so when you are trying to keep track of how much a newborn is eating, it's not very accurate. The leaking was the most annoying thing to deal with on top of everything else. I recommend Dr. Brown's starter set instead.	
1. 	This is suppose to latch onto your changing table.  Instead I use it as a car seat toy when we are sitting around or walking in the stroller.  We are not on the table long enough for them to enjoy it there.  Very nice no batteries needed but you do need to wind it up a bunch of times.  If you have a toddler in the house this is a great job for them.	
1. 	I use this everyday to heat up bottles.. I like how you can keep the frozen ice pack in with bottles to store and keep cool then just pour a little water into the front part to boil the water.  The directions are a little confusing with how much water to use, so i just have kind of learned how much water we need to use and just keep the bottle in there for 4-5 minutes.. you learn by trial and error.  Or if you want to save your money you can always just boil/microwave water and put the bottle in that.  I got this as a gift at my babyshower and I'm happy with it.	
- 1	This might work great on car seats but there was no way to use it with my stroller. Because you would have to take the straps out and rethread them through the openings to attach it.	
1. 	We have these on two of our outlets that are used quite often and I wish we had purchased these for most of our outlets instead of those plastic outlet covers that are nearly impossible to remove. We don't have any issues with ours closing and it is easy to slide when I need to plug something in.	
1. 	I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!	
- 1	It's ok not great. It's a slightly darker than the photo and the inside black circles fade quickly. Ive only had it a month. I was not impressed. I already bought another bag.	
- 1	Even though these helped with pain, I couldn't wear them because the pressure made me leak so much. They've been sitting in a drawer for months. I was really disappointed	
- 1	I bought this set when I returned to work so I wouldn't have to worry about washing my medela pieces every single day.First of all, these pieces are NOT interchangeable with the medela pieces.  I would throw them all into my bag and just grab a set of flanges, valves and membranes and start pumping.  After a couple days of doing this, and my output decreasing dramatically, I finally realized the yellow valves are NOT the same size as the medela valves and should not be used with the medela flanges.  The valves are slightly larger for this set.  Nowhere in the packaging that came with this set stated not to interchange with Medela pieces.  I only wish I had figured this out sooner--my production went down 2/3's from ineffective pumping and caused me unnecessary grief and anxiety when trying to figure out what was going on.  I was honestly crying after pumping because I felt like my body was letting my baby down.My second problem with this set also involves the valves.  The instructions state the valves have to be put on in a certain position (unlike the Medela pieces).  So now I'm all paranoid about my production and constantly looking down to make sure breast milk is flowing and that I put the valves on correctly.  And as most pumping women know, constantly checking and monitoring and worrying about how much breast milk is coming out, only helps to decrease it.Do to me buying this &#34;extra set&#34; to make my life easier, I am now frantically trying to get my milk supply back up to where it was before and am probably going to have to start my lo on formula.  Hopefully my review will help other women from making the same mistake I did.	
- 1	I was surprised how tough this is to open.  On my cabinet, the two connections almost touch each other, and the cabinet knobs create quite a mechanical interference so that my fingers can't reach in to the proper handle area where you need to lift and pull.  Other than that, it was fairly easy for my 1 year old daughter to bend the plastic back to the point where she could rip it off of the cabinet.	
- 1	I ordered a couple of these clips but this one, for some reason, had a HORRIBLE clip part. It was almost impossible to open and when I was trying to pry it open one day, it snapped shut on my finger and actually injured me. I ended up throwing it out because I didn't want it near the baby. The other color [blue/green stripes] that we got didn't have the same issue, but this one was horrible and I would never have wanted it near the baby. Perhaps it was a faulty one, but I thought it was worth pointing out. The other one was useful and we used it for as long as the baby had a pacifier.	
1. 	We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.	
1. 	I pump in my office and am not near a bathroom to rinse the parts. I use these wipe to clean up the parts and then pour just a tiny bit of water to rinse it out. I love using these.	
- 1	I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.	
1. 	Bought these after giving birth to my second child. Had trouble pumping/breastfeeding the first so I was looking for solutions. Not sure I needed the XL shields, might have been ok with L, but these work great. They are comfortable, wash up well & I feel they will last.	
1. 	...in medical bills! Previously, we had a cheap wood, stationary gate in our hallway. I must have hefted my pregnant self and my 10 month old over that gate a hundred times a day and it was taking a serious toll on my back and knees. After about the 10th time I nearly fell over the darn thing, I went to find a new gate and saw this one. Next day I picked up at BRU (I had to get the extender peice too) and installed it.WONDERFUL. Sturdy, tall, nice to look at and it opens effortlessly. Couldn't be more thrilled. Everyone who has used it loves it because there is no fussing with latches or handgrips. Just step and nudge.	
1. 	My daughter still loves this mobile and she's 13 months now.  It's so cute with all the flowers with happy faces that she can see when she looks up.  We have it over the changing table because it's a great distraction.  Definitely recommend it.	
1. 	I gave this 4 stars b/c it works for its intended use however, I prefer not to use a cushion b/c they get so dirty.  My little one is learning to feed herself and is very 'busy'in her chair.  The cushion constantly has food smeared on it.  After I realized she was fine in the chair without it (it was in the wash during a feeding time) I decided not to put it back on.  My personal preference.	
- 1	I am 14 weeks pregnant, still nursing my 15 month old and my milk supply has pretty much dried up. I still try a few times a day though. I am almost to the end of my freezer supply and I just wanted to share a few things about my experiences in using up my freezer supply.1. You can never have enough frozen. There is no &#34;too much&#34;.2. All of the frozen milk I have fed her over the last month has been 13 to 15 months old. In a deep freeze. She drank every drop, not a bad bag. So I question the 12 month rule.3. Double check your bag is sealed before you freeze, keep the seal dry. Many popped open while thawing.4. I used 3 kinds of bags and lots of empty bottles. I will NEVER buy Medela bags again. They are the only ones that the sealed opened on and 4 bags so far either broke or the seal on the bottom of the bag leaked while thawing in hot water. No problems with Lansinoh bags. Not sure if Gerber still makes bags but I used some that were 7 years from my first baby and NO PROBLEM with Gerber bags.	
- 1	I have mixed feelings about this set. The four ounce bottles and nipples were great. I can't stand the nine ounce bottles however. They leak. My sister-in-law bought the nine ounce bottles separately and had the same problem. I would suggest buying the four ounce bottles separately, and not buying the nine-ounce ones at all. In order to keep them from leaking all over the baby, you will have to fill it with formula and shake it over the sink and readjust until it stops leaking -- a total pain!Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friendProsDurableEasy to cleanEasy to useSafe for babyPortableConsLeaksMessy	
1. 	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.	
- 1	We bought this guy as a second activity center to keep at grandma's house. I thought I did a lot of research and based on the reviews we opted for Wally. He is cute but my little man much prefers the Evenflo Jump & Learn Frog we have at home. The first, and in my opinion, most important feature that makes the Wonderbug inferior is the height adjustment mechanism. Unless I am missing something, it seems that the only way to adjust the seat height is a buckle that is under the seat; the Frog has adjustable legs. My son is almost 6 months and 50th percentile for height and even with the buckle as tight as it will go and with a firm pillow under his feet, the sides of the Wally's seat go up to his armpits. It makes it extremely difficult for him to reach most of the toys unless I first bend them toward him and get him to grab. It just isn't comfortable for him. He only tolerates being in Wally for 5 minutes whereas with the Frog he is happy to sit there for as long as I let him.  I also like the the Frog let's him rock and bounce. Wally the Wonderbug is just stationary. The worm that lights up on Wally does seem to catch my son's attention and I like that it has 2 sound settings and an off switch; however, I found some of the sounds creepy. The Frog also has toys that make noises with adjustable sound settings and they encourage more usage of fine motor skills such as pushing down on a frog's head or flipping up a sunflower. I am hoping that my son will grow into Wally more. Overall I guess he works as a back-up activity center.	
1. 	We bought this because we have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old kids. We thought it will be useful for both the kids. While the little one had many nice naps in this rocker, the elder one hardly used this as a rocker. I don't think she really enjoyed it much. That does not mean other toddlers won't enjoy it. But you may want to think twice if you want to buy this assuming it will grow with your child.	
1. 	I used these in the first year of my daughters life to store expressed breast milk.  I have the Avent pump (which I LOVE) so with the adapter I could pump right into these, very convenient. I had a lot of milk stored in my freezer I really appreciated how nicely they stacked and that they didn't take much room.  I never had problems with spilling.  As a disclaimer to that, I will say that I didn't transport milk daily and that I rarely filled the cups completely.I appreciate them even more now that I'm done pumping.  While bottles and plastic bags are either causing clutter in my cupboards or have been thrown out, these are still frequently used.  They're a perfect size for on the go toddler snacks.  I also use them to store sides for my husband and I when we take lunches to go or to store small amounts of leftovers (usually headed for my toddlers lunch the next day).Overall, these are a good choice for milk storage based on their potential long-term usefulness!	
1. 	We researched baths and finally settled on this one. It seems it will serve her well until she's ready to go into the regular bathtub. We have a 6 week old and have no problems with this, it is made well and there's a nice piece in the middle of the tub that keeps her from slipping down too far.	
1. 	with my first born we used one of those baby baths, I hated it uncomfortable it was hard to keep him warm i love this product, so much easier to use and just wring it our when yo are done.	
- 1	UPDATED REVIEW:So, after 2 month of use (once a day, 5 days a week) I can say that even the good thing about the pump I wrote about in the first review, does no longer hold.The pump disintegrate quickly -- the suction is not powerful anymore. At first I thought it was a good thing -- it didnt ache as much. Now it is pathetic -- it hardly pumps at all! There is some air leak, but I am not sure if it is from the soft plastic inserts (that can be replaced) or the tubes. And frankly, I think trying to fix the problem is a waste of money given how poor the product is.Everything comes apart (the soft plastic inserts, the ring in the bottles etc), causing milk leaks and even spills.I would give the product negative 5 stars if it was possible.OLD REVIEW:Cons:- The bottles are unstable. They come with a ridicules stand, but they still cannot keep balance when attached to the funnel compartment. This is VERY inconvenient since you must essentially hold them both at all times, or lose precious milk that will spill.  2. Their competitors figured out how to make it stable, why cant they too?- Lots and lots and lots of parts. Including tiny ones. You have to wash (I also sterilize), put them together, take them apart each time. Misplace a piece and it is all gone. It is just like a huge Lego project for adults (or a 1000 pc 3D puzzle) but not fun at all. 2- Because of the multiple parts -- lots of milk gets lost on the way to the bottle in all the plastic and rubber folds. This is very unfortunate especially because each drop comes with so much effort. 3.5-  The bottles are leaking! They leak when you heat the stored milk as well as when you feed. After I reduced my usage of the pump for the reasons listed below, I tried to continue using the bottles for feeding, but I quickly stopped doing so because they just showered the baby with milk. They get the rating of 1 on this, just because you cannot give 0.Pros/neutrals:- You are in full control of the speed and intensity of the pumping. You dont have to choose from existing settings but pump the way you feel lest uncomfortable with and it continues to do so for you.- Fairly effective pumping, which is great as you can pump both sides at the same time. 4- It is very uncomfortable. At first it was painful, but I either adapted to pain or found a better way to hold it, so now it is just very unpleasant, and leaves an unpleasant sensation for 15 minutes after the pumping session is over. You are in full control of the suction strength but what is too light to be painful is also too light to pump out milk.- The motor part is heavy, bulky and noisy -- but not too bad.	
1. 	This newborn starter kit is a great choice for new moms, especially nursing moms.  The kit gives you bothe the (6oz and 9 oz size bottles) as well as extra nipples for different flows. There are also extra caps and vent disks included.The bottles and pieces are easy to clean and dishwasher safe. (You might want to get a little basket for the smaller pieces) and there is no harmful BPA to worry about.The bottles are well angled and designed for virtually bubble-freefeedings, which minimizes gas and discomfort for your little one.A very good product for the price.	
- 1	This does not absorb odors at all. I was not expecting it to add fragrance - just neutralize . Disappointed.	
- 1	It did not work well for our Britax car seat. It wouldn't stay in place. I tried it on our city mini stroller and worked better on that. Although, it's not for the child anymore... More for the adults!	
- 1	My baby is due in five months.  But I am on a roll getting all the things ready for the nursery. Wanted to have extra time to select the most efficient, quality and reasonably-priced things. So, I did a bit of digging (I am a public interest lawyer, so digging is second nature to me) and discovered that about 85% of all baby and children's stuff is treated with carcinogenic and neuro-toxic chemicals, flame retardants PBDE and Chlorinated Tris to name just a few of the poisons they put into our baby stuff.  This Rock n Play is treated with flame retardants.  So, this thing would be perfect for someone who chain-smokes as they rock their baby to sleep.  I am not planning on bringing poison into my home and keeping my baby on it.  Pretty upsetting if you think about what they are doing to the people: poisoning us right in the crib... literally! The least I would expect the retailers to do is to put a warning label up front on all products treated with this stuff apprising the public of the carcinogenic, neuro-toxic and endocrine disruptive properties of what they sell. The information about the flame-retarding treatment is only found on the label of this Rock n Play.	
- 1	I give them a two star due to the fact they hold a car seat but one of them ripped in Half after the first flight and on the way home the other one lost a zipper. The material is extremely inflexible in cold weather too. I actually cracked it on a thirteen degree below zero day! It was cold no doubt but these were brand new. Find another option.	
1. 	This are great, especially once your baby is  too big to swaddle easily, but still wants to be swaddled at night.  The material did seem to make my son too warm though if he wore it over a thicker sleeper.  The nights we used this I had to put him in a thinner sleeper so he did not sweat.  They did help ME sleep better knowing he was not going to get blankets in his face at night and/or was not going to get cold.  They are a little expensive, but may be worth the investment for your child.	
- 1	Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...	
- 1	I am concern if the baby is able to remove it with her own hands, but she still too small to said, so just  consider that the hock is not strong enough may be no stable	
- 1	I bought this because I thought it would be a wipes case that I could use one handed while changing diapers.  Not so much. Also, the red button doesn't click, so it doesn't really close/lock.  And then soon after it just fell off.	
- 1	We purchased this gate to replace the First Years Hands-Free Gate when the foot pedal broke after 1.5 years of heavy use, however, we quickly returned it and got another hands-free gate.1) The weight of the bars on the extra-tall felt flimsy when compared to the hands-free. It just didn't feel sturdy. My son would pull on it in an attempt to enter the kitchen and you can see the bars give a little.2) The self-closing feature sounds like a good idea, but it slams shut making a really loud noise and if you're trying to direct your child out of the room, you have to make sure you hold it open for them and it doesn't slam in their face when they decide to change directions.3) The latch on the gate we got was very sticky. It took two hands and quite some force before it would open. Upon investigation, we think the self-closing mechanism at the bottom of the gate caused this problem because it wouldn't let you lift it high enough to unlatch smoothly. It seemed as if it was in the way and prevented the gate from lifting. This was a problem since we used our gate between the kitchen and the living room so if we needed to rush in between either room, it was very frustrating trying to get the gate open.4) This gate did come with extensions so that is a deal if you need them to fit your doorway.In the end issues #2 and 3 was enough trouble to make us go back and buy the hands-free gate again.	
- 1	This product is difficult to use, especially if you have two cords plugged in to the same outlet.  It is extremely difficult to get the cover on.  The space for the cord is so small, you have to be very precise about where you place the cord.  In the one case that I actually got the cover on, I could not get it off.	
1. 	my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!	
1. 	Green Sprouts makes some of the best, economical bibs I have found for my baby. We bought a package in anticipation of him entering daycare at 4 months, and recently ordered another as he starts to teethe. The terrycloth bibs were comparatively big when he was 16 weeks, but they are a good, generous size as he continues to grow. I found the lack of cutesy slogans or images very appealing. They go with all his outfits.These are well-constructed bibs that hold up well to frequent washing. He hasn't been able to pull them off and the velcro fasteners are strong. The colours stay bright and haven't run, always a fear with a solid dyed garment. Handwashing or using cold water should help their lifespan. I find the terrycloth soft and non-irritating to the touch, but still absorbent and tough enough for baby's fairly regular, low volume spit-up. Unless he's really having trouble, the bib gets most of the spit-up without his clothing underneath becoming damp and the wide yoke tends to catch most everything. The bright shades mean you'll visually see the stains, though, and only the yellow and pale green seem to hide them for any length of time.Baby and parents are both happy with these bibs, and they are not so heavy or thick as to be a problem layered under his outer garments, too.	
- 1	I purchased this for a dream on me port a crib. I figured being from the same manufacturer it would be a good fit, but unfortunately no. There is way too much of a gap for me to feel comfortable having my not quite 3 month old sleeping on it. It is too much of a hassle to send it back, so I will just hold on to it to use in a pack n play when he gets older and sids is not as much of a risk. In the mean time I ordered the SUNSHINE 3 ULTRA FIRM MINI CRIB MATTRESS which is 39 x 25 x 5 inches  vs. this mattress which is 38 x 24 x 3 inches in the hopes that it be a tighter fit and not as soft. I know it is not recommended that you use a mattress thicker than 3 in a porta crib, but common sense will tell you that the reason for this is that it would be easier for them to climb out once they are able to pull themselves up and walk, but obviously once they are able to do that the risk of sids/suffocation will not be an issue and a thinner, softer mattress would be acceptable.	
- 1	I am returning this immediately.  The picture gives the impression that the images are part of the plastic which is not the case.  They are hard, raised and would not be at all comfortable to sit or stand on.  Very disappointing.	
1. 	I have several cheap covers and didn't want to buy this, bc it's pricey. After 9 months of using a cheap cover, receiving blanket, and whatever I could find I finally decided to splurge! I borrowed a friends cover while we were out and had to have one! The quality is worth the price! My baby is super active now and using the cover I had just wasn't cutting it. My previous cover was made of cheap material and therefore flimsy. I love the weight of this material and the sewn on towels. Totally worth it and you'll save money if you just start off with this one!	
1. 	My son is a really messy eater and his bibs used to be completely covered with food after every meal. It was such a hassle to have to rinse the bibs and then wash them in the laundry. With this bib I just wash it along with his tray. It takes 1 minute and it's ready for the next meal. He was a little annoyed with it at first, but he was fine after the second day. The bib does stick out a little at the bottom so you have to move the child's tray out but he is still able to reach everything on his tray/plate. I highly recommend this bib!	
1. 	I have been using my diaper pail by Dekor for 8 months now and I love it. I have tried out a few of the others via my girlfriends, and none seem to be as easy to use and works as well.The foot pedal design to open the lid sold me. (you're hands are busy enough!) Although it can be heavier to lift due to the sealing around the edge of the lid, it gets the job done better then anything having to use my hands, and I never have a problem getting my dirty diaper in the pail due to this. The seal is worth it!The diapers drop through another door that automatically opens when you drop the diaper on it, and closes back up after by it's self.The liner bags are well designed in that you tie off the bag at the bottom, and simply fill with diapers as you would a regular trash bag (no crazy long diaper sausage!) The bottom opens up when you're ready to change the bag. It has a small razor edge (very well protected from any injury) on the inside of the door that you slice the bag off however full it is. Tie it off again at the bottom, and you're all set! (Sounds harder and more complicated then it really is.)I did hesitated at the thought of having to buy replacement bags. I bought two boxes before my daughter was born, and she is now 8 months old, and I STILL have not had to buy any more boxes yet! Not as costly as I had thought....especailly for the convienence of it all!!Smell. Well, it really does do a good job with smells. As we all know, as baby's diet changes, so does the smell of her diapers!  I'd say, I didn't smell a THING until 6-7 months old with the introduction of solids. Of course, I wouldn't want to think about how it'd be now without the Dekor! I did my research before buying a diaper pail, and in a comparision test of the top selling diaper pails, this one was the winner....especailly smell factor! Regular cleaning and Lysoling helps keep the pail as fresh as possible.I reccomend this pail to all my friends. Personal experience, reviews and word of mouth are the best way to gather your research in the quest for your perfect baby products!	
- 1	I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was weird - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.	
- 1	Nicely constructed, thick fabric that maintains privacy, but &#34;natural&#34; is not remotely close... Let's try &#34;yellow&#34; on for size. Also way too large for petite frame. Picture looks sophisticated, but sets expectation that just isn't close to being met.	
- 1	I don't absolutely hate this bib, but it's definitely not what I was hoping for, especially since it's over-priced and I paid so much for it. Although it is very easy to hand wash and reuse for each feeding (which is why I wanted it - I didn't want to have to do laundry every time my baby ate), it does not accomplish its job as a bib fully. The neck is so big that most of the food gets on my daughter's neck and clothes. So what is the use of wearing it? My daughter is six months old, and her height and weight are in the 95th percentile, indicating that there is a problem with the actual size of the bib. I tried tightening it as much as I could by closing it at the end tip of the velcro, but that did not work either. I don't see her growing into it any time soon.On a plus note, I do like the material this bib is made of. Like I mentioned earlier, it's really easy to wash. I just run some warm water over it and hang it for our next use. However, I do need to find another alternative. So far, I have found the normal cloth bibs to work best, but washing them is definitely a hassle.	
1. 	Exactly as described, it is a great value! Beautiful and white...We can;t wait for our little one to get here	
- 1	Maybe other people just think cloth diapers and fabric covers are suppose to leak, but that is not the case. These were good when the baby was 6-10lbs but after they just leak all the time. Also the inserts never dry! in the dryer with only diaper cloths for over an hour and they will still be wet. We have since switched to FLIP covers and couldn't be happier.	
- 1	I am very disappointed in this item.  It is just a tote bag and the material is not as nice as the diaper bag. Very over-priced for what it is.	
1. 	Great bib with excellent coverage.  Love the pocket for catching what baby drops.  I hand wash in-between meals and let air dry, but I can also throw them in the washing machine--which I really like.	
1. 	I really love this bouncer!! It is perfect!! I love that my baby can sleep away in it.  No problems here at all!! Love the music and massage with vibration.  I wish they had one in my size,  LOL!	
- 1	This seemed like a good idea at first.  The little stuffed animal is soft and cute, but I didn't like the way it forced the baby to keep the pacifier when the pacifier might not have been wanted.  Newborns aren't able to move it away or spit it out because of the stuffed animal holding it in place.  Then I began to wonder if she began spitting up/vomiting (she has reflux) if it would cause her to choke.  So, I think this would be good for older babies, but definitely not newborns.	
1. 	My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it's comfortable. Haven't personally tried it myself! Easy to dump and keep clean so it's a winner in our book.	
1. 	I use it as a stool and it's nice. won't slip on any surface. But I guess it will be hard to clean the top.	
- 1	These stink! The gap in the c shape is so large that using them to attach toys, etc doesn't work. If you link them together they'll disconnect after a minute or 2 of playing.	
1. 	I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.	
1. 	This was our second potty for my daughter as the first one was too difficult for her to sit on. We got it before 18 months and she is very small for her age, the other potty we had was &#34;the shortest on the market&#34; but bc of the design she had trouble. She had loved this potty since day 1 and she likes the little bear logo on the front. The only downfall ivories would be she can grab the basin and easily pull it out but she is pretty good about letting me do it. Like the gray color too.	
1. 	I have had this high chair for 18 months now and I love it!  It has such great features that grow with your child.  The 3 positions of recline let you put your infant in the chair before they can actually sit up.  My son was not the best napper, but he very often fell asleep in this chair in the reclined position.  When he was a little older and started eating solid food, I really appreciated the removable tray cover.  When your toddler is covered in avocado slime or smearing butter in his hair, sometimes you need to just remove the food from reach.  The tray cover snaps off easily but leaves the tray in place until you can wipe off those little hands and let them down.  The tray also slides out a few inches to make room to lift baby out without catching his feet.  Another feature I like is the double sided cloth cover.  When it gets dirty, just flip it to the other side.  It washes beautifully... dries quickly and keeps it's color.  A friend of mine has the Peg Perego with the plastic wipable seat cover, but her son sweats too much when sitting on the plastic and there is always some sort of dried food caked in the corners.  You can't throw plastic in the washing machine.  I'm so glad I didn't spend twice as much for the Peg Perego!!	
- 1	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.  In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.  Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.  This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.	
1. 	We got this as a registry gift when our daughter was a week old. She loved it right away! The music, lights, fish action & bubbles mesmerize her in her crib. She's 9 weeks old now & the original batteries are still working. We also have the aquarium bouncer chair-another must-have item!	
- 1	The information for this product misleads me. It stated that the origin is USA and when it arrived, it is China.	
1. 	I bought this rocker because my daughter didn't like the swing that we had. She's only two months old, but she likes this chair. This is the only place I can set her while she naps. Since it vibrates, I can set her in it, and she doesn't wake up right away like she does when I set her in her bed. I leave her in it with the kickstand up while she's napping, but she also likes being rocked in it.My two year-old also likes the chair. It seems pretty sturdy because he weighs 30 lbs, and he climbs all over it without hurting it. One downside is that it didn't come with any sort of infant headrest. We took the cushion out of an old carseat to keep her little head from flopping while she's in the chair.	
1. 	It's well designed to fit a number of bottles and all the accessories.  My only problem is that the bottles take a while to dry.  I sometimes have to let them air dry off the rack.	
- 1	I have to say I don't really love this one.  My daugther who came with me to register for my shower was really wanting this for her little brother.  I was really wanting the Baby Papasan bouncer because it looked much more cozy and comfortable.  I should have gone with my gut feeling on this.  First of all, I think that for a new baby this is much too upright.  You cannot adjust that part of the bouncer at all.  It is just really upright and that's all there is to it.  They should have really considered that there would be very young babies in this because after all, that's the time when you need a bouncer the most.  Also, I feel like it was way too stimulating at times.  My other kids would come and turn it on while my son was in it and everything would go off at once.  Also, the little red frog on here was so annoying.  It gets stuck and just clicks and clicks.  You really can't fix it.  Finally, my daughter did something to it and it has stopped.  I could not figure out how to make it stop though.  My son does seem to like the monkey and the parrot, but as he got older I felt like he got a little more frustrated because they are always in his way.  When he is in this there is so much stimulation going on and he cannot see over the bar to interact with anyone.  I hardly ever use the bar any more, but I still just wish that I had registered for a different one.  Not a great product, I feel like Fisher-Price could have done more with this instead of just adding every toy and sound they could to it, not to mention your little baby is practically sitting up like a full on adult.	
- 1	Loved this product until it quit working.  I was careful to make sure the unit motor was not submerged EVER.  We turned it off after bath.  It probably ran for a total of 10 hours before burning out.  In the trash it goes.  :(	
1. 	We love the Bjorn, and love this new (more feminine) color! Great fit for our infant twins and a little more stylish now too :)	
1. 	works pretty well but sometimes the sticky stuff in the back comes loose and the bib slips off. Overall, it's a pretty good product.	
1. 	A friend recommended the Snoogle when I asked her about must haves during and after pregnancy.  At first I was a little skeptical, especially because it's pretty expensive for a pillow.  I'm so glad that I purchased this!  I'm 22 weeks along and was trying to use regular pillows as props to provide some support and also to prevent me from flipping over onto my stomach at all.  I typically use the Snoogle under my head with no additional pillows, have the long side in front to support my belly and then I may or may not use the bottom curve between my kneees.  If I need to roll over I can still use the pillow under my head and between my knees so I don't have to constantly flip it over as I roll.  I'm 5'8 and I fit very comfortably.  It's also been great to use as a prop in bed when I'm reading or watching TV.  Definitely be aware that this is a large pillow.  I cuddle so close to it that it hasn't been an issue in our queen size bed but it may not work for everyone.  All in all, I'm thrilled that I bought it and wonder if I'll want to give it up even after the baby is born.	
- 1	Got this for my son at 3 months and the plus is that it doesnt take up much space. My son doesnt really get entertained more than 5 - 10 mins on it maybe 15 if I keep him in the view of the mirror. If it had music it'd be better..	
1. 	the cups are great the handles are easy for the babies to holdon to and fumble with as they learn the process of drinking from a cup.	
1. 	I am quite pleased with this seat. I had a fold up one, but it would pinch my granddaughter's legs and she would always exclaim, &#34;It's cold!&#34; This seat does the trick!	
- 1	I read the reviews about the sheet being too small. I ordered it anyway. I should have listened to the reviews. When the sheet arrived, I washed it and put it on. It was small, but not too small. I thought I was in the clear. However, after a few more washings, she sheet is definitely too small. So small, in fact, that I ripped it getting it on the mattress. Nice fabric, cute pattern, soft, but it doesn't matter anyway because the dang thing is too small for a standard crib mattress.	
- 1	Appeared to be made of good quality (very sticky, wouldn't move with 16 month old toddlers), however, upon peeling it from the wood kitchen table, it pulled up the top layer of the table.  The wood kitchen table is now damaged because of using this mat.	
- 1	I bought these when my son was 1 month old and the earlier reviews were absolutely correct. I used them 2 xs before it became impossible to get them around his ankle ( the first 2 times I did get them on, it was a feat and I was scared it was cutting off his circulation.) Granted my son is in the 99th percentile for weight and height, but you would think these would give at least a tiny amount of stretch but gives absolutely none what so ever.	
1. 	Probably my favorite baby item ever! These bibs are a soft plastic, so it's comfortable for my child to wear but it holds its shape. It doesn't bend or anything so once it's on, it's staying in place. The lip is the perfect width to catch food. There isn't a gap between the table and the bib for food to fall down. Other bibs similar to this I have tried, the lip is more flat or doesn't hold its shape and therefore doesn't catch any fallen food. The collar is very adjustable, so I can fit it perfectly around my child's neck, and there isn't that gap between the bib and the shirt for food to get on the collar of the shirt.  I always have hated how when i put a bib on theres just a tad bit of shirt collar showing and it always got stained. well not with the baby bjorn! It wipes clean or can be put in the dishwasher. And it doesn't stain... You know how some foods like pasta sauce or carrots always seem to stain plastic containers and such? Well I have left spaghetti sauce on this bib overnight and it still did not stain it. The bibs look as clean as the day I took them out of the package. If you have a kid eating solids, you have to buy this bib. It's the only one that actually succeeds at keeping food off if your kid.	
- 1	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.  I could tell that she was not very comfortable.  It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.  Also it is very small in size.  If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.	
1. 	This is a good swing, I like the two different swinging modes, front to back and side to side.  The only problem I had was that the music quit working after 2 weeks.  I did not want to disassemble the whole thing and lug it back to the store and I did not want to ship it back to FP and wait for 3-6 weeks for a replacement.  We didn't need the music anyway, so we just used the other features, my son is now 8 months old and is still under the weight limit and he enjoys the swing once in awhile, though now that he is mobile, he wants to be on the floor, crawling around.  My son was quite fussy and the swing often helped to soothe him, a few nights he actually slept in it for 5 hours straight, if he took him out he woke up and cried and cried!	
- 1	ok these is nice looking but all the cirles come out and its just a pain to clean, and move around, all the cirlces fall out when you move it maybe when my son is older he will enjoy this puzzle mat but for now i do not like it and prefer the abc 123 ones that i found at toys are us lol	
- 1	the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk	
1. 	This crib sheet is really cute!  It fits snugly on the crib mattress and looks great too.  I highly recommend it.	
- 1	I put this thermometer on my baby registry and have found that the reading varies by as much as 3-5 degrees (when taken repeatedly in the same few minutes, the exact same way) and typically is no where close to what a rectal reading ends up being (at least 2 degrees off).It could be that I don't know how to use it correctly, but my husband and I both read the directions and tried multiple times - so even if it's user error, I give it 1 start because it just shouldn't be that difficult.Have used with adults and the same thing happened. When compared to oral thermometer, which seemed far more accurate - it was completely off mark.	
1. 	This pillow saved me! Well, honestly, I don't know anything different bc it was my first and only pregnancy... but I used it every night... you can survive without it... I did on vacation. But it was the best! I tended to have the long part behind me and I'd sort of halfway lean against it and I'd  have it between my legs... and under my head... AND I used a regular pillow for my head and a regular pillow under the stomach, which made it so I could lean back on the prego pillow. I am a side sleeper, but I also like to sleep on my back. So this pillow made that sort of possible. I wasn't on my back, but I was at least leaning against something so was better than nothing! You get tired of sleeping on your left side!!! Oh, also... when I was really far along, I started sleeping with it under my hip versus between my legs... that was when my hips hurt and I wanted to sleep on my back so bad to get the pressure off but you cant!	
- 1	We encountered midew problems only while using this pail liner, it leaks, and is also the smell does not come out of the material.We got one a few years ago and some one gave us another one (both brand new) last year from our new baby, both times we have had the same issues.Planet Wise is way better.	
1. 	If you are expecting a baby, you need a Boppy!  As a nursing mother, I don't know what I would have done without this pillow, particularly in the early days when I was trying to figure it all out.  It gets the baby in the right position so he/she doesn't have to search for the breast and the mother has a hand free to guide the baby.As she got older, I no longer needed the pillow for nursing.  Instead, the Boppy was being used to prop her up after feedings and for naptime.  Then, I started using it for tummy time and then to give her support as she learned to sit.I recommend this to every mother out there!This particular slipcover is very soft and comfy, although it does become less so after numerous washes.  I still recommend getting one, though.	
- 1	I purchased a similar crib sheet at a local store a while back and decided to get another sheet (from who I thought was made by the same company), but this one is not the same quality. The seams don't line up with the mattress so it doesn't fit properly and several seams actually lay several inches over onto the mattress itself, making it look very awkward. It's soft, but very thin. I don't expect it to last long and have only been using it as a back-up sheet when the others are in the wash.	
- 1	For solid foods this container is okay.  I would avoid this item if you want something leak proof.  The lids are difficult to snap down, and even with a lot of effort to make sure that the lids were sealed all the way around, liquid still escaped from both sides.  I would only use this for foods like mac/cheese, cheerios, and items of similar consistency... Cleans really easily in the dishwasher, though.	
- 1	I love love love the huge basket on my stroller... and hate hate hate all the leaves and dirt that fall into it when I stroll!  I walk the dog daily so this stroller sees the outdoors A LOT.  And I hate how leaves and debris fly and drop into the basket.  I'm OCD and would prefer the basket to be clean!  Since this was the only option available... and I am thankful that Baby Jogger even created it... I bought it but it definitely needs improvement!1. the clasps... they come off easily!  One in particular... is like too tight or something because it will snap off as soon as I clip it on.  SOOOO ANNOYING.  I have been meaning to contact Baby Jogger for a replacement... but with a baby... who has the time?  I am finally sitting down to write a bunch of Amazon reviews now!  The two on the very front tend to come off when I fold the stroller up.  So, if I want to go somewhere and put the stroller in my car, I have to take the entire cover off first (because it will come off anyways).  Another major annoyance.2. there are 6 clasps.  2 in the very front, 2 on the sides and 2 in the back.  The 2 on the sides are attached very low on the bar.  This creates a sagging mid-section.  I really wished they had 4 clasps on the sides and put the other 2 higher up (close to where you would attach the seat).  Because of the sag that the material creates, leaves and debris will just sit in the middle of the canopy.  How ugly, dirty and gross!3. I think instead of clasps, it would be great if they could create some sort of zipper attachment to attach it to the frame.  This way, it would be completely enclosing the basket and would allow you to access the basket a whole lot easier.  Perhaps 2-3 zippers?  One in the back, side and front to allow you to access the basket from all sides.  Accessing anything inside the basket via undoing a clasp is VERY ANNOYING because you have to fumble and feel for the clasp and fumble with snapping it back on (and back on again and again) because they pop off so easily.4. I do like how CHEAP it is since Baby Jogger sells their other accessories at ridiculously HIGH prices! =)Because it is so annoying to access stuff inside the basket with the cover on, I mainly use this to keep the basket clean when I'm strolling outdoors with the dog.  If I plan on going somewhere with the baby, I leave the cover off since I need to put the diaper bag, etc. in there.I hope Baby Jogger reads these reviews and will listen to customer feedback and update their design!	
1. 	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.	
1. 	These are very convenient if your child is already using the Avent bottles. If you use a Medela pump, you can get an adapter and pump straight into these containers, eliminating a step in the breastmilk collection chain.I also find that the small sizes are convenient, especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out of one or both breasts.I didn't give this product five stars, though, because, really, these are just four more Avent bottles with a sealing disc. If you have a bunch of bottles anyway, you can just buy a pack of sealing discs for about $4 and use those instead.	
1. 	fits on my pack and play and just holds the junk you know,  dont think i could live without this item. and i use the diaper storage as back up when my dh uses last diaper and i and elbow deep in poop, this is a life saver	
- 1	I am so surprised by all the good reviews for this swing!I think it's terrible. First off, it's HUGE and there is no easy way to move it around. So you won't be moving it into a quieter room or taking it to Grandma's. Second, the mobile is too bland for the baby to see and enjoy, there's a reason why most baby toys are neon plastic, because neutral colors do not excite the baby. No baby will be entertained by the three brown birdies on the mobile, the mirror helps, but bright contrasting colors really keep baby happy. Third, it's hard to get the baby in there! The giant mobile and controls sit right above the  cradle and you have to maneuver the sleeping baby into the cradle and it often wakes them up. You can get a compact portable swing that will do the same thing and your baby will like it just the same.	
- 1	Good Idea , but its glue is use less. It didn't stick plus when I manage to glue them with another adhesive , it didn't work . so it is just a waste of money	
- 1	I so wanted this to be a good toy, but the sound stopped working four days after we purchased it.  If you wet the suction cup, it sticks pretty well as others have mentioned.  My daughter liked it when it made sound and won't bother with it now.	
1. 	If this little piece gets lost, or don't think of the trauma of it coming out of our sterilization bag and going down the drain...your pump won't work without it.  And the membranes do wear out if you take them apart to truly clean your pump.  It is a great investment.	
- 1	Although the idea of this is pretty neat- the balls themselves are flimsy and easily misplaced.  The balls also don't put out enough light to navigate a dark room, and almost give off a creepy glow when used.  My kids won't use it at all.	
- 1	I was really excited for the Skip Hop Elbow Rest. We currently use the very popularAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Bluebut I don't like how bulky and difficult it is to stow away between baths. This elbow rest seemed to solve all of my problems, it even has a handy loop to hang it up.Out of the package I was excited to see that it has Velcro to keep the side flaps tucked together when not in use. It also has a nice, thick pad to protect parents' elbows.Unfortunately, that is where my excitement ends. I have sliding shower doors and the flaps of the elbow rest aren't long enough to reach over the door tracks and attach to the tub wall. The elbow pad itself is only 16 inches long (6.5 inches shorter than theAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue). For me the elbow rest has two functions. To keep my elbows comfortable and more importantly to protect my son from the shower door tracks if he slips in the tub. This doesn't come close to covering the edge of the tub. I don't expect it to cover the entire tub but 1/3 of it would be nice. On the flip side are a total of 3 suction cups. 1 on the tub side and 2 on the parent side. My sons likes to take apart everything, I doubt that is enough suction cups to keep it securely attached to the tub when a toddler is involved.If I were Skip Hop I would add at least 4 inches to the length, 1 inch to each of the flaps, and more suction cups. Then they would have the perfect elbow rest.I've added photos to the customer images section. Check them out and please let me know if you find them helpful! Thanks!	
1. 	This is great! It makes the room look so cool. Blue shows the best. I wouldn't use this as the only nightlight since it gets pretty dark, but it's a great add on for the kids to look at to go to sleep.	
- 1	I was looking for a side hip carrier that was comfortable and attractive. This is not it. I am constantly rearranging myself or trying to straighten out the waist band and shoulder cushion from riding up in order to be comfortable.	
- 1	Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward? YES they will. My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby! I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBj&ouml;rn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support! P.S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else.	
1. 	I've loved this item since day one of installing it. It is super easy to put in place and to use. My toddler is baffled on how to open it. Believe me this kid is strong! He has repeatedly yanked, pulled and tried in vain to get it open or break it off, all to no avail!! Now for some reason, this device is not just toddler-proof but also relative and maid-proof as well!! Many seemingly intelligent adults have found themselves utterly befuddled and frustrated with the workings of this device. At times I have found it yanked off the toilet in a desperate attempt to lift the lid with the device in place. HOT TIP: Lift up on both tabs at the same time. Wella....magic!!	
- 1	I have the previous version of this baby monitor, and we really liked it. While the picture viewed over the internet was not the greatest, it was still a real treat to be able to see my little one while I was at work and my parents enjoyed being able to look in on her at night.I don&#8217;t remember exactly how old she was when the monitor stopped working, but I clearly remember that the entire unit was extremely hot. I had another (non-internet) monitor at the time, so I didn&#8217;t really pursue a refund. It wasn&#8217;t until later when I heard about the battery recall that I realized that it had to have been the overheating battery that caused the monitor to go out. I was very happy to think I could get this very expensive monitor replaced, as we currently have a second baby on the way. Turns out not to be the case.This review is of my customer service experience with Summer Infant, and not a review of the monitor itself.When I found out about the battery recall, I dialed the number and they happily agreed to send me out a battery. I told them that the overheating battery also damaged my monitor, so they send me to a second number as they only deal with the battery recall. I called this number and explained that even plugged directly into the wall that my monitor no longer worked and I believed it due to the overheating battery. The CSR did some troubleshooting with me and told me it was the cable. I didn&#8217;t think this was the case, but I agreed to give it a try. Once the new cable was received and the monitor still didn&#8217;t work, I tried to call again. After waiting on hold for over half an hour, the second representative told me that my monitor was out of warranty and they had no way of knowing that my issue was caused by the battery. Basically, if the battery would have exploded instead of just overheating they would be able to help me. My frustration didn&#8217;t come from the inability to get a new monitor, but with things the rep told me. She actually said it was my fault, because I should have called Summer Infant when the problem first happened. My argument here is that I didn&#8217;t know why my monitor malfunctioned &#8211; but once the battery recall was evident it all made sense to me. Since she was clearly not going to send me a new monitor, I asked her if there was anything that could be done. I offered to send the broken monitor in so they could see if the problem was due to over-heating, and she again told me I should have called when the monitor first malfunctioned. She mentioned possibly bringing the battery to a Radio Shack type store to see if it had malfunctioned. I asked her if I could confirm that, would they then replaced the monitor. She said no, so I&#8217;m not sure what the point of that line of conversation was. In the end, she offered me a 30% discount on a new baby monitor before reminding me once again that I should have called when the monitor first malfunctioned. I declined her discount offer &#8211; I have no desire to give this company more of my money after the frustrating customer service I received.	
1. 	This little guy was one of our baby shower gifts that actually gets daily use.  It's cute, for one, but I really questioned whether or not it did much for my baby.  I don't think it did when she was really small, but the white noise seems to be useful for her now, at nearly four-months old.  We use this basically every time she sleeps, whether a quick power-nap or going down for the night.  We have it strapped to her crib (which she has slept in since before 1 month old) and have used it basically every day and night.  We always use the heartbeat sound since I think for now, having some consistency is probably the most comforting to her.  I think the monotony of the sound is probably best for little babies, too.  The whale sounds seem like they wouldn't be very soothing to anyone, of course, I'm not a baby, so my opinion probably doesn't mean much.Occasionally, once the sound stops, she will actually wake up, but turning it back on and rocking her a minute or less will have her out cold again.  I do wish you could have the sound on longer, for that reason.  I also feel like the plastic switch box is pretty cheaply made and find that the buttons kind of stick in a pressed-in position.  This has not affected being able to play it or anything, yet, but it's kind of annoying and I wonder how much more abuse the heartbeat button will take.Overall, I think that using this regularly comforts her AND she uses this sound as an association for sleeping and calming down.  I used to think I'd just set up and iPod and speakers in her room for white noise sounds, but this sheep has been really convenient and easy for us to push the button and be all set.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
- 1	my twin grand daughter don't like it, it seems bother them around the neck, it needs to be softer around the neck.	
1. 	I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.	
- 1	i bought these to freeze and store my homemade baby food in once i needed a bigger size than an ice cube tray.  the size is good, but the jars themselves are lame.  the lids do NOT stay on, don't create a good seal, and frozen food came out with a freezer burn smell.  also, frozen food does not come out easily and i can't tell you how many fingernails i've broken trying to pop a cube of frozen peas out.  the silicon itself retains smells and even portions placed in the fridge just over night come out smelling funny.  the only successful usage for me was to use these only to freeze a large batch overnight, and transfer the frozen cubes to a ziplock bag within a day or get the freezer burn smell.  to get the food out i had to let them thaw for a for minutes to really release from the sides of the jars.  whatever you're looking for, keep looking.	
1. 	We received a number of swaddles as gifs before the birth of our first child and this was hands down our favorite swaddle. We had a big baby and he thrashed around quite a bit but slept best when swaddled. While the aden and anais swaddles were very soft and had cute patters on them he almost always managed to break free. We also liked the Woombie swaddles in terms of keeping him in the swaddle, but the zipper went up really high and we worried about choking him. The Miracle blanket was the best of all worlds because the inner arm flaps kept his arms in place so that we could wrap the long outer strip really securely. Highly recommend!	
- 1	I appreciate the extendable handlebars as we are tall. We have upgraded with the quilted seat pad and two cup holders, both of which are useful and well-designed. I like the locking foot rest and use it regularly.I wish our 2011 model had one-handed seat recline as the 2012 does, as it is cumbersome to use both arms. The under-seat basket is quite small and inaccessible when the seat is fully reclined. The latching mechanism for storage seems like it will break before long. The straps are very difficult to adjust.Overall, I am only moderately pleased with this purchase. I have seen many that appear to be of lesser quality, and a few that seem to have better features.	
- 1	The snaps a re nearly impossible to snap on a squirmy baby!  The velcro version of this cover was also a dud because the velcro was so sharp that it cut my son's legs.  I used wool covers and loved them!	
1. 	I loved my Graco high chairs in the black and white damask pattern because they were really cute.  BUT, I have twins and so I had two of them, cramming up my breakfast nook.  They take up a tremendous amount of space.  And, although they clean up beautifully, it takes some time to do so (you have to wash & dry the fabric covers, then scrub down the whole frame) .  These Healthy care Deluxe Boosters take care of both of those issues!  I now have a ton of room in my breakfast area and spend a tenth of the time cleaning them!  That means more time doing the stuff I want to do like play with my kiddos!!	
1. 	My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable tub tatoos!  I have both the fish and the turtle - both are cute and my kids like them.  Unfortunately, they are so small that the do not do a very good job to prevent slipping in the tub (even with two packages of them in the tub).	
1. 	The Happy Hippo Travel Gym is a great buy for anyone. It is fairly inexpensive and provides lots of entertainment for your little one. It is colorful and has a hanging mirror, rattle and toy that are all detachable. All of this is packed into a convenient carrying case that zips up.  The gym is great to unzip and lay on the floor for tummy time or back time. It has just enough padding that your baby can play or nap comfortably on it and still not take up a large amount of space. The only down fall to this product is you have to make sure the levers are turned so that the overhead wire that holds the toys stays in place. If it is not tightened it will start to droop towards the floor. It is not harmful to your baby in any way it just does not stay in place unless it is screwed in.  We have two of these, one for our home and one for Grandma's. My baby absolutely loves his tummy and back time on the Happy Hippo.	
- 1	This food processor will be good for making food for older babies who can handle chunkier textures. The blade is so small and there's not a lot of horsepower in it. So beware! It does indeed leave big chunks of food. So if you're looking for something that will make a smooth puree for your baby, this is not for you. You have to be willing to scan the food and toss or mash the big chunks. And the steamer function? It's a joke. You'll have to run the steamer a few times before the food actually cooks or softens.The only benefit I see of this product is when the baby is older and can chew or handle thicker textures. It's just helpful in that it's a smaller food processor than your bigger blender/processor, so that you can maybe save on counter space?	
1. 	My daughter is nursing and started pumping.  I had made a Christmas basket filled with &#34;nursing mom&#34; items, including this.  She said this worked perfectly.	
- 1	We started using these with our first daughter, and overall, we're very pleased with them. We used these to transition from breast-feeding and that went without a hitch. The thing we noticed though is that the harder, inner nipples started to break-down and crack after a few months. One-by-one, we had to start throwing them away, so I went ahead and purchased this Breastflow Stage 2 Nipple 2 Pack to replace them. To be absolutely honest, these have held-up even worse. I purchased them on June 10th, and as of today (July 26th), the end of one of them has completely deteriorated and the other has very noticeable cracks. That's a whole lot less life than I was expecting, especially since my daughter is having fewer bottles than she used to.Overall, we still like the Breastflow bottles, but the durability of the inner nipples really leaves something to be desired. It's also a shame that they aren't sold separately at a lower price point, because that would probably make buying more a little bit less of an offense. While I doubt we'll be changing bottles with my oldest (now weaning her off the bottle at 21 months), we'll definitely be looking for another product when our 4 month old twins are ready for them.	
- 1	The product description says that it is 7 oz cup, but I received two 5 oz trainer cups. However, I did not return it and keeping it as the product is good otherwise.	
- 1	I just purchased the third fan in as many years. It does the job to direct air to my daughter in her car seat until the AC cools the car enough. It's enough to keep her from roasting. It's made as cheaply as it looks, however.  You may get through the season, but it won't  survive more than one summer. From what I can see, it's no better or worse than other stroller fans out there.	
1. 	I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his boat. It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!	
1. 	The songs and stories are so sweet, especially the What Does the World Look Like story. As soon as I heard that I knew I had made a good purchase. My daughter no longer sleeps in a crib, but I keep this on a shelf in her room and she turns it on whenever she passes it. I would recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	I purchased this for my 2.5 year old for traveling and he loves it. It folds up so small and takes up little space in the car. When unfolded, it's a comfortable place for my toddler to nap and sleep at night.	
1. 	These are nice but you can get much cheaper and larger bags from toys r us.	
1. 	No complaints about this one.  Baby loves it.  We love it!	
- 1	my daughter won't drink out of this, and the pieces are bulky. i wish it was more aerodynamic and skinnier for small hands.	
1. 	I like this sheet so far.  It fits my crib mattress well and is soft.  It would be perfect if the color was a little darker, so if you are looking for a more teal crib sheet this isn't the one for you.	
- 1	Got this for my bassinet and it says on the package even Prewash before use! I did it and it shrinked significantly!!!!! Had to return them!	
1. 	I am absolutely in love with this.  I sleep better, my son sleeps better... I can lay, half asleep, rubbing his belly, helping him keep his pacifier in... and it is so nice to have him right there...  I bought it when he was 4 weeks old and wish I had it from the beginning.  Absolutely love it!	
1. 	Utilizing this showing the different ways to stack these - starting with big upside down and going upwards to the smallest then starting with the smallest and making each smaller one disappear with the next larger one!  FUN! THEN we put them inside each other starting with the largest - lots of ways to make his brain work.  One of the best toys that's educational/mind bending (at least for a 7 mos old), inexpensive and pvc free.  LOVE IT!	
1. 	This gate is sturdy and easy to install and our ferrets aren't able to find a way through/under/over it! Highly recommend!	
1. 	I love my body pillow.  I got it when I was about 3 months pregnant.  I didn't start using it nightly until I was about 4-5 months along.  It was a little stiff at first.  However, once it was broken it, it was great!  I use it every night!  My husband loves it as well!  He often says that he may buy his own!  It's a great pillow!(I also bought the cover for it.  The cover is pricey, but worth it.)	
1. 	this is so so so worth the cost. it is soo easy to install. totally clear. super strong. baby even likes to look through it so he doesn't cry when I walk to kitchen!!! comes with measuriong strip to show how far apart to put hinges. great	
1. 	I like it so much.I bought because of two great feactures-belt and cushions and it works very good.My baby loves soft cushions and he is safe enough with the belts.It is easy to wash and pack it,I like that it becomes a bag,easy to carry on the shoulder.Great product,recommend everyone.	
- 1	not good for us at all.it spills all over my bag. i don't know what to do with this.i don't like this Sipster cup!	
- 1	This material was so thin that the pattern on the pillow showed through.  It also had a waxy feel which may have been for waterproofing, but not what I wanted.  I have a softer organic cotton cover that I greatly prefer.  Would not buy again.	
1. 	I got really excited over this and anticipated great results when I purchased it before my son was born.  However it was not until my son was about 10 months old that I was able to use it.  He responds much better to the rain and heart sounds.  The other sounds seems to be a little disturbing to him.I must admit that my first review was a 2star rating but I must retract that and state that it is really a matter of timing for each child.  Now it is the quickest way to get him off to sleep.  My son fights sleep so this is a charm for us.To those considering the purchase, be mindful that each child is different and will respond differently to various stimuli.  For me the value of this purchase took almost a year for me to see it.  But I surely do now!My major concern is that the other sounds are not easily discerned and as an adult not comforting. My solution, I just don't use those settings.	
- 1	Works great, but I had to return the first one after five months because the main unit suddenly stopped communicating with the satellite units.  It was apparently a hardware malfunction that is somewhat common among these units.  I returned it and got a second set that has been working fine for about a month.Edit: The transmitter in the main unit of replacement product burned out after ten months. Same deal as the first time: it got turned off after being on for quite a while, and when it was turned back on the transmitter no longer worked.Giving it an updated status of 2 stars because even though it works well and was replaced nicely, neither unit lasted very long.	
1. 	Like the way is set up. Easy to install and very safe for kids and for parents step ahead of preventive an accident.	
1. 	Love these liners have been using for many years with all my kids . never had a problem with them.	
1. 	I got this size up from the 27mm because I started leaking from the bottom of the shield while pumping. I didn't realize it would not only help with the leaks, but it seemed to decrease my pumping time and increase my supply within days. I recommended these to all my large breasted mommy friends. I am very satisfied with the results.	
- 1	Since the first time I ordered these there have been some changes and none of them for the better. The ones I bought in 2011 are still going strong. The ones I just received are already annoying me.The plastic on the new ones is smoother and less stretchy. This means that not only is it harder to grip the end of the tab, it's even more difficult to get the post into the hole to fasten the closure because the hole doesn't stretch around the post as easily.I'll be putting the newer ones on cabinets that are rarely opened so that I don't have to deal with them very often.Packaging: Previously just a slim box, now the slim box has a cardboard front with a plastic insert inside. Unnecessary and wasteful.Great original product, bad changes. :(	
- 1	I have twin daughters. They started eating &#34;solid&#34; food (by which I mean they were spoon-fed purees) around 5 months of age. By about 8 months of age they were able to self-feed small bits of food. By 10.5 months they were able to feed themselves their entire meal. The Nibbler is indicated for children 10 months and up. I tried it earlier based on recommendations from others and my girls both hated it. By the time they reached the designated 10-month point, I tried again several times, but once again, both girls did not want to eat from the Nibbler. At that point, I gave up -- if a baby can self-feed using their fingers why would they need this gimmick?Perhaps your experience will be different if your child isn't self-feeding at 10 months. But, don't buy this product ahead of time presuming it's essential. It's not.	
- 1	we bought it and used it once. what a waste of money! the middle part is too flat and my baby was uncomfortable with the bulky sides.	
1. 	Love this product! My favorite feature is the non-slip material on the feet and on top. It doesn't slide around when my kids climb up and down which was a big concern for me. My kids love it and so do I!	
1. 	Great basic monitor for a great price. Easy to use, well designed, compact for travel. One receiver is all you need. While there's a little bit of white noise in the background, you can still hear baby very clearly. Works better if you plug it in, eats batteries quickly. Not for very far ranges, like if you plan to spend a lot of time in your yard. Great buy.	
- 1	It's nice but I personally think its a bit bulky and heavy for a smaller baby. I have to keep taking him from my nine month old cause he will smash his face with it and cry.	
1. 	It is supposed to have a convenient dispenser bottom. There are two perforations which would be great except they are not shaped like the liners and when you pull them through the bottom they get all scrunched up. Other than that...I love these. I use them with my playtex milk storage rings and connect to my breast pump...so easy to use, put the cap on and refrigerate or freeze. Baby also has less gas with the drop in liners than with the bottles. I stopped using bottles for breast milk and just use these exclusively. I recommend.	
1. 	I just  happened upon this listing one day, I don't even know how.  It has truly changed my life, simply because it's so convenient and USEFUL.  Before, we had the flat thingy pressed against our round newel post.  I would knock it off every time I bumped into it or hit it in any horizontal way, for the last YEAR.  It wasn't a huge deal until I noticed that the paint on the wall on the other side was starting to chip from the pressure.  Just about that time, I found this thingy. Yep.  TOTALLY changed things.  The Y shape is rather large, so it not only fits on a thin post like in the picture.  Our post is about 3&#34; diameter and I know the Y would fit over a larger post as well.  Probably up to about 4&#34;?	
1. 	Delivered as promised. Not toss away cups. Easy to wash and reuse! Still using them and condition is still good. Dish washer safe	
1. 	Fantastic product, totally Houdini proof! Very simple to use, great for the first time parent who have never swaddled a baby before.  Wonderfully soft natural fabric against baby's skin.  My blanket has washed and dried (on a cool setting in my drier) wonderfully.  I'm a great believer in swaddling, especially in the first few months. This has moved onto my list of essentials for baby!!My son slept wonderfully from day one and I put a lot of that down to swaddling him.  Now my daughter is here I have been swaddling her.  She has however become a master Houdini and can break free from almost all my wrappings (and believe me I wrap her tightly!)  The problem is that she is a huge bottom wriggler. As she wiggles she moves the muslin material loosening it and also moving it upwards. This gives my little miss enough room to pull those pesky hands up and out of wrap.  This was driving both me and my daughter nuts as she would wake herself up and then become fretful.  I searched the Internet to see what wonders were available to help and found the Miracle Blanket.  Having road tested this blanket for a couple of week I can say hand on heart it is totally Houdini proof!  My daughter and I love it.  I wish I had found this blanket earlier as it is so easy to use. So much easier than using a muslin.  I will use this wrap until she is ready to move into a grobag.	
1. 	We've had our Jumper now for 3 years.  We first got it when our first daughter was little and she had a ball with it.  She pinched her fingers a few times but that didn't dissuade her from playing in it.  She absolutely loved jumping in it and would giggle and laugh for up to 90 minutes.  We now have another daughter and we're getting the same reactions.  I just put her in it and she started jumping before she was even in it because of her excitement!  There are 3 main benefits to the Jumper.  The first, it strengthens your child's legs because of the constant jumping.  Second, it teaches them balance.  My daughter just stood up and lifted her hands up as if in celebration of getting to play in one of her favorite toys.  Third, it gives parent's a break from having to watch closely to be sure that they don't get into something they shouldn't.  Let's be real for a moment...having a few minutes to not have to worry about your child rolling or crawling to try to get into something is priceless.  As both my daughters were more than happy in it for an hour in the morning and another hour in the afternoon that gave me an extra 2 hours not counting nap time to get other things done that I needed to do including just sitting and taking a rest.  It's just my opinion but I think everyone needs a jumper!The only negative thing about getting a jumper is eventually your child will pinch his/her little fingers.  Other than putting the Jumper is a very wide door this really can't avoided unless you're willing to line the door frame with a towel.  Both of our daughters have pinched their fingers and their reaction was the same, they cried for about 20 seconds and then kept on jumping.  After a couple of small pinches they learned where to keep their fingers and after that they didn't pinch their fingers.	
1. 	I use this to transport my daughters bottles and food to and from daycare and it works very well for me (daughter is 6 months old).It fits 6 Dr. Browns 8oz standard bottles with caps on although it is snug; the wide mouth bottles would perhaps fit 3.I typically have 4 bottles in there and I use silicone name bands around the tops of the bottles which would make 6 bottles almost impossibleThe top zipped compartment is the PERFECT spot for her food and snacks.I have had no issues with the craftsmanship of the item and I don't anticipate it lasting for more than 6 months only because of the kind of abuse it takes.	
1. 	The Summer Infant 2 Sided Panel Extension Kit was exactly was I was looking for. We bought two of the extensions and they work great. They are very easy to install.	
- 1	I don't think I've ever been so dissatisfied with a baby product. Don't buy these.  The lids do not seal, nor do they really stack.  I occasionally use them for puffs or cereal, but even that is risky if you aren't careful.  Totally useless.  Do not bother with these.	
- 1	This towel is very cute, and my 2 year old loves to wear it, and it fits her well.  However, after washing it just once before she used it, the towel developed lots of little pulls and snags and looks worn out and shabby already.	
1. 	These are awesome and keep my girls warm during my jogs.  They love being in the stroller and it has been a really cold winter for Houston, Texas so I wasn't taking them out in the stroller much due to being worried about them being too cold.  These changed that.  I put them in socks, fleece footed pjs, a coat and hat and then into these.  They stay warm and are happy to be out on runs with mommy again.  I cannot speak to how well these work in really cold temps as 30's and 40's is about as cold as it gets here, but these certainly work better than blankets that they just kick off.	
- 1	This is a nice product, and not expensive which is good.  But my baby has never been interested in it.  I use the night light but its a bit too low to rely on it for diaper changing for example.  The sounds are nice and the images projected seem nice too but they do not capture the baby's attention AT ALL. And i'm talking about a very curious baby.	
1. 	I ordered the Navy & Royal & there wasn't much difference in the shades.  I chose these because they are 100% cotton.  They remained soft after washing & fit the crib mattress well.	
- 1	I have been using my pump 5 times a day every day for 4 months.  I thought pumps were made for moms who couldn't nurse, but apparently this pump cannot perform as often as I need it.  We had a strong storm, so I will give the pump the benefit of the doubt and blame the storm for blowing it.  However, my Medela from 1998 also endured being plugged in during power surges and did not blow out.  This Medela model was my favorite.  I loved the easy let down and gentler pumping.  Too bad I WASTED my money on the new model.  Four months of use and now nothing.  It is not even coming on.  AT ALL.  I didn't buy it off Amazon, but I figured I could at least review it here since this is such a trusted site.  I had read that Medela no longer makes the cut as one of the best pumps.  Now I know why.  The machine that is 15 years old still works, and my brand new model doesn't.  I do not recommend this pump.  If you do buy it, plug it into a storm strip and not directly in the wall.  I hope your luck and $260 is better spent than mine.	
- 1	This cot has a support stiffness that is in the material running through the center like where the child's waist would be.  It sticks up higher than the top and bottom of the bed so it is very uncomfortable if the child is lying on their back.  I'm going to find another cot.	
1. 	My 18 month old discovered how to unlock and open the slidding glass door and make her way to the backyard.  This product works like a charm.  You just place on the stationary part of the door and the slidding door is stopped when attemted to be opened.  Even with my adult force I can't get the door open!  We remove it a couple of times a day to let the dogs in/out and it still works.  It is a bit expensive but the alternatives aren't much better and you will have to drill into the door frame.	
- 1	We loved these while they were in the tub, but they can get moldy if you don't pull them up and let them air out once in a while. Well, the first time I tried to remove them from the sides of the tub, one of the suction cups ripped right out of the side, so of course it won't inflate with a gaping hole in the side. I'll return them, but am really bummed. We all really liked those bumpers.	
1. 	These fit our Dr. Brown's bottles perfectly (note, these AREN'T for the wide necks!)  When you take the pieces of out of the bottle (the blue valve and top rubber piece), and you put this cap on, it doesn't leak. So happy we brought these for traveling. You can also put the caps on and shake the bottle to mix the powdered formula and water, then put the rest of the pieces on and voila! No leaks that way.	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs. I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!
