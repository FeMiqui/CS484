- 1	This is not soft and baby wants to play with it. If baby hits head on it, it is very hard and will hurt your baby. Returned this and got a blow up one.	
- 1	Since my son finally started doing #2 on the potty and potty training is going really well, I decided it was time to ditch the pull-ups and move to cotton training pants with a cover.  After reading reviews on covers I decided to order these because of all the great reviews.  Since everyone said they ran big I ordered 2 packs of the large (26-31 pounds) for my 34 pound, 38 toddler.  We had our first accident (using these covers over the gerber training pants)today and urine rolled all down his legs within seconds.  He may as well have worn nothing over the training pants.  I had purchased BRU vinyl covers to use until these arrived and they did not leak at all when he had accidents.  The unopened pack of these is going back.	
- 1	I recently started using these on my 6 month old.  The mouth piece is a little hard to get in place.  The cups do leak when he shakes the cup and they have from day one.  The wash easily and they are holding up nicely to his dropping/banging them. Quick update...These cups leak non-stop I will no longer use them.  The cup leaks with normal drinking not just from when my son wants to bang or drop his cup	
- 1	I was disappointed in these. Unfortunately after being used for a few months in a large rotation these started to tear and fall apart along the seams. I was disappointed because I had heard a lot of good things about FuzziBunz. This has made me hesitant to try their diapers.	
1. 	Ok this item is something that has made life so much easier for us.  Firstly let me say that we tried A LOT of different bottles to find the right suction for my son and went through Avent, Gerber Nuk, Evenflo, Playtex with the liners and eventually settled on Playtex Ventaire.  All these bottles warmed up quickly, quietly and beautifully in this warmer.  It says it takes 5 minutes, for a full 8oz maybe but with a newborn the bottles warm up in next to no time at all.  All you do is just put the water in, snap on the switch, let the bottle sizzle away for a really short while and you can feed with ease.  I keep a small jug of water next to my bed as well in case I need extra I don't have to go to the bathroom to get more.  The water holders are such a bonus as there is no having to get enough light to look inside to see the fill line or anything like that.  It heats pretty evenly and I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a bottle warmer.  We usually just leave the bottles at room temperature, seeing as it's winter, and just warm them from then.  Well worth the money!	
- 1	This is awful. The small holes around the caterpillar and plastic circle that goes around the ball makes the holes underneath very small. It was truly upsetting to have to jump out of the shower because my screaming 9 month old had her finger stuck in one of the holes. I threw it in the trash.	
1. 	My baby used this for a little while but eventually grew to hate being swaddled. The only thing is the material is not wrinkle free so after a while the flaps wrinkle up into narrower dimensions so much so that the swaddle isn't flat. I feel like I'm tying my boy up with cotton ropes. Easily solved by ironing it but you have to do it everytime you take it off and put it back on.	
1. 	I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!	
- 1	If you plan on breastfeeding your baby I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend purchasing a My Brest Friend nursing pillow.  There is no support with a boppy pillow and if you are new to breastfeeding it can be quite a challenge. My baby often times would slip through and i'd have to hunch over to hold him up.  Its extremely uncomfortable and hard on your back and shoulders etc  etc.  Get the My brest friend..you won't regret it!	
1. 	I am using the bigger one more right now since we are using sippies.  In a few days I will also be using it for bottles too.  I like how you have options on which basket to use.  The bigger one holds quit a bit and I have 3 using sippies right now.  Not sure about the round thing.  I think you could use it for just about anything you need it to be.  I haven't had a reason to use it yet.	
- 1	I love the older version of this cup that doesn't change color but could not find it in store so I got this one. First wash on the top rack of the dishwasher and it melted. A very poorly manufactured product.	
1. 	These work very well with a Medela Pump in Style advanced system. We tried the others available on Amazon (in plastic bag, much cheaper and kind of misleading you into thinking they are Medela brand)... these work soooo much better, especially for the high volume &#34;exclusive pumping&#34; needs we have with no breast feeding. Why spend extra time pumping?	
1. 	este articulo fue embalado en una caja inmensa y a al hora de pagar el envio hasta Venezuela salio en 800 bsf. imag&iacute;nense hubiera salido mejor comprarlo aqui, aunque si nos ahorramos algo pero no fue mucho... con los pocos dolares que da cadivi es mejor comprar algo que si valga la pena (que el envio no sea tan costoso)... por otro lado es muy bueno ya que el bebe se divierte mucho con los sonidos y articulos que trae...	
1. 	After hearing a story from a friend about a preschooler turning on all the knobs on the gas stove and then going to bed I began my search for a solution and came across these simply knob covers.  They are easy to install.  You simply slip off your own knobs, install these with the front latch open, then close the case over the knob.  Toddlers can hit the knobs and spin them but they can turn the knobs themselves or accidentally turn on the stove.  They are easy to cook with.  With one hand you can pop open the top cover, reach inside to turn the knob and then close it again.  We have a commercial style oven.  The knobs are a simple, non-intrusive baby proofing tool well worth the investment.	
- 1	Such a cheap item. The projector went out within about a month. We still use it for the lullaby music but had to buy a night light separately which is a huge disappointment..	
1. 	I really like this product.  I put in the Huggies pop up wipes and don't really have any problems.  When the wipes are getting down to the bottom, they sometimes fall through the top so I have to pull them back through.  I re-wet the fresher pad everytime I add more wipes and I've never had dried or browned wipes.  Besides, what baby doesn't like a warm wipe versus a cold one?	
1. 	I bought one of these potties for my 18 month old and it is fantastic!  I just bought another one to use in the other bathroom.  It doesn't move around like the other potty seats she has used.  Would definitely recommend!	
1. 	This hamper is so cute and goes very well with the Osh Kosh &quot;Bears Bears Everywhere&quot; border, valences, and bedding set that we picked out.  I like that it folds up easily, and that the inside liner comes out to use like a laundry bag.	
1. 	These are nice bath toys. They float reliably and are colorful and engaging for my 6 month old daughter. I've also started using them at mealtime- she plays with them rather than trying to grab the spoon, then they either wash off super easy or go in the tub with her.	
1. 	I live in Minnesota and babysit my nephew on a part time basis. He is carted across town to my house a few afternoons a week. Little baby's mom and dad work for the police department and have installed this infant Bundle Me into his car seat. It seems completely snug and safe. I'm sure they wouldn't have used it if they felt is wasn't safe. Baby mama used to be a part of car seat installation/safety events.The back of the cover has lots of notches to accommodate different types of car seats. The plastic zipper will not get cold in winter and the zipper pull is large and bulky - which is a good thing. This is perfect for moms and dads who only have one hand to unzip. Parents are pros at doing everything one handed, but it helps when designers accommodate this need.My only compliant is I wish the zipper itself was made of a hard plastic instead of metal. This is intended for use in the winter and metal gets cold.A wonderful product to use in cold weather climates.	
- 1	We have a Britax convertible car seat which is huge but it fit perfectly. It's simply a bag that makes it easy to transport your car seat and keep it clean. The back pack straps are a cool feature and we liked that it had wheels, however; we are returning it. When we first used it, the zipper broke and the teeth pulled a part which added to the stress of flying with an infant for the first time.We're going to try to search for another brand that our car seat may fit in. If we can't find one, we'll just use the big plastic bags the airline can provide to put it in.	
1. 	I really didn't want to go the seperate potty route as our bathroom is tiny as it is.  This was a good compromise, it's stores fairly flat and takes less than a second to put up.  My daughter loves the 'ladder' idea.  Only drawback so far is that the non-slip grooves on the step are a bit deep so she's reluctant to step up when she's barefoot.	
- 1	We ony got this nipple because it's compatible with the bottles that are compatible with Ameda breast pump machines. All of the other nipples we are aware of are medium to fast flow. We mistakenly thought that this was a slow flow nipple.[Good]The sturdiness of the nipple itself: Which competing products, the nipple bends and our baby just ends up playing with it leading to bad breast feeding and twisting while feeding. With this nipple, it's so sturdy that it keeps our baby still instead of constantly twisting and moving his head and body.Cool Looking: Pretty high tech in terms of initial impressions.[Bad]Fast flow: Yes the initial flow is slow. The baby needs to build suction. However once flow starts, it ends up flowing way too fast. It's so fast that our baby ends up choking multiple times during a feeding. This is anything but natural. About 30 minutes later, our baby has thrown up his milk. This hasn't happened with the cheaper nipples.Air Intake Prevention: This is no different from the a cheaper nipple.Price: Given its big flaw, it doesn't deserve the price premium. It is way too much.[Verdict]This is not a breast milk feeding nipple. Real breasts do not drown babies in milk. Do not buy.	
- 1	I got this for my evenflo sureride 65. The base of the seat has a slanted part so none of the bottom rested on the car seat transporter's base. The make also didn't seem very strong. There is no way on the manufacturer's website to find out if it would actually fit your car seat, short of buying and trying. We ended up with the magna [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVVSDU/]] personal cart (cheaper at costco) with a much deeper base that fit our seat nicely! It's also good because I can use it for a myriad of other uses, not just transporting the carseat.	
1. 	Awesome hand pump. Very easy to use and clean. Great for pumping On a regular basis or for expressing milk when engorged. Medelas high quality as usual for a great price! Love it!	
1. 	I bought these when my daughter was in the nicu and I was exclusively pumping for her. I had Raw, cracked, and sometimes bleeding nipples from it. These were a godsend. I actually just passed them off to my best friend who just had her baby and was having similar issues (is that gross? Oh well).	
1. 	I thought there would be a connector to it so it made it longer when inserting it into the other part to pump. The neck line of the tube is very small. Thank you for your product.	
1. 	We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. She loved this seat and so do we. It allowed her to be in the same room as all of us and be able to be at our level (on the floor) while we played games with her brother. Our 3 year old son also loves it. He of course uses it as a rocking chair. Its a very versatile gift :)	
- 1	This was okay for the price. It's nice that they sell this trial pack, so I didn't make the mistake of buying a bunch of them. The prefolds that came in this set are small. Unless your baby is tiny, you won't be able to fold them around your baby (we usually wrap prefolds and flats around her and use Snappis to hold them in place), only fold them in thirds. The diaper cover is a one-size. It comes loose around my DD's legs all the time and is a bit smaller than her Thirsties Duo Wraps (also the adjustable size with snaps). The cover is very flimsy. I also have more leaks and blow-outs with the cover, even if I use a better diaper. Bottom line:  This set stays at the bottom of my stash for emergencies.	
1. 	At first I was a little skeptical of these bibs they were so light I didn't know if they were going to be waterproof. However, I was quickly proven wrong. These are tough bibs that are wonderful! We've been using these 3 times a day for the past several months and they haven't shown any signs of wearing.Pros:- Waterproof- Bib covers a lot of area, mine covers my little girls shoulders. Which is awesome for messy days.- Durable construction, the Velcro hasn't shown any signs of wearing- I keep one in my diaper bag, it folds up so easily and small I sometimes forget I have it.- It is great at restaurants, I'm not always worried that she will get food all over her because it is a bigger bib.- Cleans easily; I throw them in the wash and then air dry them.Cons:- NoneI waited to get these because I was on the fence about them. My cousin owned one for her little girl and it was amazing! I had to get these because my previous bibs were not working all that great. I would also purchase these for a new mom's baby shower, these would make an excellent baby gift!	
1. 	I bought these for my great granson & his mother is very pleased with them. very easy to use. It helps not having to wash a dirty bottle, just simple to clean.	
1. 	These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands).  I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack.  I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns.  My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with MONKEY BOY or POWER DROOLER all over them.  They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials.  To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars.  You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby.  Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin.  Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin.  Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.	
1. 	The gate is great and works perfectly! Go ahead and buy a set of longer screws or anchors to install with the gate. We have two of these, and ended up having to do that to both of them after they came out of the wall when opening!	
- 1	I wish I had spent the extra money and bought a better brand.  This one was hard to put together, is hard to adjust the incline and is just much flimsier than I was expecting.  My mother in law has one at her house that's a different brand and I should have just bought that, it was only about $20 more.	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. These work alright but started tearing in the wash after the second wash. I previously bought OsoCozy wipes and have been using them for over a year (they look exactly the same) and almost none of them have torn up with frequent washing (I use these as diaper wipes). I would never buy this brand again and would pay double for the OsoCozy that won't fall apart immediately. My mistake!	
1. 	We purchased this to place around our brick hearth, in advance of our child learning to crawl. This product has not been tested by our infant yet, but it's probably safe to say that he will be able to pull this loose. That said, my take on this product is that it is meant to cushion the edges of the hearth in the event he were to fall towards the hearth. I don't think this product was intended to be repeatedly pulled at or played with by infants, so I was a bit surprised to see so many reviewers complain that their children could easily pull this loose. Of course they can pull it loose! It's foam adhered to an extremely porous surface with some double-sided adhesive! My question is why are these folks letting their children play with the material that was installed specifically to protect their children from an area that was dangerous enough to begin with that it required said padding to be installed?? THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOOD PARENTING THAT WOULD TEACH YOUR CHILD THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE OFF LIMITS.As for the product installation, it was easy enough. I found it helpful to place each adhesive/velcro strip so that it would make contact only with the brick itself, and avoided placing where it would have to adhere to the mortar, since the mortar on our fireplace hearth is slightly indented and thus below the level of the brick, where the strips could more easily make and maintain contact. After letting set for 12 hours, I did attempt to remove the padding to see if the bottom velcro strips would remain adhered to the brick. It didn't. Again, this is not a huge issue, because I'm not really sure why we would want to temporarily remove the padding, leaving behind 2 dozen little velco strips on the hearth. All in all, I'm pleased with the appearance and installation of the product.	
- 1	I returned this item after I realized all the parts didn't come apart to allow for thorough cleaning.  It seemed very cheaply made.  For the price, I would expect something a little more practical and sturdy.	
- 1	This cup leaks and the lid doesn't screw on well after awhile. I won't buy it again. You get what you pay for.	
- 1	These were a disappointment.  It was much too hard for my son to get any liquid from them at all.  it did turn out to take a huge amount of effort, but without the valve, the spill completely.  I will put them away and maybe try them again when he is a bit older.	
- 1	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own. However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing. We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles. Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion. The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby. Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET! Pass on these...don't believe the hoopla.	
- 1	I have a two year old and a one year old who alternate between mildly curious and intent upon opening cabinets with grown-man like strength!  I bought several cabinet latch products to see which ones would not only be easy to install but also actually do the job of baby-proofing the kitchen.The other reviews are correct; this product may look complicated to install, but is quite simple.  It actually gives you the option of using the adhesive tape, or screwing the product in or both.  I really wanted mine to hold up, so I peeled off the backs and then screwed them in as well.  THEY STUCK!The problem is the latch mechanism itself.  I could open the cabinet with little force when the it was in lock mode.  There are two pieces of plastic that are supposed to essentially grab each other to keep the cabinet closed.  They slide right past one another, so my kids would be able to open the cabinets even when not really trying.I'm pretty upset I tried a product so expensive that I just ended up throwing away.The other products I bought that were similarly worthless were:Safety First Wide Grip LatchesSafety First Press and Pivot LatchesEspecially for Baby Cabinet and Drawer LatchesI HIGHLY recommend:  Safety Innovations, Spring Loaded Cabinet and Drawer Latch, 4 packSuper easy to install, (just one piece to screw in), and a Sumo wrestler on drugs couldn't get into the cabinets.	
1. 	We bought this as a gift for a nephew. At the low price, I was worried it wouldn't be well-made or sturdy enough to last. I was wrong. After assembling this (which was quite easy, took about 20 minutes), the final product came out strong, sturdy, and great-looking. Everyone that saw it was impressed with its appearance. It will take wear and tear, the hair is surprisingly high quality, and our nephew loved it! Hard to find a long-term heirloom for under $100, but this qualifies for sure.	
- 1	Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside	
1. 	Very soft and comfortable for baby. Has held up well despite countless washes! Def buy 2 so one is always ready to replace the dirty one.	
1. 	My wife uses this blanket everytime she takes our girl to the park.  It is easy to set up and easy to put up.  The velcro matches up everytime, with other blankets they never match back up after you unroll them.  We took the blanket to the beach this year on vacation, it worked very well and did not pick up any sand.  The carrying strap makes it easy to handle while be preoccupied with a little one.	
- 1	Look for 100% cotton towels and skip these 80/20 cotton/poly blends.  They're not as fluffy as aden+anais towels, and they're super thin, so they're not warm either.  And because they're thin, they don't last in the washes as well either.	
1. 	... the rest of the items were!  I just can't seem to get enough suction out of the aspirator for it to work.It has everything you need, and the carrying case isn't bulky.  It really is a good investment!	
- 1	This fan is just ok.  I like how the blades are foam, because they are safe, just in case my baby wants to grab at it, but you pretty much have to get in the blades to feel ANY breeze at all.  She likes to look at it....that's about it.  Plus, it drains batteries quickly.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.	
- 1	There is not enough shape to the nipple part.  Combined with the heaviness of the plastic, baby can't latch on to it, and if she does - it falls right out because of the weight.  I would have expected much better for the price.  I use only MAM now, but I can imagine just about any other pacifier would be better than these.  I gave an extra star because they do seem made well, but functionally, these are only a 1 star.	
1. 	We've had this turtle for four years and it's still working, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of similar products we've tried. I love everything about it: the design, the true-to-sky constellations, the three light choices, the auto off feature. Perfect for a nursery or an older child who's afraid of the dark!Update: We let a battery leak and it killed our turtle :(It was only 5 years old and I know it could have lasted much longer!We got the ladybug version for our LO and love it as much as the turtle!The colors are different than the turtle. It lights red, purple and green (the turtle had orange, blue and green lights).The light seems to be much brighter, but it could just be that the batteries are new.We'll be sure to check them regularly to make sure they don't leak.	
- 1	I was really excited to get these.  They seem like the perfect solution for child safety and ease of use, and I have to admit, the sliding covers work great... they spring back into place as soon as you remove the plug.  Unfortunately, these covers are smaller than standard covers and do not actually cover the hole in the wall around most of my outlets.  Even the ones that are fully covered would require a paint job to make up for the newly exposed section of wall.  In my opinion, this problem is just laziness (or greediness?) on the manufacturer's part and could have been a very easy adjustment for them to make.In short, before you buy these, check underneath all your outlet covers and ensure you have at least ONE EXTRA CM of space all the way around that can be exposed without requiring a lot of touch-up, or worse, revealing a hole in the drywall.	
1. 	I did not originally sign up for this item; it was given to me along with a box of 6 4-oz Avent bottles at my baby shower. I really like this product; according to the sterilizer's instructions regarding my microwave wattage, it only takes 2 minutes to sterilize and 2 minutes to cool down. I've never had any issues with getting burned or anything melting. And all it takes is 7 oz of water (I use filtered water instead of tap water) that I recycle every 2-3 uses to avoid wasting water(beyond that the water level decreases so it's best to measure to make sure it's still 7 oz).However, I have a gassy baby and wanted to see if I could switch to the Born Free bottles since several of my friends have raved about them. My 1 month old daughter is drinking 4 oz now, so I bought the 9 oz Born Free bottles and unfortunately they do not fit this sterilizer. She seems to be growing out of the stage of being fussy all night long due to gas so I guess I'll stick with the Avent brand bottles instead of buying a new sterilizer to accommodate using a different brand of bottles.	
- 1	Not very smooth. We bought another that is one third the price that rocks so much better.  Do not buy	
1. 	This chair is nice to get if you have a larger baby (like my son) who quickly outgrows smaller playseats.  He didn't like to sit in it for too long, because there's a hard, board seat without too much padding.  He did like the toys pretty well, but sometimes got frustrated when he couldn't pull them towards himself more (mainly to chew on).  The toys are detachable and can be used seperately when the child gets older.The kickstand feature is nice for securing the seat to put baby in it, or to stabalize for young infants.  Never used the calming vibrations feature.  Fairly easy to assemble (and disassemble, when it needs to go into storage).	
- 1	We bought this for our 2Y old and our 7M old.  Here's the bad:  This stroller is NOT lightweight in my opinion.  Once you put the thing together, it is very heavy, big and not easily stowed in the back of our SUV (a Honda CRV) - it's pretty long and cumbersome.  The handle is really high so this stroller would better suit someone over 5'10&#34; I'd say.  The seat in the back is not very comfortable for my son bc our 7M old needs to have the seat in front slightly reclined, which puts the bar right in the back of the 2Y old sitting in the back seat.  The canopy can't cover both of them - pick one to be shaded only!  The basket is under the seats and you can technically access it from the sides of the stroller, but the only thing you can put in there that way is a bottle of water...then how do you get it out?  The brakes are not easy to apply - you really have to put some pressure on there for them to lock in.  The front seat is HUGE - my daughter was swimming in it.  I can't see how you could safely put a 3M old in this stroller, which is the lowest age advertised.  The maneuverability isn't great either.The good:  Very easy to assemble and sturdy and it's probably perfect for 2 toddlers or a toddler and a young child. Easy to fold and easy to unfold.  Price was great for a double.We really wanted to like this stroller but it's just not for us for now.  This better suits someone with older babies who is very tall and doesn't need to load this in the car daily.	
1. 	I am sure other swaddle wraps would have done the same, but i chose to buy this because its soft and its cheaper than most others. We used it for maybe 2-3 mths and he grew out of it.Did its job, most definetly soft. The young lady who takes care of my son also complimented how soft and cuddly that microfleece was.	
1. 	These are comfortable to hold and make it easy to cut my baby's nails without cutting them too short or struggling to hold onto the tiny clippers.	
1. 	It's all been said I think - these work amazingly well and I haven't second guessed this purchase once for use in our baby's room.  The ONLY annoyance I have with them is the power indicator light which is pretty bright.  We just taped over it and problem solved.	
- 1	Was so excited about it, but never used it. Just didn't seem like a good buy. It may work, but for me it was a totally unnecessary purchase.	
1. 	I love the peace of mind this jumper gives my husband & I.  We no longer have to worry about the jumper falling off the doorway.  Our baby girl loves it too.  She has been in it since she was 4 1/2 months old.  I love the different height adjustments.  It does fold up, but it's a joke.  I didn't knock off a star because I know that this isn't really meant to be portable.  I wish it were, but I would suggest buying a normal doorway jumper if you want to take one with you as long as you aren't going to be using it a lot.	
- 1	I'm pretty sure I have a standard-sized doorknob, and this thing did NOT work well. It was impossible to lock & unlock the door with this thing on it.It seemed too big for my doorknob. We had to remove it.	
1. 	Bought the 6 pc one, and it's kind of small when all connected so I use this open as a blocker. The gate is difficult to open, you have to lift the hand and pull it apart and that gets kind of tricky. Either than that this serves its purpose	
1. 	Other than the marbles rolling around in my skull, I'm no expert on rattles. The Bright Stars Grab and Spin seems like a good one though.  I like that the toy is multidimentional with rattling beads encased in hard transparent plastic, a rolling wheel, sliding charms on the handle and bright colors. Also nice is that the charms on the handle are made of a softer material than the hard plastic elsewhere to make any chewing safer and more comfortable for baby.Our thre-month-old grandson enjoys grabbing his rattle by the handle and shaking for all he is worth, a big, broad smile reflecting his enjoyment. For the money I'd say this rattle is a bargain.	
- 1	If each section could be made a bit deeper (while still keeping the fill line at the appropriate height), the milk would be less likely to spill out of each section.  Also, if the lid would somehow snap on, that would make transportation easier.  If the container was airtight, that would also improve the product.	
- 1	I have a problem with leaking. Simply wet diapers do not leak through, but diapers that have been dunked / sprayed always leak for me. My Planet Wise bags don't do this. I will continue to use this bag as a laundry bag only.	
- 1	I never felt like baby was really secure in this wrap. I watched all the tutorials and did everything right but I couldn't not have a hand on her or she'd feel really unstable. She also hated the way it held her body, I think it was much more uncomfortable than a Moby or Ergo carrier. It also pulled awkwardly on my one shoulder and was not comfortable at all.	
1. 	These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields. I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable. I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort. I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher a few times, too and they distorted a little but it didn't really affect their use.	
- 1	This aspirator dont sucks well, and the the part that goes to the nose, fell apart when you squeeze. Go for the pigeon nasal aspirator if you want a great option!	
- 1	Let me start by saying: the idea is genius. Too many kids are using sippy cups for way too long.  It's a nasty habit and gross to see a 4 year old walking around sipping milk from a sippy.  Milk and juice beverages should be drank at the table, not wandering the house.  That said, this helps kick that habit and offers a little extra security with the lid.The bad:  it leaks.  Leaks. Leaks.  Mason jars are cheap and non toxic. No chemicals no stinky plastic. My kids don't throw their cups so I'm not concerned about breakage but, they're also durable in case of a fall.  But this lid?  Leaking disaster. What a waste of $11!!!  I mean a cheap plastic lid shouldn't cost that much it I was willing to fork out the extra cash for something good. Nope that was a bad idea.I the end, we just serve our kids their drinks at the table, with no lid, in a mason jar (small 8oz size). It's less of a mess without the EIO lid than with it.  The lid makes a dribbling mess everywhere.Don't waste your money. Just teach your little ones to drink from a cup the old fashioned way whenyoufeel they're ready.	
1. 	This is an excellent tub. I tried one of the seats first, which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable. Second I tried another tub, I wish I could remember which one to warn you, but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its no slip surface.Finally I tried the EuroBath. Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it. Its great for itty bitty babies, big babies, and even small toddlers. I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge. If you lack storage space, this can be annoying, but its definitely worth it.	
- 1	After receiving 3 of the newborn size Halo SleepSack Swaddles and loving them, we decided to purchase 2 of the size small version because our daughter quickly grew out of them.  The first time we used them, her breathing sensor went off because she had stopped moving (had not stopped breathing, thankfully), because the swaddle cloth was up over her mouth and nose! We were terrified and thought that possibly we hadn't wrapped the swaddle tight enough, but for her next nap, we wrapped more tightly (much more than we ever had to do with the size small) and watched her closely as she slept.  Slowly but surely, the cloth wiggled its way up towards her face as she moved in her sleep. We immediately removed her from the swaddle and returned them. Now we still use the newborn size, but don't zip the bottom all the way and let her bottom and legs stick out. It looks silly, but it's much safer. I have no idea why the newborn size doesn't ride up and the size small does, but we aren't taking chances with our daughter!	
- 1	It's impossible to suck water out of this cup! Got this on sale at Target and now I know why... very disappointed. There are much better sippy straw cups out there!	
1. 	I bought one of these for both my house and lake house. I love this product it stores everything neatly and the sides come off if you don't need them for ointment and stuff. I love this product.	
1. 	Let me preface this by saying I didn't put this on my shower gifts as I thought that this was a waste of money.  With that attitude and frame of mind ...I got this as a shower present 2 years ago and have used it happily since then with no problems whatsoever.  I would highly recommend it.  It does it's purpose of keeping the wipes warm, esp in the winter.  I'm realistic about my expectations.  For the price, I think it would have been worth it to purchase on my own.--To note, I don't always change the pillow as your supposed to (I think only 4 times in the past 2 years) but there is usually always water in it.--If you run the pillow under water and work the hardness out it seems to lengthen the use.  I have not had any problems with the lid.--After a few weeks, I actually purchased a rack to put this on as the bottom does get warm and I didn't want it to hurt his dresser top (which doubles as a changing table).--Are the last few wipes brown?  Yes, but there are trade offs.  It's also because the pillow hasn't been changed so partially my fault.--No problems with the lids.--I use mostly pampers wipes as I didn't not like huggies (too dry).  But I did use huggies since I had purchased some.  I didn't try any other brands so I didn't have any problems with pop-ups like others.  I did my research on wipes before purchasing any and understand the product I was purchasing and if it was compatable with a wipes warmer.  So again, its about realistic expectations for a product.I haven't used any other wipe warming product so I have nothing to compare it to but I'm expecting baby #2 and will probably use this until it breaks and then will purchase a new one.  Also, this has been in continuous use for the past 2 years.	
- 1	This fabric is not good. I borrowed my friend's sleepy wrap and bought the moby thinking it was the same. Wrong! Boba bought out sleepy wrap and it's so much better. Get that one instead! The fabric is stretchier. :)	
1. 	I got this to help ease my back pain. It's true that you can sleep on both your sides when you use it and still support your back but your belly will be squeezed and your legs will get numb of you change sides. The shoulder area is not tight. I had to place a pillow under the head area to relieve the pressure on my shoulders	
- 1	I thought a swing was a newborn MUST, so I bought this one before our little guy was born. I chose it because 1) we have a small apartment and it has a pretty small footprint, and 2) the price is right, and 3) it gets reasonably good reviews.Here are the cons, in my opinion:1) First and foremost, some babies simply don't need a swing to keep them happy. Our baby, as it turns out, doesn't need motion. In fact, he doesn't really like motion all that much.2) The way the seat is with this swing, the baby can't move around much once they're in it. I guess it's probably designed that way in order to be safe, but if your baby likes to kick (like they can in the bouncy seat), they may not like this swing.3) The motion is pretty fast. Even though there are multiple settings, they all seemed basically the same speed, and they all seemed FAST.4) It's portable in the sense that it's not enormous, but it folds only into a slightly smaller shape that when it's not folded. And the shape itself is awkward for putting in a car, etc.If your baby turns out to be one of those babies who NEEDS TO SWING, you'll probably want to invest in a nicer swing. If your baby doesn't need a swing, then don't bother with one at all.	
1. 	We have used this since the birth of our baby and have never had a big problem with it. The sling for a newborn worked well for us, the only thing I didn't like was the second stage, where you remove the clips for the bottom of the sling and just let it sit in the water. It seems like they could have designed this better. I never had a problem with the bump, as when I started using the second stage I would put baby's bottom behind the bump where it should be and shifted the headrest up a but. Once baby could sit up I had no problems at all. My child is now 15 months and still fits in the tub. The toys that come with the tub are also very nice. Our favorites are the pelican and the starfish.	
- 1	I couldn't use this and had to return it due to the fact that the straps aren't adjustable. The part of my crib that it wraps around to attach is thicker and because of this the straps don't even come close to closing. Not all cribs are the same so having straps that aren't able to be adjusted is bad design.	
- 1	These don't really need to be purchased to go with the 6x6 mat.  If you do order, be sure to get enough pieces to go around the whole mat.  Also, our 11 month old found a corner part today and began to chew on it.  It comes off easily and can be swallowed.  If the playard is over the mat she did not notice the mat can come apart yet.  I probably would not purchase the edges and corners for the playmat.  The playmat looks great without them.	
- 1	The picture for this product is deceiving. I thought the fabric was smooth. I is actually a cheap feeling scratchy and abrasive type material. I wouldnt want it on my bare skin. I tried my son in it once and he screamed hysterically and I haven't used it since. Its too bad because its a great size and constructed well. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use it.	
- 1	I wanted some way to wear my baby that would be comfortable for both of us.  A few friends recommended moby and moby style wraps, so I got this with high hopes.  My son and I both found it cumbersome, hot, and constricting.  Maybe we weren't doing something right, but he hated.*There are SO many layers of material, once you finally manage to get the damned thing on properly, that the both of you will be sweating like proverbial professional women in a church before long.*Actually getting the thing ON is way too much like work, and if you want to nurse in it, it takes even more finagling and adjustment. I never managed to successfully nursed in my moby wrap.  It could be that I am too well endowed to nurse in a wrap, but the way the wrap squashed my son against me made it impossible for him to nurse without having his entire face mashed into my breast.  Suffocation is not exactly a positive side effect of breastfeeding.*On the subject of squashing, I never managed to find a happy medium for this thing.  Either we both felt constricted, or it was too loose for me to feel confident wearing it.  My son wasn't, I guess, normal in the constriction department.  Rather than being soothed by swaddling and confining wraps, he would throw an absolute conniption.I think some of our issues may have been worked out with practice, but the thing is so time consuming to put on and arrange, and I was so sweaty and tired after wrestling with the wrap and the baby, plus the wrap at the waist pressed directly into my c-section which was unpleasant for quite some time after I was (per the doctor) healed enough for normal activity, that I just didn't have the patience to keep trying at it.  My baby threw a fit every time he was in it, and that stressed me out completely.  I just didn't have the stamina for this  method.He did like a sling carrier when he was very young.  He was a very long and large baby (22 in at birth), so the sling didn't last long before that started to make him feel constricted as well, and a sling isn't as secure as the moby, which was a drawback for actually accomplishing much in the way of errands and/or chores while wearing the baby... which kind of was the whole purpose.I finally hit on something that did (and does) work for us.  It's a mei tai, or Asian Baby Carrier.  I found a free tutorial online, and it was a screaming success.  I am NOT an accomplished seamstress by any stretch of the imagination, but this was pretty simple construction, and only took a couple hours to put together, one the pieces had been cut.  Hip carry isn't very comfortable for us, but front and back carry are incredibly comfortable.  My husband has 3 ruptured discs in his lower back, and even he can carry our son in the mei tai for short periods.  I can get it on and off in under 2 minutes.  There are no complicated wrappings, twistings, or turnings.  My son's legs are free, and he can get his arms in and out if he wants to, which makes him very happy.  He's content to hang out in the mei tai for longer than I'm content to wear him.  He weighs 30 lbs now, so he's quite a load, but the mei tai lets me carry him with very little effort.  I can even squat, bend (with care, I mean gravity does still work), wash dishes, make the beds, I've even put on my shoes with him in the mei tai with no problems.Of course, everyone is different, so what works for us may not work for someone else, and it seems quite a lot of people love the moby.  We didn't.	
1. 	Our daughter is 32 months old (two years) and I bought this potty for her to use. My mother in law bought one too, I suppose she was trying to help, but it wasn't as good as this one. I strongly prefer it over almost all the potties locally available. The reason I like it so much is that the cup is under the seat and not part of the seat. The one my mil bought has the cup as an inset into the top and when my little girl sits on it, it sticks to her bottom and well, I'm sure you can guess what happens when she has used it...Unfortunately she stood on the lid of the potty and the seat cracked and I thought it best to get another, to keep her from getting pinched in the crack, but when I went back to the store to get another, they didn't have this version any more. The one they did have, that I got, is not as simple, now that I know I can get this potty here I will probably buy another.The only flaw, that is not the fault of the potty, is that we have the elongated toilet bowls and most potty seats that can be set on the toilet only work with the round toilets. We currently have four potties for our daughter, two here, and one each at my mothers and his. All four are different.Fisher-Price Royal Pottyis at my mothers house and I like it a lot, it too has the cup under the seat.	
1. 	Tried an Eddie Bauer mirror and it didn't work very well. This one is great, lots of adjustability to get the right angle so you can really see your baby. Also limited amount of image distortion unlike some mirrors that seem to give the fish eye effect. It gives a good full view of my baby too, not just her face. Overall, definitely recommend!	
- 1	I was really excited for the Skip Hop Elbow Rest. We currently use the very popularAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Bluebut I don't like how bulky and difficult it is to stow away between baths. This elbow rest seemed to solve all of my problems, it even has a handy loop to hang it up.Out of the package I was excited to see that it has Velcro to keep the side flaps tucked together when not in use. It also has a nice, thick pad to protect parents' elbows.Unfortunately, that is where my excitement ends. I have sliding shower doors and the flaps of the elbow rest aren't long enough to reach over the door tracks and attach to the tub wall. The elbow pad itself is only 16 inches long (6.5 inches shorter than theAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue). For me the elbow rest has two functions. To keep my elbows comfortable and more importantly to protect my son from the shower door tracks if he slips in the tub. This doesn't come close to covering the edge of the tub. I don't expect it to cover the entire tub but 1/3 of it would be nice. On the flip side are a total of 3 suction cups. 1 on the tub side and 2 on the parent side. My sons likes to take apart everything, I doubt that is enough suction cups to keep it securely attached to the tub when a toddler is involved.If I were Skip Hop I would add at least 4 inches to the length, 1 inch to each of the flaps, and more suction cups. Then they would have the perfect elbow rest.I've added photos to the customer images section. Check them out and please let me know if you find them helpful! Thanks!	
- 1	The good thing about this ink is the color. I should have used washable marker. This stuff smears very easy I couldnt get a good print and wont come off ANYTHING, clothes or hands. I would think twice before using this again.	
1. 	This item lost one star because of lack of instruction when putting together.  If you take some time and think about it though you can get it togehter.  The instructions need to be rewritten though.  I did buy this for my son and it's pretty girly but he likes it and the colors are unisex.  It's just flower themed.  I would have bought the circus one for him instead if it had been in stock.  Otherwise it seems pretty sturdy and once put together moves well.	
1. 	I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker. From the reviews I read this one looked like it had everything that one needs to write down and remember, so I bought it. I have not used it but I am very happy with what I saw. Hope it ends up being as useful at it looks.	
- 1	To tell the truth, I thought the gear shift on the side that makes sound would be a great incentive for my son to use the potty.  When you would go he could flush his potty and make car sounds.  That never happened, it became a toy long before he decided to go potty.  It would leak.  No matter what we did, have him sit, stand, whatever it would get under the gray seat, go along the top of the bowl insert, and ultimately end up pooling over floor.  The lid broke off so we ended up putting the lid under the potty to catch any urine that would leak under so I could wash that instead of the whole bathroom floor  all day long.  It also made it taller so it was easier for my son to sit down on it.  As a step stool both my son and daughter use it all the time to get to the sink and wash their hands.  It did fit great into the adult toilet.  It locked in tight so that I didn't have to worry about it coming out when my son got off of the big potty.  I gave it a two star because of the leaking problem.I went and got the munchkin arm and hammer potty for my little girl, though she hasn't gone potty in it yet, just looking at the design I now wish I had gotten that instead when my son was training.  I would have saved some money on both another potty and all of the cleaner I had to use from cleaning up leaks.	
1. 	These membranes are great. If you're pumping it's good to always have extras on hand. If you find your pump losing suction, replacing the membrane is often the trick to fixing it.	
- 1	I have this product installed in my Prius, and it does not stay attached to the headrest- at all.  I am having to readjust it every 2-3 car rides.  Usually when I look in the backseat this mirror is crooked or has fallen to the side.  Would not recommend.	
1. 	love it. has 3 different color modes. found same product in stores but at least no sales tax and shipped to home. very soft and cute. makes great nightlight. only bad thing is that it turns off after 15-30 minutes, would like it if it stayed on all night.	
1. 	I haven't tried this with my newborn yet, but I used this sling ALL THE TIME with my other baby!  I had my last two babies close together (13 months apart), and toward the end was stuck with a baby who couldn't walk while I was in my very uncomfortable third trimester.  This sling was a LIFESAVER.  It has enough length/slack that I could put my baby in (she was about 10 months the first time I used it)and adjust the sling so that she was not sitting right on my stomach. It's also VERY easy to get on and off, especially off.  Removing a baby sling, whether a baby is in it or not, seems to always be the hard part.  This sling comes off easy as a wink, and if you have your baby in it, it's just as easy.  The padded shoulder is also a very nice perk, and it pads nicely without adding a lot of bulk.I am looking forward to using this sling again, and will be getting on the maker's website soon to see how to carry my newborn in it safely. I'd absolutely recommend it to a mom needing a sling.  I've tried several different styles and brands, and this is so far my favorite!	
- 1	This thermometer consistently disappoints, and the last thing I want when my child is potentially running a fever is second guessing the results of a thermometer.  I ended up buying a simple rectal thermometer, and have used that with great success.  This one would say no probe was attached (when one was on), wouldn't register a reading, or would register a reading that was clearly wrong.  A huge disappointment for a relatively expensive thermometer.	
- 1	These were different than what came with my bottle starter package and I hate these. The sponge comes off after first use. I bought them twice thinking maybe the first one was defective but had same problem.	
1. 	Received two gingham sheets.  Nice understated pattern.  I'm happy with the quality.  They keep baby cool during the horribly long AZ summers.	
1. 	If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!!	
- 1	I borrowed the bag from a friend to use on a short  1 hour flight.  The fabric is horrible and already has weak points and holes from one flight. On my return flight, the weak points became more holes.My two cents as a product developer - I believe they use a 400 denier which is really weak and flimsy coupled with a light PU coating.  They should have used a 600D in order to handle all the wear and tear a trip through the airport will have. I can't believe they charge as much as they do because to produce it probably only cost in the range of $4-$7Bottom line - save your money and buy something with a heavier weight fabric	
1. 	This bath tub is very functional & cost efficient..considering you can use this for a very long time (just DON'T use chemicals to clean it/ USE Organic Cleaners!) All you would need is a little pad to put under baby's butt or back..everything else it perfect! It is a little on the Big side...so if you have a small place, I would invest in something a little smaller...GO TO [...] they have this bath tub & another one that is a little smaller, so you can actually hide it under a cabinet & not keep it out in th open all the time because of how big it is :) Just nail it to the wall (back of door) like I did :)	
- 1	This was a gift.  While I've seen other kids enjoy these, it didn't work in our household.  We made our own baby food and I guess it wasn't smooth and thin enough because I could never get food through the whole in the spoon.  Also, it was really hard to fill.  Nice idea, but didn't work for us.	
- 1	I read the previous reviews on these pacifiers and bought a dozen of them.  Word of advice- don't.My son will NOT use them.  In fact, he hates them.  He only likes the MAM pacifiers.	
1. 	We started using these when our daughter was 6 months old. It took her a bit to get used to them, but now at 10 months old she is a pro. They don't leak and they are easy for her to grab and hold on to. So far, so good!	
- 1	My son has bathed with these toys since he was an infant. I wish someone had told me that exposure to latex (which is natural rubber) can make people develop a latex allergy. He now has a latex allergy at the age of two. I would not recommend these toys to my worst enemy.	
- 1	This thing is so tiny, I think it must be 3&#34; total across.  You would think that the underside would be covered in rabbit material, but no.  The underside and top side, behind the ears, are just a little blue block.  This cover you see only covers all sides, but not top or bottom of the blue block that is supposed to be the ice pack.  It's a hard blue square and once  you freeze it, the block will be come extremely cold with frost on it.  So tell me, who wants to put a frozen plastic block on your child?  I thought that was the point of this thing.  To have it be an ice pack for boo boos?  How can that be if it's open with no cover??  Would you get an ice pack from your freezer and put it skin to skin??  No.  So why would we put this little frozen plastic square skin to skin on our baby??  This company needs to toss this design and get the rabbit material on the underside to protect baby's skin!!!!Also, it's so damn small, it's like the size of a mouse at Petco.  Unless you plan on using it sideways, you will give your baby freezer burn in no time at all.  I am returning this for a refund, STUPID IDEA.	
1. 	I used these VentAire bottles for the first time two years ago, and I'll never use a standard bottle again.  The bent angle took some getting used to, but it does encourage a more upright feeding position, which is now recommended to reduce ear infections (which it did in my case).  But more than that, the venting system built into these bottles is like magic.  It's very noticeable if you've ever feed a baby with a standard bottle before that the VentAire bottle are so much better for your baby's tummy.This is a nice set because of the size variety, and the slow and fast flow nipples are great too, although it's quite a shock to your baby the first time you switch to fast flow :)	
1. 	Max is a HUGE hit in my house.  We have him on the carseat/stroller handle, and he is endless fun for the little one.  I put him on just before a plane trip and it kept his attention for so long.Note, the picture has him attached to a green snap - maybe to attach to clothing?  He doesn't come with that - just the yellow elastic loop.	
1. 	We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.	
- 1	I love the shape and height of this pillow, but it's just too soft for nursing. The lack of support causes the baby to slip forward. It's a very light-weight pillow and tends to shift a lot on your lap. Also, the cheap filling tends to bunch up and become misshapen after only a few washes.	
1. 	I really like this seat protector for the infant car seat and base for the bench int he back of my 2005 Infiniti G sedan.  It really protects the leather seats from any indentations.  It is very durable and stiff, and for that I think it protects much better than the other seat covers that I have found in the stores.My only real issue with this product is that it does not seem to grip the bottom of the car seat base at all.  It seems to me that it should be a bit more rubbery rather than plasticky on the top to provide a gripping surface for the base.  I have sort of DIY remedied this by placing a non-skid pad between the seat protector and the base, but it does seem to be a defeating of the purpose, and a bit ugly as I have to be sure it stays in place, so it is a little bit larger than the base.  In hindsight, it could have worked as well to buy some non-skid strips to put on the base itself, but then it would be relying on some kind of adhesive to stay in place.It really is a shame that the company did not test this aspect of the seat base, as otherwise it would be hands down one of the best purchases as an accessory for my child.UPDATE:  10/2013I changed carseats, now I use the Chicco Nextfit, and this protector really is perfect.  I think the base of the Chicco is much grippier, and nothing slides anymore.  It must be something with the Graco bases that cause the sliding around.Disclaimer:  I LOVE THE CHICCO NEXTFIT - if you are looking for a convertible carseat, or toddle seat do yourself a favor and buy the Nextfit.  It is the best.	
- 1	There are eight exposed screws on this Baby Einstein product - I am going to attach a photo to show them.  While our adult fingers can't get in the rattle's holes to grasp or scrape against them, the placement of these screws is easily reached by tiny baby fingers.  My daughter has already gotten her fingernails caught in them once which caused her some pain.  Terrible!I purchased this Rhino Toys one instead which is much better as it is one-piece construction, also soft plastic easily grasped by baby hands - baby loves it and I love it. http://www.amazon.com/Rhino-Toys-81031-F-Oball-Rattle/dp/B00188XW26/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1363012209&sr;=8-1	
1. 	I think this is a great outlet strip cover.  I almost wish I had this before I had kids because it conceals it so nicely and makes the strip look much more tidy.  It's somewhat hard to snap and unsnap together. But that's the point, right?  I would recommend this to anyone looking to either conceal their outlet strips or babyproof their home.	
- 1	I bought this when I was shopping for my unborn baby. He is almost 10 months and I can honestly tell you that I tried to use this product, but it was unnecessary for me and my husband. The concept is great, to electronically time all of these various things (naps, feedings, diaper changes, etc), but it is not as efficient as it seems.Firstly, the battery life is not good. It just eats batteries, even when it is doing nothing. Secondly, even if your newborn has ate just an hour ago and has napped long before that time, it does not mean that your baby is not hungry. This concept applies to diaper changes, feedings, naps, etc.) The only real indicator is your baby... and believe me when I tell you that your newborn will find a way to tell you what he or she wants. Also, since you haven't recorded how long it has been that your baby last slept or how much your baby has last ate (particularly if you are using formula or bottled breast milk), this product really falls short.Honestly, I wanted to love this and use this like some other parents say they had, but it was one of those completely unnecessary purchases we made hoping to make life with a baby easier. This product was frustrating.Me and my husband found that it was easier and more efficient to simply use a notepad. We wear watches, so we just recorded the time of each activity (i.e. what time baby went to sleep and how long he slept , what time baby ate and how much he ate). This product doesn't have a log, so you couldn't possibly look back on the activity throughout the day or week and measure how much baby has been eating and sleeping. It is just a set of different timers.I would not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to anyone. I think the standard notepad is the best option.Also, another option that I think would be great for this purpose is an iphone/ipod/ Smartphone APP called the Similac Smartmoms Baby Journal. It is completely free to download onto any device that reads APPS. It has all the same functions of this device but includes pictures as well as a chance to mark how full baby's diaper was at his last change. Also, it keeps a log of all these activities for a very long time and greats graphs to determine trends. Technology is so great these days. Go on similac.com/app to check it out. I only found out about this app when my son was already 6 months old and I don't really use it, but I think it would be great for new parents and especially better than the Itzbeen Baby Care Timer. Good Luck and Congrats to all you new parents!	
- 1	I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it... but I think it's one of those personal preference things. My son just doesn't like it. We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly. Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer. He LOVES it. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down.	
- 1	I hate this monitor. It is 20 feet from my child's room yet it constantly beeps that it is out of range. The beep is so loud and annoying and it's allllll night long. I've tried plugging both parts into to other outlets but have had no luck. There must be something in our house or neighborhood that causes interference.	
1. 	No where in my research for soothing cracked nipples where these things mentioned.  I heard it from my sister-in-law.  It seems after your 1st kid, your nipples are more sensitive then the first time around.  This helped protect the crack from the baby sucking each time.  You could pump to help solve the problem, but I did not want to do that in the middle of the night when I as already tired.  This made it much easier to deal with at night, and in the day if I was limited on time.  In lieu of the nipple shield, I also recommend the hydrogel pads for a little cooling, soothing protection.  I went 2 months with the cracked nipple, trying other methods I found online, until I was told about this product.  It helped speed up the recovery time!	
1. 	The HALO sleepsacks have been really great products, and we have used them from birth to almost a year, so far.  Most other reviews talk about the awesomeness of the sleepsacks, so I just want to mention one thing- the sleepsacks come in lots of different materials, with different warmth ratings.  These tog warmth ratings are available on halo's website- there are actually even warmer sleepsacks than this one, for instance, like the ones made of valboa. We used the warmer ones in the winter, and the difference between the micro-fleece and valboa ones was actually very large.  Our cold apartment was not a problem when my daughter was wearing the valboa sleep sack, but the micro-fleece one was a better choice for the early fall, the spring, and the summer.	
1. 	What a simple toy! At first I couldn't visualize how a baby (my first) could find a set of stacking cups interesting and enjoyable. Well, at first all he did was scatter them about. Then he started banging things with them. Then he started holding them in his hands and walking around with them as if he had hooves. Finally, he started to study them and spent a lot of time at this activity.At the present time, our boy is 15 months old. Now he takes the stack apart, arranges the cups on a flat place, goes back to get them and put them back together in the proper order. I sometimes mix them up on his flat place and turn a few upside down. He immediately goes to the pile and sorts them out in the proper orientation and order and rebuilds the stack. Then he smiles at his accomplishment. It's rather amazing.He seems to find the cups endlessly fascinating. When he's whiny or grumpy, I give him the stack and that immediately grabs his attention. We take them everywhere. In the bath. In the car. It's a simple and inexpensive delight.Gary Peterson	
1. 	Here's a tub that makes both baby and parent feel secure at bath time.We got this tub about two years ago for our son. We used it for about a year with him. Now we are using it again for our newborn daughter.This tub has two outstanding features. First, the hammock holds a newborn or infant snugly. This makes the baby feel secure and gives you the ability to have a hand free. Thus, it's possible for one person to bathe the baby solo without worrying that the baby will fall into the water.Second, because the hammock has adjustable straps, it can be raised or lowered. This allows you to have baby out of the water for a sponge bath prior during the first few weeks when they're not supposed to be submerged. Once their cord stub falls off, you can lower the hammock so that they are in the water as little or as much as you want.As the baby grows, you remove the hammock. Baby can lie against the inclined side until he or she has the strength to sit up. Then, once sitting well, they can use the straight-backed side. Because the tub is small, it's easier to keep baby upright even when they haven't mastered sitting up. Also, another advantage over a bath seat that goes on the floor of the bathtub is that this little bath doesn't require so much water to fill, making bath time simpler and quicker.Some reviewers have complained that the tub does not drain completely when you open the drain plug. This is absolutely true; however, I think the drain plug is merely intended to drain out the vast majority of the water -- which it does -- so that you can turn the tub over to rinse it and drain it completely.  Without this drain feature, the filled tub would be incredibly heavy, making it nearly impossible to turn over to pour the water out (not to mention the mess you'd probably make trying to dump all that water down the sink!).	
1. 	Added a lot more room for my son's playzone.  Since the original is smaller, I wanted to make it a wide enough spaces for him to move around.	
1. 	Love these bibs!  They hold up really well, can be put on the top rack of your dishwasher for cleaning and aren't super stiff like a lot of the other bibs out there.  Best bib out there!	
1. 	A bottle warmer has many uses.  The first and most obvious use is the fact that you can have a bottle warming while you're changing your baby's diaper, getting them dressed etc...While some will complain that it takes 5 minutes, I find that to be a gross over estimate.  It takes not quite 2 minutes from refridgerator to warm.  If it truly took 5 minutes my guess is that too much water was being put into the resevoir.The next great use is the fact that it's easy and so any Dad - new or experienced - can figure out how to use it to help out.  It's extremely easy to use so it can even be easily used in the middle of the night.The one weakness that I found has to do with warming up breast milk that's been frozen.  It seems to have some sort of timer that times how long the water in the resevoir has boiled to not let the milk get too hot.  If breast milk has not had an opportunity to thaw out in the fridge yet it will obviously take more than just 1 press of the button for the milk to thaw and be warmed up.  The problem is that even though there's still ice in the bottle the water will be warm and so the heating element that heats the water will shut off after 10 seconds.  What I had to do was shake the bottle to more evenly distribute the temperature through out the bottle and add more cool water to the resevoir 3-4 times.  This situation is easily fixed however by remembering (easier said than done when you aren't sleeping much!!) to take out a bottle 12-18 hours in advance.Overall, great product, great value and a must have.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to set some sort of control to tell it that the bottle is full of frozen liquid.	
- 1	I was very excited to buy this item for my 4 1/2 month old baby. He love to kick his feet so I thought this would be great. However the volume on it is terrible. Even with the volume on the second noise  spot I can barly hear it unless I get real close to it. It was a waste of my money.	
1. 	The velcro on the side is a great feature. These bibs worked well, we have them a few months later.	
1. 	Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal BlueWhat a great little invention! Perfect for sleepovers at grandma and grandpas house!	
- 1	What genius decided to make this thing so SHORT?! A lady who just delivered a baby doesn't need the added back ache of having to bend over nearly to the ground to throw away a diaper.Not only that, but the handle sticks (and then pops off the side) on a regular basis.Also, when you open the chute to dispose of a diaper, you get a giant nose full of everything that's in the bin.  In other words, the awful stink that is in the bin is scooped into the disposal chamber and wafts out into the room every time you throw a diaper away. This is definitely NOT odor proof.The old model was taller and didn't hurt our backs.The old model did not STINK every time you threw away a diaper.WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY CHANGE THE DESIGN?!	
1. 	This is just fantastic. We previously were using the lulaby bear but the darn thing kept messing up. We went through three of them before finding this. Here is the break down:Good1. Can have it play all night or use the automatic shut off.2. Tons of sounds to choose from3. Small, fits in our playards little rack where we keep diapers and such. Also easy to pack when staying somewhere overnight.4. Has the option to plug in to save money instead of wasting batteries, but the battery option is nice to have two since you do not always have an outlet everywhere.5. Can program it to play one sound, play two sounds at the same time (such as rain w/ thunder), or you can choose the option for it to play sounds at random.6. Easy Easy Easy to use. I never even read the instruction manual.Bad:1. It does not go real real loud.To give an example of how loud it goes. If we turn it up to full volume and close the bedroom door we can hear it (it is on the far side of the room away from the door, our room is an average master bedroom) if there is not another sound going on. But if the T.V, dishwasher, dogs, or shower is running anywhere in the house we cannot hear it. That is more than enough for us, especially since it is right next to our babies crib and as long as he hears it we are happy. Also when we go to bed and all things are off in the house we have to turn it down to its lowest volume otherwise it is too loud. I hope that helps!!	
- 1	I'm giving the star to the idea of attaching this toy to multiple baby gear. That can be useful, however I cannot say that the toy was attached well in any of the items we tried (high chair, car seat, swing). It never got detached, but when baby pulled any of the toys the arch would bend toward his face. I also think it is overstimulatig. Our sweet boy who rarely cries got so frustrated with this toy! The  most he could take of this was 10 min, then he'd start batting angrily at the toys and cry in frustration. He was able to spin the propeller- not a problem- but he caught his fingers in the spinning blades a few times and wasn't happy about it.The musical box has 3 tunes - about 3 seconds each. The first week only one of them would play (pop goes the weasel) and I got so sick of it. I wrote to Tiny Love about the problem and they never replied. Now for some reason, I get to hear the other two tunes, but the weasel is the one that we hear most of the time.This toy made me forever switch away from cheap Chinese imports to quality toys from Haba, Selecta, and the like. At least they don't make me cringe every time baby puts them in their mouth, since safety standards are much stricter in Europe, and also because they use natural materials (e.g. wooden toys stained not painted, and finished with natural beeswax). Amazon carries quite a few of these toys for very reasonable prices. They are also more educational because they are simpler so allow the baby to use his imagination in using them. Toys with sounds and lights are no more educational than a TV.	
1. 	Great photo book. I'll be ordering more of these as a  new mom taking WAY too many pictures of my little girl! Love the windows on the outside and the personalization options. Doesn't look cheap and well made.	
- 1	this didn't fit our toilet unfortunately.  We had to return it and find another product.  Not sure if it would have held up to my son's strength anyhow	
- 1	I like the design and thought. But it is just not functional in the manner that I needed it to be. We used it for about 3 trips through the store before it broke. My little girl is about 18 months old and about 22 lbs. She tripped which of course put a little bit of strain on the leash and it tore. It is more a of cute fashion toy for a kid to wear vs. a workable kid leash. If you wanted it just for that purpose I'd give it another star. If you want it as a leash, consider something more durable or maybe having the stitching reinforced.	
1. 	This stroller is great for parents with two or more kids. We have a couple other strollers but ended up buying this one when we had an infant and a 2.5 year old. We were about to take a trip to Disneyland and thought it would be worth it.The stroller fits one child in the front and the front seat has three reclining positions. When the seat is all the way up in the sitting position, then another child can sit or stand in the back. If the front seat is reclined to the middle position or laid flat (it doesn't go completely flat, but goes down far enough for a child to sleep), then the back cannot be used.The stroller comes with an extra piece so you can attach various models of car seats. We were past that age with our infant, but we kept the part in case we have another.Also, not shown in the photo, the stroller comes with a fabric band that wraps around the top to hold drinks and other items. I thought I had to buy this separately and did so, but ended up returning the separate accessory because it already came with the stroller.The stroller can be heavier than regular strollers (it weighs around 20 pounds) so when pushing our 20 lb infant and 40 lb 2.5 year old, it can be quite a workout. It's not as maneuverable as I'd like it to be either. Also, the rear brakes aren't as reliable as I'd like them to be. You really need to make sure you press down hard.Setup was really easy. I was able to set it up myself in about 25 minutes. Probably would've been faster if my 2.5 YO wasn't trying to help me so much.It was really nice having this in Disneyland. Our infant could sleep in the park and when our preschooler got tired, we could let him take a ride. He is in an age where he constantly wants to run away from us, so it was great to park him in the back when we needed to walk for a long time.	
1. 	This bib keeps his face and clothes clean because it's rigid and he can't squeeze it and shove it up to his face. We had big messes with other bibs that were cloth and flexible. To clean the bib, you just wipe it and presto.	
- 1	This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back.	
1. 	We have at least five different sleeping sack.  This time order is  for baby shower gift to a friend. Wonderful design, easy to clean, keep our baby nice and warm.	
- 1	This would have barely covered my lap. How I use these now is just for under my baby's butt whenever she gets changed on her changing pad in case of accident. It helps delay us from having to wash the Kushies waterproof pad that we have over our changing pad cover, which are much better for the job. Our baby tends to have lots of accidents so it worked out I guess but I would have never bought these if I had realized how small they were.	
- 1	It was very cute when I received it in the mail. After the first wash it was totally deformed and didn't look the same. I don't recommend this item at all.	
- 1	I am going to compare this to 2 other options: Baby Kicks Baby Wipes and Gerber Baby Wash Cloths.I had recently started cloth diapering and received both the Babykicks and the Osocozy wipes as gifts. The Osocozy are so thin in comparison. They feel flimsy and if you are dealing with a poopy diaper they do nothing to help grab what's there. In comparison, the BabyKicks are thicker and sturdier and allow me to easily take care of messy diapers even though they are just as soft as the Osocozy wipes. I also picked up a pack of regular Gerber baby wash cloths and found them to be superior to the Osocozy as well! They are not as soft as the Baby Kicks, but they are certainly just as good at grabbing the poop off my little ones rear.UPDATE: I finally figured out why Osocozy wipes are a hit.  My product review was based on my experience with my 1 year old.  Now that I have a newborn, I am totally a fan of these Osocozy wipes.  They are all that's needed to clean a little one's bum when they aren't eating any solids and are still just having breastmilk.  The Babykicks and Gerber washcloths are a bit overkill for a newborn; too much bulk gets in the way when you are on diaper change duty.  This is not the case with Osocozy wipes.  They are just the right size and perfectly adequate for any newborn diaper change.	
- 1	I hate it. Whenever I use it, it feels like a gun being pointed at anyone's head.The accuracy is dependent on the user and is accurate only when you make sure there is no hair etc on forhead on way while taking the measurement, leaving room for errors.It works, but I think ear thermometers are much more reliable.Update:The company send us a newer version of the thermometer. We got to use it over this weekend and it seems to have much quicker response time. I also checked the temperature measured to the rectal temperature and they are off aby around 1-2F .. which is pretty good. I do like the newer version much better and like the customer care of the company even better!!!	
1. 	We registered for this and received it as a shower gift.  My daughter loved the musical star from the moment I laid her on the mat.  Unfortunately, the motion sensor did not work.  I called the manufacturer, and they sent me a new one.  The customer service rep was very helpful.  The new star works great, and now that my daughter is almost 6 months old, she still loves it.  She does roll into the gym bars now that she is more mobile, but she still loves swatting at the toys.  She has discovered how to pull hard enough so extra links will come off into her hands, and seems to smile as if she's proud of herself. I can't compare this to other gyms, but so far this has served its purpose.  Once they start rolling all over, the size of the mat will not be significant.	
1. 	I love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. They fit great and arrived in record time.	
1. 	Excelente para cubrir el colchoncito del bebe en el corral.Buena marca.Absorbe el liquido y muy funcional.Lo recomiendo ampliamente.	
- 1	Don't waste your money	
1. 	We got these to go with our supply of drop in liners. This meant that we didn't have to clean nipples all day long but could use a nipple a couple of times and then put it in the dishwasher.	
1. 	I love this pillow! It's size is great and my son loves to sleep in it. It gives him the feeling of being held and he just loves it. It's great for us parents because we can put him in it and he can sit with us on the couch or on the bed.	
- 1	I thought this would be less hot than the other options I saw, but it made his head so hot!	
- 1	Very disappointed in this product. After reading all the great reviews I figured I just had to try it. Not worth the money at all, the plastic is thin and flimsy and the unit itself does not lock into place and comes apart. I just got this today and it'll be going back in the box and sent back. It takes up way more room in my cabinet than just putting the bottles in and it makes all the pieces separate so I have to put them all together at time of bottle. I'd rather put it all together coming out of the wash so everything is ready to go. Highly disappointed.	
1. 	Very excited to have the Miracle Blanket. Machine washed and dried with no bleeding or loss of color. Looking forward to using when our little guy arrives!	
1. 	We have two of these and they are easy to use and the key to a good night's sleep for our baby. They're warm and wash well.	
- 1	This tub seemed like a no-brainer based on the many reviews, but I'm not thrilled.  Here's why:1) You only need the sling for about a week until the baby's cord falls off.  After that I find it far preferable to put the baby in the water because he is much warmer and happier.  Not worth buying this for the sling, just do sponge baths until cord falls off2) It's massive for a small baby.  There is a bumper to support their behind, but at 4-5 weeks the baby can arch his back and slide right over it.  I used a much smaller tub at my mom's, just a simple rectangular plastic thing that was just long enough for the baby to sit in with my support and he was much happier since he could push his legs against the end of the tub and not feel so out in the open.  With this thing his legs are everywhere3) Because it is massive, cleanup isn't fun.  Rinsing the whole thing out in a kitchen setting is awkward because it is huge. Would be OK in a big bathtub though.	
- 1	I was not satisfied with this purchase and thought the kit was over priced and poor quality.  It looked a lot better online than what actually came.  I also didn't like how when it arrived some of the pieces were all jumbled around, I hope it wasn't a return!  I would not recommend getting this kit, I think that you can find better quality kits around the same price or less at any baby store.	
- 1	Buying this item was a bad idea as was buying the bottles. Bottles aside; to have a brush that is only good for one type of bottle is stupid in my opinion because you'll need various brushes then and that results in having a counter full of extra brushes.To buy any one baby product that is only functional within the same brand is foolish in my opinion.The Lansinoh bottles require this brush and this brush is no good for other bottles&#8230;. enough said?	
- 1	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower.  I thought it would be wonderful.  I was wrong.  My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner.  In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides.  SCARY!  This started happening after about 3 weeks of age.  Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part.  I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow.  Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone.  It's not worth the risk.	
1. 	My kids 2-4-6 love this seat, well the 6 yr old I big for it, but he used to like it.  It's easy to transport and the padding covers hinges well, so no pinching!  It's comfortable according to them, and keeps them from falling in.  Easy to clean. Very happy  with the purchase.	
- 1	Bought this, drawn in buy all of the great reviews.  It doesn't really help to train your kid to drink from a cup any better than a regular cup.  Except that it is plastic.  My daughter rarely used this, and now I have down-graded it to a bath toy.	
- 1	We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on.  It's too loud.  We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it.  It has voice activation.  So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise.	
1. 	Great product. My newborn baby was swallowing the formula very fast when I used the 3 months size so I ordered this one. It is just perfect.Love it.	
- 1	My 9 month old has zero use for this toy. She likes the winkle but not this. It's made well	
- 1	I'm 5 months pregnant and was looking for a body pillow that would help me sleep comfortably on my side as I'm primarily a back sleeper. After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back.  Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams.  I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body.  It did do the job in keeping me sleeping on my side but I just wish it was softer and more comfortable.	
1. 	Purchased when my 4 month old seemed to be getting bored with her sea gym. She was excited and engaged from the moment we put her down with this. Fairly easy to assemble and can be kept clean easily. Very pleased with this purchase!	
- 1	It is nearly impossible for the liquid to come out of the top of these cups. I even contacted the company and they sent me a new valve. I was excited to get it but it didn't improve anything. I am extremely disappointed.	
1. 	This is a great shopping cart cover.  I love how easy it is to use.  I can hold the baby and arrange this quickly with one hand.  My baby is very happy in it and it gives me peace of mind that she's not touching a germy cart.  Its very well padded and folds up so quickly when done with shopping.	
1. 	These Babybjorn bibs beat the pants off regular old flat bibs.  It isn't even close.  We keep one hung on the diaper/travel bag and one for home use.  Eating at home and at restaurants is now a much less messy affair.  Every parent should have one (or several) of these.	
1. 	My children are 12 years apart and I wish they would have had this item with my first. It is so easy to use and makes those middle of the night feedings just a little more tolerable. If you get into a routine: ( wake up place the bottle in the warmer change the diaper the bottle is done by the time you are and has even had time to cool for a moment). I only had one problem with getting the bottles 2 hot but that was my fault from heating them twice. Go figure. I had a c-section and we lived in a 2 story house, what trips this saved my husband from going downstairs all night was well worth the money.	
1. 	we purchased to keep at grandmas that lives out of state but we visit often! kids love it! compact easy fold to store!	
1. 	I first saw these at a local indoor play place and fell in love with them! Now my 12 month old got one for his birthday and he can already scoot around on it. (He is 99% for height) My three year old loves it but I had better get him the larger size before this one gets worn out!	
1. 	SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but  when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib). By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds*  I WISH IT COULD BE  MORE  SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!	
1. 	I used this seat when my dd was under 15m. Now, I am using it for my son. I never really had a big issue with it, just small ones. a) It doesn't turn well in water(mainly I think cause of plastic and friction) but that didn't matter to me cause I don't really find myself NEEDING to turn itb)instructions- I don't remember if it came with instructions but when i would put it on the tub, I would lean on it to force it onto the tub. After doing it this way for dd for a year and for ds for awhile, my hubby informed me that there was a handle underneath to open it. I am the type that reads manuals from cover to cover. I don't remember that at all.c)water drainage- when I am done with it, I have to lean it foreward and let it sit for the water to drain out. Now, I have been using it since 2004 and NEVER HAD THE MOLD! It' just takes a good minute for all the water to drain. I just lean it foreward and let it sit there until the next bath or my shower then move it.All in all, good bathseat with few small hangups. I love it and am continueing to use it and have used it for about 2 years	
1. 	We have an old (1947) toilet that is round.  Our Toddler started playing in the toilet and I had to get a lock asap!!!  This one worked right from the start and we have been using it for a week now. Once I installed it correctly, it held firm to the bowl and has not moved around at all....we love it and feel more secure having it!	
- 1	I ordered this in my daughter's size months ago and she still hasn't grown into it.  I'm sure it will be great when it finally fits but the sizing is way off.	
1. 	I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter hoping it would be a nice activity on a plane trip. It is well constructed and attractive (though I must say not as nice as the quiet book my mother sewed for me as a toddler).The activities are:Page 1: Shape matching, different colored shapes match to same shaped outlines with velcro attachments. The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.	
- 1	This sleeper worked great when I first set it up. The baby stays in it for sometime but not for long. The problem I have with this sleeper is that I don't get it to close. In the video it looked so easy but it's not. No matter how many time I push the bottoms at the side it wont close. It's really annoying me. I think one of bottoms isn't working because it doesn't snap when I press it. You should really make sure all the parts on your products are working before you sell it to someone. I'm so fed up and annoyed I can break this sleeper.	
1. 	Great buy for the price.  These generally are expensive in the retail store.  I purchased a few for easy changing/washing.  Covers are really soft and fit perfectly.	
1. 	I think it is a good bath tub for this price.It looks nice and  for different ages but I find it hard to wash my newborn s back because you can not turn him around when he is in the net/sling.So I need to wash his back first and then put him in tub,a little inconvenient.Overall I like the product.	
1. 	This has been one of the greatest purchase. I love the fact that it is made of organic cotton, it's stylish, simple and easy to use it.It's a mush have!	
- 1	It did not get to the corners of my baby's nails so it left a weird angle and a sharper end to the nail. Needless to say, I had to buy the regular baby clippers and it worked like a charm. I got the safety 1st grooming set	
- 1	We actually borrowed this car seat for a trip we were making on an airplane. I had read this was a great seat for carrying through the airports and fitting on the coach airplane seats. And those reviews were right. Although heavy, we carried it through the airports without problem and it fit in the seats great. My 2 year old son did great in it on the flights.That's where the greatness of this carseat ended. It was a pain in the rear to install in the various cars we traveled in. The installation is significantly more complicated than our Evenflo carseat that we love. And even though I spent time reading the manual and installing it properly, I never felt like I got a truly secure installation. I also hated that the carseat is top heavy so when you set it on the ground, at the airport or when switching between cars, it just falls over. The recline is terrible and even though I had it as reclined as a forward facing position allows, whenever my son fell asleep his head flopped forward.Prior to this trip I was seriously considering purchasing a Diono Radian RXT, but now I will forever praise my Evenflo Symphony 65DLX carseat and will not be spending money on this carseat. I think next time we fly I will instead choose the CARES straps.	
- 1	I have several of these, as my baby is a &#34;happy spitter&#34; with frequent spit up episodes. We go through 6-10 bibs a day.  We own the first generation of these, where the Velcro was abrasive,they stayed on better but left friction marks on my babies neck,then we bought these, the second generation and the Velcro is much softer but stops sticking /working after a few washes, now I can't keep the bibs on her during the feeds, she's just tugs them off at 5 months.Bottom line, I would buys dozens of these if they snapped. The thick rim around neck is super helpful in keeping sneaky spit up off the clothes, but with the Velcro issues, they are worthless. I will be buy the Aden and anis snap bibs instead going forward.	
1. 	As stated by another reviewer, this is a bright red sheet.  That is why I got it.  The picture is a deep red, so I was very happy when it arrived and is bright and vibrant.  The fabric is soft.	
- 1	The bra is tight, so tight the top part rolls down under the armpits - not comfortable.  I am using avent's small glass bottles and they are too heavy for the bra to support even with how tight the bra is.  I still have to hold them so suction isn't broken.	
1. 	Plus:1.  Easy to use.  The foot pedal works great and the cutting edge for the bags is really convenient.2.  Good odor control.3.  Liners really do last a long time, making them less expensive than they seem at first- definitely cheaper than the Genie's.  Even regular trash bags cost something...4.  The style (foot pedal controlled flip-up top with trap doors in) makes it impossible for our puppy to get into, and this dog is an expert at trash cans.  He hasn't even made a move for it, which says something impressive about its odor control.5.  Holds a lot of diapers- we empty about every 5 days.Minus:1.  It's nearly impossible to find the refill liners in stores (I've seen them once at Baby Depot, never at BRS, Target, Walmart, or anywhere else) so they need to be ordered ahead of time, which means we always have to pay shipping for them as well.2.  A minor point, but it is hard to tell when the liner is about to run out.  So long as you've ordered extras ahead of time, this isn't a big deal, but if you haven't, you're in trouble for a couple of days.	
- 1	My 1 year old daughter just does not like this toy. I have tried everything to make it fun and it just isn't. Also it does have a moth ball odor which I personally have a low tolerance for.	
- 1	Color looks great on the webpage; blue and yellow. It arrived grey and yellow.The diaper pad is so small, it would have only covered half my baby. I wanted to use it to cover those dirty changing tables in public. I returned this item in search of a bigger diaper pad.	
1. 	I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.	
- 1	the mirror is the size of a credit card, useless if you're driving and your baby is facing backwards as you want to be able to see them quickly, not have to spend 30 seconds trying to see in that tiny mirror. Also, i have an SUV and the clip it comes with is not flexible enough that you can set it in the right angle where you can look into it from the front mirror. spend another $3 and get something like this for about $10.Brica Baby In Sight Mirror Gray	
1. 	We ordered this to use with the co-sleeper. The color matches exactly the sleeper,we ordered the toffee, but its kind of a dull color, the green would have probably been nicer. The sheet fits snugly and is easy to get on and off and once washed it soft and not to chaffy for the baby. Overall a good product.	
1. 	The only swaddle my baby can't break out of! I bought this for my 10 week old who was breaking out of swaddles within minutes of putting him down! I wasn't really sure how this worked but it basically uses baby's own weight to keep his arms cozy and comfy. I would definitely recommend this to parents whose babies break out of swaddles easily but need to be swaddled to fall asleep- and stay asleep!Another nice side effect is my baby seems to associate being all wrapped up in this with sleep and is falling asleep much quicker and with a lot less fuss!	
1. 	This is my favorite bouncer.  My daughter was mesmerized by it from the very beginning.  At 3 months she still stares at the fish swimming about.  The vibration feature is great to relax and lull your little one to sleep.  The only negative thing I can comment on is the motor is a little loud, but not enough for me not to love the product.  I especially love the variety of music and nature sounds.  The Ocean Wonders line is truly wonderful!	
- 1	At first, I was so happy with this product.  It's great to have a way to keep milk cold so that you don't have to rush to the fridge all the time.BUT . . . the straw disintegrated under my son's teeth, and Thermos has terrible customer service.  The rep said that they don't warrant the straw and that I should throw it away and buy a new one.  When I asked for her name, she refused to give it but instead transferred me into a voicemail.	
1. 	This is a great mattress! I was so impressed at the packaging when it arrived (double-wrapped in plastic inside a box), and it was super light-weight, so I was able to unpack it easily. The mattress is firm and fits nice and snug inside the Graco Sarah 4-in-1 crib. We are very pleased!	
1. 	I see some customers got defective products, which is unfortunate. I got the Ladybug one for my daughter's second birthday, and she LOVES it. For her, falling asleep is difficult, and this helps her tremendously. Now that she is 2 1/5, she gets out of bed at night to turn it back on when it's off. It's easy for her to work. She even made up a story to go along with the booklet that came with it.You won't regret buying this, as long as you get one that works properly, like ours does. We will purchase one for our son when he is old enough, as well.	
1. 	Cant live with out these! Although I wish I had color selection.. I ordered a 2nd one.. we use one at night and one for the diaper bag!  Both are Pink with Green tops.. not that it matters but I like the Green and blue one..Whoever invented this is a genius!	
1. 	I bought the Snap n Go when we took our 2 month old to Miami. We wanted a cheap stroller to travel with, so we wouldn't mind if it got broken. We gate-checked it and had no problems. (Granted, we were lucky--we might have wanted a canvas bag to stick it in.)6 months later, it's been one of my favorite purchases.I use it every day for quick errands in town, trips to the mall, dinner in some restaurants, even in the grocery store--it's easier to push her in it than to lug her into the store and put her in a cart. I just carry my reusable bag and fill that with groceries.Especially at first, when she almost always fell asleep in the car, it was GREAT not having to wake her up--I'd just move her carseat into the Snap n Go, and she never noticed.I have not had any problems with durability, although it's clearly not meant for rough terrain! I'm on sidewalks, in the mall, in airports (three plane trips later...), etc. It can stick going over bumps or rough patches (some iced-over snow on a sidewalk, for instance)--but I'm not on those surfaces very often, and the convenience of the snap n go far outweighs the few moments when I have to shove it over a small obstruction.I also, now that my monstrously tall daughter is about to outgrow her infant seat, am very glad that I did not purchase one of the travel systems. I'm looking for my next snap-n-go--the stroller that I will keep in the car and use for errands, plane trips, and the mall.  I'm glad I'm not stuck with one of the strollers that comes with an infant seat--they seem to be either very bulky with the infant seat attached, or cheapish and plastic-y, or with other features that I've now realized I don't want, or without features that I've now realized I DO want.To keep at home, I have a heavy-duty, durable stroller with good suspension for walks around our neighborhood (no sidewalks, and some unpaved roads).I like the advice from the Baby Bargains book--get whatever car seat you want and the Snap n Go. Use those for a little bit while you figure out what you're going to be doing with your stroller, and then you can make a more informed decision. I thought my big Maclaren was going to be my stroller--until I had to lift it in and out of the car too many times. At the same time, I needed something pretty rugged for walks, so I just gave in and decided it was worth having two strollers for two purposes. People who live in an urban environment might want to ignore my advice...(and oh! The other two top purchases were a Hooter Hider (sounds crazy, but if you nurse your baby and don't want to sit at home or go into exile every two hours, it's a HUGE help) and a bouncy seat--it's what she sits in when I shower, or do anything, really, when she needs to be secured and I can't hold her.Good luck.	
- 1	I bought this for public toilets for my daughters potty training. It turns out it doesn't remain steady, so as soon as I tried to sit my daughter on the toilet with this it moved and defeat the purpose of using it.	
1. 	These wipes do the job. They are absorbent and attractive. I handwash and air dry them so the stitching at the seams is still intact - I noticed that many parents complained that the stitching comes out very easily. The one complaint I do have is that some of them tend to leave fluffy residue on my baby's bottom - this is an aesthetic complaint really as she does stay dry and has had no rashes.	
1. 	My son sits in this swing fine he doesn't stay in it as long as his bouncer but I think that has to do with the motion, he can't handle that much motion. But he doesnt flop forward and the low setting is just right for him. He really likes the music. I put him in this swing on day 2 that we had him home. Out of all the swings I like this one the most because it has little toys that attach to the sides and a mirror to look at you can even buy more links and linkadoo toys and change out the toys that it came with. It is soo interchangeable with other Fisher Price toys. I wouldn't trade this swing for anything and it folds up real compact and is easy to fold and store!	
1. 	I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too.  Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off.  I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.**Edit 2/27/13: I had contacted the company about this problem who asked me to send the giraffe back. We did so and have since received a brand new giraffe and are very happy.  I have changed the rating from two stars to five for the satisfying customer service.	
1. 	Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners. Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible!	
1. 	Best product EVER! I spent several weeks getting peed on by my newborn son and having to change my shirt multiple times a day before I found these. They're way more absorbent than they look, and you can wash & dry them along with the baby's laundry. Now that my son is older and not surprise-peeing anymore, I keep them on the changing table and hand them to him to play with while I change him so that he doesn't squirm all over the place. Peepee teepees are definitely on my must-have list if you have a baby boy.	
1. 	We have been using these for a few months and they are on our must have baby gift giving list.  They are easy to use, almost always easy to clean (except bananas) and a great way to introduce foods.  Love this product.	
- 1	I have the nipples given to us in the hospital and they are slow flow. These nipples allow milk to flow out when the bottle is upside down unlike the other slow flows I have.	
1. 	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.  However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing. We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion.  The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby.  Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET!  We'll use them with our next baby and will recommend to them to ANYONE that will listen.	
- 1	Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.	
- 1	had a plastic like smell for a few daysi don't know if its the material or the 3&#34; thickness but i was not satisfied with how the mattress gave way to our kid's body weight  and she is not fat (@24lbs)	
1. 	Perfect! Folds up easily and I take it everywhere. Even use it in my own back yard.	
1. 	I don't use the drain feature, so that doesn't bother me (other people have said it's hard to drain.) I love that it's roomy and has a couple different options for seating. I lay my kiddo down to bathe him but allow him to sit up to play. Actually, he can switch himself between the different seating options now (he's 8 months), which worries me a little, that he's that mobile in the tub, but hey, I'm right there watching, so I guess it doesn't matter much, and it entertains him to move around and chase toys around the tub.	
- 1	As others have mentioned, the color of this product is more of a lime green, not even close to sage as pictured.  I'm only keeping it because it was cheap, it's soft, and I can't be bothered to send it back.	
1. 	I have had this pump for only about a month and it has been great so far. Easy to assemble, easy to clean, pumps nicely. The only negative thing so far was the yellow piece that the milk flows through in the elbow does not detach easily---I cannot grasp it nearly enough to get it off. They say to twist it while pulling but I can't do either. It started to crack the little openings in the center when I tried.	
- 1	My daughter is three months, and we had been using this as a nightlight.  Last week it just stopped working. It was great for late night feedings and diaper changes.  She was just starting to become mesmerized by the changing colors when it stopped working. Too bad, I really liked it.	
1. 	I originally had a Medela Swing, which was ok. It was my first pump, so I didn't know any better. But when we out of town, my pump stopped working because it shorted out (my dog had bitten thru the wire, and when my husband tried to re-connect the wires, it died). Anyway, I needed a pump badly, we went to Wal-Mart and bought this one because it was a cheap fix. When I first used it, it felt sort of violent at first because I was used to my Medela,which is very gentle. But it was only because I wasn't used to the Even Flo. Well, I was amazed at the amount of milk I got in such a short amount of time (a full 5 oz in maybe 10 minutes!!!but I was pretty engorged, too). I think it's much more efficient since there is no tubing, which can reduce the suction power. I havent had any problems with the pump at all, and am very happy with this purchase and price. The breast pads that came with it are terrible, though, and I stick to Lansinoh pads, which ROCK! They don't leak at all, even in the morning when I tend to be full. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is pretty loud, and the flanges only come in one size.	
- 1	This latch broke off after 2 months of use! It's only on with sticky stuff Anyway. Should be better quality to hold on to over, after all trying to keep kids safe!	
1. 	This unit is a combination of solid wood parts and particle board parts. The drawer sides and back are low-quality particle board but the front panels are solid. The drawer bottoms are basically just thick box-board (think 8-10 layers of cereal box material pressed together. If you're concerned these might not hold the weight of your clothes and other items, there is enough of a lip beneath the drawer bottom to install a couple of side-to-side dowels or 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch trim wood using wood glue to augment the bottom support.This is cam-lock construction, but for the price and the fact that plenty of particle board is used this is to be expected. For the price, this is a pretty nice dresser! I gave it 4 stars because the value you get for the price is great, but the way the drawer runners attach to the particle board is less than snug. Just don't try to make the screws for the runners TIGHT and you'll be all set. Also, the pre-drilled holes for the brackets that secure the top were too high on one side. This is no problem as you can just move the brackets and insert the screws directly into the wood for an even tighter fit than the pre-drilled holes.	
1. 	This is a great nursing cover.  With my son, I would usually just go into a dressing room or out to the car if I had to nurse him while we were out and about.  Well, forget about that when you have 2!  I can't believe I didn't buy one of these sooner!  I can't think of one thing wrong with this, it's just great.  Nice design (pretty, but subtle), easily adjustable neck tie, wire thingy that helps you to see what's going on down there (genious!).  I didn't think much about the absorbant &#34;pockets&#34; on the inside bottom corners, but they have actually come in handy for spitup.  Also, this folds up to be very compact...I fold it in half so that the wire part is very loosely folded, then just start rolling....it ends up about the size of a long hot dog and sits hiding at the bottom of my diaper bag until I need it.The only thing its missing are heavy metal anchors to keep it in place against a baby who is *determined* to see what's going on out there:)  But then, I guess that would be a liability issue :oP	
1. 	Very happy with this album, it is cute, and very sturdy. The front picture and binding picture are also a nice touch for organization	
- 1	For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50% less and my LO still hated them! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies	
1. 	I knew I wanted a well-rated, good looking car seat when I was doing research for ours, and wanted something different from the standard Graco and Fisher Prices out there.  Britax consistently had great reviews and many awards so we decided to get the Roundabout.  This model is more portable for travel since we travel a lot.  We haven't traveled overseas with it yet, but we really love it so far. I also have great peace of mind that I have a car seat that exceeds U.S. safety standards.	
1. 	It fits in even the smallest bottles (medela breast milk storage bottles) and seems to get every inch! My absolute favorite bottle brush!	
- 1	The material seems to make my skin itch around my breasts. I've never encountered a reaction quite like this before to any materials. Perhaps my breasts have just become sensitive since I've given birth and started pumping/feeding, but I every time I use this bra, I get itchy breasts and red marks; especially on the underside. I'll try re-washing it.	
1. 	It's kind of big and clunky, but our baby likes to watch and listen to it.  It has a good volume range -- some toys are just too loud.  The bubbling water is a nice effect.  The toy was fairly simple to install on the crib and a plus is that it can be used beyond sitting-on-own age.	
1. 	these little pickers are amazing!! they remove the boogies so well and they dont bother my 2 mo old when im doing it!! I love them every mom should have a pair the asirator is no god with hard boogies these are a must!!	
- 1	these cups are terrible.  They are heavy and extremely bulky.  Very difficult for our toddler to handle.  Don't like them at all!	
- 1	The size of the nipple seemed too small for the likes of my child. The plastic composing the nipple also seemed too inflexible and unnatural.	
1. 	This is an good product, little loose for medela 5oz & 8oz bottles that we have. They almost dont fit the nipple rings of the medela bottles the nipples come out of the ring when my son handles them a little rough and all the milk starts pouring out. We had to use these nipples with Enfamil Nipple Rings/CapsEnfamil Slow Flow Soft Nipple, 12-Countthe only down side is these caps dont take or have any caps.But there is one big advantage of these nipples, which is they dont get stuck like other nipples. My baby is used to pinching on the nipple hard, other nipples get stuck due to vacuum and milk doesn't pass. This one doesn't get stuck because of the tooth inside the nipple. I wish it fit the medela bottle a little better. It is said to be good for colic babies not sure how exactly that works.I would recommend this if your kid has the same problem as mine. The only thing is that you have to be sure that it fits you bottle these are the standard ones. I think one good test is if the free standard nipples that come with those ready to feed Similac bottlesSimilac Advance Newborn, Ready to Feed, 2-Fluid Ounces (Pack of 48) (Packaging May Vary)or above mentioned enfamil nipples fit you bottles then these will fit your bottles as well.	
1. 	My daughter loves this bib.  It is of adequate size to prevent food from getting onto her shoulders when she turns her head from side to side during a feeding.  She also really likes the teether.  I've had two of these for several months now, they are constantly in the washer and so far, have held up really well.  Only thing is, the packaging says nothing about BPA free plastic on the teether part.  However, when I purchased mine, the sight claimed they were BPA free.  I haven't let it bother me too much because she chews on most of her toys and only a few of them claim to be made of BPA free plastic.  Give these a try if your child has trouble hanging on to her teether.  This one is guaranteed never to hit the floor because its fastened to the bib itself.	
1. 	I bought this tracker when my daughter was 4 weeks old. I was having problems remembering how much she was eating, whether she was sleeping better or not. This helped me keep track of those things and more. I could look back and see if there were any changes in her eating habits - it wasI started using it like a little journal that my daughter can see when she's older. I kept notes about her moods, what she did during the day. It even became a good tool to use with my nanny once I went back to work.	
1. 	I bought these sturdy cups for my grand-daughter, age one year. This age and beyond love to explore with objects that can be stacked, nested, and rolled. They also have holes and are fun for water play.	
1. 	Handy tub. Fits well in the kitchen sink for my newborn. The sling is soft and comfy. The only issue we have is space for it to dry, but if you have a large tub or live in a warm area you wouldn't have a problem with it.	
1. 	My wife purchased these from another store for more than twice the price so I decided to bring down the cost average after we found out that they do not leak. There is a small rubber piece that fits in the spout to control the speed that the liquid comes out. After your child gets old enough you can eliminate the rubber piece. I think these are great to use as soon as you stop using bottles. After you stop using, the rubber flow control piece you can use them until your child grows out of sippy cups or you lose them. Great choice. Highly recommended.	
1. 	This has been a terrific buy.  It allows for a central place for bath toys, and also allows for them to drain easily.  I also very much like the little shelf -- it's perfect for storing a bottle or two of bath wash.It mounted easily and firmly; that thing is not going anywhere!The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is beause I wish it was bigger!	
1. 	Very good, I hope my daughter loves, my daughter is too young, still use it not very good, I was prepared for her	
1. 	Have you tried &#34;spill proof&#34; sippies only to find that your kid has outsmarted it by sticking something in the spout?  Can't happen with this cup.  Even when my child turns it upside down and shakes it, nothing will come out.Yes, the spout is a bit of a pain to wash, especially because we don't have a dishwasher, but it is worth it to avoid the spills.  I loved the first one I bought so much I went and bought  two of the uninsulated cups.No leaks from the edges of the lid or the spout.  I would buy this cup again!	
1. 	That's how comfy this little seat is! My 4-year old hasn't moved her little butt out of this thing since we got it earlier today, and I don't blame her.  The soft cushy foam is so comfortable, but not to the point where you sink down into it - it's very sturdy.  This fits perfectly on any standard kitchen chair and I love that there is enough 'grip' to the bottom of it that it does not slide at all when she gets in and out of the seat.This is exactly what we needed in moving her from a high chair to a booster seat at the kitchen table - the right height and width (with room to spare and grow into).  It's not heavy or clunky - my daughter is easily able to carry this around when she wants to - it would be perfect to take to any restaurant or the movie theater.The surface is easily cleaned - just some warm water and a sponge, a little dish soap if needed.  Unlike with some foam/plastic products there was no strong 'plasticky' smell when I opened the box, which made me very happy.  Overall we love this product - and it's a fantastic price!	
- 1	The helmet seemed a necessity once the baby started pulling up. However, we used it for a total of 30min. The helmet gets so hot, the baby was dripping sweat within 5 minutes of having this on. I read the reviews about this problem, but figured it would be ok since it was winter when we bought it, and we keep the house cooler than the average person. I dread to think of parents putting this on a baby in the summer. It would be borderline dangerous. Supervise your baby and save your $$$.Update 6/2012Having mentioned that this is not a good product should not deter you from finding something else suitable. I don't think that we should overprotect our children, but head injuries are serious. My 2.5 year old slipped on a wet tile floor and had major behavior changes for 3 weeks as a result. Unless the head bump causes a concussion, the medical profession is useless. So although in my case, I was sure the head bump affected my child, three different doctors told me it was okay as long as he didn't throw up. (I was about to throw up at them for being so useless.) Pre-verbal children may not be able to articulate what they feel and how the head bump affects them. Supervise your children, re-configure your living areas, wash your floors only when children sleep, and why not, try to find some kind of contraption that protects accident-prone children.	
1. 	We started using Drop Ins Nursers when our baby was about 6 weeks old. Drop Ins worked well and really helped on colic but it was not very convenient as you need to push the air out before feeding and because my hand couldn't reach all the way, I had to use some kind of &#34;tool&#34; (like a milk collection bottle/ long tube etc) to push the air out. This is inconvenient especially when you are out and about - and if you forgot your &#34;tool&#34; then you will not be able to push all the air out. Also I had to keep the bottle in overturned position whenever my baby paused during feeding in order to prevent air from getting back into the liner (and then have to push the air out again) so this is very messy as milk will continue to come out from the teat in overturned position.So I switched to VentAire and I just love it! It doesn't give my baby any gas, reduce spit ups and it is so much easier to use. No more buying liners, pushing air out, keeping bottle overturned. There are more parts to wash but they are so easy to wash. I have used them for a month and only encountered 2 leaks because of human error. If you assemble them properly, they will not leak. I also picked the Wide version in order to reuse the teats from Drop In Nursers. I definitely recommend these bottles.	
1. 	We just bought this and it is winter where we are at...well sort of and now that our toddler has gotten taller it has been very useful since she cannot fit the sacks anymore. She is still too short for the legs on these but it's like using a blanket. We bought a 2T-3T size while she is 15 months old and obviously it is too big but she can definitely grow into it which means we will get our money's worth. Just wished that they had a summer version because I have a feeling that it is going to be too warm for her during the hot summers.	
1. 	We tried quite a few bibs before settling on these. Don't let the thinness of these fool you. My 5m old is a running faucet; he's teething like crazy. These bibs get soaked but his clothes underneath stay perfectly dry. I don't mind going through three or so bibs in a day if the clothes aren't changed.	
1. 	My son was 6-13 at birth and the s/m fit him.  It was big but it worked.  He started to outgrow it at 4 months - he was too long, and he'd start to pull his arms up and through the gaps at the bottom.  He's about average in length but skinny - we moved him up to the L size for length and it's really big on him.  Would work better on a fatter 4 month old.  He slept better last night in his new bigger snuggie as we call it - we've been having some rough nights as he busted out of the small one - or trying to skip the snuggie altogether, no luck there - but he did get all twisted and bunchie inside of the large so I had to unwrap and fix him at one point.  I don't like the hand gaps in this item, but for the most part they aren't as big an issue as I feared they'd be - the bigger problem is the jump in size.  For the price (compared to similar items) I have liked this a lot.  This is my 4th kid, we just used flannel blankets on the others - the velcro and stretch makes things so much easier.	
- 1	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic Diaper Depot by Prince Lionheart.	
- 1	I couldn't resist the value  of these spoons, and I've liked other munchkin products just fine.  Unfortunately, after only a few uses, I noticed that the backs of the spoons were all rough feeling.  Upon closer examination, I realized that my baby's teeth were leaving rough grooves in the plastic.  For all I know, he's been swallowing plastic shavings.  Disturbing.  The Beaba or Munchkin silicone spoons are really great, softer, and more durable.  The silicone spoons are also a better design in that they are softer, and so better for teething, and they're not too 'deep', meaning my baby can get the spoon clean.  They also appear to be more enjoyable.	
1. 	These are really easy to install if you line them up how you want them and mark where you need to drill.  I like them because they stay in place, and if installed properly its easy for adults to open the cabinets, but too difficult for babies.	
1. 	My little 2 1/2 month grandson was delighted with this! The blinking lights, different sounds kept him amused. I would recommend this to anyone.  Price & Quality were exceptional through Amazon!	
- 1	Let me start by saying that we used Playtex Ventair bottles with my first child.  The bottles were great--durable and well-made.  We used them throughout her bottle-hood--for over a year.  No problems.However, we began using these again with our second child.  We were excited to hear that they were BPA-free and with our past experience with Playtex bottles, we were happy to purchase these.Within 3 weeks, the ink on the bottles came off of them.  So we had to use sharpie pens to mark the ounces.  And within 3 months, they began to leak.  We bought about 20 bottles...from a various number of stores.  So now we are stuck with 20 leaking bottles that require a sharpie every few weeks.  Perhaps it was because we washed them in the dishwasher...but really, the bottles should be prepared to handle that.Please don't waste your money on these bottles.  They appear great at first but go downhill quickly.	
1. 	LOVE this crib.  It's the perfect size and my little girl is just turning two and still loves it.  We're so glad we purchased it for her crib.	
1. 	Got this swaddle for my 2 month old who breaks out of swaddles easily. This is the best swaddle and would recommend to any mom! Got our baby sleeping through the night!	
- 1	Looks perfect except it's too big. Doesn't fit into my Dr Browns or Medela standard size bottles. Would probably work for wide-neck bottles.	
1. 	We loved this seat! We didn't use the inserts, we just washed the blue tray as needed. The seat fastened to chairs easily and was stable and secure. Small enough for taking to restaurants, big enough to be secure. Surrounded the baby well enough that it made playing with finger food easy! Baby loved that and so did we.	
1. 	This was my favorite bottle bag for my son.  It will hold six bottles with the ice pack going on top of the bottles.  I usually only put five in at one time so that I could use additional ice packs.  The storage on the top is small, but will fit two Gerber baby food containers, spoon and bib.  I used this to take his bottles to daycare and on all-day trips.  For short trips (to daycare), one ice pack would work.  For all day trips, we used additional ice packs.	
1. 	I use it's as a room spray for my kids' rooms after cleaning. I use couple sprays per room and the bottle lasts for a long time. It smells very fresh and clean.	
- 1	i ordered Britax foot muff for my 8 months old since winter is coming. This nicely fits in britax b-agile stroller and has agood material (looks great). Only, yet big, issue is it is so small. My daughter fits in here right now. Now it is fall here. When it is winter, i doubt she can use it. It is far shorter than its stroller. Even now it is difficult to zip if she is wearing a shoe. Just wondering why britax make it little longer and roomy. Or it should put product size. It is surely not one size product.	
- 1	It is no joke. i read the other reviews and ignored them.. These suckers leak. leak bad. Leak often. Leak everywhere. Leak QUICKLY. And get everywhere quickly. We've tried everything and eventually got rid of them. We hoped they'd help with a baby who was refusing to nurse but they didn't.	
1. 	This is a very nice cover and has been very easy to use.  I like the terry cloth padding provided on the corners of this nursing cover.  It has been very handy when you need something to wipe your babies mouth quickly.	
1. 	The high back and sturdy base make this chair perfect for little ones just getting the hang of using the potty. Be aware that with a boy the splash guard might not catch all the pee, but you can help him learn how to sit correctly and then it doesn't happen!	
1. 	I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps our daughter perfectly clean while having absolutely no negative effects on her skin. We have a routine of bath-time every night before feeding and sleeping, and this cleanser makes bath time fun every time. It rinses away super-easily, with absolutely no effort involved. This is important, because our daughter has a lot of baby rolls with folds in her neck and arms and legs. It smells a bit strong, but the smell is from the natural ingredients they use, it's not an added fragrance. And once my daughter is rinsed, there's no residual smell at all. I'm so happy we found this cleanser.	
1. 	My husband and I bought this for our little girl's nursery. It's perfect; however, the amber lights are barely visible - even when the room is completely dark. Furthermore, the blue lights are not that great (although better than the amber ones). The best are the green stars. They are the most clear and most visible. Overall, we are very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others. Enjoy!	
- 1	I purchased this stroller under the assumption that when it said it works with major brand car seats that my Combi would be included.  It doesn't work at all and now I have to return it.	
- 1	I was an exclusive pumper as my baby wouldn't latch. Over time my supply started diminishing and I found the flangs for my medela pump uncomfortable. After hearing About these I thought they were my answer. They weren't. They were just as uncomfortable, even more so really.  Why not make these in silicone rather than hard plastic? I hope someone out there designs a flang for breast pumping that is comfortable.	
1. 	We have an awesome little girl who just turned 4, and my husband and I thought she would like this. She has Autism, and isn't easy to buy for! She LOVES this! It is amazing how well it projects stars and the moon onto her ceiling, I had no idea it would be as amazing as it is. Even her 8 year old brother loves this thing, and her dad and I like it too. =) The colors are bright and vivid. Beautiful! If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just do it! =) Your little one will LOVE it!	
- 1	I bought the pink one...wanted to love this cup...paid $$$ a lot for it. Brought it home from the store...assembled it...tested the nipple part with my mouth...barely any liquid water came out. I had to turn the cup to the awkward edge of the nipple and squeeze and then liquid came out. You naturally want to put your mouth over the obvious wider flatter head of the nipple, but nothing comes out AT ALL. I am an adult too with heavy suction ability...NOTHING....but sideways, at a weird angle, I can get some out. Also, this frackin bottle leaked all over me. You have to really really really attempt to line up the nipple head with the screw indentions on the bottle. It doesn't naturally screw on. Poor Design.Update...the top is getting easier and simpler to screw on properly. But I still don't use it because of the nipple...I don't want to cut it either.	
1. 	This is the best invention!!!!!!!!! I had a C-section so this was a godsend! Easy to use, comfortable and my daughter loved it! After nursing she would sleep there for hours. My belly did not get sore. When my daughter was old enough she would push up on her bell with the boppy, she would sit up with the boppy. And i use it till this day for a pillow when laying with her. THIS IS A MUST HAVE.	
- 1	We were very excited about a swing that would allow us to move the kiddo straight from the car or stroller (Graco Snugrider Stroller Frame) without taking him out of his Snugride 35.  However, we were sorely mistaken when we thought this swing would function as a, well, swing.  The motor isn't even REMOTELY powerful enough to keep the Snugride 35 moving.  Brand new batteries won't get it moving.  Even if you kick start the swing by giving it a push, it will NEVER continue to swing unless you put it on the highest setting (there is a turtle to rabbit scroll wheel that is pretty worthless).  Once below absolute bunny the swing slows to a stop in a matter of seconds.  Not only that, but the fast setting is pretty jerky... way too fast back-and-forth in my opinion.  The vibration setting works fine, and the nature sounds are OK.  Music is, as always, awful.  When will they let us load up our own MP3's into these things?!  Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone... even my baby enemies.	
1. 	Our two year old was getting tired of sitting in his high chair, but wasn't tall enough to sit in a regular chair. This booster seat is the perfect compromise. We have it set to the lowest setting and he is able to sit right at the table (without the tray) and eat with everyone else. The straps make it super secure on the chair, but it also seems pretty easy to take along with us when traveling. Great product and a great value.	
1. 	These trays are wonderful!  I began making my own baby food when my daughter was six months old.  You cook and puree the food, then fill the tray and freeze it.  The thick, rubber lid stays on the tray and does not pop off in the freezer like some other product lids (Baby Cubes in particular).  The food can then be popped out of the tray (like regular ice cubes) and placed into a zip-lock freezer bag for long-term frozen storage.  The product is durable and of high-quality.  I love using these trays as they hold a whole batch of food at one time.  Once I freeze the food and transfer it into a zip-lock bag, then I just pull out what I need (usually 1-2 cubes of food) for each feeding.  I then wash the trays and they are ready for the next batch of homemade food.  I have put everything from pureed and cooked pumpkin to spinach to fresh plums in these trays, and the food comes out tasting great every time!  I highly recommend these trays...you won't be disappointed!	
1. 	These are great for travel as a way to clean your pump & accessories when you're pumping on the go, particularly in the car.  It's much better than putting your parts away without cleaning them until you reach your destination (and then I could totally see myself getting caught up in unpacking and nursing the baby that I would forget to clean the parts until I needed them to pump again).I also called Medela because I was getting a filmy residue on my Calma bottle nipples and they said I could pull these through the nipple to clean them - it's the only thing that worked to eliminate this residue.	
1. 	i used similar-looking bibs that i'd gotten from babiesrus, but when i tried to rinse them with soapy water, the plastic separated from the fabric over time. These bibs are washable, waterproof (like cup-upside-down-on-bib-but-clothes-are-dry waterproof) and i love that they velcro on the side.	
- 1	We were really looking forward to getting this changing table because it looked sturdier than all the rest and the reviews were also good.  Unfortunately the last piece of wood that we unpacked from the box was damaged and the laminate was broken. Except for that, we liked the quality of the wood so we decided to request a replacement. We figured it was just bad luck on this first piece.The replacement arrived a few days later and we were horrifed to see that it looked like it had been left to soak in standing water.  The cardboard under the plastic wrap was almost falling to pieces from having been soaked. It wasn't raining when we received the package so the damage must have occurred in transit.When we called Amazon customer service they explained that by policy, they were unable to process a second replacement on an item for the same reason.  We'd have to request a refund and then reorder the piece if we wanted.  After having two bad experiences with this piece of furniture we wanted nothing to do with a third attempt. Another inconvenience is that the table does not come in a box but in layers of cardboard packaging. So each time we had to return it, I had to run around to try and find pieces of cardboard big enough to patch the package so UPS would accept it. Very disappointing experience.	
1. 	We use this tub for our newborn.  The tub fits directly in my kitchen sink, so no need to bend over and strain to wash the baby.  It has a place to keep my washcloth and her shampoo.  It also has a convenient drain that changes color when the water is too hot.  My baby seems very comfortable in the hammock with the padded head.The only drawback is that the tub is large.  For me, this isn't a problem - I store it in our guest bathtub.  But if you have limited living space, it might not work for you.	
- 1	very nice material, but it just doesn't absorb my sons pee. i originally bought these to use as reusable, earth friendly wipes, but to be honest i got lazy and running back and forth to the sink got old. so i was using them as a pee shield for my baby boy (because as anyone with a boy knows, its unsafe to leave them exposed while changing) and it just doesn't absorb... instead the pee goes down right onto the changing pad, which is exactly what i'm trying to avoid. anyway, so now i have 20 of these and use them to wipe his drool. oh well!	
- 1	I got this for my sons boon highchair. It doesn't stick. At all. Disappointed because he liked batting the flowers around, but it flew off the chair in two seconds. I've found only the Sassy highchair toys stick on our highchair.	
1. 	This makes it very convenient to use the car seat in two cars without having to mess with the seat belt.  Snap in and snap out quickly and easily.	
- 1	After reading all of the great reviews, I ordered these for our baby that is due shortly. Being a new mom, as with everything for Baby, I wash it before it even goes into the nursery. I was very disappointed when I started folding these and found the edges on over half of them already unraveling! Even the low price does not justify such terrible quality.	
1. 	I have had this diaper pail for 14 mos and have loved the convenience of this product.  The last thing you want to have to worry about is buying specific bags for your diaper pail!  A mom has better things to think about and better things to do with her money.  So nice to just be able to use any ordinary trash bag.  This pail has worked great for us. I occasionally clean it out with soap and water.  We are getting to the point now where the diapers are truly stinky, but we just take the diapers out every day along with the regular trash. Recently,  we do get a whiff of stinky diaper when we open it, but I've found that with the genie, too.  I may try putting poopie diapers in a little plastic bag before disposing and see if that helps.  Not a big deal.This is a cost-effective, no-nonsense baby product.  I'd buy it again. Not sure why it's so expensive on amazon. I found it for probably half the price at the big box baby store.	
1. 	It works amazingly to calm and sooth our 8 week old. I used to have trouble getting her to nap during the day and it is so calming for her to relax to fall asleep. A great product!	
- 1	This product is difficult to install properly.  I thought I was ordering the screw less system.  I have given up and ordered a new set	
1. 	This is pretty cool. I thought it would have music, because we received it as a gift, but it does not. Which turns out to be totally fine. It displays stars on the ceiling and lights up different images, if you choose. It's pretty neat and my baby seems to really like it and likes pushing the buttons. It's pretty bright so it's definitely a good night light to fall to sleep to.	
1. 	No fuss, no muss.  It's basically a trash can.  It's no Diaper Decor but it absolutely does the job.  I also like that it has a little compartment on the lid for you to put a deodorizer disc.	
- 1	These bottle produce mildew on the picture. Hello kitty is now green and I've only had this for a couple months.	
- 1	I bought these hoping to have a nice alternative to losing the milk that escapes when I become too full but these are definitely not the product for me.  There is no way to hide these things, they are hard plastic and very apparent.	
1. 	Just what I needed. Overall loving this product so far and would recommend. No issues upon arrival. Happy about my purchase!	
1. 	I got this set to edge our stone hearth, and the color is a nice neutral beige/taupe. The adhesive has stood up to 18 months of abuse by my toddler and pre-schooler. No lifting or peeling. The seams blend nicely together where the corners and straight pieces meet, and its discreet and doesn't scream &#34;BABY PROOFING!&#34; Highly recommended.	
1. 	I was worried this would be a cheaply made cover but it's actually quite soft and durable. I definetly am happy with this purchase!	
- 1	It stopped working the second time I used it. I work from home, so I don't have to pump often, so I decided to stick with the free manual pump I received at the birthing center rather than try a replacement. Fewer things go wrong with fewer parts.I was given a refund quickly without any problems.	
1. 	I have already given this monitor a great review but today I decided to up the review.I have had this monitor for almost three years. It has been dropped on cement, ceramic tile, down the stairs and more and it still works like the day we bought it.. and what a great day that turned out to be. We cannot live without this monitor.We never had any problems with sound or picture, and after 3 years something finally went wrong, the adapter that charges the monitor no longer works.Well I called the Summer Infant support and they are sending me the new adapter FREE of charge. FREE!!!! Now that is customer service!!!We love this monitor and we will do our best to only purchase Summer Infant products due to amazing customer service and quality of products.Thank you Summer Infant!!!UPDATE 5/25/09 We have had this monitor for over 5 years now and it is still going strong. I cant believe it is still working. Our monitor has been dropped a million times, our 4 year old has thrown it, and more has come across this monitor and it still works without any errors or problems. What more can I say!	
- 1	If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan, which I thought it would, it would have  a much better rating.  But turning this thing doesn't really work.  Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet.	
1. 	These are great! I love the way they attach to each other. This way you don't have to be perfectly lined up (a bonus since my bookcases are over 10 feet tall), they are strong, come off if you ever need to move them and were very easy to install. I feel 100% better know my super tall bookcases are attached to the wall and wont tip over (and believe me I tried!!). I recommend these to anyone, especially with young children who love to climb!	
1. 	This high-chair was given to us as a gift...and I LOVE it!!!It was purchased in 2002 for my oldest and am very glad to say that we've taken out of storage in 2006 to use on my second!  I didn't want to try any other product...this one is a keeper!!Comfy, secure, durable, long-lasting, etc. etc. etc.	
- 1	I put new batteries in both units & only 1 unit worked.  I returned the & amazon.com was quick to send the paid return UPS label.  They refunded my money as soon as they were notified I dropped the box off at UPS.  Thanks again Amazon'I bought Safety 1st Crystal Clear Audio Monitor (1 RX) & it works great.	
1. 	We got this in an attempt to get our little girl to play on her tummy and gain head control.  She perfers her back, but we knew we had to get her to her tummy to play if we ever want her to crawl.  So we looked around and found this.  We love our Boppy pillows and decided to give it a try.  So does ok in it but only for a few minutes.  She seems to get bored with the toys and we have to have other things within her reach or she wants out.  But it has gotten her to where she will lay on her tummy more and she has gained great head control in just a few weeks nd is already working on scooting!	
1. 	My TV has buttons on the side going vertically. Around 1 my son kept turning them on and off and on and off......ugh. So I bought the 10X1 one. It's EXCELLENT and fits perfectly. He's a little smarty pants because he tried to take it off at first and struggled but it would not budge. :-D The ONLY downside is that I sometimes like to turn the TV on or off without the remote and since it's there until I remove it forever, I have no way to turn it off unless the remote is handy. But, I'm ok with that because I know it's serving it's purpose and I rather spend 2 minutes looking for the remote than constantly redirecting my child and potentially damaging my electronics with the constant on/off routine (which is how my computer's harddrive died).	
- 1	This very expensive mat has been a giant disappointment.  I bought this for our little one for a soft place to play, learn to crawl and walk on.  I'm not sure why it's so pricey since it looks like a lot of the other puzzle mats you can purchase much cheaper.  For starters, it provides very little cushion (I don't even like to sit on it).  The biggest issue is cleaning it.  It looked nice for about five minutes.  If you just wipe it down, the dirt accumulates between all the pieces and collects underneath it (making a mess of our hardwood floors).  If you want to do the job right, you must take the entire thing apart and clean each peace with a wet cloth, then vacuum underneath it and mop the floor, then let it dry before putting it back together.  It's a HUGE pain.  Same problem if you want to move it to another room.  The other issue is my son likes to take it apart and chew on the pieces, then toss them around the room.  I have since purchased two of the Dwinguler mats (which I love) and are so worth the cost.	
- 1	We have had this for just a few weeks, and it is now totally useless. The screws holding the battery door are a problem. One of them was stripped when we got it, and the door broke as I was trying to get it open to put the batteries into it. No problem, the other screw wasn't stripped so I got that one out and it held on for a few weeks. The door completely broke off last night as my son was turning it on, though, and now the batteries won't stay in to make the thing operational. Since my son likes it so much, I will probably try to rig it with some tape. I wouldn't recommend actually buying it, though.	
1. 	These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total.	
- 1	I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item	
1. 	they are easy to use and operate.  Baby can't take off or manipulate, and they kinda look stylish lol...i constantly get compliments. maybe they are joking when complimenting, but i really do love these things.	
- 1	I bought this for bottles after reading all the positive reviews, but in my experience, nothing stays on it.  The bottles have to be jammed on and they continuously fall off side ways or pop off on top.  I have tried resting everything on top, but that is just as likely to fall.  Usually we just rest things on the counter in front because they are less likely to fall over.  While more attractive on the counter than a traditional bottle rack, I find this almost useless.	
1. 	This saved me a lot of chasing around time.  Easy to operate and extend great lenght for what I needed.  Wife have hard time unlocking it due to require strong manly hand to push down with pressure to unleash the lock.	
1. 	I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.	
1. 	Great base that fits perfect with my car seat. I brought this one so that my mother and husband could have their own base so they would not have to strap the car seat in the hard way. Just one snap and the car seat and base are connected. Easy as pie	
- 1	I read a lot of good reviews on this product and was very dissapointed that I don't detect ANY change in the diaper pail odor. We have a diaper champ and threw these in the bottom. No affect!	
- 1	I bought this toy for my 1 year old. She loves toys that spin. This toy will hold suction for about a minute while she is playing with it. And doesn't hold for much longer when not being played with. I have tried to stick it to her high chair and walker trays. Very disappointed in this toy.	
1. 	This pacifier chain is adorable and we get lots of questions about it. I love that it's also safe for my baby to chew on when he decided the chain is more interesting than the pacifier attached to it. Great product!	
- 1	This would be a great idea for potty training a newborn. It is way too small. I started potty training my daughter early and even when she was a year old it was too small for her. It sits way too low to the ground, and the seat itself is not even a seat. It's just a plastic ring which must be horribly uncomfortable. My daughter refused to use it, so I'm stuck with it and the extra 4 packs of liners for it.	
1. 	We used this for our fire place. There is a raised seat and we used two of the corners and covered the edges. So far it has stuck well and I feel so much better not having to worry about our little guy falling into the sharp edge. Our fire place is tile and the color blends in well!	
- 1	My daughter hates these bibs! The strap is the same plasticy material and every time I put it on my daughter it pulls her hair. If your baby has any hair at all this is not the bin for you.	
- 1	I have found these bibs good, but after 4 months of use they began to go moldy in the seams. I always wash or wipe them after use and then hang them to dry so I am surprised that this has happened. They are now too gross to use so back to the search for the perfect bib!	
1. 	These tweezers are a far more useful tool than those disgusting snot suction things! You have to be quick and precise with these but they do the trick. The tips are small enough to fit into a newborn's nose and blunt enough that if you do touch skin or nose it doesn't hurt. The tweezer is the length of a normal tweezer so it fits nicely in my hand. It is easy to clean and you don't need any filters or hoses. The only downside is I could imagine the tip breaking off if I dropped it enough times since it's plastic. On the other hand, you wouldn't want metal in the baby's nose anyway.	
- 1	This thing is awful.  It's hard so you have a hard time positioning the baby.  It's uncomfortable, you have to hold the baby into position while trying to get your baby to latch on.  Holding your breast, holding your baby's head, and their body keeps rolling back to their back, add other pillows to get the baby to stay in position.  So frustrating!! If you have had a c-section forget it, it applies too much pressure to your abdomen.  Day 2 of being home I sent my mom out with some money to get the Boppy!  Best decision ever!	
1. 	I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise.	
- 1	I was excited about this bumper and it worked for the first couple weeks and then it started sagging. My son is bumping his head on the crib all the time now. It's a little too big for our crib so I've been trying to make it work but even in the places it's not bunching up it still sags. The quality is not that great. I wish I could return it but I've already washed it. I do not recommend this bumper.	
- 1	Our toddler is just able to reach door knobs so we needed something to help prevent her from locking herself into a room. These are ok, but I should have sprung for something a bit nicer. The two pieces snap together kinda poorly and the clamping area on the bottom you use to grasp the knob is flimsy so you really have to work it to get the doors open as an adult. Smaller door knobs just won't work. The lock cover is molded silicon and while it is easy enough to open, it's hard to seat after. Spend a little more money and get something nicer if you can. These keep everyone out...	
1. 	Like it a lot. They are great made material. I change this silicone nipples for 4 months. Only works for evenflo bottles. Highly recommend.	
- 1	This was my second child and my second pump. The first was an inexpensive one i had been given. Though my previous one worked wonderfully, it died after only 5 months of use. So We decided to find a new one. I researched pumps for a good time before selecting this one. It had great reviews and seemed to fit my needs.Unfortunately I now dread pumping. Inf act, I hate pumping with this pump.~As others have said the soft cup warps and has changed color, even with careful cleaning and up keep.~I seldom get more then an ounce or two. It pumps well if i'm engorged, but i'm not always engorged. I have big breasts, they don't need to be engorged to have plenty of milk. In fact, I hand express more milk then this pump gives me. so lately, i find myself hand expressing often.~It takes way to long to get very very little. I have 2 daughters the oldest of which is still under 2. Meaning, i need to take care of her too. breastfeeding takes enough time, spending an additional hour for a meager ounce isn't worth it. at all.~The feature that is suppose to help cause Let Down.. is a let down. it doesn't work. I have most success if I pump one side after my daughter has nursed for a few minutes. The pump does work if I have already let down. Then it might go smooth and i can get a few more ounces. I find myself running for the breast pump if I let down when my daughter doesn't need to eat.. unfortunately its not convent and not always possible to do. Therefore its frustrating.~Have to be extra careful to help prevent milk from getting in the tube. There is no freedom to sit around and pump with ease, I usually have one girl or another in my arms and need to juggle more then one activity (ESPECIALLY IF ONE ACTIVITY TAKES SO LONG). If the tube gets pinched, even for a second there is milk in the tube. I HATE cleaning it out to keep the motor safe.I also dislike leaving the motor running after pumping to let the condensation in the tubes evaporate. Its doable, however its an annoyance.----Comparing my old ($50 Evenflow pump) and my new ($150 Medela Swing):Old: by 3 months of use I had 15 packs of unused breastmilk stored in the freezernew: I have 1/2 a bottle of breastmilk stashed in the fridgeOld: 3 ounces in 10 minutesNew: 2 ounces (maybe) in 40 minutesOld: No tubing, bottle and nipple shield attached directly to motor base. EASY cleaning.New: tube attaches bottle/nipple shield to motor base, need to let motor run after use to clear up condensation.Old: Could hold and play with Baby while pumpingNew: Playing with baby may result in pinched tube which WILL cause milk backing up into tube and maybe motor. This means extra cleaning. Cleaning the motor is a pain, but important for keeping the pump working right.Old: Died after 5 months of use.New: still going after 7 months of use. :-) yey?Makes a decent back up pump, in case of engorgement but that's the only time I find it useful. I find that i do love the pump when i'm engorged and in pain... nothing like getting milk out quickly. Because it works when I'm engorged and because its still working after 7 months.. I give it a 2 star and not 1.	
- 1	I do not like this product at all.  It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience.  My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in.  I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him.  I do not recommend this product.	
- 1	We were not able to install this safely due to a cross-threaded screw.  The company was willing to send a new one, but I decided to return the whole gate.  It was slightly too small without the extension that is included, and the extension made it too wide for our staircase, so we would have had to purchase a different extension direct from Regalo anyway.  By that point, I would have spent more than just going to Babies R Us and getting the more expensive gate.	
1. 	This easy and to the point.  It attaches easy and very tight which you need.  Can move around for best angle to see your child.  That's it.  Just easy and works.	
- 1	Not all that soft, horrible for swaddling. My baby breaks out of it within 5 min. Cloud b's blanket or miracle blanket ( for hot summers) works much better for swaddling.They r pretty designs tho....I use them more blankets now. It's not SPF, so I'm not using them for that, as I see a lot of hoity toity mothers do, showing off their $45 sunshades by having the blanket over the stroller. please.	
1. 	Works out well for the 3 year old that sleeps on it.  She loves it!  I put a blanket over the bed so there are no issues with anything poking her.  Love that it folds up and stores in a small package.  Great buy for the price!	
1. 	For our son as a newborn. No problems with cleaning or melting in the dishwasher. Avent products have done us well since our son was born.	
- 1	I can't remember how old our daughter was when we got some of these for her snacks. Maybe 9 months. But within minutes she learned she could push into it along the edges, flip it upside down, and shake all the contents out onto the floor or wherever she was. We may as well have given the snacks to her in a cup without a lid.My wife picked up a Munchie Mug (Munchie Mug - The New Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Made in the USA. - BPA Free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top) and this one did the trick! Our daughter can reach her hand into it and pull out a piece of snack or two, but she can't empty the entire contents. Yes, it costs more, but I'm willing to pay more for superior products that actually get the job done.We will still use these Munchkin ones on occasion when the other snack mug is dirty or we can't find it, but we always use them reluctantly. Save yourself a lot of hassle and get the Munchie Mug instead	
1. 	This is a great baby gate and works perfect for what we need. The only issue we have had with it is that after a while of banging it back and forth going up and down stairs, it has started to twist a little.	
- 1	My husband and I both tried to use this shade and it just constantly blew back on windy days thereby defeating the purpose.  It is not 'firm' enough to withstand even a breeze really.  We tried attaching it every which way to keep it stable and we just couldn't get it to work well.  Not to mention, our son really likes to look around and it blocks his view a lot.  I'm still looking for a good solution to the sun issue!	
1. 	I bought this for my child's nursery. He is now 3 months old and we are on our second bag (we just used up the one that came with the diaper pail at 2 months). So far, no odors. The bags do have a light scent which may help odor control. I love that I do not feel like I am wasting bags. I can cut the bags and make a new one when its full or if his diapers get too smelly when we introduce solid food, I will cut the bags and take them out sooner. I usually take out 1 bag a week (full!). They fit a lot of diapers inside. I recently purchased a second diaper dekor plus for the downstairs as our regular trash can was starting to smell a bit. I absolutely love this diaper pail and recommend it!!	
- 1	We ended up sending this one back.  You can't swivel the camera with the monitor, so when your kid becomes mobile you can't move the camera to see where they've gone, which makes the camera a little useless.  Summer Infant makes better monitors than this one.	
- 1	These containers have the WORST dry erase system possible. I was able to use that the first time, and then the band either rubbed off or the marker wouldn't erase so that I could update the contents and date. I tried to contact the company directly and they didn't even bother to reply, so clearly they are not interested in having customers that are happy or will recommend their product. Honestly, save your money. I ended up just buying some jarred organic food, using it periodically and then reused the glass jars with much greater success.	
- 1	I purchased this tubing to replace the tubing that came with my Medela Pump in Style Advanced.  Only one of the tubes worked.  The other had a hole in it and therefore had no suction.  I would not purchase tubing from this company again.	
1. 	Our daughter is, was, and still is enthralled with this mobile from the time she started sleeping in her crib. She LOVES the toys that rotate on this, and as she has gotten older upon waking she is even smiling and &quot;talking&quot; to them without them moving she likes the mobile so much! At night we put it on one rotation with the ocean sound and &quot;knock on wood&quot; she always falls asleep NO JOKE. We rarely if ever use the remote, but it does work. The music is a little tinny for my husband and I, but she absolutely adores it. The way the music/waves fade is great at bedtime. And the way the mobile pauses to let little eyes focus is just right. I was a little cautious when registering for this because I thought it to be a little pricey, but with the selection of 3 sets of toys to hang for different ages it is well worth it. I would highly recommend this mobile!	
1. 	Fits the 3 inch Dream on me mattress nicely.  The quilting is just the right thickness and softness.  Washes well.	
1. 	Huge. Can be taken apart and used in multiple places at once if you don't need to make a giant baby playpen. Cheaper then buying multiple ones for different locations. A little difficult to take apart, but it's sturdy.	
1. 	At first, we wondered why we would ever need 12 bottles, but after pumping, we saw that it was a good packaging choice by Medela. These are easy to carry out and easy to store. They're also easier to wrangle when you're first learning to bottlefeed a baby with your other arm full. These are compatible with the Medela nipple collars for the larger Medela bottles.	
1. 	This is a great tub.  We used this for about a year before it sprung a little leak (well, my husband who is responsible for blowing it up might say it is was a big leak!).  It came with a patch kit, but we had misplaced it, so we ended up buying a new one about 6 months ago and it is still going strong.I can't be bothered with using the drain - this is such a small tub, so I can't comment on how the drain works on ours, but I just use a little muscle and flip the whole thing over to empty the water out.  Just lift the duck with one hand and put your finger under the suction cup with the other hand and you are good to go.  We don't do a soap fill up and then a rinse fill up - we just rinse after soaping, and it has worked great.My kids love the quacking noise, although they cannot see it in the tub, which is a little weird, but they like it anyway.  The duck is definitely large, so it can be an issue with a small space. But we have made it work...	
- 1	This was comfortable for about a month, then started getting smashed down. By the end of my pregnancy, it was lumpy and flat, and there is no way it would last through more than one. The size was great but the quality was not.	
- 1	I stored some in the freezer for when I go back to work. After only two weeks in the freezer, I defrosted one to see how easily things would go, needless to say, after warming it up, the smell was horrific.  I had some Lanisoh bags and I defrosted one of those, much better. If you end up with this box, I would not suggest freezing, store in the fridge with the four day rule then toss.	
1. 	This is better now that my daughter is a little taller. She is not quite ready for using this by herself, but we have higher toilets so this helps.  I wish it were a little bit more stable but for the price, a good product.	
1. 	Very quick, gentle, quiet when I am using it. Very good. I want to extend my breast feeding because of this product because it makes my express milk life easier.	
1. 	I have two of these.  One in black (onyx) and one in brown (huntington).  Most of the britax's are plush (fuzzy and hot).  The onyx is better than most.  The huntington is cozy but I do find it a little hot.  We just got a new suv that has rear air so the hotness is not quite a problem now.  With the rear air I will probably not get a replacement cover that is cooler.  In my other suv which was a darker color and did not have rear air I probably would have gotten another onyx cover.  The onyx has a little plushness on it but mostly it is smooth (once you take out the extra padding for small babies).Overall a great seat.  Probably better than any other but it's not perfect.  The side-impact protection seems flimsy and I could see that it might break easily (which is mentioned in other reviews).  And some people rave about the straps.  I find they get twisted up pretty frequently.  And I dont like the tightening mechanism.  It is difficult to pull.  The ratcheting action is not as easy to use as the smooth pull that I loved on my infant graco safeseat.But I do feel that my child is safe.  Installation with the latch system is pretty easy.  Installation with a seat belt is quite difficult and will likely require 2 people to get it tight enough.  I can put in the seat with latch and tether in probably 5-7 minutes.  Not something you'd want to do everyday but not too bad.  I really like the tether.  It adds alot of stability.Note: I am using this seat rear facing, center seat, in a Toyota Sequoia for a 22 pound 19 month old.	
- 1	I purchase this wrap when my son was a newborn in hopes of replacing my Moby Wrap. While I love the Moby, it is SO HOT. I live in Georgia and my son was born in the spring. I needed a lighter fabric that would be comfortable in the humid ninety-plus degree heat.The fabric is much lighter weight and much cooler than the moby. It's also beautiful colors and I received many complements on it in the few times that I have used it.However, it is not nearly as comfortable as the Moby Wrap. The Moby is made of a soft stretchy cotten that is soft on my skin and baby's. With this wrap, the edges dug into my shoulders the heavier my son became. It also seemed to rub under his legs.This wrap was useful to me while he was small enough to keep his legs tucked into the wrap (until about 8 weeks). Up to that point he was not heavy, so it didn't rub my shoulders. My son is now 18 pounds at 4 months and I can no longer use it. It was far too expensive for such little use.* I followed the instructions on the DVD, but some people may be able to tie the wrap to avoid the problems that I had. I purchased a Beco rather than continue experimenting with this wrap. It's so much easier.	
- 1	These outlet covers are dome shaped, making them easy to grasp. There is a cutout feature in the center to make it easier for adults to get them out.That is a joke as my under one year old can just take them out and just hand them to me!Do not purchase this item, it is unsafe.	
1. 	My son would not sleep without this!!!!!!!!!!! It was a life saver for me and when he grew out of the size small I got this one in large and it worked perfect!!!!!!!!! It is the only kind he couldn't wiggle out of :)	
- 1	I bought these when I was just starting out making baby food for my son. My strategy at the time was to make large batches of food to freeze and then thaw day by day. Eventually I moved away from that strategy, but I gave up on these containers before that.The silicone bowl portion of the container sits in a plastic ring, which screws into the blue lid. The silicone bowl has a tiny notch in it that is supposed to keep it from turning in the ring, but it's not enough to overcome the force of screwing and unscrewing the lid, so the silicone bowl turns and buckles while you're trying to get the darn thing open. Plus, the ring and lid are both so small that it's hard to get a real grip on them with your hands while trying to open and close the container. It's a cuss-fest.I ended up using the OXO tot square containers with the green lids to store purees. They worked great for me.	
1. 	Has worked very well on a variety of toilets, and my son prefers having it when we're out so it makes it more likely that he'll tell me he needs to go, which is great.	
1. 	I use this on my Maclaren Quest Sport.  Pros: you can fold it up with the stroller, and has extra storage for cell phone and maybe a diaper or two and travel wipes container.  Cons: didn't fit Avent bottles or larger sippy cups (we use Tommee Tippee), cup holders only fit pint sized waterbottles & other plastic bottles (like 20 oz soda for example)- and a definite NO to those paper take out cups(we learned the hard way) I bought a cheap cupholder seperately (Munchkin).  Overall, it is worth buying to save yourself some aggravation with the hard-to-access basket on the Maclaren stroller when seat is reclined.	
1. 	The bibs are great at catching food, drips and liquid. Easy to clean and durable. Love it, it's the only bib I use now.	
- 1	I bought these sippy cups based on the great reviews, but I'm disappointed. Yes, they don't leak, but my daughter (2 yrs old) has a hard time sucking the milk/juice from them, like the spill proof seal is a little too tight. And even when she does get the milk out, there is always about a half inch left that she can't get out because the spill proof insert sticks out too much and doesn't allow the milk to funnel down... even when I tried to drink from it to see why she was struggling with getting that last bit out, I couldn't. Bad design... wasteful and it frustrates my daughter because she can see more in the cup but can't get it out.	
1. 	When my baby was a born I used this pillow constantly! Since you can not take the cover off, I always put a blanket over it. I've spot cleaned it, but it does kinda suck that I can just put it in the wash every once in a while. I am not a crazy germaphobe and with the blanket over it, he never really spit up on it or anything. Before he was mobile he was always lying in his pillow. I will say it's not very good at propping my baby up as he is learning to sit up, he just tumbles over. So as of right now, I use it more as a back cushion. He still nurses but we never use it anymore for that.	
- 1	My daughter does not like these cups, so I don't like them.  It's too hard on her mouth and too hard to get any liquid out. They also don't click when screwing the lid on, unless you're extremely muscly.  She is 15 months old, who knows, maybe she will use them when she is older.  She did much better with the NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, 10-Ounce, when going from bottle to cup.	
- 1	I loved the idea that there was a place for her to hold the teether to be able to chew but this thing is huge and heavy. She just ends up dropping it and going for something smaller to chew on.	
- 1	We try and use a regular cup as much as possible with our 14 month old - but sometimes you just need to give them a drink in a cup that won't spill. So, we keep these for those times when we are out and about.  I own 5 of the Nuk Learner cups- and I've now had to replace the nipples on all of them. I'm about to go buy replacement nipple #6 and #7, as my daughter has bitten through the top, sometimes getting small pieces of the silicone in her mouth!  Nothing she could choke on, but still not good for her.  I wish they made these in a hard version that fit on the cup for once the child was ready to transition off the soft spout.  Until then, I'll keep buying replacement spouts - which is costing a fortune.	
- 1	Really want these to work for me.  I read so many positive reviews, but they sre simply no good for me.  I put them on immediately after having our fifth baby.  They felt great! Soft, warm, very natural feeling and looking.  Then my milk came in.  My husband was thinking of building an ark to save us from the flood that was coming from under my shirt!  The pads leaked thru.  The pads leaked around the edges.  Milk was literally dripping down my chest as i lay in bed nursing my sweet baby.  When i removed the pads, i expected them to be saturated.  No.  Just in the spot that was directly over my nipple.  So, not only did the pads leak thru, they somehow repelled the milk and shunted it out of my bra, hence the milk was dripping across my chest.I decided to give the pads another go once my milk supply stabilized and the engorgement had resolved.  Well, the pads leaked in the same manner with the very first feed.I emailed the company and they did not respond.  So, since i foolishly bought two pairs plus the lanolin soap...i'm out $60.	
1. 	the fabric is really nice and the holes for the straps are on the sides so they don't get in the way	
- 1	Do not buy these. They come with double sided stickers, to fasten them to the surface. I put them on my coffee table as the corners are at a height my baby could hit the, By the next day he had already pulled 2 off and once they've been stuck once, they won't stick again. Useless!	
- 1	Our baby had diaper rash so we stopped using the real nappies and cloth diapers all together.  The Real Nappies was great at keeping the poop and pee in, but our baby went pee and poop so much (sometimes every 3 minutes) in the first 0-3 months, that the cloth diapers didn't work since they don't wick away the wetness.  We also didn't use the Real Nappies until baby's umbilical cord fell off because it would contact the umbilical cord.  Using cloth diapers also makes the bottoms of outfits tighter since they are puffier.	
1. 	I use this organizer all the time!! It holds my Avent bottles perfectly.  It has a place for everything!!  I do have leaks somethings but thats only when I don't hang it over the side of the sink (duh, right).  It also doesn't take up that much space on my kitchen counter.**update**My baby is now 7.5 months old and I still use this organizer! She is now learning how to use the sippy cup and it fits on here perfectly as well!  I put the valves in the little valve basket!  I still give this bottle organizer 5 stars!!	
1. 	This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.	
1. 	I really love this dresser it has the perfect size and it looks cute in our nursery. It can fit a changing pad and you can still have wipes and a few small things next to it. I'm 7 months pregnant and I put it together all by myself. I have to admit it took me a while and you need patience but after 2 1/2 hours it was complete.	
- 1	I rarely review products, but I love aden + anais, and this did not meet my expectations at all. I tried to double check the description and didn't find anything about it being a lightweight version... The sleep sak we received as a gift (with the frog pattern) is much thicker, has a sturdy zipper and has an overall better quality than this one.  This one will likely be used for summer, since it is so lightweight -- but that is only if it holds up.  The material and the zipper are so flimsy that the whole thing is already wearing out after 2 washes. Part of me wonders if it's counterfeit!	
1. 	I love this product.  I put it in my baby's bassinet and it keeps him right in the middle of the bassinet.  Plus it's a little softer than than the thin cushion my bassinet came with.	
- 1	I love how the tub closes up real flat, makes it easy to store. The item is very stylish and cook looking. However, I had to return it cuz my child kept slipping down the plastic and got water in his ears! It was so hard washing him while having to hold him up constantly.	
1. 	This sheet gets used ALL the time!  It's like sleeping on cotton I think.  My little guy loves it and it keeps him comfy as well as dry (if he has any issues while sleeping).	
1. 	This seat protector has been great at keeping seats looking new and catching snacks the little one has dropped!  Easy to clean too.	
1. 	I got these after trying out one and falling absolutely in love with it.  First, it is really lightweight and the design is adorable.  Keith Haring being one of my favorite artists with those whimsical designs?  LOVE at first bite:) My little one loves the designs and the fact that it has an easy on easy off velcro is not a problem because when he's done eating, bib comes off quickly.  The pocket is so helpful in catching those little bits that toddlers toss down or drop en route to the mouth.  As well, it wipes clean easily and dries very quickly.  And even despite washing, those fabric bibs will retain some traces of odor or staining from food no matter how many times you wash them.  I love these.  I highly recommend the product for it's design, ease of use, and ease to clean!	
- 1	The mobile looks really pretty. However, I used this mobile for not more than 30 mins and the battery was dead. It uses 3 C batteries.	
- 1	I was hoping this would solve the washing-hair problem every night for my super squirmy toddlers, but the water kept on getting into their ears even if I hold them still and seal the front as much as I could.  Now we simply use it as a water bucket.	
1. 	I love this crib.Let me tell you why.1.  It fits in doorways, meaning you can move it from the nursery to your room without breaking it down.  My baby hated the sleep and play thing that I had planned to use in our room, so I moved this one in our room at night, and back to nursery for naps.  Took about 3 mins at night, and 3 mins in the morning.2.  It rocks.  Literally.  You can rock the baby to sleep which helps them learn to go to sleep without being held.  Or when they fuss at night.  He is 7 months old, and we still love the rocking feature.3.  Well made.  As much as we move it, it is still tight and holding up great.4. Space saver in shared room.  My older two had full size cribs, which seems silly now.  They both were climbing out of the crib long before they ever got close to outgrowing it.  Babies are small, duh.5.  It is pretty.  It doesn't look like you old school portacrib.6.  You can lower the matress REALLY low, like to the floor low.  Which is great for my 7 month old who pulls up in it all the time.  I don't think he'll be able to climp out for a long time.Things I don't like:1.  You have to buy an additional matress because the one that comes with it is only about 1 inch thick.  But for this price...not a big deal.	
1. 	A set came with my original pump but they melted a bit during sterilization so I ordered new when I had my second baby.  I pumped A LOT (make or buy yourself a hands free pumping bra, Mums!) FT working Mom and second baby had reflux and didn't nurse well.  One lesson I learned is that you buy the shields for your nipple size, not your breast size.  I bought larger shields thinking I would need them being well endowed, but they were painful.  Turns out big boobs don't mean big nipples and the standard shields were prefect for me.  The soft plastic in this set provides extra comfort that the solid shields do not.  I used both, but these were better.	
1. 	I bought this when my son was born 27 months ago and have never had one problem with it.  Replacing the moist pad is easy and affordable.  They last for a few months if you soak them in water to clean them between wipes refills.  I could not have lived with out this wipes warmer the past two years of changing diapers.  I highly recommend it!	
- 1	I received this as a gift, unforutnately it didn't fit on our stroller (pretty standard Graco Travel System) or on our carseat (either our Grace or our Marathon) and so it was pretty useless.	
- 1	I bought one of these and one of another brand, and put one in each car.  The other one worked great, but the bar at the bottom of this one warped in the sun within the first week.  It simply wasn't worth anything, since the other brand cost about the same and was more durable.	
1. 	I got this as a gift at my shower.. Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one. I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it.  Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast.	
1. 	solo viertes un poco de agua en este esterilizador, introduces los teteros y lo metes al microondas y listooo, ya estan excelente para darle la leche al bebe....	
1. 	I saw this and just had to get it. It's good to wash and sterilize all bottles and breast pump parts before using them the first time.I own the Avent Isis breastpump and this has grooves for it to click into-very cool! I like to sterilize my pump once or twice a week, and once a week I sterilize the bottles and nipples.I can't ever wait for the washer to run, so instead of waiting, I just throw everything I want sterilized into the microwave for 4 minutes and it's done. It's so easy and simple.And it keeps things sterile for 3 hours unless you pop open the top right away!	
1. 	the fabric is really nice and the holes for the straps are on the sides so they don't get in the way	
- 1	Quality is sub par and doesn't match the ones sold in stores. It's as if I got a fake version	
1. 	These are the only bottles my son will use and of course this design is discontinued. I took away a star because I got a pack with 3 pink bottles. Figures. FYI - the Dr. Brown's nipples fit these bottles exactly the same as the Playtex and you can still get those in the store. Way cheaper than trying to find the Playtex ones.	
- 1	Didn't feel great and we don't really use them because I feel like its too harsh on my baby's soft skin.. So don't bother. Just use your hands to wash your baby.	
1. 	I keep these in my diaper bag wherever I go.  These are small enough to stuff anywhere in case you need to throw a smelly diaper away!	
1. 	We used this on a full size bed.  Our house was for sale and had showings, inspections, etc continuously for a month so I had to make sure the bed was made every day.  It was very easy to lower the rail to make the bed.  It stayed securely in place.  I'd recommend it.	
- 1	Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it.Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.	
- 1	It was very messy and my son just spilled the drink everywhere.Maybe he wasn't ready. Now that he is using a straw I might revisit this cup and update the review.	
- 1	It checks the temp every two seconds but it doesn't show you the actual temperature until it has been in the water for about a minute because it gradually figures out what temperature it is. So if the temperature changes fast it doesn't notice right away. It worked decently for the first few weeks but then it stopped recognizing that it had been taken out of the water unless you shake the water out of it for about a minute or two. So it starts beeping thinking that it's still in the water and the temperature is too cold or something.	
1. 	Since my son started sitting in high chairs at restaurants, I've always worried about him eating off the dirty tables (or licking them).  So when I found this rubber placemat, I thought it was perfect for eating out.  It takes up very little space in the diaper bag since it rolls up into its catch tray, it's super easy to wipe clean, and it doubles as a protective guard so my baby doesn't hit his face against the edge of tables.  The suction is pretty decent, it sticks on most surfaces.  All in all, for how inexpensive it is, it is a great product!!	
- 1	This never stayed stuck to the tray, even when he was quite small it didn't take much effort to break the suction.	
- 1	At first glance I thought this would be a great toy for my 6-month old who loves chewing and holding items by herself. But then I realized that the wings are filled with some liquid-goo item and the plastic that contains it does not seem very thick. I pressed my nail into it and it feels like my nail could pierce through if I pushed hard enough! There is NO way that I am going to give this to my teething baby that loves to stick her sharp little budding teeth into everything as hard as she can. I have no idea what the liquid is, but it is not something I want her to swallow.That, plus the fact that other reviewes say that bits of the handle have come apart in their kids' mouths, I just don't think that this toy is safe. Sassy needs to redesign the product or tell parents that the goo will not come out. Even then, I would still not trust it. So many toys out there, why take the risk?	
- 1	I love all the orange ones I bought and love this products so much. However for the blue one I bought, it leaks, turns out that either the lid or the bottle is not round shape so those two never go together. Need better quality control.	
- 1	I decided to splurge on my second son's mattress. I bought my first son a regular mattress without considering the materials and off-gassing, etc. this seems to be a nice mattress but it is very heavy and doesn't quite fit well in my pottery barn Kendall crib. I always have to jam the corners down and the mattress seems to be slightly too big for the crib. The mattress also seems to slope down from the middle to the sides and my newborn (less than a week old) somehow rolled down to the crib side when swaddled.  I would not buy this mattress again.	
- 1	Bought these for the inside of our diaper pail. What a waste of money; they don't help at all. No fresh scent, no masking stinky scents; absolutely no difference at all. Very disappointing. Don't waste your $ on these.	
1. 	This product is so convenient.  I saw other mom's deal with the sterilization issue by boiling everything, what a time consuming process.  This way it's all done in less than ten minutes and you can be doing other things during the process.  The only suggestion I would make is to increse the number of bottles you could sterilize at one time.  Great product.	
1. 	I wish I had taken this to the hospital with me...it would have made breast feeding so much easier.  Instead, I was forced to use multiple pillows, which would slip and slide all over the place.  Frustrating!  As soon as I got home, however, I started using this product, and breast feeding went much more smoothly.  This pillow is the perfect shape to hold the baby while breast feeding, and the fact that it has a strap to secure it onto your body is wonderful.	
1. 	We have two landings where we use these gates and they work really well for them. The first one was a little tricky to install but the second was much easier to do. I love the magnetic latch because I know the gate will close every time. It can be difficult to open sometimes but I'd rather that than have it open too easily and have my child sneak through.	
1. 	blocks are made in the USA, brightly colored. The reviews were good (paint don't chip) so they were chosen over others (anticipating my son to be biting it quite a bit). Bought this for my little one.	
1. 	We really like this potty chair, got this in pink color and it looks very cute. It's stable but at the same time very light. The back part is very comfortable i think, it lets ur baby lean back relax and concentrate on the important process :) also its very easy to clean, just take the white part out and wash it. We are very happy with this product.	
- 1	Every time I scan I get a different reading, even when using it on myself. It's OK to give you a ballpark number on older kids, but you end up scanning over and over for an average.Our pediatrician requested a temperature reading from a rectal thermometer for our infant which she said was most reliable. Yet, they use ear scanners in her office. I probably should have gotten one of those instead.	
- 1	it will detour the smaller toddler but those with a purpose or a stronger arm can easily open the door.  Our son who was only 2 actually was able to break the first one to get into his sister's room.  I wouldn't dare put it on a door that I needed to for the child's physical safety (although getting into his 11 year old sister's room might be considered a safety risk!	
1. 	I know they make these with a huge bulb on them now, but I still use the pairs of these I had from 10.5 years ago when my son was born.  I clip my 10 and 4 year olds' nails with these and they are steady and perfect and still clip fine.  Just bought a pair for a new mom-to-be friend, and have gifted them in the past.  These are all you need! And maybe some reading glasses and good light!	
- 1	These were my second attempt to find a good sippy cup with a straw and I'm disappointed yet again. I thought, based on the reviews, that these would be better than the other cups I'd tried - which had too many parts - but they really aren't. Sure, there is one less piece to the straw, but you have to dismantle the flip top to get the straw apart (ultimately resulting in the same number of parts). And they are just as tricky to get apart. They also hold less liquid than the others. Finally, and MOST disappointing, these leaked more than the previous brand I tried - a lot more. So, ultimately, I'm going to end up using these for water and buying more of the others for everything else. Now I need to go ammend my other review...	
- 1	these medela nipples (regardless of which size) always collapse when then baby eats from them. granted, it's handy that they fit right onto the bottles. but that's it.	
- 1	We got this and used it on our daughter from when she was a newborn. We only bathed her a couple of times a week for the first 2 months, then every other day until she was 6 months old, and now 5 times per week. However, the plug kept shedding rubber - pieces were coming off - almost every time I used it. It is now held together by a thin sliver of rubber, and removing it is a gentle wiggling process and pushing it out from the bottom. She's just 10 months old.The setup is sort of awkward. The sling was the worst. If I had to go back to newborn, I'd never fill the tub with water, but use the sling just for sponging and rinsing with an external stash of water. For the rest, until she was heavier than 15 pounds and able to sit on her own, she kept stretching out and floating upward (and this is having her head on the toddler/child side, which props them straight up). There is a knob there that is supposed to catch their butts, but if the baby is too light I guess it doesn't work. I had to fashion a sort of belt to hold her in until she got big enough. Now that she is big enough, she can wiggle around and splash and have fun.I'm not entirely sure what the reservoir behind her head is for. I stash the soap bottles and stuff there, but it often fills with dirty/soapy bathwater water. I'm not sure if it's there for water or what. Actually, there are a lot of such places that hold water. There are grooves in the side that aren't useful but are an artifact of the molding process. They are annoying to clean and are the first to feel gooky, so I guess they let me know when it's time to scrub out the tub with bleach.This tub is for children, but there is a big warning that it contains small parts and isn't suitable for children below 3 years. So what gives?Anyway, it holds water. Or it will until the plug is done breaking.	
1. 	I love this!  It is the only thing that helped my baby learn to sleep at night.  Fisher price is a wonderful company also.  After I was done using this  put it in storage where the seat padding and headrest got damaged.  I was able to buy a replacement for only $12 so thankful for that and that I did not have to buy a brand new one for baby number 2!	
1. 	I can not say enough about this product.  My little one liked to be swaddled.  It gave my husband and I (any my little one too) the gift of many hours of extra sleep.  Without M.B-->she would sleep 4 hours max.  With M.B.-->10+.  (DID YOU SEE THAT!  MORE THAN 6+ hours extra in a row!)  As a working couple...that was priceless.  It was a sad day when she outgrew it.  She is verrrrrrrry long and grew out of it at ~4 mo. which is about when they should be transitioned to free-style sleeping (as I have been told anyway.)I buy this for all my expecting friends.P.S. Ignoring the 'straight-jacket' comments will be easy with all the extra rest you will be getting!	
- 1	TERRIBLE.  It BARELY bounces.  Honestly, sometimes you'll even think it's not working.  Our daughter needs a decent amount of bounce and this just did not cut it.  Not even close.  So we returned and got a regular bouncer that we bounce w/ our foot!	
1. 	My son is about 15lbs and just over 25 inches.  He fits perfectly in this lying down.  It supports his head and neck if he wants to lay back.  My little guy loves it.  It has a no slip bottom which I love.  Hangs to dry right on the bar in the tub.  No mildew smell so far.  We've been using it for 2 months.	
- 1	It just stains so easily it's not worth having it. I took the cover off and it's better that way. My friend has some black water proof changing pads, I'm beginning to see that's the way to go, would be nice to have them to put over the changing pad.	
1. 	I found that the idea of this bather was excellent.  Sadly, it did not fit in my sink.  I ended up using it as a cushion on the counter to dress her in.  I do not bath my baby without it.	
1. 	Puts my baby girl to sleep everytime.  It's amazing, wrap her up in this thing and she goes right to sleep and will sleep ALL NIGHT!!!!!!  Very soft too and very warm	
1. 	Super cute, so fun. It was a lot lighter than I expected, but it is very adorable. It really provides a calming light and fun to a room. We love it.	
1. 	What is good about this SuperBib:LightweightCan wipe off or washGood size to cover growing babyVelcro closure that goes on well and is a nice size for those cute little short necks.	
1. 	I love the inside mesh bag that I can remove and take with me to the washing machine. It makes holding your little one while carrying all their laundry a snap!! And to the New Mommy from College Station, TX, I'm a new mommy also, but aren't you supposed to soak poopy clothing so that it doesn't stain the outfit?!? That just seems kind of gross but that's just me. I personally love this hamper and would definitely recommend it!	
1. 	Basic heavy plastic gate for a great price. Easy set up and worth it! It's cheap and functional but not flimsy.	
- 1	We got this product as a gift from a friend of mine and boy did we looked forward to get it because our little boy loves giraffes. He simply adores that animal so our friend thought that this will be perfect.When i saw it and when i saw the reviews i got very excited and i couldnt wait to see our baby`s face when we show it to him.But the thing is this ...We got it. And it looked perfect. So i put it in the washer and washed it as described. It said dry flat so i did that too. And the next day i laid it flat and put our little boy on it. He was sooo happy, he was simply smiling and biting the giraffe`s head.  For some reason i looked at his little face and i noticed little hairs. When i pinched a little from the furry part of the giraffes head, i got a finger full of fabric.Immediately i put it again in the washer. Washed it again and still the same thing. The fabric keeps coming out :-((Now im scared to put our little guy on it because i dont want him to end up swallowing any of it. He is at a stage where he licks and bites everything.I am wondering if i should write the company about this or not.I always get good products from amazon, i have bought so many items here and this time i feel cheated :-(Its a child product and i dont think that they should be exposed to something like this, at any age. No parents would want their kids to end up having a mouth full of fabric.Please if u have some advice on how to make it stop loosing fabric, im all ears. Our baby really likes it. I like it. Except for the fact of constantly releasing fabric :-(((	
- 1	I don't understand how this is marketed as a toddler/child pillow.  It's way, way too lofty, even for an adult.  There's no way this can be used as a first toddler pillow or even as a child's pillow.  It might work as a travel pillow for use in a car or airplane.  I can't think of any other sleep-related use for it.If you're looking for a toddler pillow (for a kid who's used to sleeping without a pillow), tryClevamama ClevaFoam Toddler Pillow, Cream.  It's the thinnest small pillow I've found and my toddler (22 months old when we got it) took to it right away.  He'd shown signs of wanting a pillow, by using them on the couch and on adults' beds, so we took his cue.The only problem with the Clevamama pillow is that it doesn't fit into toddler pillowcases.  We ended up putting it width-wise into a king-size pillowcase and tucking the excess under the toddler mattress.  That's actually a pretty good solution because it forces the pillow to stay put.Bottom line:  This small pillow is way, way too thick for even a side-sleeping toddler or child to use comfortably.  Don't waste your time or money on it.NOTE FOR PROSPECTIVE PARENTS:  This is my one piece of advice that I wish I'd known when we were buying things in advance of our first child's delivery.  If you're like most modern parents, you're going to have a lot of tiny beds with different-sized mattresses, mattress pads, and sheets.  You're also going to be doing a lot of laundry.  These various sheets are different sizes, but it can be hard to tell which is which when they come out of the dryer.  You do not want to be fighting with the sheets when it comes time to remake a bed after a vomit or feces incident.The solution is to choose ONE color for the sheets of a particular size and stick to it.  For instance, get all green crib sheets.  Make all of your co-sleeper sheets cream.  For the pack 'n' play?  All brown.  (The brown will hide travel smudges, too.)  Buy white or yellow toddler sheet sets.  Also, get alaundry markerand write a code for the size on the mattress pads' labels.People got you fancy bedding sets (which, if they contain padded elements, can be dangerous for infants)?  You bought into the hype and got all kinds of crazy sheets for the crib?  Return them if you can.  Or consign them.  Or give them away.  Seriously, having a unified color for each size sheet will simplify your life for YEARS to come, especially if you have more than one kid.	
1. 	i was looking for something that can let me use my medela pump and pump right into my avent bottles, and found this adaptor to use.  i usually pump and feed right away so this saves me using the medela pump bottles and then pouring into another avent bottle.  the only thing is, you must remember to put the adaptor ring on the avent bottle before you put this adaptor on, if not, it will leak if you don't stay upright.  this package comes with the adaptors for the avent nurser kit too, but i've never use it, and i wish they just sell them separately.	
1. 	At only 3 weeks old, my son goes through about a dozen diapers a day.  We have the diaper champ in his bedroom and it's been great so far.  (We'll see once he switches to solid food and his diapers are a bit more stinky!)  It's so easy to use and you don't have to buy the special bags.  We've used kitchen trash bags as well as large plastic shopping bags like the kind you get at babies r us.  One recommendation - get a can of Lysol and spray the diaper champ down when you change the bag.  Overall, I love this diaper pail and would buy it again in a hearbeat!	
1. 	I did not get the exact bibs pictured: please see my uploaded image to see what I got. It was a real surprise because I was expecting a blue, yellow and orange bib. Instead I got a blue, yellow, and green bib and two of the three had different graphics than what was pictured on Amazon. So when you order these, apparently you should expect colors and designs to vary (would've been nice if Amazon said this on the product page when I ordered these).Aside from that, these are good bibs for feeding solids. I bought them because our baby is a messy eater, she'd stain all her cloth bibs and they quickly molded (Gross!). These are very stain resistant, dry super fast and are a generous size. The pocket does catch about 95% of falling food (baby's still on runny baby food). She was very distracted by the bright colors when I first started using these, but I fixed that by putting the bib on her about 15 minutes before the meal. The only down side is that these are not good for bottle feeding because they don't soak up liquid, it just runs all over. So for bottle feeding I use a cloth bib. Overall, I bought these cause they don't stain, they dry quickly on the kitchen counter and make feeding solids easier - I wasn't too concerned about bottle feeding so it's not a big deal. Very happy with them!	
1. 	This is one of my favorite items we have for our baby.  Right now at 8 weeks, my baby already associates this blanket with sleep and will happily hold her little arms down for me to wrap her up at night.  She falls asleep for the night within 10 minutes of wrapping, which is so nice for a sleepy momma! She still wakes up about every 4 hours at night to eat, which is completely normal and to be expected for a baby her age.  So please take this into consideration if you are hoping it will automatically make them sleep through the night.  However, I might add that she is only waking up at night to eat, she is able to comfort herself back to sleep on her own while she is swaddled in this blanket.  One other side note: she didn't seem to enjoy being swaddled the first couple weeks, but has grown to love it, so don't give up too early on swaddling, it has helped her sleep so much better.  I have tried a few different swaddling products and I will try to synthesize here my experience with each one.Aiden + Anais vs. Miracle Blanket: The miracle blanket was just too big for my newborn, so we started out swaddling with Aiden + Anais swaddling blankets.  This worked great for those first few weeks until she became strong enough to break one arm free of the swaddle.  One reason I like the miracle blanket better for swaddling is at night when I need to change her diaper, I can leave her arms swaddled so she doesn't wake up any more than necessary.  It is also so much easier to re-wrap the miracle blanket in the middle of the night than it is to do an effective wrapping job with a swaddle blanket.  However, on the topic of Aiden + Anais, these blankets are also great for other purposes, such as putting over the carseat, a nursing cover, etc.  I love how light and soft these blankets are.  Winner for swaddling: Miracle Blanket, Winner overall if you have to choose between them: Aiden + Anais because it has so many more purposes.Swaddle Me (velcro) vs. Miracle Blanket: I tried the swaddle me blankets because I was given a few and they are pretty much fool proof to put on.  I did not like these at all for swaddling in the night.  I would have to un-velcro the whole wrap to change her diaper and the loud velcro in combination with allowing her arms freedom would wake her up.  It would take a good 15 minutes to put her back to bed.  With the Miracle Blanket she stays pretty much asleep, so I burp her, set her back in bed, and she is asleep!  Amazing.  Winner: Miracle Blanket!I did not try to the swaddling blankets that zip simply because most of these blankets hold the babies legs straight which experts warn is bad for their hip development.  This is not a problem with the Miracle Blanket.  Overall, this is a great product and I 100% recommend it!Update: My baby used this blanket until she was about 4 1/2 months old and peacefully sleeping a 7-8 hour stretch than another 3 hours after that.  After her 4 1/2 month mark she became uncomfortable in the night being swaddled and would repeatedly wake up.  But, because her moro reflex was still strong, she couldn't sleep with her arms out either, so the halo sleep sacks didn't work well for us for a while.  I switched to a zipadeezip swaddle transition blanket (I think you can only get them on their website?) and it was amazing!  She was in that blanket until about 7 months when we switched to a halo sleep sack because she outgrew the zipadeezip.  My neighbors also swear by the zipadeezips for transitioning off of the swaddle blanket. Good luck and sleep tight :)	
- 1	this was a big waste of money.  remote didnt work and the music was grainy	
1. 	I love that this swing goes both side to side and back and forth. i like the neutral color scheme, however i feel like if it were more colorful it would hold my 3 month old's attention longer. when she was just a few weeks old she would sit and nap in this swing all day, now she will only sit in it for 20-30 minutes at a time, but hey thats long enough to empty the dishwasher or start a load of laundry !! overall i have been very happy with this swing and found it well worth the money.	
- 1	These spoons are a little too deep and a little too wide. I am the mom of 3, so I have tried lots of spoons. These were not among my favorites. It was hard for my 7 month old to get the food off of it. I will stick with the Gerber spoons.	
1. 	This is definitely the best carrier on the market. It gives the best support for me and my daughter loves it. It is also helpful that the carrier comes in adult colors. Sometimes you want to look like a grownup instead of always wearing pastels or items with cartoon animals on it : ) I have tried other carriers and this is by far the highest quality on the market. It is worth the extra money.	
1. 	Cheap replacement for the medela series, good to have multiples around for convenience and as you will eventually lose some of them.	
1. 	I run an in-home daycare in a townhouse in addition to having my own young children.This gate is by FAR the sturdiest gate I've used and it is my absolute favorite.  I have 4 different baby gates.  We used it in a previous home to surround the fireplace but have it in use for keeping children in the playroom across a large doorway now.The gate is attractive, too!  I don't feel like I'm keeping the children trapped like with other gates.My only issue is that my oldest daughter figured out how to open the gate at the age of 2.  However, by then she understood and obeyed when I told her WHY she couldn't go through the gate.This gate is also taller than the average baby gate, which I love for my 12 month old climber.  She stacked pillows and climbed over the first gate I installed in that doorway.	
1. 	The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google Door Guardian installation instructions, find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8 inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16 inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16 inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.	
1. 	Baby loves this and has used it every single day since birth till now (hes 8 months)	
- 1	First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.	
- 1	My daughter had a hard time with this cup... the opening is very large and she would choke on the water because it came out too fast. I would go with the NUK beginner sippy cups.	
- 1	Do not buy these bottles unless your babies can absorb formula through their skin. The lids leaked within just one week. Further, the bottles are not finely graded, so when you are trying to keep track of how much a newborn is eating, it's not very accurate. The leaking was the most annoying thing to deal with on top of everything else. I recommend Dr. Brown's starter set instead.	
1. 	I bought this Cloud b Twilight Turtle for my new grand-daughter's nursery.  It is amazing.  The ambient lighting is perfect.  It lights up the nursery with such a soft glow.  It feels like you are looking up at the stars in the night sky.  My daughter is so happy to have it.  The baby was a preemie & so she is in a cradle in my daughter's room for now (not yet in the nursery), so my daughter moved the Turtle into her bedroom.  She said it gives just enough light so that she can see the baby's face at anytime during the night if she wakes up, but yet the light doesn't interfere with their sleeping.  Thank you for such a great product!	
- 1	My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use.  Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support.	
1. 	Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!	
- 1	i have a solely breast fed baby and I needed her to take a bottle when I went in for surgery when she was 2 months old I spent close to 50 dollars trying to find a bottle that would work! Ultimately this is my favorite design out of all of them (the only reason its getting a second star) but she hated this bottle! The nipple is way to long and caused her to gag and puke!	
- 1	They were cute in the package, though some were patterned differently than the picture and with a more predominant green than I expected.  What was really disappointing was that the pattern fabric shrinks disproportionately to the fabric on the back of the bib.  It causes the bib to roll up and they don't hold their color and texture very well after even one wash.	
- 1	this rack is weird and doesn't fit the bottles, etc. I don't end up using a dishwasher basket at all because I don't wash dishes enough to clean the bottles as often as I need anyway. I've only used this once and it was a joke. not worth the money. You end up washing everything by hand anyway, unless you wash dishes every single day.	
1. 	I like this blanket a lot because it is soft, is a square shape (those rectangle ones are terrible) and is very large.  We have two of them - one in the lavender polka dots and one in the fuschia polka dots.  At first when we brought our newborn home, it seemed huge.  But that turns out to be good because it lasts a long time as the baby grows.  A lot of receiving blankets we got turned out to be too small and were only used for about 2 weeks.  Now this is the main blanket we use for swaddling our daughter.	
- 1	We purchased these bottles for our primarily breastfed baby based on the wide based nipple and good reviews. His latch on the nipple mimics breastfeeding well, and he has been going back and forth between the bottle and the breast successfully since 1 week old.However, both my husband and I have found that because of the way milk pools between the inner and outer nipple, it is essentially impossible to feed the last 1/2 oz or so. Even when we let it drip back down into the bottle and then quickly invert it again--you just can't get that last bit of milk to stay in the inner nipple long enough for him to drink it.I'm not willing to sacrifice 1/2 oz of milk everytime we use a bottle. We have retired these bottles and are now much happier with Tommee Tippee.	
1. 	Great bibs! Machine washable, waterproof, flexible, not heavy, pocket to catch food is a must have. Unlike most bibs these attach to one side, which makes it a little harder for your little one to pull off.	
1. 	There are a few other ones less expensive, but spend the extra buck on this one because the built in spout/funnel in the lid makes all the difference in the world.We ordered one of these from Amazon for on the go. It was really convenient and large enough capacity to scale as the baby ate more and more in a feeding. It was so handy we picked up another one (from a different manufacturer) at a garage sale. We immediately noticed how this one from Munchkin was so much better designed. The other version had four compartments but no funnel spout in the lid so it was much more difficult to get all of the formula out. It was like one of those frustrating marble games where you need to get all of the marbles to stay put in the little holes. We ended up buying a second one from Munchkin. We'll probably use the other one for cheerios or other snacks or give it away.	
- 1	This was the biggest disappointment. I used a friends electric pump (don't remember what brand it was) and a piece broke so I decided that buying a manual pump was fine since I only pumped to have some milk on hand for a babysitter if we went on a date or left the baby with his grandparents for any amount of time. Well. After about a month of rare use the star shaped piece that creates the vacuum started getting sucked down into the bottle. There was too much suction for it. It was so ridiculously frustrating to have to stop pumping all the time to unscrew the pump part off, fish in the milk for the piece, snap the top clip part off to reinsert it in place, fidget with the pump handle to get it back in place, pop the cap on, screw it back on, pump very carefully, and BAM- the piece is sucked back into the bottle; repeat. There is no way I could EVER recommend this product.	
1. 	My 2 sons used the same Graco 6 speed open top swing (we have a different pattern than the pictured Windsor pattern). I am expecting my 3rd son very soon, so I thought I might try one of these newer model swings i.e Graco Hug swing, Graco Silouette swing, Fisher Price Cradle swing, etc. After careful research and actually looking over them all at Babies R Us and Target, I have come to the conclusion that my old swing is better. I like that it is higher off the ground, so I don't have to bend over as far to put my baby in it. Like the newer models (that I suppose are advertised to be improved and better), my older swing has the same recline position, legs fold for storage, snack tray, safety belt, some models have an overhead mobile, music option, and speed varieties. I happen to think the older models can be used for longer. The Papasan and Hug and Siloutte are like a round bucket so when your child is bigger they look as if they are way too big to be in it, but the traditional seats make your child look normal to be in it as they grow. I believe the weight limits are ll the same too in the 25-30 lbs range. I also found that the seat covers on the Graco open top are easy to remove and wash (as most Graco products). Can't see spending $130 for a new swing when I am content with my old $80 swing, it has given me it's worth.	
1. 	I read all these reviews and finally decided to take the risk and give it a try. It works great! My 17 month old used just plain cloth bibs when he eats, and you know what happened - food everywhere. When I tried this on him, at first he didn't like it. But I played with him and put food in there and played picaboo a little, then he got used to it very quickly after 2 meals. Now it works great - soft, easy to clean up and saved a lot of mess!	
1. 	We called it Moriz and it is one of the best friends of our little one. Moriz is soft and it is easy to play with him. We where a little suprised that he is actually that small, but we like him.	
- 1	Please don't waste your money on such expensive bottle washing bottle brush. This was way to expensive and it didn't even clean the bottles as good as the Munchkins bottle brush did.	
- 1	I'm sure it would be fine if all you want is to let your child sit in the carseat with a damp bathing suit... however, if accident protection is what you're after, this is useless. I have a Britax, and my daughter's first accident in her car seat leaked right through, wetting the cover underneath and the middle seatbelt material. I ended up having to remove the cover to wash it, which is exactly the hassle I was trying to avoid in the first place. Very irritating. I just ordered the Kiddopotamus Deluxe instead. Wish me luck. ;)	
- 1	Everyone told me how wonderful this blanket was and I saw great reviews for it on Amazon and elsewhere, so we purchased it.  For our purposes, it simply didn't do the trick.  Our daughter was too wiggly, and too unhappy about being wrapped up for the blanket to work.  We ended up going with the Halo sleepsacks with wings -- all we had to do was velro close those suckers and it was lights out for the little one; they required way less effort for us and obviously at 3 a.m. I'm a bit lazy.	
- 1	UPDATE:  Looks were misleading.  The mattress frame that came with our crib doesn't lay flat.  It either tilts to one side or the other.  At first I assumed it was because I was inverting the frame to make it sit higher, but I just flipped the frame today and it STILL doesn't lay flat.  At first, it wasn't a big deal, I just manually leveled the frame myself.  However, now that my son is heavier (16 pounds) and rolling over constantly, he's starting to tilt the mattress himself and face plant into the bars.  Since it is WELL past any return date, we are stuck either drilling wider holes to compensate or getting another crib.  NOT HAPPY.  I also do not feel this pine wood is sturdy enough to withstand an enthusiastic toddler... it wobbles.  If you were thinking of side-carring your crib, forget it.  WIthout the fourth side, it feels like it will snap any second.This is a beautiful, sturdy, solid wood crib, and it looks just lovely.  The wood is a nice, light color, and there was no chemical off-gassing smell at all!  Only a slight wood and oil smell.  Putting it together was quick and easy, although the pieces weren't labeled, so I had to do some educated guessing on which parts were which.  It was fairly easy, once I set out the parts.  I really liked the way the bolts came prepackaged, so there was no question about which to use.  The two, top side rails had a slight chip at their narrowest tips, but I think that's inevitable when shipping such soft wood.  The mattress is useless; you will need a real one.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a real mattress anyway.  I'm only docking one star because I'm not too happy with the spring bottom.  It attaches to the wooden crib via these weird metal arms.  As another reviewer noted, the only way to get the crib set up at it's highest (newborn) level is to invert these metal swing-arms.  So the crib is basically balanced on these 4, angled arms.  (Maybe they don't want you setting the crib that high, but many of the manufacturer's pics show it that way, so I think those holes should be drilled).  At any rate, that's still not my biggest gripe.  I don't like how the mattress (at normal levels) HANGS from these metal arms, and there's a metal dowel to keep it from over extending.  If you've got a thin mattress, and a toddler stuck his hand down there while bouncing, I think that could be a pinched finger waiting to happen.  I'm no crib expert, honestly, and maybe there's a reason, but I think I would rather have the spring board attach directly to the frame itself.  Also, it's a minor gripe, but the crib came covered in large manufacturing and warning stickers, and I wish the manufacturer would use a glue that was a little easier to remove.	
1. 	This is my first hand-pump, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I do love this thing. It's comfortable, gentle (since I get to control it, obviously), and works well. I have no complaints!	
1. 	I like that they're clear so as to not draw much attention to themselves.  You also get a bunch for a good price compared to the other options out there.  I've found that the level of difficulty in removing these plugs really depends on the actual outlets.  We've used them in two homes and it was easier to remove them from older outlets--probably because those outlets were more worn out.	
1. 	I was told that carseats stretch out your leather if you don't place anything between them so we decided to try this saver and boy does it save. I have just small pressure points in the very back that you can see when you remove the carseat but they have gone away within a couple days. The bottom of this is a harder plastic the the others I have seen in stores which I think is what helps this. No complaints here and I would defiantly recommend to anyone. In fact I'm ordering one now for my mom's car as the little bit extra cost makes it well worth not having stretched out leather.	
1. 	I read many reviews on this and installed it carefully, though I understand that it still may not work for everyone. We have a basic cheap one-piece tub in the kid's bathroom, with the vinyl or plastic wall. I used the tape for installation. Cleaned it thoroughly with soap and water, then rubbed vigorously with alcohol and let it dry for half an hour. I put the tape on and held in place as long as my arms could take it. Then we put a space heater in the bathroom and had it set to 75 for about 30 hours. It wasn't really cold, but I wanted to make sure it stayed warm, especially over night, and also dry out the air. We didn't put toys in it or get it wet for 2 more days. What a procedure! But it has been installed now for about a year and it's been perfect.The biggest downside for us was the price...30 bucks for a toy holder. Yikes. Not a necessity, but very nice to have. We lucked out and found it half price on clearance at a store. Yay!	
- 1	This is one of my favorite baby purchases.  It keeps the wipes nice and warm and it's easy to maintain.  I rinse the pillow when I get to the bottom of my wipe supply.  Depending on the brand of wipes I use, some of them don't pop-up through the opening, but it's easily fixed.  The Huggies brand wipes seem to work best, as they are connected to each other with perforations and not just stacked together.  This is a great gift idea for someone that is expecting or for yourself!!!1/17/14 Update- Well after using this product for 14 months, it has brought on a concern.  A week ago, I noticed the light on the front was not working.  When I investigated the cord, I discovered that the metal piece that attaches to the warmer, was corroded.  I immediately unplugged the cord from the wall, and also found that the inside of the warmer was cold.  This scares me because it could have caused a fire.  I am not in the market for a new warmer, as it's winter and cold wipes are not enjoyable for my son.  I have contacted Prince Lionheart and hope to have an answer from them soon.	
1. 	I researched a TON of slings & baby carriers before deciding on buying one! I didn't want to spend $100 on one and ultimately decided on trying this. I almost bought the Moby, but decided against it cuz I was a little intimidated by all the wrapping and wanted something to quickly get off and on.I LOVE the style. It's gorgeous fabric and the open tail on the end is enough fabric to use to cover up baby's face if you're nursing, or if you're outside and you need to keep the sun off for example. I have not personally used the sling to nurse baby though, but I'm thinking you probably could.I've only used it for one hold...the one where the entire baby is in the sling (as a newborn to 6 weeks). It does take just a little practice to get the baby positioned just right in this hold because you definitely don't want to just &#34;plop&#34; baby in there...you need to keep baby from bending his head down too far to his chest. It worked because I could put baby in there and actually get a few things done around the house...and eat lunch! It didn't allow me to do household chores that required bending over though...like loading the dishwasher, doing laundry, things like that. I also couldn't do dishes or get too close to the counter tops with the sling on because the baby was at the same waist height as the counters.It's been nice to use while shopping in certain places. I have found that if I go to a grocery store, it's much easier to keep baby in the car seat, and stick the car seat on a cart. And if I'm doing some mall shopping, it's easier to put baby in a stroller. This sling has come in handy when I need to do a shorter shopping trip in a store or place that doesn't have carts...like Kohl's! I just stick baby in the sling, and shop away. I can easily take if off in the dressing room if I need to try some clothes on.As far as comfort, it has a really wide, padded shoulder area where it sits on. It doesn't hurt my back at all. After awhile (like 15-20 min or so), it does cause just a tiny bit of discomfort over top my shoulder, but I can easily reposition it some (with baby still in sling), and it helps.I'm looking forward to trying new holds now that baby is getting older, so I will have to update later!	
1. 	I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well.  My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again.  They are large with good cushion and will do its job.  The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months, they are still there on all three corners.  I would recommend but of course, if your child is persistent, I am sure he/she would get it off eventually. So far, so good.	
1. 	Both my husband and I like this bag a lot.  There's enough space to pack everything you need (for us, first-time, one-child parents, that's two-three extra onesies in case of a blow-out or leak, a pair of socks, a hat, hand sanitizer, diaper clutch with diapers and wipes, burp cloth(s), wet bag for dirty cloth diapers, nursing cover, receiving blanket, bib, and the stuff that used to live in my purse and now is part of the diaper bag).  There's also room to shove a few things like a sling or book or something in the back slim pocket, plus leftover room for a few extra items for longer trips out.  The pockets are nice for organization, with a nice roomy main compartment.  We like the cross-shoulder design, we feel that is best because a one-shoulder diaper bag often will slip off as you maneuver stroller/car seat, etc.  However, just a note that you can't really wear it cross-body when you have your child in a front-carrier, but it does fine sitting on one shoulder for a bit - hasn't posed too much of a problem yet.  We are really glad we invested in this diaper bag, and my husband likes that it's not too &#34;girly&#34; in pattern and that it doesn't look like a hobo-bag type purse like some diaper bags.	
1. 	My brother and his family are a very green family!  They loved this gift.  They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!  My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's green test!  YAY!  I recommend this gift!	
- 1	The pitcher is a great idea to save time while making a batch of bottles for the day, however it is too small. If you fill 32oz of water, and add powder, you need to mix very carefully in order to avoid making a mess. I spilled formula all over the counter several times. The way parts fit together also seem a little flimsy, not sure if it would last. Bought a Rubbermaid mixing pitcher instead that fits 2 quarts and is much bigger and feels sturdier.Rubbermaid Servin Saver White Mixing Pitcher 2 Qt.	
- 1	This combo has such potential.  The colors are fantastic and very eye catching.  My daughter is drawn to it and you can see her eyes light up when I put her on the mat.  Unfortunately the toy bar falls down which defeats the purpose of that part of the entertainment.  This became very frustrating for not only myself but my daughter as well.  The included pillow is really not all that useful for support with the seat and only helps a little for tummy time since it is so slick.  The included toys are liked by my daughter and developmentally appropriate.  However, the actual seat positioner is so upright that my daughter slides down quickly.  It seems to me that once your baby is able to sit up in this seat it only has a very short window of usefulness before it gets tossed aside.	
1. 	I put the baby bath in our actual tub and run the faucet the whole time she in - she loves the sound of the water. The sling allows for me to have the baby bath overflow and still be safe.	
- 1	Okay, I bought it thinking it's easy to take temperature readings, especially for infants. My baby was sick and we measured temperature using this at multiple times during the course of 1-2 days and it never showed above 98-99 degrees (i.e. normal body temperature for babies). The following day baby was really sick and we took her to a hospital nearby and baby had really high fever (over 102). Even on that day this thermometer showed around 98-99. The doctor and nurse there said the readings on these things (scanners) are never accurate. They recommended the in-ear thermometer and ended up getting one from CVSBraun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer with ExacTemp Technology, IRT4520USSM. It was a pain to take readings using those in the beginning but now the baby is much more accommodating and so far we've found them reliable.Reading other reviews here shows that this deviation can be either way, higher or lower. Skip this one and get one which is accurate (aka with better reviews).Avoid this at all costs!!	
- 1	I bought this item after using the regular Breathable Baby bumper when my baby (now 9 months) was an infant and loved that it, so I was excited to find this and bought it as soon as we lowered the level of her mattress.  The problem with the product (and why I sent it back before I let her sleep in the crib with it) is that it is easy for her to pull down and I could see her easily untying the fasteners.  They are a silky material which babies love, and mine would have just played with it until it came undone.  Her crib is a sleigh bed style, so there was not enough length to the ties to wrab them around the top of the crib rail to secure it, but that still would not have stopped her from trying to untie them.  I think for some cribs the design may work, it just did not work for my crib so I returned them.	
1. 	The negative comments on these gates have a few points I don't understand:Child tips it over.  I've sat on the edge of this thing when a 1-gate ring.  No problems.Child drags the gate all over.  Unless you mount it to a wall, any gate is going to be moveable.Gate has trouble folding.  Yep, it is hard to fold.  this is a GOOD THING in that you don't want your child folding it on his/herself.Gate cracks.  I have three of these.  No problems.  Really must be lemons for this to be an issue.We actually made one giant ring out of three of these and although we need to zigzag the longest wall so that it stands up without falling over (one long straight wall is not going to be sturdy without sideways support no matter what you build it out of), it is just right for our purposes.  The kid might not love it, but she now has a TON of space to play.Our child with a propensity for getting stuck in things has yet to get stuck in it (yay!) nor has she found a way out of it yet.  I love this thing.	
- 1	I love the concept of a pad that fits over a changing table.  Only the waterproof pad has to be changed when baby pees or poos during a diaper change, or when a very messy diaper leads to baby's dirty bottom leaving skid marks on the changing surface.  In fact, starting about two weeks into having a baby, I had a contoured changing pad, covered with a pretty fabric cover, then a waterproof pad over that.  A changing accident meant, I just swap out the waterproof pad.  Because it's flat and lies on top of the changing table, it's much easier to change out than the fabric covers with elastic that pull completely over the changing pad.  And, if I wanted to take photos in the room, I could remove the waterproof pad and just have the nice fabric cover showing.I usedCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, EcruandCarters 2 Pack Keep Me Dry Quilted Crib Pad, Whiteand some off brand quilted pads.  All of those measured 18 inches by 27 inches.These pads from Munchkin measure 11 1/2 by 23 inches.  But, really they are a little smaller than that.  The corners are rounded, so there is less coverage.  And the pad fabric is so light that the edges curl up.  This not large enough to cover the spray range from my baby boy, even when centered under his bottom.  Also, because it's light weight material (terry cloth bonded to thin vinyl), it curls up and slides around.  None of the other waterproof pads I use have problems with curling up or sliding around.My husband, who also does diaper duty, agrees that these are too small and are not useful.I see from other reviews that some people are using this as a portable changing pad.  This is not large enough to protect your car upholstery.  This is also not large enough to protect your baby from a dirty changing table in a public restroom.  My 9 week old is too large to be protected by this tiny pad, and I think his arms and legs would have been off the pad even as a newborn.  For carrying in the diaper bag, I use a receiving blanket, since I got several of those that fold small and wash with bleach.  I had also used a lap pad, which is a small waterproof pad (still larger than these Munchkin ones).  In the restroom changing tables, I just want a surface between baby and table to not get germs on him.  I don't care about protecting the table from baby, so I don't need a waterproof pad.  For a portable changing pad for your car, I recommend,Invacare Extra Reusable Bedpads-Size 24 x 34 Capacity Absorbs 1200 cc - Each 1.  That is a huge 24 by 34 inch pad that can protect my car seat and the back of the seat.  And since I just leave it in my car, I don't have to worry that it's huge.Overall, these changing table pads from Munchkin are the worst waterproof pads I have encountered.  They are waterproof, but they are so small that it doesn't matter.  They won't catch spills from your baby, and tend to slide around a lot.  Every other waterproof pad or lap pad I have purchased is a better buy than these.  Save your money and get anything else.	
1. 	I like this seat a lot.  It is easy to transport; I can take it to my parents' house, to restaurants and anywhere in between.  Works great!	
- 1	I got this and no matter what temperature the water is, the word HOT shows up and doesn't go away.	
1. 	What can i say, they loved playing with them. Until my dogs chewed them to pieces. But they're great for some water fun for the kids.	
- 1	I am not very happy with these toy. Given that they are fun and colorful, I am reluctant to give these to my 5 month son. At this age he pulls everything into his mouth--chewing on green turtle's head is favorite. However, the toys have very strong plastic smell which did not go away after almost a month out of the bag. The packaging has no mention of BPA free plastic. Paint on these toys is a think layer on top of one color plastic toy. It was a bit sticky when I first received these toys, which made me think that it is not very safe for a baby to lick or chew. Considering the smell and paint, these toys are underused. I wish I did not purchase this set.	
- 1	I was very unhappy with this product and ended up returning it. It was very poorly put together. Loose strings were falling off all over the place. The way it hooks the baby in was not very sturdy. I ended up using one from BrightStarts instead.	
- 1	For my 3 month old baby the toys were hard to reach, also the little toys are too flat with no different textures or sounds. The only thing she likes is the bear. I later bought the taf toys gym which has a larger mat and more interactive toys to play with.	
- 1	We used the hotsling for the first 3 months of my baby's life and then we bought the Balboa after she outgrew the hotsling. This sling IS NO GOOD. First of all, the plastic ring digs into me and my baby's head is always hitting it. It's a huge BAG, basically and there are better slings out there. All of the weight is on your shoulder so I cannot comfortably wear my baby. Too bad. I will buy the ERGO.	
- 1	Cheap and thin looking. I am still using it with our crib though because I never actually look at it too much. It's just there. :)	
1. 	I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while	
1. 	My daughter would sit in this Exersaucer ALL DAY if I would let her!!  Especially now that she's crawling, it is so handy to occupy her when I need her to be safe for a few minutes.I should add, though, that I got this as a gift and I doubt I would actually have paid full price for it.	
- 1	Update: We loved this product until the projector stopped working!  I was hoping it would last more than 5 months :( I read the reviews and thought it was just a fluke when other people said the projector broke. Not a fluke. UGH!My husband and I are very pleased with this product and our baby LOVES it!  The voice activation is very sensitive so we just leave it on all the time at night because otherwise it turns off when we have the timer set and then turns back on in just a few seconds (I think it picks up the sound of the fan we have in his room). Great product!	
- 1	This looks great but it's very bulky to put on. Also it gets really hot underneath the cover and the top is too wide and cumbersome so it keeps sliding away. You practically need 3 hands to make it work properly as a nursing cover.	
1. 	I bought this because my sister had something like it when she was breastfeeding, and she said it really helped with positioning her baby. When we first started breastfeeding, about an hour after I gave birth, it was really hard to hold my baby to my breast. It was too difficult to support his head with my arm, and regular pillows didn't work. The only way I could comfortably feed him is with the boppy. This one may be a little more expensive, but it has a cute fleece cover that easily washes and stays very soft. You can use the boppy for feeding, positioning baby on his belly or back, or even for you to sit on after giving birth (like a doughnut) to help with perineal pain. The possibilities are endless!	
- 1	cheapest made rack in the history of all racks.  It was difficult to even connect it because for some reason the customer has to assemble this tiny rack from 6 pieces it arrives in  (?!) and the parts didn't fit quite well.  A very disappointing product for this brand.	
1. 	My husband and I bought this product after reviewing and comparing several others to find the best one for us and for our daughter. It is very easy to use/put on, and very comfortable to wear with my daughter in it! The straps distribute the weight over your shoulders/back in a very comfortable way and nothing digs in or is uncomfortable when you wear it. She always fell asleep when we put her in it and never fussed about it, so I assume it was just as comfortable for her! I feel that this is a good quality, safe and durable item, and very secure. My daughter is now 2 years old and we have kept this product to use with our next child! We highly recommend it.	
1. 	On first introduction, my son at 2.5mos old wasn't particularly interested. Tummy time especially was not happening. He enjoyed gazing and eventually reaching for objects as he got older. Inevitably he'd turn himself over and become fussy. At 5 mos now he finally enjoys looking and grasping at objects on the mat. He soaks it of course with drool and so far I've had no problem throwing it in the wash. I don't blame the mat when he didn't enjoy it, certain interests take time to develop.  Oddly my dog ignores the attached toys as baby only with the exception of the monkey. We gave up on the monkey after finding it downstairs a few times.I do have one complaint - the music and lights do not always work. If I use the first setting it stops playing after maybe 30 seconds and only restarts briefly if you nudge the poles. The second setting doesn't generally have this problem. Baby doesn't necessarily seem to notice but it bugs me.	
- 1	I thought this would be less hot than the other options I saw, but it made his head so hot!	
1. 	We have tan leather seats in the car so this offered the best colour option and looked the least hideous.  So far, it has not damaged our leather seats. The only con is that the top piece is a bit small.	
1. 	Puts my baby girl to sleep everytime.  It's amazing, wrap her up in this thing and she goes right to sleep and will sleep ALL NIGHT!!!!!!  Very soft too and very warm	
1. 	well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.	
- 1	These are just 2 pieces of Minky fabric sewn together. No padding. The velcro sides are stretched out so they are longer than the rest of the cover. This causes the edge of the velcro to stick out and be scratchy.	
1. 	We haven't used this much yet, but it appears to be just what I expected.  It is a little tall, so putting it down in the diaper bag doesn't work.  But there is plenty of room for a cold back in the bottom and full sized bottles.	
- 1	These are nice and organic burp clothes but they are too small to cover much and too thick to use under the chin.  I'm sure some people like them but I ended up using the less expensive and larger size burp and diaper cloths.	
- 1	I was really looking forward to this cute travel wipe package. I am disappointed because the label is on crooked, and it doesn't open or close easily. I have to line up the box to get it to shut. It's not easy to retrieve the wipes, and you need easy when you're trying to change a baby and often times only have one hand to get the wipes out!Sadly - I will be returning this item.	
1. 	We love the Playtex Insulators. We tried a whole bunch of cups when my youngest hit the sippy age, and these were the best by far. This is one of our many purchases as we have added to our sets over the years. We do find that after a while the plastic valves need replacing, and occasionally I have thrown away a lid but only after a long time (years). One note of caution, do not try to boil these as it warps the cups and then the seal is not correct. That may seem obvious but I have heard of several people doing it so it is worth mentioning.	
- 1	I expected something a little larger than this.  It seemed so small when I took it out of the package that I measured it.  It is NOT 14&#34; x 28&#34; as the package says (the description says 29&#34;, which is even more wrong).  It was barely 14&#34; x 27&#34; (you would have to pull it tight to get it to 27&#34;).  I had to work to get it to tie to the slats properly and I am guessing it should be tight, but it was not as easy as I expected for a standard crib.I understand the point of this--to save sheets because your little one spits up or wets the bed--but they aren't supposed to have pillows in the crib with them and this is pretty fluffy and almost like a thin pillow.  Mine sleep with a pillow as it is, so I'm not overly concerned about it, but mine are over 12 months now also.It doesn't cover much area, so if you are concerned about diaper leaks and you have a baby that is a mover, this one cover isn't going to work.  You would do much better to have a full mattress pad with a second sheet under it (a quick pull off in the night and you are set with a clean sheet).  My babies have been big movers since they were just a few months old, so I would have had a hard time figuring out where to put it when they were smaller (they are big enough now that their middles tend to be pretty close to the middle of the crib most of the time, but I still would need 2 of these to cover the whole possible area).Really, not worth the money as you are better off with an extra mattress pad and sheet (I got all my crib sheets for $2-$3 on clearance and the mattress pads were around $10).  If this small cover isn't in the &#34;leakage&#34; area, you are going to need to change the whole sheet anyway, so you might as well just be prepared.	
1. 	Really soft and useful bib for your little one. Its  easy to clean and takes care of mess unde the table.	
- 1	The car seat was difficult to install rear facing.  I took it to the hospital near my home that performs car seat checks and they stated that it is one of the most difficult seats to install rear facing.  I drive an SUV and the seat in front of the car seat needs to be pushed forward to a point that an adult cannot sit there.  I was dissatisfied at this point of using the seat but we were working around the issue.  Today my child threw up in the seat and I need to take the cover off to wash it.  There is apparently an older version of this car seat in which the base is removable, the current seat does not have this feature.  The cover is seriously impossible to remove.  I just spent 15 minutes on hold waiting for a customer care agent to explain what I'm doing wrong...I spent 15 minutes on the phone with her explaining that I'm not doing it wrong, I just need to try harder.  To remove the round plastic pieces holding the cover down where your child's bottom would be you need to stick your hand in between the base and the seat and press the bottom of the piece through the top by pressing a lip that holds it in place toward the outside of the seat (this is an extremely small space, even with the seat fully reclined).  Once there you need to use great force (enough force that they recommend a screw driver or butter knife) to press the lip toward the outside.  Unfortunately to reach this plastic lip I need to bend my fingers around another large plastic piece - I wear a women's small glove and they barely fit - good luck bending a screwdriver around in this manner.  I'm seriously going to have to get a babysitter so I can drive my car (without a car seat and child) to purchase a new seat or deal with vomit smell.  Only buy this car seat if you won't be installing it rear reclining and you plan to never never wash it.	
1. 	I had purchased this before my daughter was born and used it often to BF.  After about 6 months of use, some of the plastic tubing in the neckline poked through the fabric and began scratching my neck.  I was disappointed and decided to reach out to Bebe au Lait.  Within 24 hours of my email to customer service, they responded with an apology, a pre-paid UPS label to send them the defective one, and a confirmation email to send me a brand new cover.  I love when companies make sure their customers are happy!	
- 1	it broke right after I had used it once. i carry this around as my back up and it's already smashed. it did work well that one time.	
1. 	Let me start by saying I think it's WONDERFUL of Avent to offer their consumer the option to modify what they already own!  I bought 2 Avent bottles for our son to use while my mom watched him for our anniversary.  He was exclusively breastfed & only used 1 bottle, that 1 time.  When his doctor suggested starting him on sippy cups with a little bit of water (6months), I really didn't want to run out & buy something else that would take up more space in our cabinets.  I bought these guys & the handles.  Our son loves the handles, but has really struggled with the spout.  I would go so far as to say he cannot drink from it.  I eventually caved & bought 2 Nuby 2 Handle Cups with Soft Spouts.  He can drink out of the super soft spout much easier.  I do wish this product would have worked for him because when I screw on the Nuby lid, the spout does not align with the handles.  The Avents *always* align.  To sum it up, I am giving it 4 stars even though it didn't work for our family, because (1) I love that Avent offers a modification for consumers, (2) the handles rock & the spout & handles align super easily, & (3) my baby is exclusively breastfed & has very little experience with bottles (1 bottle, 1 time) - I believe a baby who knows how to drink from a bottle would have a much easier time with this product.	
- 1	It looks and feel great online and up close. It does have great comfort. Its a bit bulky, but I liked how flat the seat was. We were looking for a big girl seat. The 5 point harness system is where this fell short for me. We are coming from a Britax 70. Huge fan of Britax, and wanted to love this seat. The clip is cheap and hard to close and un clip. Then the harness buckles were even worse. You have to push the fabric out of the way to un buckle it. It is comes unbuckled at all. I saw where people posted this problem, after food was suck in it. This was my first day using it. Within 3 hours of installing it, we went to the store. It took me 5 minutes to get her out of the seat. I started to panic. It is bein returned. I have ordered the Britax frontier. I hope I help someone with this review. If this seat had the harness system of a Britax, it would be SO PERFECT. I hope Graco reviews this issue and upgrades the harness latches.	
- 1	I bought one of these about 2 years ago for my first child and the quality was much better. The fabric was softer (think cotton vs. nylon), felt more padded, and it featured a soft, non-slip grip on the handle. The AIR version existed when I bought the first one, but I didn't see much difference between the two...Now, 2 years later I purchased this exact model for baby #2 and was very disappointed. The fabric (while attractive looking) is not very soft, feels cheap, and there is no grip on the handle. To get these features now, you HAVE to buy the AIR version... which, if you shop around, you can find for only about $40 more. It's definitely worth the extra money IMO. My daughter was in her onboard35 until 14 months, and having a soft fabric that baby will want to sleep on, and a soft handle that makes the carrier comfortable to hold, was a must-have for me.	
1. 	Very solid well made gate. Doesn't have a foot opening option but that hasn't been an issue, opens easily enough even if your hands are full, but the little one cannot open it. Mounts easily (definitely want to screw the mounting pads into the wall though if a permanent placement, friction based installation will not stand up to little one yanking on it). Gate closes automatically behind you... if we want to prop open we just set a chair next to it to prop.	
1. 	Short easy to get that cleaned a little oil. Appearance is very cute, I love babybjorn. Children 9 months, holding their own use.	
1. 	Exactly what I thought they'd look like! No shiny texture just normal cotton and they look sturdy will follow up on h ow they wash	
1. 	Great bathtub, I love the cloth part to hang the babies on. My only complaints are there are some nooks and crannies that don't drain (why they would do that I seriously have no idea) so you have to make sure to clean them out or it'll stink, and the padding started to come off after only a couple months of use, I'm sure I could fix it easily with some super glue though	
1. 	My daughter immediately took to this toy.  It is adorable with many aspects that she will eventually explore over the months to come.  It is relatively large and seems to be made very well.  I wish I dad gotten it for my first two kiddos...	
1. 	I babysit my niece once a week. She suddenly had a affinity for one of my outlets that had a design outlet cover on it. I quickly decided that I needed to get outlet plugs. Fortunately/Unfortunately, I have 16 outlets near the floor in the two rooms I keep my niece wrangled in. The Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack was the perfect size and solution for this problem.The Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack is a great quantity and were affordable. The outlet plugs are clear, which is great because they don't draw a lot of attention. They are easy to put in and hard to take out. Obviously, you want them hard to remove for babies/small children and they are definitely successful in that nature. They have a side that is flat that is suppose to help adult's remove them. I've had two adults remove them with no issue. Personally, I find them difficult to remove, but it beats the alternative.Overall, the Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack does its job perfectly. I would definitely recommend these to mommy's, daddy's, auntie's, uncles, grandparents, and anyone else who is trying to keep little fingers and small toys out of outlets.	
1. 	These sacks are everything the reviews promised they would be. I bought them for the baby I am expecting in a few months but broke into them to clean up after my dog's puppy pads (when his diaper genie 2 ran out of bags). We already knew we didn't want to use a diaper genie for our baby since it has been so ineffective for our dog's pads- and we only put one in a day (he's indoor and outdoor trained) but we continued to use it for him because it was better than smelling it in the garbage. Using the sassy sacks for 2 days has made a huge difference. We can throw away the pad in a sassy sack into a regular trash can and there is no smell. I can also take these with me on dog walks to pick up poops along the way.I am so pleased using these for my dog, I can't wait to use them for the baby! I have ordered several more boxes because I know I am going to be getting a lot of use out of this simple, but effective product.	
- 1	I bought this and set it up days before our daugther was born. I am glad I did because we instantly picked up the neighbor's baby who lives in the townhouse 3 doors down from us- imagine the confusion! Even changing stations didn't help- we still picked up the sounds from their monitor AND even more static! I followed all the directions to avoid other interferrances but none helped. When you turn up the volumne, even if the monitor and hand units are in separate rooms, they will make a horrible sound as though they are still too close, so you have to turn down the volumne thus making it nearly impossible to hear the sounds of your baby- especially over all the static!I read lots of reviews on all the monitors and thought this one would be the best for our money but this one is going back to the store ASAP!	
- 1	and never again. They don't hold on the baby. And the feet are too small. The fabric is great, but totally not usable.	
- 1	I think the battery might just suck.  Maybe we didn't charge it right the first time but it only works when its plugged in.  I had an old summerinfant monitor with a huge screen and black and white photo but it wasn't portable.  We switched to this after our dog made the monitor fall and picture fuzzy.  I prefer the larger screen and the portability sucks when it keeps turning off. Kinda useless.	
1. 	I like this bib better than the Baby Bjorn one because it's not rigid and has sleeves.  At first I didn't like that you had to tie it in the back and wish it had velcro straps, but it does make it harder for baby to take off.  Easy to wash and dries quickly.	
- 1	Yes, it's cushy and comfortable and your child will probably enjoy sitting on it. But, someone decided it would be a good idea to make the cushion absorbent, which translates into a big pee-filled sponge. I used it with a girl, and once I noticed what was happening, I would wring the cushion out in bleach water but it still got really nasty.	
1. 	These were great when my child was 0-3/4 months old. They helped with gas - spit up, somewhat. Once he reached about 3/4 months old he just didn't care for the nipple anymore and I switched to a different brand. Only downfall is there are a few parts to clean, but nothing crazy. These survived many trips through the dishwasher (top rack only).	
- 1	We have been using the Baby Bjorn bib, but sometimes my son cried when I put the Bjorn one on because its so stiff (he's used to it now, though). I wanted to try this out because it looked like the same thing, cheaper, and less rigid. Unfortunately, by being less rigid, the pocket doesn't really open, but folds in onto itself so that food isn't caught but just slides off and onto lap. We don't use it anymore. Maybe when he's much older and doesn't need the food catcher (will that ever happen??). But as of now, its pretty much useless.	
- 1	Right out of the box, it did not work! Probably needed a new battery. But who wants to have to replace a battery in a cheap potty watch/timer they just bought! I returned it.	
1. 	I don't know how I ever made it without a Diaper Genie! This system ensures that the diapers do not smell. We loved it so much we bought one for upstairs, downstairs and for grandparent's houses. It is super easy to use--highly recommend that if you use disposable diapers to buy this product. On another note-the Diaper Genie Elite works even better!	
1. 	We purchased this for our 9 month old daughter and she LOVES this chair.  We've been able to use this in almost every restaurant we've been in. This won't work on thin metal tables or tables with a limited ledge.  The top metal piece that sits on top of the table has a cushion on it so it won't damage tabletops.  I keep this in the car all the time and I can easily store this in the basket of our stroller when we're in NYC or D.C. It's very lightweight and has a great harness (not just a seatbelt) to keep my daughter safe. My daughter enjoys that she can sit next to us during meals instead of watching us from her stroller.	
1. 	My daughter loved hers so much I had to purchase as a gift for my nephew.  Didn't ruin my walls or even leave a mark.  Provided hours of entertainment!	
1. 	Before my daughter was able to crawl, we would put her in this every day.  She was a ball of energy right from the beginning, and didn't want to lay on her playmat for more than a few minutes, but she LOVED bouncing in her jumper.  She'd often bounce for half an hour or more.  She seemed to really like the fact that while in the jumper she could see Mama and Daddy and feel like a part of the action.  And WE liked the fact that it tired her out a little, so she fell asleep more easily at naptime.Also, it's very light, and easy to put up and take down, so we took it with us everywhere.  It was wonderful for keeping her entertained when visiting friends or relatives.A couple of tips: It works best in a WIDE doorway.  Otherwise little fingers can easily get crushed.  Also, read the directions for adjusting the height.  There's a trick to it, but once you know it, you can use it even on very short doorways, or if your baby has very long legs.The only drawback was that once our daughter learned to crawl, she found it way too confining, so we were only able to use it for a pretty short time, but she loved it so much when she DID use it that I think it was WELL worth the money.	
- 1	I am concern if the baby is able to remove it with her own hands, but she still too small to said, so just  consider that the hock is not strong enough may be no stable	
- 1	So, maybe I am doing something wrong but these are terrible.  We have only had them about a week and I hate them. I was really excited about these because I like the idea of the organic cotton, but they have leaked every single time.  My son gets a slight rash with microfiber so I was hoping cotton would fix that.  I will say that has been the only good thing about these, no rash.  But they do not absorb at all. He is 20 months old and cannot even wear these for an hour without a leak.  In the mornings I change him at 8 right before we leave to take my daughter to school, by the time we get home at 9 he has already leaked through these diapers.  I much prefer my Flips and Thirsties AIOs.  I am going to try the organic cotton flip inserts instead of these.  And they take FOREVER to dry.  I find that it helps if you flip the top layer of cotton around the diaper, but even then they easily take an hour and a half in the dryer.  I tried to put them on the drying rack and 24 hours later they felt like they had just come out of the washer.  They also stain very easily, which isn't a huge deal to me since no one sees it but still not very pretty. Save your money.	
1. 	I bought this pail primarily because I didn't want to have to deal with expensive refills that many of the other diaper pails have. I did this understanding that it would not mask the smell as good. Instead I keep a box of inexpensive diaper sacks in the changing area and for any smelly diapers - I put it in a sack before throwing it in the pail. When it's full it does get a little stinky but it really hasn't been bad at all.The deodorizer chamber is large and you can add your own.My main problem with this pail is that it doesn't seal. The hinge in the back has open holes where stinky diaper air can get out.However, I love this diaper pail, it's a great inexpensive option if you don't mind putting the diapers in the sacks yourself instead of buying expensive refills.	
1. 	We love our sleep sacks. Our daughter's room gets very cold (we live in MA), but this and some fuzzy footsie pj's, and a thick blanket guarantee she's warm all night.	
- 1	Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped.  Ridiculous.  I went through so many batteries.  For an item as high priced as this, I needed it to work longer. Disappointed in you medela. You worked so good 10 years ago....now... Thanks for the great 3 months..... I ended up stopping breast feeding after this broke, because I couldn't pump at work since it didn't work anymore. My milk dried up. Only being able to feed twice a day was not what I envisioned for my daughter. Now, when it DID work, it was worth every penny.  Handy tote that looked like a purse. No one even knew. Quiet and fast and comfortable. $250 is steep, but for the convenience, worth it.... For three months.	
1. 	My experience with these bottles was overall great. The newborn starter set is a great way to get the bottle feeding chore done without all the drama of buying all individual pieces in separate packaging! You will of course need several more bottles in addition to this set, the more the merrier. The nipples are changeable for when your baby gets bigger and needs more flow to eat. I like that the bottoms come off as well as the tops, this makes for easier cleaning. In my opinion, when it comes to bottles, many moms have their own idea of which type is best, i feel that this is a bottle worth consideration by the first time mom, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time mom.However, I recommend buying ONE to begin with, then buying this set if you liked the one. i know this is hard to do, but it could save you some money. There were several different bottles i had received as gifts, that just didn't work for me, and they went wasted with no use from me. =/	
1. 	The balls have a hole in them and are like &#34;squirties&#34;.  I've refrained from buying anything like this anymore because it gets mold inside.  That said, my 2 y.o. daughter would much rather fill the balls and squirt the water everywhere than throw it into the basket!  Still a fun bath time activity.	
1. 	Can been annoying if you are particular about colors, but we didn't care and these were baby girl's favorite for the first 3 months.A good price and Prime Shipping is super convenient.Was up well and stood up to the microwave sanitizer really well too.	
1. 	Very good gift for my friends who just had their 2nd.  Their 1st is about 3yrs old, and these are very good for helping to keep them all safer!	
- 1	We didn't care for this seat at all and will be returning it. It's very loose after it's assembled and would not attach securely to the table (our table fits all the specifications as being one that this chair can be used with). The pieces that are pushed upward to hold the chair to the table are lightweight plastic then the arms that come out to keep it stable are attached to the same center plastic part and come out at an off angle (and cannot be adjusted) so they don't press against the table and the whole seat can be moved up and down.Even if it fit the table safely I would still be disappointed, the seat sits back from the edge of the table leaving a big gap which I can see lots of food falling down. The fabric part is cheaply made, crinkly, and only comes in an unattractive red and black.We also own an inglesina fast chair and it's wonderful. We tried this chicco chair because our fast chair does not fit our table. If it will fit your table or you're only planning on using it while traveling the inglesina is the way to go.	
- 1	We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby's carseat. Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad (putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly), the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way (knee in seat, tugging hard), and the carseat didn't budge a bit.Our car has fabric, not leather seats, but the seats are contoured. I think because of the thickness of the pad, it doesn't conform to the shape of the seat, but becomes an additional surface, which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else, much cheaper, for the back of the seat, rather than something underneath the carseat, and that worked great. I think using a towel could work fine, underneath the carseat, for some protection, without sliding issues.	
- 1	I'm really sad because I normally LOVE Sassy products but this one is not the high quality that I have come to expect from the brand.  The ring shapes are cute, but the plastic is really lightweight, which means it's difficult for a younger child to hold the pieces and get them on the ring because everything is always falling over with just the slightest touch.  At the very least, the bottom should  be weighted so it doesn't get knocked over so easily.  The other really annoying thing is that the middle bar is not tall enough.  It is not even tall enough for the rings to fit - it falls inside the top ring, whereas it should be slightly taller because this makes it really hard to get the top ring on. Remember, we're talking about babies and toddlers - they don't have the greatest dexterity in the world, so this makes it really difficult to play with the toy.  Overall, I regret buying this toy and would not recommend it.  I am now going to have to get a better and more sturdy ring stacker for my baby.	
- 1	It is confusing how the cords wrap around and comes out. There are little slots they have to come out of otherwise the cover won't snap closed. I also hate how the plastic cover is hard to open. And after wrapping one cord around, there doesn't seem to be enough space for another cord. I just ended up stuffing all the cords in a big wad into the cover and promising myself never to open it again. I give it two points for actually keeping the cords inside, but it is way too hard to use.	
1. 	I really like these mesh feeders.  The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.  The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.  The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.	
1. 	This product is just what you would think it would be... it's nice to have one in mom's car, one in dad's car and one in the grandparents' car... makes life simpler.	
- 1	These are ok.  They do what they're supposed to do and they're easier than rinsing the pump accessories for us working moms so no complaints there. They are indeed individually wrapped, which seems like a waste.  What bothered me is that they are marked unscented but there is clearly a chemical scent accompanying the wipes.  The instructions say that you can wipe your pump accessories down, let them dry, and they're ready to go.  However, if your accessories are still damp from the wipes, then you need to rinse them off.  I'm guessing this is because of the chemicals they use.  So once the pump accessories dry the chemicals magically go away?  I don't know how this works but I'm not getting them again.  Switching to pacifier wipes, they're cheaper and likely safer.	
1. 	Great additional stroller for tandem ride. An excellent sturdy build that fits both our newborn and our larger 4 year old. Pushes with easy and is very configurable for future use. A great product overall!	
1. 	I read some reviews suggesting that it is simple to just lift both toilet lid and seat I do not agree. There is a latch that actually goes inside the toilet bowl so that is not possible. My 15 month old son can not lift the lid and has actually lost interest in even trying. It is simple for me to open so no struggle when ya gotta go! I give this the full stars it deserves!	
- 1	These gave me a lot of relief from soreness. Until they gave me a miserable case of mastitis. Not recommended.	
1. 	When I turned it on, the beautiful night light caught my baby's attention right away.  She loves watching the light.  Sometimes she watched it for too long, got overtired, and then cried :)HOWEVER, there was a big problem with this product.  It cannot fit to my baby's crib!!!  Just like what the other reviewer said, if you have a slightly more expensive crib, this unit may not fit to the rail.  But since my baby seems to love this unit, so I filed flat the top of the thread screw of this unit (I needed to remove about 4mm from it).  Now I can fit it to the crib.  Hopefully it won't break down or else I may have problem returning it.	
- 1	After purchasing one on the go potty to encourage my daughter's potty training, I bought this one. After reading the reviews and being attracted to the benefit of it being so user friendly for toddlers, I bought it. The reviews are correct, the seal is air tight. I'm not sure that I mind that fact, especially if you leave &#34;their business&#34; inside until you can find somewhere to empty it. For me, I was able to empty it right away so the air tight seal was a nuisance, not to mention the fact that while potty training my daughter, she can only hold it for so long while I pry the thing apart so she can sit and use the potty....Then, the discouraging part: the first words out of her mouth were &#34;Owie, mommy&#34;. Well, I'm pretty sure not any two toddler booties are the same size, so assumed that my petite sized daughter just wasn't comfortable on it. So, I reluctantly gave the potty to her daycare, where many other children her age are actively potty training as well.I went to daycare to pick up my daughter, and found out that every child that was put on the potty complained that it hurt their bottom to sit on it. I took a closer look at it and realized that I wouldn't sit on it either! No way! It's super hard plastic. Yes, I agree with other reviewers that it's easy for them to carry around, but what toddler doesn't feel like a &#34;big girl&#34; or a &#34;big boy&#34; when they can carry something all by themselves.However when it comes time to actually use it for the purpose you buy it for, this product is an epic fail in my house. Now, I have two potties that I cannot use.The best remedy I  find is to buy a plastic cover (much cheaper!) to put over public toilets. If you potty training and need to go out, I just put in a pair of pull ups OVER the training pants. You avoid a stinky gross mess if an accident happens, but they still feels and understand what it feels like to have the accident and therefore are less likely to cling to the comfort of using diapers or pull ups. Besides, who wants to sit in their own mess! My daughter has come a very long way, but this product has had nothing to do with it. Perhaps someone on EBay would love the product, or I'll consider selling it at a local yard sale.With this product, this is what it comes down to: If my daughter isn't comfortable using it, she won't. Meaning: I waste my money. Especially when a room full of potty training toddlers also refuse to use it.	
1. 	This device is great!!! It heats the bottles to the right temp fast very fast. Easy to use. I could not live without it. The detached cooler is great for trips and family functions. Keeps the bottles cool to you are reasy for them.	
1. 	I purchased this cooler mainly to transport expressed milk from work to home. I got the cocoa/pink one and I really like the color. The brown bag looks very discreet, but that pink lining adds a little bit of personality. The zipper on the top is great to seal in the coolness. The handles have a button so that they can snap together and hang from stroller handlebar.I fit four Medela 5oz bottles along with three ice packs, one of which came with the bag. I added two of my own, about the same size as the included one. They're all about 5-6 inches tall and about 1 inch thick. I put two ice packs on the side and one on top of the bottles. With my setup, there's still a little bit of room on the top (about 2-3 inches), therefore, it's easy for me to zip and unzip.My commute from work to home is about 30-40 minutes, and when I get home, the bottles are still nice and cool. It definitely met my expectations. This is great value for under $10 bucks!Update 9/14/2013: After a year, I am still using this bag for when I go out with my baby. It fits three 8 oz Dr. Brown bottles with some excess room. Most of the time though, I pack a couple food pouches, one or two jars of baby food, a small bag of Cheerios, one Dr. Brown bottle... it could get tight, but because sealing the coolness isn't the priority anymore, I can leave part of the zipper open if necessary. The front pocket I store some napkins, a couple baby spoons, and most of the time a waterproof bib... gets a little poofy, but who cares? Haha! All in all, I still think that the price I paid for this bag has made its return and I'm satisfied. =)	
1. 	I think this pillow is a must for any pregnant woman who struggles with sleep at night. It helps support your back and hips.  It is however really large and it took me a few nights to learn how to sleep with it (almost like there is a technique to it).  But once I figured it out, my sleeps have been as good as they're going to get while being pregnant.  I sleep comfortably with this pillow.  My only disappoint is that I wish they made a cover for it so that I can wash it.	
1. 	Having nursed my daughter over the past year, the Bebe Au Lait nursing cover has been an indispensable accessory that has seen perhaps the most use of any baby item we've purchased. It's a must for nursing in public except for those that are a bit more daring about their level of public breast exposure. The built-in pockets are wonderful for storing small accessories, such as the nipple shields I needed. They have also doubled as impromptu burp rags for quick, small clean-up jobs. The wire sewn into the neckline creates a convenient and discrete way to peek in on the baby as they nurse, which is rather critical when trying to get them comfortably situated and properly latched on. As a whole, the cover folds up compactly for convenient transport via diaper bag (or purse). The one challenge we encountered is that, as my daughter grew older and more active, she grew fond of waving the cover around like a flag, which sort of defeats the purpose. By the ten month mark, she no longer tolerated being hidden under the cover since it blocked her view of what was going on around her. The cover still gets five stars for being a critical part of our nursing relationship for a solid ten months. Just be aware that older babies may be less tolerant of it.	
1. 	My baby was in NICU for a week & was fed through a bottle so it was very hard to establish breastfeeding. my lactation nurse gave me the full coverage version of these to try and even though it worked it always seemed to flip and almost cover the baby's nose so I was concerned about her breathing. I got these and right away I noticed a difference and within a week I was able to trick her into feeding without the shields, YAY!	
- 1	When I started feeding my son solids, I purchased a pack of pouch pops to use on our 20 Squooshi pouches. These were the only ones available at the time, so of course I got them. The pouch pops lengthen & soften the hard spout on pouches, but that's pretty much it in my opinion. I still had to squeeze the pouches for my son because he would constantly squeeze too hard too fast, & end up wearing his food!Then came the Sip'n tops... It's like they read my mind! I seriously LOVE these caps. They have a one way valve, so baby can only get food out by sucking... They can squeeze & squeeze & not a single drop will spill out! I no longer have to hold the pouch for my son, he can hold it & feed himself in a matter of minutes! I also love that these have an attached loop & cover for storage... So if baby doesn't finish the contents of his pouch, just pop the cap's cover on and let him finish it a little bit later. I couldn't do this with pouch pops, they don't have any covers for storage. They also don't have the much needed (& appreciated!) one way valve!The Sip'n caps are more expensive per 2 pack, but are worth every penny in my opinion. I'd seriously pay double to be mess free like I have been lately! I bought 10, but still have 6 unopened and have been rotating the original 4 I first purchased.Overall, Sip'n caps win for me! They soften the hard spouts, have covers for storage/travel, and have that amazing mess free valve! If you just want something to soften the spouts, then the pouch pops would work for that!	
1. 	My son was colicky and swaddling really helped. This blanket worked well for him in the first month or so of his life, but then he got stronger and started breaking free of it. We moved up to the miracle blanket which is alot more secure with no velcro.	
- 1	I have Beaba Pro 2X and it does not fit at all. The rice cooker/insert is too big to fit in the Beaba Pro 2X.I had to return it. It would've been nice if the seller made it clear that it does not fit in the Pro 2x.	
1. 	This cover fits perfectly on Costco shopping carts, covering all surfaces, as well as all supermarket carts. I keep getting stopped by people asking me about it because my baby looks so comfy - it's like a mini sofa! It has tons of features:* Very padded and comfortable, especially for long grocery runs. My baby can nap in it, supported by the pillow, while still buckled in.* Has a wide removable pillow 18 x 6 x 4 that you can insert behind baby to prop them up if they can't sit up well. It's attached by a tether so it stays in the cart.* Secures to the cart with just one hand - you just unzip, plop it into the cart, flip one part over and under the handle, flip the other part over the back, turn the fitted edges over onto the sides of the cart, and attach it with a buckled strap.* Buckled waist belt for baby* Can also be used as a diaper pad. I don't use it for this purpose because the fabric is too nice!* Doubles as a backup diaper bag. Has a large 19x 11 zippered pocket to put diapers, formula packets, ointment, etc.* Has two smaller 9 1/2 x 4 zippered compartments, for coupons, makeup, wallet, etc.* Two elastic loops to hold formula bottles.* Folded into itself, it zips up all contents neatly to the size of a small duffel bag, (24 x 9 in diameter).* Machine washable cold, machine dry warm. With the exterior's heavy black canvas and all the padding, it doesn't look like something I'd like to wash too frequently. Will have to see how easy this is.* Also comes in pink, at BRU.I've tried the Clean Shopper (almost no padding, smaller, a simple strap goes through the back to secure the baby to the cart) and the Safe N' Easy (cheap quality, looks like a big rain coat/ shower cap, difficult to get baby into, doesn't stay on). They can't compare to this one.	
1. 	If you are expecting a baby, you need a Boppy!  As a nursing mother, I don't know what I would have done without this pillow, particularly in the early days when I was trying to figure it all out.  It gets the baby in the right position so he/she doesn't have to search for the breast and the mother has a hand free to guide the baby.As she got older, I no longer needed the pillow for nursing.  Instead, the Boppy was being used to prop her up after feedings and for naptime.  Then, I started using it for tummy time and then to give her support as she learned to sit.I recommend this to every mother out there!This particular slipcover is very soft and comfy, although it does become less so after numerous washes.  I still recommend getting one, though.	
1. 	We have a row home with very low banister.  I purchsed the Kidco Configure Gate along with the extension and it fits perfectly and wraps around the area nicely and doesn't take up too much room.  For the purpose I gave it 5 stars, but I did feel both the gate and extension were a bit pricey.  The gate is crafted well, easy to install, and the peace of mind is well worth it.	
- 1	I'm so sad!  I bought another JJ Cole bag in May 2013, it began to fall apart after only a few weeks.  I contacted customer service for JJ Cole, they had me destroy my old bag and sent me a new bag.  I chose this bag the Caprice Diaper bag and now after using this one for only a few weeks the front pocket of the bag is coming apart!  These aren't cheaply priced bags.  I know it's not me!  I usually carry the same bag or purse for a year or more and I've never had a bag come apart like these bags!  I have an old bag by another brand of diaper bags (SKIP HOP) from my first son and that bag is still in perfect shape!  I will be contacting JJ Cole again as I'd just like my money back at this point!  I won't be buying another JJ Cole bag again!  It's sad because they are cute bags!	
1. 	It was very easy to install with the extentions to fit my 47 1/2 inch door way. Didn't take long to get it up and instructions were very clear to understand. Opening the gate can be done with one hand and closes by itself after you let the gate go. It is a very tall gate and I like the good quality grip pads. It comes with adhesive pads or screws to install the mounting cups. I used the adhesive and works great. I got it online at sears for a good price with extentions included. Highly recommend this gate!	
1. 	This is one of only a few products my husband and I would buy again with no hesitation.  We bought it over a year ago (with the extension) and have used it every day since.  When my daughter outgrew the octoganal arrangement, we just opened it up and have used it to block her from the kitchen and other dangerous areas.  She is not a climber yet, so I do NOT recommend using it in this fashion if your child is.  It will tip over, the circular formation is the sturdiest.  We haven't had any problems with pieces breaking off or the plastic being brittle and we adjust it almost daily.  Highly recommended.	
1. 	Our first house had a huge kitchen and dining room but our new house didn't!  We used her highchair as long as we could because I loved it.  But after about 2 months it just got in the way too much!We had the hook on chair for dining out but I really didn't want it for the house.  I started looking at boosters and this was the best we found!The tray is awesome!  That was the main reason I held on to her chair for so long!  It makes feeding her a snap.  She eats what we eat before I season it so when everything is ready you just grab the tray and fill it up.  It cools while I season and get everything to the table.  She then sits at the table with us and eats.  When your done it pops off and goes right in the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes.  It's also great for potlucks!It can be adjusted to fit almost every table.  We've used it at church, home, grandma's and friend's house and we've yet to find a table it won't adjust to fit.  We've used it without and without the tray and she fits fine everywhere.It is also super portable!  You can have it unhooked and folded up to go in seconds!  Then once you're there you can have it unfolded and hooked to a chair just as quick!  It doesn't take up much room in the house or car.  We also have yet to find a chair that it can't hook to.  In fact one of our favorite restaurants (small family owned place) bought a couple of these to use as boosters after seeing ours.These seats really are great whether your cramped for space or just ready to move up to a big kid seat!	
1. 	I love this blanket!  It is nice and sturdy and does not blow away in the wind.  I use it at the park, beach, and many other places.  If the ground it wet it will not soak through.  I guess the only downside is if it gets really dirty you need to go to a laundry mat to use a super sized washer.  But usually, you can just wipe it down with baby wipes and it cleans up well.  It's a material that is slicky and repels dirt.  So just don't set it down on top of dog poop and you will be ok.	
- 1	We bought these pail liners for our newborn's diaper bin.  We were using an old stainless steel trash can that we had with a closable lid, and thought these would be perfect because of the elastic top.  The fit is great and they definitely stay in place.  But after about 3 weeks, we noticed a smell to our diaper load when it came out of the wash, and verified that the smell is coming from these bags (not the clean cloth diapers).  And after 6 weeks, we are getting leaks in these bags.  The bottom of our trash bin is now wet every time we lift one of the bags out.  We did put these bags in the dryer, but made sure it was on low heat, as the directions indicate.  I definitely don't recommend this product.	
- 1	We had to get some of these for the bottles.Like: 1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it. 3) LEAKS! - No valve except the hole in the cup spout. 4) No valve except in the cup spout. Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year. Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options. I recommend anyone investigate those first	
- 1	I loved the look of this cup and my 8mo has no trouble sucking water out of it, but only if the conditions are right. The valve is a neat design and mostly keeps the liquids in, but is awkward to clean and does spill a little with every knock of the cup on the table. The biggest disappointment are the handles, which are very loose and will spin around the base when he tries to lift the cup. He finds it so frustrating that, although in the right position the handles would be very comfortable for him to hold, he'd rather I hold it for him. It's also because as soon as the liquid level is below about 3/4 full, the cup has to be horizontal or tilted backwards for the liquid to go into the valve, and he doesn't like tilting his head that far back. He has more success and finds it more comfortable drinking out of a regular Target sports bottle (with a straw), which is surprisingly also far more leak-proof.Pros:- looks great- nice shape handles for a baby to hold (if they stayed in place)Cons:- handles are loose- valve difficult to clean inside- does spill a little when shaken- only works at a very limited angle (a little too low or too high, or slightly to the side, and you won't get anything out)Overall, really wanted to like this product, but using it has been a sore disappointment.	
- 1	I was really disappointed upon receiving this at the size of the travel crib when packed away. I was hoping for something we could take on an airplane with us as a carry on, this is not the solution that allows for that. It is much too big. It must be checked, which in this age of paying for checked bags this is just one more thing we would have had to pay to check. We sent it back. The mattress appeared plush and the crib seemed like it would do serve it's purpose well as a sleeping place, but it just wasn't airline travel friendly in our opinion. If we drove while traveling we would have kept this crib. But with the number of times airlines have lost my bags if I had to check our travel crib when flying I'd also have to have a backup plan on where my baby could sleep when the airline lost the crib. We ended up with the GuavaFamily GoCrib and it's fantastic!!	
- 1	These are awful.  Once you wash them they curl up into a tight scroll and will not lay flat again.  Terrible purchase.  After unsuccessfully trying to get them to lay flat I threw them away.  What a waste.	
1. 	I wanted a wipe warmer for the simple fact of making diaper changes more comfortable for my son. This works so great as long as you frequently check the sponge at the bottom. It's very easy to do so don't let the other reviews fool you. All you have to do is press down on it and see if any moisture comes up. If you let it dry out, it's useless because it gets brick hard-trust me. I'd say you have to re-wet it twice a week and I would buy a new one every 3 months like it says. I don't put the whole holder filled with wipes and that makes it easier. I'd also rather not use any pop up wipes with it because using that mechanism doesn't keep them as warm. I like to open up the whole top part and pull out a nice warm wipe instead of a half way warmed wipe thru the top hole. And I've never had a problem with the top not staying latched-yes, I have used the top part plenty to know this.I made the mistake of letting my sponge get dry and it turned brown and hard so I already need to buy a new one before I can use it again. I also didn't buy distilled water, just used water out of our Brita pitcher and that works fine.The reason I gave it 4 stars is how often you have to maintain the water level of the sponge. It would be nice if you didn't have to check it so often and worry about it drying out so quick and turning into a brick.But it works great for its intended use and keeps baby happy as well.	
1. 	I really, really love this stroller. I can open and collapse it one handed, which any mom can appreciate. I feel comfortable with my daughter in the shoulder and lap belt, and the canopy is much better than the cheapo strollers at Toys R Us. The quality of the construction is great as well. I guess I don't see the big deal with the reclining feature, mostly because it doesn't recline very far and my daughter doesn't really like it, but every kid is different.This is a great lightweight umbrella stroller and my only complaint is such a minor issue it's barely worth the time, BUT... I'm average height and the handles can be a little awkward for long walks. If I walk close enough to hold them comfortably, I end up kicking the back wheels. If I keep my distance, I have to rest my palms on the pointed end. It is highly likely that I'm having difficulty transitioning from a bulky, traditional stroller to this model, and that you should ignore this complaint and just get the stroller anyway.	
- 1	UPDATE:This sippy cut lasted less than 2 months. The handle kept getting more loose, until it came off completely. And it leaked. I was excited to get it at first, but it was too frustrating so we got rid of it.=====Pros:*BPA-Free (never let your child near plastics that are not BPA-free, especially little boys)*Two-handled*Handles remove, to convert into grip-able cup*Valve is good, easy to remove for faster flowCons:The only real problem is that the handles don't snap or lock into place. So they slide around the cup, sometimes covering up the nozzle.	
1. 	Shipped in nice original box.Four corner plus the long strip - as described.A nice touch is the double-sided-tape is 3M and not some cheap fall-off-next-week tape.	
1. 	Love these.  Best thing I ever got. Use them for my twin grandsons ain't my small kitchen.  Easy to set up and take down.  The twins are two now and have been using these since they could sit up.  Easy to clean.  I sewed two towels together and put it over the back of the chairs to minimize those grimy hands.  We take these camping and when we visit friends and family.  There are three hieght adjustments and folds up to take anywhere.  Nice to have for many years!	
1. 	Love the boning in the neck line. Perfect to let baby breathe and allow me to see what's going on. Used it for the first time today, and felt totally comfortable nursing in the living room with guests.	
- 1	I liked this straw cup until my daughter pushed in the silicone lid and spilled the drink ALL OVER herself in her car seat ... twice (we were travelling and I couldn't get a new one right away).  Now it's in the trash.Try the 10oz straw cup by Vital Baby, they're MUCH better and don't leak or come apart.	
1. 	this carrot gets lumpy after a while, but my baby really likes to chew on it.  it takes a long time to dry - at least 2 cycles in the dryer.	
- 1	Okay, not my favorite teething product but not worth my time to return either. I would keep looking if I were you.	
1. 	Love under the nile products for being fair trade and always using organic cotton.  This is a great toy for a teething baby.  My daughter loves chewing on the ends of the green bean.  I think it is very comforting to her.  This kind of toy is a much better shape then some of the other under the nile toys because my daughter can chew and hold it easily.  We also have the strawberry, broccoli and tomato and this is her favorite one to chew on out of the bunch.	
- 1	I purchased these after a lot of research. I was so unhappy with the plastic bottles, they leak, and for the price I paid, they should have been the best. I would not recommend them to anyone.	
1. 	For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret.	
1. 	No complaints here!  Does what it should and seems to be well made.  I installed these on the outlets I use most often (ie, for the vacuum cleaner), and then put these  little plastic covers on the rest -Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack	
1. 	These are the best bibs ever. We have a variety of types of bibs that we were given at baby showers and these are the best by far. They don't get grimy like the other ones. It helps tremendously to be able to put the bibs in the wash.The only con may be if your child tries to yank their bib off on their own - velcro tab may not do much for you then. That said, my 19 month old yanks his bib off at the end of meals but it takes a LOT of effort.If I had a list of &#34;must have&#34; baby items for every mother these bibs would be on it!	
- 1	Not very smooth. We bought another that is one third the price that rocks so much better.  Do not buy	
1. 	I don't particularly understand the technology behind this model of baby bottles, but I do know that I see plenty of bubbles end up in the bottles while feeling my daughter. They are always at the nipple of the bottle. Does this happen to anyone else? I normally use the drop-ins bottles and I don't prefer one bottle over the other. I notice the same amount of burping and fussiness regardless of whichever bottle I use. I do like that the bottle is bent so it is easier to feed my baby. Also, I didn't notice at first that the pack came with fast flow nipples, but that was my fault. I thought something was wrong at first but it was just the wrong nipple, as my baby still requires the slow-flow ones.	
1. 	this package has every thing i was looking fore and in a great price ...it's perfect for all new moms	
- 1	Why did you choose this rating?Not fill my expectations.What did you like or dislike ?You do not have enough pressure and grip needed to express milk . I do not served .Who would you recommend this product to ?Would not recommend . Not this brand.	
1. 	I am a big guy, and even when I pushed down on the base of our Graco seat, I could not get the seat installed tight enough. A couple of clicks on the Mighty-Tite was all I needed to fix that!This device is excellent, and I can't possibly imagine anyone breaking it like some reported here, the device weighs a lot (a good thing) and feels extremely sturdy.	
1. 	This is the swaddle we prefer for our baby, she is about 13.5 pounds. She usually cannot get out of it although sometimes she gets one arm out through the neck. This swaddle is completely adjustable there is a ton of velcro. The only issue we have had is that when we first bought it the velcro was almost TOO sticky, and in only about a week it didn't seem quite sticky enough but it still works because there is so much of it. We prefer the fleece swaddles because the cotton ones stretch and do not seem to fit our baby correctly.	
- 1	The mirror is not much larger than other mirrors or more clear. I ended up returning it for a regular rectangular mirror. There was nothing special about this mirror!	
- 1	This came off after the first time it got hot. Do have a GE Profile with a slightly rounded front so this wasn't seated all the way back (close but not quite all the way) - but I think it just couldn't take the stove getting hot.	
- 1	This product made my baby choke.  After multiple attempts and the same outcome, we've decided to discontinue using it.  I do have a friend that this is the only nipple her baby will use.  So it depends on each child.  However, for this being listed as the closest to breastfeeding, it hasn't worked for us.  We use Dr Browns wide bottles with the natural flow nipples with better results.  I would be nice if other bottle companies would make a nipple attachment for the Medela bottles to avoid having to use one bottle for pumping and one for feeding.	
1. 	I recieved this play gym as a baby shower gift. We have been through 3 gyms and this one is the nicest. My two year old loves playing with her little sister on this. All the gyms we tried were all Fisher Price play gyms (one we found was an injury hazard after my daughter was injured on one. Fisher price somehow got wind of this and began I don't know if harassing is the right word but continued calling me on 3 occasions. Anyway none of the fisher price play gyms had this many toys. One featured Mcdonalds type toys and stopped working after two uses. It was promply thrown in he garbage where it belongs.The Baby einstein play gym is easy to fold. Takes no time setting up (a plus for a busy mom like me) and can easy store away (fisher price claims this on the Ocean Wonders Play gym but trust me from experience its not at all)	
1. 	I love storing homemade baby food and her snacks in these little containers. They are small, children eat small. They don't take up a lot of space. Beware the cups if a child is very young. They can pop the lids off with their teeth.	
1. 	We use this for cloth diapering. It is better than the diaper genie at keeping smell in - and we don't even use a scent thing in the top. It's in our bedroom where the changing table is. NEVER smells unless we open it and, hello people, whether we all like it or not, smell comes out when we open a diaper pail. But when it's closed, the smell stays in and doesn't leak at all. The only issue I have is it's a bit small, but we have 2 girls in cloth diapers, and we wash every 2 days, and it fits 2 days of 2 kids diapers easily. So I guess it's not that small. We line it with a PUL lined bag or a trash bag, and the lid still works well. Just make sure you snap the lid on right.	
1. 	We don't have a dishwasher so I throw everything in the sterilizer (bottles, breastpump parts, binkies, etc.)after washing with soap and water. It is easy to use, just throw items in, 7 ounces of water and microwave for 7 minutes. I use this sterilizer daily.I only gave it four stars because I put in the breast shield from my First Years breast pump and it melted a bit where the shield sat in the appropriate slot. I can still use the breast shield but there is a permanent dent melted into it. Otherwise, I love this sterilizer!	
1. 	i was no able to find these in store so i bought them online. i love them. better to replace the valves than the whole cup!	
1. 	I really like these quick clean wipes for my breast pumps accessories. However, I just think they are too expensive. I have not purchased from Amazon only MacroBaby.They work well. I have purchased them a few times. I pumped 5 days a week at work for 10 months and I just couldn't continue to purchase these.But, they are a great product for on-the-go.I love the Medela brand and this product falls in line with there other great products that are not cheap either :-).	
1. 	I like this blanket a lot because it is soft, is a square shape (those rectangle ones are terrible) and is very large.  We have two of them - one in the lavender polka dots and one in the fuschia polka dots.  At first when we brought our newborn home, it seemed huge.  But that turns out to be good because it lasts a long time as the baby grows.  A lot of receiving blankets we got turned out to be too small and were only used for about 2 weeks.  Now this is the main blanket we use for swaddling our daughter.	
- 1	The opening is a little small and it's hard for my 3 year old to pee with it without peeing all over the pee guard.  Plus, why would you put ridges in the pee guard?  It makes it so much harder to clean and sanitize.  My 3 year old is in the 50-75th percentile for height and weight, so he's not a huge kid so I feel this seat is just made too small for the average 3 year old.  I don't think I'd recommend it to others.	
1. 	I really like these mesh feeders.  The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.  The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.  The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.	
1. 	What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave.	
1. 	After a few turns of the lid there is a slight leak, but  over all great!  Great for kids learning how to use real cups

1. 	My son was scared of falling into the toilet so this was super helpful when we really dove into potty training. He liked that it tightened down so it didn't slide around like a cheaper model we had picked up. The little lip in the front is very handy for boys learning to aim while seated if you know what I mean. ;) We're getting ready to use it for boy #2 and it still looks new.	
- 1	As another customer posted we got a stinky stroller too. My wife does not want to use it and wants me to send it back. If I had the energy, I would but so tired, this is the 3rd time in a row I have been burned by Amazon.	
1. 	This is a pretty good design and we especially like the high back, which makes it possible for babies/toddlers to sit unsupported.	
1. 	i love this bouncer!  i have used it for both of my kids, and, even though i had to return it three times because of a faulty vibrations switch, i never once regretted purchasing this seat!  you can switch it on so that the music, fish and bubbles all move around for the baby to stare at! my son used to sit in the seat for 20-30 minutes at a time, and my daughter, who is much more active than my son was, would sit for 10-15 minutes at a time, which is a HUGE amount of time for her!  i love this bouncer and would buy it again if i ever have more children.	
- 1	We bought this one and the dinosaur one a year ago. The dinosaur broke after 5 months, and the moon finally broke after 10 months as well... the button you're supposed to press falls inside and it's impossible to reach anymore. Huge bummer because my kids love these... Customer support replaced the first one for just the price of shipping, which was nice, but we won't bother getting another one to replace the moon. Now, of course they are 3 so they played with these a little too much, but unless you have kids that don't drop or throw things, these will get broken eventually... A shame!	
1. 	My son wasn't so fond of this at first since the music is quite loud, but now he loves it. I love how he can grow with it. It is so versatile, it keeps us both entertained. For the money this is a great buy that will last you years!	
1. 	My baby likes it. She likes the colors and the toys hanging on it. One small thing - currently at age of 2.5 months, she kind of leans on one side in the rocking position - could be baby specific but could also be how the seat is shaped.	
- 1	They are a great product if your child takes to the trainer set, other wise, inquisitive children get distracted by them, specially because of the color choices instead of making them clear or white.	
1. 	I am pumping 2-3 times a day while at work and I use these wipes after each time.  I've found that I can use the same wipe all day, saving me money and time.  I usually use a napkin to wipe off any drips and then the wet wipe to clean the various pieces.  You will still need to wash with water now and again, because the wipes can't get into the smaller places, but they definitely do the trick when you're in a pinch. I highly recommend them!	
1. 	Great set, but you'll need more nipples. At least 2 out of the 5 are Fast Flow, which I didn't use until my baby was 8-9 months old. The nipples are like $4 for a 2pk, so add that to the cost when comparison shopping.Other than that, I love these bottles! I don't have a single complaint about them. I do not use a bottle warmer. They do leak in the diaper bag when not kept upright, but I store mine upright, so that's a non-issue.	
1. 	Per Wired Magazine's May 2005 edition (Page 61):Shopping cart handle germ count: 1 MILLION.If just 10 percent were influenza virus, you could pick up: 510 germs.Number that would make you sick: 1.When I think of my children touching those surfaces and then putting their little hands in their mouths, or rubbing their eyes... yuck, makes me squeemish.I'm ordering two today: One for each car so dad and I can cut down on the contagion we battled this last year.[The number of germs on a toilet handle, btw, is only 50,000]	
1. 	We have something similar to this leftover from when my daughter was a baby and I wanted another, I wasn't ablt to find exactly the same pad but this is doing the job.	
- 1	PLEASE do your child a favor, DO NOT PURCHASE THESE! We had been using these for our child for some time. Yesterday, upon randomly inspecting them, I found a layer of mold in both spouts. We are very clean people but it's difficult to see in the long, thin spout and no way to clean inside it so we never noticed this mold growing. I am so disgusted!!! I feel like the worst parent for letting my child use these and I have no idea how long the mold has been there. It doesn't matter how well they work, if you cannot clean them properly you are hurting your child!	
1. 	Love the various patterns that we can choose from.Makes nursing less boring and less embarrassing.It worked great for me and kept this cover along with the Vitaville Argan oil, which is a nipple saver!I also have given this cover as baby shower and my girlfriends loved it.	
- 1	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.	
1. 	This edge guard is very easy to put on and sticks very well. Its very soft as well. Would recommend.	
- 1	If this product actually spun around like a lazy susan, which I thought it would, it would have  a much better rating.  But turning this thing doesn't really work.  Would have been better off getting small shelves to fit more baby food in the cabinet.	
- 1	zipper breaks after a few uses	
- 1	My daughter loves this toy but.....it broke within a few months!  I wrote the company and with in a few minutes I receive a reply that the toy is no longer in production!  If I mail the toy to them (spend more of my money) they will replace the toy with a similarly priced toy.  They provided no information as to what that toy would be.  Don't buy this obviously defective product!	
1. 	I bought this set to split with another mother so we could give them a try. We love them!! These little snack cups are terribly convenient and I quite literally don't leave home without it. They're not 100% spill-proof of course, but they cut down on mess (and food maintenance) a great deal. Being able to hand my son his snack cup while I prepare a meal equals two satisfied parties. And have I mentioned errands and outings? Grocery shopping was made oodles easier after the snack cup.When your kid is peckish and you don't want to whip out a bib or otherwise be overly concerned with clean-up, the snack catcher is the way to go. (Yes, you will need to pick up a few errant crumbs or bits that have been shaken out, but the majority stays put.)Highly recommended product!	
1. 	My daughter has been using these for the last (6) weeks and loves them.  They are easy to use and clean, and the nipple really seems perfect for moms who are breastfeeding.The baby has not had any gas issues while using these. Now purchased them in (2) sizes....5 STARS	
1. 	I had some personal recommendations on the Diaper Dekor, I read the reviews and decided to get it.  Overall, I am very pleased with it.  It has a foot pedal to open the lid and you can drop the diaper through the trap doors.  The pedal does not work exceptionally well on plush carpet because there is little firm support underneath it, but it's good enough.  You can always put some plywood under the pail and pedal for extra support.  Also, if you have a dirty diaper, the mess could get on the trap doors if that part of the diaper hits them.  When full, the pail is very easy to empty.  Open the bottom compartment, pull out the plastic tube/bag with the dirty diapers, cut it and throw it away.  Then pull the tube/bag down, tie a new knot in it and the pail is ready to fill again.  The refills are a bit tricky to replace the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.  The refill bags last a long time.  There are three to a box and we've only used two boxes in eight months.  There is no way of knowing when a refill bag is near the end though, so you may not be left with enough to hold the diapers and the dirty diapers may be loose in the pail.  This has happened to me a couple of times and it's not a big deal to clean up.  It would be nice if the plastic had a red stripe toward the end of it like cash register receipt papaer does, so you'd know when it's about out.This diaper pail does not do anything fancy with the diaper, such as roll it up into a sausage, but you can roll it up if you want to save space and fit more diapers in the pail.  When your child is eating solids though, you will probably want to empty the pail daily.  Each time you open the lid to put a new dirty diaper in, the smell of the previously discarded diapers wafts into the room.  I've tried adding some baby powder or baking soda to the bag to help absorb the odor.  I also got some diaper pail deodorizers from Babies R Us that seem to help mask the smell.	
- 1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.	
1. 	This was a good purchase.  My one problem with the blanket is that the inside seam where the stripes and the vinyl are sewn, are coming apart.  Other than that, this was a good purchase.  Good for beach, park, whatever.  Can get wet and is not an issue.	
- 1	I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick. Also they don't really block the sun either, I don't think any product like these would. I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face.	
- 1	First time mom who is over protective. Baby liked the colors and animals (we bought the animal friends one). However, this thing is HEAVY & I couldn't stand the thought that the moment I walk away it could fall & hit my poor daughter right in the face! Sure it can be tightened, but I don't think enough to have it be safe!If they can make this lighter I would whole heartedly recommend.	
1. 	These are so awesome. I plan on buying a lot more! This version is more light weight. Which I like because I don't keep my house too cold and until summer comes I am putting him in a light weight sleeper. my 4 month old didn't care too much for it the first couple days but then got used to it and sleeps in one most nights. I do not care for the heavier weight ones, not sure if its micorfleece or just fleece either way I'm not planning on buying any of those.	
1. 	Really love this bundleme. The color is beautiful, and fit our red stroller very good. It helps me very much, after i got this, I can take my baby out everyday in the winter. Useful and good item.	
1. 	I could smack my lactation consultants for not recommending nipple shields when I told them that breastfeeding was too painful. My son is 4 weeks old and i've been pumping exclusively and feeding him from a bottle while trying and filing to get him to latch properly. With the nipple shield, he latched on the second try. They say these things can reduce your supply because your nipples don't come into contact with the baby. Well, guess how much contact we had with exclusive pumping: NONE!Now we just have to see if i can get him to nurse regularly with the shields.	
- 1	I own several PP items and love almost all of them.  This product however, was a disaster for me.  I thought the size would be great, but its shape is overly cumbersome and weighs you down considerably.  This might not be a problem if you have only one baby, but I had twins so I already had my hands full.  I needed something with good storage capacity, but that wouldn't be so difficult to carry - this had plenty storage capacity but was not easy to carry at all.  I am not a large person - average weight, but tall.  It made me so wide I had trouble fitting through tight spaces (like between cars in the parking garage, etc). It would scratch against the cars, or bump into peoples chairs when walking through restaurants.  Then there was the velcro closure.  I cannot count how many pairs of tights and how many sweaters were ruined by that stuff.  I had my twins in November, so it was cold and I was wearing that kind of attire daily.  If I got in a hurry (imagine that happening when you are a busy mom with newborn twins) and picked it up without properly closing it (which generally required two hands - HA, I haven't had two free hands since I became a mom!!) it would snag the heck out of whatever I was wearing.  And it is a HUGE piece of velcro!  I sold this barely used bag and several matching accessories at a twins sale and went with a touring tote plus a matching faraway fold out tote to use as a companion bag when I need to carry more baby gear with me and I am a much happier camper.	
1. 	Love this playmat! We also have the baby einstein ocean playmat and they are both great... We love the sounds and effects on this playmat and our son has loved it since day one (about 3-4 months old)..Now that he can crawl he will lay on it for a few minutes and chew on toys, but we like to leave the music and lights on for him while he crawls around and plays.. He can flip it over now, and he thinks that it is funny, but it is sturdy and he never could flip it when he was younger..	
- 1	I bought this set at Buy Buy Baby in a pinch. I had been sending the small Pyrex glass bowl/blue lids to daycare and they were starting to chip. I wanted a set that was safe so I bought this as well as the Innate lid/bowl combo at the store.Overall I am not pleased with the price/design of the ThinkBaby product.ConsLike other reviews, the words scrape offI think the cup will be useless and I won't be using the spoon and forkthe plastic over the stainless bowl makes for extra pieces to wash and store since you don't want mold between themthe bowls are bulky and I am sure they will leak if I were to put a thin liquid in themyou can't microwave them so I must send items to eat cold otherwise daycare will just transfer the food into a plastic bowl which defeats the purpose hereWith that said, I really do like the rectangle piece with the latch lid. I also really really love the Innate bowl. It is a stainless container with a silicon lid that turns into a silicon bowl. Daycare is happy to transfer the food into the bowl and can microwave the puree/or pasta I send without the issue of leaching plastics and chemicals.Had I designed the set, I would have made them rectangle and added one w/ a two compartment option. There are plenty of times that I want to pack two small purees/items for daycare and must put a stainless ramekin inside the cereal bowl to separate the items. I am going to buy LunchBots next. Smaller container with less spots and it has the two compartment option.	
1. 	With all the bells and whistles out today on baby products, all you want is for your baby to be safe and comfortable in their tub.  This is definitely the case with this tub.  It is contoured perfectly to cradle your newborn and the padded backrest keeps him/her from slipping.  I did not use the cradle, although it is a nice feature, because I felt it made my baby too cold.  This simple design works perfect and fits on single and double sinks.  I love that I will be able to use it into toddlerhood.  The plug and built in wash basin are convenient added features.	
1. 	Anyone who is breastfeeding needs this product in case you get damaged nipples from bad latches! I didn't have this product and got infections, etc., from bad latches while breastfeeding	
1. 	These little bottles are surprisingly strong and light weight for what they are, which is a glass bottle.  While they can shatter, it takes a lot to get them there thanks to their compact build.  On top of that, you don't need to worry about BPA.The only problem with these bottles is that they have to be screwed down just right to allow airflow into the bottle and prevent baby from gulping air.  This can be solved with a nipple that Gerber puts out made of brown silicone that has a cross cut in the side of the nipple.  It's absolutely perfect for these little bottles.	
- 1	I first heard of the boppy pillow when a friend of mine had a baby.  She allowed me to use it to hold her baby without straining my arms.  I thought it was the greatest thing.  I had never had a baby before and never held one and I thought there would be no way I could breastfeed without it.  Little did I know at the time I was pregnant.  I registered for a pillow and didn't get one, so I paid the outragous price and shipping because I thought I wouldn't be able to live without it.  Pre-pregnancy I was a size 1-5 or extra small.  I gained probably 60 lbs.  When I brought my baby home, the pillow would not even fit around the fat left over from pregnancy.  Once my uteros (sp?) did go down quite a bit, it fit a little better (it still doesn't fit quite right) and I could try to use it.  I have large breasts (about DD) and I still had to prop a blanket under my baby's head to reach my breast.  She would fall into the gap left in the stomach area all the time because it didn't fit right.  I eventually just set the pillow aside and do not use it.  She is now a little over a month old and it is really easy to set her in my lap and she reaches the breast on her own.  Do not be fooled that you will get your money's worth out of it.  I'm really dissapointed a read so many good reviews and turned out I wasted money that I could really use for other things like DIAPERS!  I would have given zero stars if there was the option.	
- 1	Really too think to be called a blanket. You will need to use multiple of these to keep baby warm!	
- 1	my 6 month old like to put everything in his mouth and is pleased that the mirror/music box hangs at just the right height for this.  the toy as a whole however is not great.  the mirror only plays one tune 90% of the time.  twice i have heard something different and wondered if it was a new song or the batteries dying.  the music lasts a very short period of time and is very hard to activate.  it has to be hit just right.  while i like the way the toy attaches, with two easy to use clamps, the joints, which make the toy angled, do not work well and the music isnt a great feature.  the mirror is low quality and images are very distorted. on a positive note, the bird has balls in its belly, which turns, and the fan works well with the pulling of the string.	
- 1	Got this for my bassinet and it says on the package even Prewash before use! I did it and it shrinked significantly!!!!! Had to return them!	
1. 	Diaper Champ is great.  But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.  So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!	
1. 	Our 3 1/2 old loves this car seat.  She was getting to heavy to lug around in the infant car seat so it was time to move up.  I have to say the installation instructions are VERY confusing so we went to the local fire department and had it installed professionally.  Most local fire departments do this about once a month free of charge.  I feel comfortable knowing it is in safe.We have gone on long road trips with the baby in this seat and she is just comfy and cozy the whole way.  We also love that when she gets to be over 40 pounds, we don't have to buy a new seat because this one converts to a booster.	
1. 	These work SO well, they cut through breastmilk with no issues and make things very clean and ready to use again. I'd love to be able to keep them in my breast pump tote all the time so I wouldn't have to dry and hand wash every part, every single time I used it. However, using 3-4 of these a day at $9 a pack would get a little expensive and I guess I'll just need to use soap and water. Any time someone buys these for me though, I love them!	
1. 	I have several of these - one under the sheet on the crib and one under the sheet to my pack and play.  LOVE THEM!  Great item to have!	
1. 	The Playtex Ventaire Advanced bottles are by far the best bottles I have used. This set came with 5 bottles in 2 different sizes as well as with extra nipples and extra vent disks, which is wonderful considering how often the bottles get used and being small parts, can get lost. The bottles are excellent for semi-upright feeding because of the angle in the bottle body, which I have found actually does help reduce the number of bubbles in the milk, in turn reducing the gas and colic my baby gets.I use these bottles to pump my breastmilk and they are fantastic and don't leak after repeated use like so many others. The plastic is good quality and doesn't warp over time like other bottles I used before - plus they are microwavable and BPA free. They are also easy to clean. Highly recommend!	
1. 	We got this wipe warmer from my aunt for a shower gift. We had a different warmer on our registry. I read all the reviews for this warmer and returned the one we wanted originally. I couldn't be happier with this warmer. Yes, water does gather on the lid, but runs down the inside of the warmer, thus rewetting the pad in the bottom of the warmer that keeps the wipes from drying out. Zac doesn't get a surprise with a cold wipe and we don't get a surprise from, well, those surprises boys &quot;spring&quot;  on you! This is a must have and I recommeded it to many expectant mothers I know!	
1. 	These are my go-to bibs. They wipe clean simply and love the pocket to catch food. My little one seems to think it is the best for storing snacks for later. :)	
1. 	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.  I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.  It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!  Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!	
- 1	Boutht this for my twins.  It ends up just sitting around. It's very heavy so not really something they like to play with.  The plastic is hard to so they have smacked it on their heads.  There are plenty of other teethers out there that are softer/lighter.  Not something I would recommend	
- 1	Filling them is hard. To shut it a lot spills out you must put not that much to be able to shut it. I so wasted my money.	
- 1	I bought this item because of the Sealy Posturepedic name, the price, and the fact that the positive reviews outweighed the negatives. Well...I should have paid attention to the customer who said that the mattress indented where her child was lying down. This is exactly what happened to me. After only a week, there was an indent in the mattress where my son's head and torso lay. I turned it over and the same thing happened. I think it's because of all the air above the springs, but I can't be sure. I returned it due to its very poor construction. I'm surprised, but at the same time I'm not because the mattress also had the Kolcraft brand name on it and I'm not particularly impressed with that brand.	
- 1	I totally understand that crib mattresses need to be firm in order to be safe, but seriously, this thing is much harder than is necessary to be considered safe.  We purchased the Nook pebble mattress for my 1st born (which I LOVE,) but during my 2nd pregnancy when we found out we were having twins, I went hunting for more affordable options.  We decided on the Colgate Classica I based on the review in the Baby Bargains book. I wish I would have spent just a little more $$ or maybe just tested a few more mattresses out before buying 2 of these concrete slabs. The girls refuse to sleep on these.  My son just transitioned into a twin bed, so we gave one of the girls his Nook mattress, but now I've got to look for a mattress topper for the other baby.On a positive note, this mattress is constructed well and is super light which makes for changing the sheets very easy.	
- 1	I got this as my little one has a Bee lunch bag as well.The metal parts were wobbly from day 1 (unpacking) but hasn't come off;however, I don't trust this anymore and stopped using them.The Heinz cutlery set I bought from the supermarket is sturdier.Waste of money	
1. 	I really like this bag. It is the right size for my 18 month old. BUT it is hard to clean. When I tried to turn it inside out to clean the seams ripped. So far it has held together ok, but I will likely have to get another soon.	
1. 	These are okay, good for the price. My toddler has figured out how to get the lids off though, so she still spills snacks all over the place. There's another snack catcher by munchkin that has a lockable lid. Get that one instead.	
1. 	I really like this magic cube. Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot. The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great. We enjoy it.	
1. 	One disclaimer--if you're used to sleeping with a feather pillow and down comforter, and you don't buy a different cover for your Snoogle, you're going to overheat in short order.  It's stuffed with polyester, which is fine--it holds its shape well and supports you--but by itself with this cover, it becomes waaay too hot.  That said, I love the shape and the support the pillow gives.  I've only had it for 2 nights, and the first night (without a separately purchased jersey cover) was hot, but with the new cover, I can already tell I'm waking up and flopping around the bed less.The also-pregnant friend who recommended the Snoogle to me said her dad got one and likes it for his back trouble, too.  I may have to recommend it to all the poor sleepers in my life.So, Snoogle with original cover:  4 stars.Snoogle with jersey cover:  5 stars.	
1. 	I loved the cover feel and its color! Match my nursery and my son loves the way it feels  : )	
1. 	the first thing i noticed when i received this was that the mirror was actually large enough and of high enough quality that you could see yourself.  we tried it in the car, but couldn't get it adjusted right --  so i hung it on the wall by the changing table so baby can look right into it while i change him.  i used a removable 3M wall hook (which are a miracle if there ever was one).  the monkey itself has a pleasant look and is soft.	
1. 	This ring was the first toy our baby grasped at 2.5 months of age.  I held it up for him, he grasped it and stuntedly shook it up and down then attempted to put it in his mouth.  A month and a half later he still goes for this ring and chews on it, shakes it and tries to pull it apart with both hands (one on each side pulling outward).  It is well made and I feel confident I am giving him something safe to play with.  This ring, the waldorf maple teether ring and Sophie the giraffe are his favorite three items to chew on and we highly recommend all three to ensure variety.	
- 1	These are not any good, the lid isn't secure enough. After spilling plenty of medicine we ordered the munchkin brand	
1. 	perfect size and color. keeps my baby wipes warm, so no more late nights changing diapers with cold wipes. Now my son have soft, moist and warm wipes.	
1. 	This bib keeps his face and clothes clean because it's rigid and he can't squeeze it and shove it up to his face. We had big messes with other bibs that were cloth and flexible. To clean the bib, you just wipe it and presto.	
1. 	I'm late getting a double stroller. My girls were 4 and 2 and we use this for traveling. It folds pretty flat. Steers well and looks comfortable. I like that the tray and visor can come off to reduce bulk. The handle is at an odd height for me, 5'2'' but its perfect for my husband, 5'11''. All in all a great stroller for older kids.	
- 1	I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.	
1. 	We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old.  Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for, she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business.  Now that she's nearing the two-and-a-half year mark, we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process.  After reading tons of potty seat reviews, I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer, since it's one of the few on the market that's made of BPA-free, non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl.  As an added bonus, this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat.  We have oval-shaped, elongated toilet seats in our home, and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly.  This toilet trainer doesn't slide around at all on the toilet seat, which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it.  Despite the exact fit, the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted.  There's a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage.  (We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank).As I said in the title of this review, the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect, if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto.  Apparently, when toddlers first begin to use the grown-up toilet, many of them experience an innate fear of falling in, even when using a potty seat insert like this one.  Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat.  This was the case with my daughter.  When sitting on this toilet trainer seat, she couldn't relax enough to urinate, much less have a bowel movement.  She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the (unsanitary) toilet seat in order to steady herself, but even then, she still couldn't relax enough to do her business.  On a hunch, I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary, which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles.  The first time we used that seat, my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet!  However, the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat, and it's not adjustable, so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it.  And unfortunately, none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market (the BabyBjorn, Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod), has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the SHANDLE. The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong, moisture-proof adhesive strip.  It's intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat.  But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat.  We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat (around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat), and voila!  She had two, secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat.  It doesn't hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs, martians and robots, which makes them attractive to toddlers.  (It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white, for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look).  Our daughter isn't yet fully potty-trained, but now she's comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat, and she looks forward to using the big potty.  (So much so that she's pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone baby potty!)If you've been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it doesn't have handles, please Google Shandle and consider giving the product a try.  It was the perfect solution for us.Grade: A- (1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer doesn't have built-in handles).	
- 1	This is a cute bath mat. We like that it's longer than most other bath mats. Unfortunately, it doesn't stick to the bathtub at all. We've tried it in 3 different bathtubs and the results were the same. Needless to say, we no longer use it. I wouldn't recommend this bath mat because it just moves around and floats, and that's not good if you have little ones who are new to being in the &#34;big&#34; bath and want them to stay safe.	
- 1	We purchased this in hopes that it would get our reluctant potty trainer to get interested. It leaked from the first 'use' all over our floor. I did check to make sure all parts were pieced/fit together correctly and tried it a few more times. It leaked each time.	
- 1	These are great as burp cloths but do not use these as diapers! The absorbent batting in the middle is no comparison to real cotton prefolds, like those from green mountain diapers. Your baby will soak right through these Gerber diapers and you will probably not want to cloth diaper anymore. Regal prefolds are pretty inexpensive also, so if you want to try cloth diapering, do your research! Try green mountain diapers or diaper rite.	
1. 	These cups are much bigger than they look - we can put an entire 8.25 oz Enfagrow drink in here.  Also, since the base is smaller, it fits in all traditional cup holders.  I buy only Gerber Graduates/NUK for Gerber Grads cups now since all the lids and parts are interchangeable.  That really comes in handy!  We've never had a leak issue as long as you place the white guard in securely enough.  Sometimes my daughter bangs them hard enough to knock it out, but that's an easy fix.	
- 1	This nipple shield was extremely large for me, and I would consider myself a medium size. The baby had difficulty even getting it in his mouth. I prefer the Medela sheild which provided a better fit for me.	
- 1	My rating may be a little unfair because the blankets are fine - but I bought these solely because I loved the adorable sheep pattern.  When it arrived however, the print is barely discernible.  It simply looks like a while blanket.  I will post a picture so you can see what I'm talking about (and it actually shows up better in the picture than in real life).  I guess it's always possible mine was a fluke, but this was my experience.When compared to my Aden and Anais blankets, I have found these to be more scratchy, but they are also cheaper.  This isn't an issue for me, but I thought I would mention it.I love the big size of the blankets, and I would have given them 4 stars if I could have seen the sheep pattern like the product image depicted.	
1. 	This is an absolutely amazing product and a must have for infants.  i say may be toddler too escpially the ones like my son who move a lot during sleep.	
1. 	After trying many other brands and styles of bottles, my wife and I agree that the Playtex Ventaire are the best.Less pieces than Doc Brown, excellent venting system, inexpensive nipples to replace as your baby grows and you need higher flow.	
1. 	After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here's my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you're looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanismKidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5 Tall  / fits 29.25 to 37.5 doorway width  / 1 bar to step over / gate opening 22-  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22.  (This certainly won points from my 6'2 husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn't more mention of this feature.-  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75 pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75 spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become weaker if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37 and your door opening is 36.5, it won't seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34).-  It doesn't have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it's totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1 high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It's the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it's definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36 Tall / fits 28-48 doorway width / 2 bar to step over / gate opening 19-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19 - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5 and 10 so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33 and this gate didn't end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn't seem stable.  And the 5 extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate's extensions add 2.75 as needed).-  It's by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks.-  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2.-  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.First Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32 Tall  / fits 29-34 doorway width / 1.5 bar to step over / gate opening 17- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17 wide! I'm 5'8 and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn't end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn't worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn't cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34 doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn't bug you, try this one.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn't look cheaper to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don't use any of these for that.  Think about how you will use these gates in your house and what features you will value. Good luck with your own purchase!	
- 1	This is the worst stroller ever.  I watched the youtube videos, looked at the reviews (not many) and decided that it should work fine.  Well it doesn't.It is difficult to get in and out of the back of my car as it is somewhat heavy and definitely cumbersome.  In order to not look like a struggling fool I have to put it in handlebar first and roll it up into the back while getting dirty from the tires.  This is the least of my problems.  Trying to get this thing to close is crazy.  I even practiced as many suggested.  I really don't think, unless you've closed this thing 100 times it will not get easier.  Opening it is not as difficult and I have that procedure down.Then I have to deal with getting the car seat into the stroller.  As this is a removable parts type of stroller (you can switch out the car seat and put the bigger seat on) you have to make sure each side of the car seat is fitting just so into the spaces on each side of the stroller.  So imagine hunkering over a stroller holding a not so heavy baby in a HEAVY car seat trying to make sure each side is in correctly which you can't even see both sides at one time!!  And if you don't have the seat in correctly it will go forward as you are trying to lock it in.  DANGEROUS!  Thankfully my husband was helping me the first time we attempted this and we both caught the car seat (with our infant inside) before it flew forward!!!!  So now it's usually my husband and I, one on each side of the stroller, guiding the car seat into the locks, then we both press one lever on each side of the seat to lower the handle back to lock it in place.  A pain in the rear.  By myself it is horrible.  I usually have a back ache the rest of the evening from trying to hold the car seat just so, so I can guide it in correctly.  And now we've discovered the car seat only faces us as we are pushing it.  For some reason I thought since the large seat goes both ways that the car seat would too???  Maybe we should try again, maybe it can...we did try for a few minutes and it didn't seem to fit that way.  I guess for most infants this doesn't matter as they want to see mommy or daddy but my little one at 3.5 months likes to look out at the world.  Also notice in order to lock the car seat in place in the stroller by lowering the handle behind the infants head your infant will not see all those cute toys you have hanging across the car seat handle...so no entertainment for them while in the stroller!!My next complaint is there is no tray for mommy or daddy's things.  We bought a bag type deal that straps onto the handle that can accommodate 2 water bottles and my phone and a few other things if needed.  This stroller comes with one cup holder and after our first experience in putting a Styrofoam cup in it I can tell you now you need to take the circular top off of it or it WILL puncture your cup.  Forget putting a cup of coffee in it unless you take that ring off.  That is a simple fix so I can still put my coffee in there, but again there is only one cup holder that will work to do that so my husband has to hold his coffee :-)There is ample room, in my opinion, on the bottom for my diaper bag and a few other things if needed.The bassinet feature is nice, but really I've only used it once so far and don't anticipate using it that much, as like I said, I have a baby who wants to see the world!The main reason I bought this is for the toddler seat facing me because my first child would freak out sometimes if she couldn't see me and I hated that.  You can find this feature in other less expensive strollers like the graco flip.  And actually at this time there are probably even more available.  Graco does have a stroller (signature series I think it's called)that you can switch out the parts like this one.  I almost got that one, but because Amazon did not offer the car seat I wanted that would match with the black stroller I decided to buy this one because with Amazon Mom's Prime I really liked getting these things shipped to my house for free.I would definitely NOT recommend this stroller.  It is too heavy, too cumbersome, too dangerous.  If you can afford the more expensive ones (which I cannot) go for it.  Or go with a graco or chicco!********Update:  Now the rubber gripper on the bottom of the car seat is coming apart.  Of course this is a different product than the one listed here, but I assume most people are going to buy the separate car seat for this stroller.  The car seat has not clicked in all the way despite me making sure I pushed it in.  I go to get the baby and car seat out of the car and it won't budge...until I push down again and it engages.  We don't even use this thing more than a few times a week...I can't imagine someone who has to use this everyday at least a couple of times.  It would be in pieces by now. Someone send me $200 so I can throw this thing out!!!	
- 1	I bought this tooth brush kit and really don't use it. The toothbrush bristles are too hard. The finger brush is ok. My son did enjoy chewing on the other two items when he was teething. I still use the toothbrush stand even now that I bought a new better toothbrush, but everything else hit the trash.	
- 1	Just disregard the product photo, because the actual product looks nothing like it. The product photo shows a thick material that looks sturdy and has a sheen to it; I envisioned it would be made of a pool float type material. In reality, it is very thin, and appears to be made out of packing peanuts. It does not grip my faucet, and any slight contact with it spins it around and causes it to come off. If you have a diverter on your spout, that might help keep it from coming off, but it still looks like it will tear easily. Serious disappointment. This thing might be worth 50 cents, and even then, it's not at all functional, just cute to look at.	
- 1	I bought totally 4 lunch bags (2 owls 1 monkey and 1 ladybug) for my friends' kids as gifts. The 3 of them look great except the ladybug. First, it has a different wrapping. Second the material of the bag is different. At first I thought maybe it's an older version until I found the Last reason which is the worst is that it has a bad odor. Which the other 3 don't have. I would like to know if any other buyers have the same experience. And I hope the seller could contact me to explain what is happening. I'm now worried about all the dishes, bowls and spoons I bought and if they are fake they could be dangerous to the kids.	
1. 	the bath pad is fine - seems comfy for my little guy and keeps him elevated.  but beware - do not hang it to dry until you squeeze out some of the water.  i did not do this and the cloth that wraps around the hook ripped a bit.  but it is fine to hang once some of the water is squeezed out.	
1. 	I love this idea and  so does my son. He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. He gnawed that thing to death. We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.	
- 1	After you wind this up, it plays for less than two minutes before you have to wind it up again.  It is now on my son's crib as viewing pleasure rather than a soothing device.	
1. 	We received this as a gift at my baby shower and I was eager to use them. We first brought them out when my daughter was about 5 months old and she loves them! We still use them during bathtime (she is almost 11 months) and also have a few out on her play area since she likes chewing on them. She giggles when I squirt her with them and likes the bright colors. Good product for a reasonable price - highly recommended.	
1. 	My little one loves to brush her teeth with the Baby Buddy.  All the other reviewers that gave good feedback were right.  because of the handle design she grips the brush like the baby on the package, and chews and brushes happily for 10 minutes, massaging gums and her tooth (well now two teeth).  It makes a nice second brush that I can hand her mid day after nursing or a snack.	
- 1	We encountered midew problems only while using this pail liner, it leaks, and is also the smell does not come out of the material.We got one a few years ago and some one gave us another one (both brand new) last year from our new baby, both times we have had the same issues.Planet Wise is way better.	
1. 	There are a lot of choices for toy hammocks that we saw.  We went with Prince Lionheart becuase we have other products of theirs.  Quality products.  This net holds a ton of teddy bears!  The only draw back as you will probably see other's write about as well is the drop. It is a big hammock so expect it to hang low.  Overall good quality and works well.	
- 1	I am disappointed. The blk/wht print on the fab looks so cheap and I am afraid the color will come off. The fabric itself is not safe for babies there are fibers standing up and babies could bite them. Picture looks much nicer than the merchandise itself. They have a good photographer!	
- 1	The pros: easy to transport, decent size (holds 2-3 days of diapers), nice print that hasn't fadedBUT...there has got to be something better out there for cloth diapers!Please go and look at the washing instructions on their website:[...]Please note that you are not supposed to wash this wet bag with your diapers (unless of course you wash your diapers on warm/cold setting which would be unsanitary.)You should not use a high speed washer on a vigorous spin cycle.Also, water pools in the bag and has to drip out. As their site states, You can squeeze the water out. You may want to wash the bag again, as dirty water could have been trapped inside and may cause odors, as well.The website says that it can tumble dry on low heat. During the first couple of months I line-dried the wet bag. I tried to dry this in the drier, on low, once. It became misshapen and has never been the same since.Lastly, the attitude on their washing instructions page is very 'self-centered', reminding the reader at least seven times of the situations when warranty does not cover and when they are not responsible. Although they must view this as necessary, this makes me uncomfortable to buy their products again.It is probable that since I do cloth diapering I would like to conserve as much energy as possible. Washing a wet bag, twice, in a load by itself in lukewarm water is not what I think of as ideal when I am already doing many loads of diapers	
- 1	I was excited to get this item, but it broke  during the first use and the amount of weight was not the issue. It was a bummer.	
- 1	To get to the letters after you place them in the barn you must remove all the animals to open the barn door. My son gets frustrated with having to remove them. The letters seam really cheap on the toy. They are super light weight but also had bits of plastic sticking up. The toy just doesn't hold his interest. He has several other shape sorters that he loves. This one just isn't a hit. He likes animals and barns but this toy just doesn't hold the 'it' factor for him.	
1. 	I am not a carrier Mommy but when I travel this carrier has saved us. I used it for my 19 month old until just recently! I love that the baby can face both ways and that the head rest goes up and down This carrier is hands down my favorite and the only one I will recommend.I love how the top snaps together and how many adjustable parts there are. Before my baby was walking this was my go-to carrier.I highly recommend - it is convenient to use. Simple to understand, secure and there is no way you can snap baby's delicate skin. The back has an 'x' configuration that takes pressure off of any one specific area. It kept my back from hurting while running through airports. And baby and I got to bond during the experience. I always knew where she was. Even my husband has worn this - very easy to adjust back and forth.If you are looking for a baby carrier, regardless of baby's age I recommend this one. It cradles small babies and lightens the load of larger ones.	
1. 	As a first time parent, I was constantly reading reviews of baby items before I made purchases.  This tub was rated very highly and so I thought I'd give it a go.  No disappointment here--its rated highly for good reason.The tub worked beautifully for my premature baby because of the hammock that straps over the top, making it easy to give my baby a sponge bath while he was cradled in the hammock.  Now that he's bigger and doesn't need the hammock anymore, the tub is still working well for both of us.  The plug that changes color when the temperature of the water is too hot is hard to see, but it does work and its nice to have.Of all my baby item purchases, this is one of my absolute favorites.  I highly recommend this product--most especially for bathing your preemie or newborn!	
1. 	These sealing discs are great for traveling. They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price. It's great for parents who are on the go and are looking to store baby bottles more efficently.	
- 1	i dont know....somebody said smth about step-stool for 13mo. baby? you r kiddin!?!?!?! this is MADE IN CHINA and really cheap quality. Alice is 8mo. old and i just got it - she likes all of her toys (pyramids, cups, zippers, buttons, rattles, plush toys etc) but this on. does not get her attention for more then 1 minute. it seems like this toys has lots of things goin on, but not really. they dont do much. big construction but you can move anything around (up/down/sides). you just touch it, thats all. it doesnt make any noise...there are some tiny beads but again - its ok for the baby that is limited to movements and grabbing, touching...IF your BABY is over 6mo. - DO NOT GET IT!	
1. 	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.	
1. 	I loved it until it was stolen out of our pickup truck.  I guess it was popular.  It was fast and easy to use.  Great for restaurants.  Cleaner too.  I hate using high chairs.	
- 1	More my fault than anything, but the molding on the edge of our crib didn't work with this clamp.  I had a hard time finding one that did!	
1. 	Great bib for drooling baby! My little guy soaks the bib but because of the middle part his clothes stay dry and I only need to change for another bib, not the whole outfit. I let them air dry instead of in the dryer since a friend said hers got ruined after drying in the dryer.	
1. 	Could it get any better?  I don't think so.  This is the best $10 I've spent so far.  We take this mobile everywhere!  It works in the car, either on the window or on the infant seat handle.  Also, I hang it in my pack-n-play since the mobile that came with it is so boring.  I have also used it on the window above the rocking chair for our son to look at during feedings!  I love this product & so does our son; he never seems to tire of staring at it and as he gets older different parts interest him.	
- 1	I just received this in the mail along with the lower car car seat adaptor bar and I've been searching online for some advice on how to put it together. I'm also looking for videos online and I can't seem to find any.. I really don't want to have to buy a Britax car seat because in my opinion, the Peg Perego is a fantastic infant car seat.. any advice?	
1. 	Catches everything! Easy to clean and to get on and off. It&#8217;s the only one we use now that my son eats solid food.	
1. 	Boppy can suck it! I love this thing! My sister is a skinny little thing and had the boppy for her son. She said she needed one or two more for it to be actually useful for breastfeeding because it was such a low profile pillow. She tried taking this one when she tried it and she's not evening bfing anymore! Works great for my little one, She enjoys it for nursing, napping on and now her sitting up endeavors! I am a VERY plus sized mom, I wear a 26 dress and this fits me just fine! That boppy never would've wrapped around me!	
1. 	This bottle warmer is easy to use and works quickly. We've been using it for a month and haven't had a single issue with it.	
1. 	My niece is married to a cop - a big burley guy who really didn't want to be seen lugging around a girlie diaper bag. I do daycare for them a few afternoons a week and dad drops off. He has no problem being seen with this diaper bag.The perks of this product other than the looks:- It's easy to operate eyes free. No need to look. The three outer pockets are distinct. You can put a nook in one, diapers in the middle, and bottle in the third. Just feel, unzip and grab.- The zippers tabs and pulls are large. Perfect again for eyes free and one-handed use. Parents are pros at both of these maneuvers.- The zippers are also coated with heavy paint. This will help avoid them becoming freezing cold or burning hot. Again - someone was thinking when designing this bag.- It stands upright on it's own nicely which aids in one handed use.The downsides are:- As others have mentioned, the size. The outer pockets could have been a little bigger and maybe the entire thing could be wider.- An inner divider would be a nice touch- Also an insulated pocket to hold a chilled bottle would make this product perfect.I still give it five stars. It's meant to be a cool enough bag for dads and if my police officer nephew will tote it around, it has accomplished its mission.	
1. 	Great Sunshade for my jogging stroller.  I love the top flap because I can put it over the front shade and make it VERY dark for my son and he can go right to sleep!	
1. 	I purchased these bags twice intead of some type of expensive diaper genie.  Super stinky diapers still need to be double bagged (like after baby starts to eat food), but overall I am happy with these.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews about this thing and took to heart the complaints of mildew, etc. Considering I live in the south, I was very hesitant to get this item. But decided I'd try it anyway. I'm very glad I did.Let it be known I use this mostly in the stuffiest bathroom in the house (its easier to warm for bathing an infant) and I have a BAD tendency to get distracted after the bath and come back hours later with a still soaked bather to pull out of the tub and hang somewhere to air dry. I have had this thing months now. I've never had to toss it in the wash, it still smells like new. I wash my baby every other day. I'm lazy and hang the thing in the shower itself to dry. I have had not one problem with it and I love it!	
- 1	The glass bottles are nice but the whole bottle is useless all thanks to the new nipples. Our baby had a very tough time maintaining a good seal around the nipple and as a result milk would spill all around his neck. We initially thought it was the flow rate on the nipple but after trying different Avent nipples (that have slower flow rates) and getting the same messy results we decided to return the entire bottle set and get the Dr. Brown's glass bottle set instead.	
1. 	I just like the product because it takes a while to pump to get a lot of breast milk.  You need patience in using this product. It is better to use an electric breast pump.	
1. 	I started using this about a week ago with my 5 1/2 month old son. He has 3 teeth and is working on the 4th! I was worried about using the brush with his gums being so sensitive with the new tooth breaking through but he LOVES it! The bristles are much softer than they appear in the picture. I use just a tiny bit of the paste and start massaging his teeth and gums. He likes to hold my finger and do it himself too. Now when he sees me get out the finger brush he gets excited! Hopefully we are setting good hygeine habits for the future!The only downside I have is that the finger brush is a little big for me which is weird because I have rather large fingers for a female. I just make sure to hold onto it with my thumb so it doesn't come off in baby's mouth. It's not enough of a problem for me to reduce my rating though.Happy brushing!	
- 1	Not all that soft, horrible for swaddling. My baby breaks out of it within 5 min. Cloud b's blanket or miracle blanket ( for hot summers) works much better for swaddling.They r pretty designs tho....I use them more blankets now. It's not SPF, so I'm not using them for that, as I see a lot of hoity toity mothers do, showing off their $45 sunshades by having the blanket over the stroller. please.	
1. 	This is a great bibs for beginning eaters. I like how they are machine washable. Cute designs. Neck size works as well.	
- 1	I am a mother with 3 young children and I wanted to know which bibs worked the best. I have compared the Bumkins Superbib, the Babybjorn bib,  the Bibbity bib, and the Bumkins sleeved bib.With my first child, I quickly realized that using cloth bibs and putting them in the laundry after each meal was a terrible idea. They would get moldy and I had to own a dozen bibs.  Then I switched to Bumkins Superbibs. They are very easy to use. I just wash them in the sink after meals and hang them on my bib drying rack. The bibs are dry and ready to use again by the next meal.  Bumkins Superbibs are lightweight and my babies never mind wearing them.  Since the pockets are soft, they don't work well if the bib has been kept flat in a drawer. I always kept my Superbibs hanging upside down by the pocket on the bib drying rack. So, the pocket dried in the open position and worked better. Now my third child is 8 months old and is eating mushy baby food. Even with the Bumkins Superbibs, there are still always some oatmeal spills on his clothes. I rarely have to change his entire outfit after a meal, but I wondered if there was a better bib available. So, I bought a BabyBjorn bib and a Bibbity bib.  Here are my results.Both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bibs are SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs. The Babybjorn bib is made of hard plastic (like a cup). It says soft in the description but that is just nonsense.  The Bibbity bib is softer, like rubber.The Babybjorn bib is difficult to put on the baby because it is so hard. Even the neck strap is made of stiff plastic. I had great difficulty adjusting the neck hole because it kept hurting my son's neck. I never could get the hole small enough to keep food from escaping onto the clothes below his chin.  Plan on baby crying the entire time you are fiddling with his bib. The pocket of the bjorn bib is great and always stays open. However, because the pocket is so rigid, it clashes with the tray. My son sits on a chair that clips onto the countertop. The bjorn bib pocket kept getting caught under the countertop and then it would yank my son's neck. He really hated wearing this bib.  The BabyBjorn bib is super easy to wash in the sink. It is easy to dry with a towel so you don't need a bib drying rack with this bib.The Bibbity bib is much better than the BabyBjorn bib. It is softer and feels like rubber. It was awkward to put on at first and my son was mad. However, he got used to it. I was able to get the neck hole small enough to keep most of the oatmeal out without hurting my son's neck.  The pocket stays open pretty well. However, since it is soft, the pocket would close up when my son leaned forward and the pocket hit the edge of the countertop/tray.  So, food did slide past the closed pocket and land on my son's lap. The Bibbity bib is about 1 inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and is 2.5 inches shorter than the Bumkins Superbib.  It is very easy to wash in the sink and dry with a towel. I think the Bibbity bib works a little better than the Bumkins Superbib because the pocket catches more. However, my 3 year old daughter refused to wear the Bibbity bib,  and said it hurt her neck. She loves to wear her Bumkins Superbibs. UPDATE: My son is now 13 months old and refuses to wear the Bibbity bib. It is just too heavy and uncomfortable.Unfortunately, all 3 of these bibs left way too much food spilled on my 8 month old's clothes. If you have a baby who eats mushy baby food and grabs the spoon, a regular bib just doesn't give adequate protection. So, I bought 1 MORE bib. I bought the Bumkins sleeved bib. It was GREAT! It covered everything, even his lap! He could feed himself oatmeal, make a huge mess, and his clothes were clean afterward! The sleeved bib is very easy to clean too. I just wash it off in the kitchen sink and hang it on my bib drying rack (which sits right next to the sink). It went from dripping wet to completely dry in 2 hours. Since, the sleeved bib dries fast on the rack, I use the same bib at each meal and only needed to buy one sleeved bib. I put it in the laundry every few days.UPDATE: My son is now 13 months old. He refuses to wear the Bibbity bib at all. It is too heavy and uncomfortable. He also pulls off his Bumkins Superbibs, throws them on the floor, and laughs. So, I put the Bumkins Sleeved bib on him for every meal. He feeds himself spaghetti and makes the biggest mess you've ever seen. He doesn't mind wearing the sleeved bib and can't get it off. It also does the best job protecting his clothes. I wash it in the kitchen sink after meals and hang it on the bib drying rack. It is dry in about 2 hours. I put it in the laundry every few days. If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably buy 2 Bumkins Sleeved bibs and a drying rack and that's it. Here is a link to the drying rack I am talking about.Mommy Genius Drying Rack--Dry or Display Just About Anything (Baby Bibs, Plastic or Reusable Food Storage Bags, Kitchen Dish Towels, Bathroom Hand Towels, Washcloths, Mugs, Sports Water Bottles, Herbs, Mittens, Children's Boots, Lingerie, Holiday Orname...	
1. 	Added a lot more room for my son's playzone.  Since the original is smaller, I wanted to make it a wide enough spaces for him to move around.	
- 1	I had bought previous ones that had 4 tabs. Now it seems they changed their design to 5 tabs, so it's not compatible with the previous ones. No indication on the packaging. Boo.Pros:+ Durable foam surface, doesn't scratch floorCons:- I don't like the removable shapes because it's just more cracks for liquids (like saliva) to leak through.- Also, when the baby removes the shapes, then it's hard floor below.- I also don't like the multi-colored tiles because I can't see colorful toys on them and have stepped on them. Next time I'm going to get a plain neutral mat.	
1. 	I think I like this better than my baby does! Its cute and small and has a cool texture but she's just not that into it. The little rattle on it has these tiny little quiet beads. Just enough to make a small sound but not enough to annoy. She is only 4.5 mos so she might take to it later on.	
- 1	We have had two of these now and while it does cushion the tub, the Elmos, fish, and shells come off after a few months and the mat looks very dingy.  Other than that, it's ok.  Our second mat (which we just got earlier this year) only has 2 shells left on it.  Disappointing.	
1. 	I have a graco pack and play and my son didn't use to fall asleep on the bassinet surface neither when used by itself or with a thin sheet. The Eddie Bauer sheet is like terry but soft and, it would seem, comfortable enough that my son actually stays asleep in the playard now for hours. It's also protective that even if his diaper leaks the pack and play doesn't get soiled. The only gripe I have is that it's not exactly form fitting and looks just a tiny bit loose but it doesn't move over the bassinet surface enough to be a hazard.	
1. 	These are the best bibs for the little tyke learn how to feed themselves. The food naturally doesn't always make it to their mouth and rather than hit the floor or furniture, it lands in the bib, easy reach for the tyke to try again!  These are great, easy to wash or stick in the dishwasher.	
- 1	We really need a footed sleep sack for our baby now that the temps are getting colder but I have no options because this comes in only size L or XL, the large saying 12-18 months which should fit my son but it is the hugest thing. It literally could fit a 2 year old toddler. My husband said he knew a very short adult woman in college who could easily wear it, it's that big. And my son is really long. He's 99th percentile in length. He is wearing 12-18 month clothes at 8 months old. He is in the range for length that's noted for this sleep sack. Halo needs to get their sizing in line with standard clothing sizing for babies and they need to offer a smaller size in this item. I'm not putting him in a sleep sack without feet because he flips over a lot sleeping and loves to move his legs where he wants them, up on the bars of the crib, etc, and I know a closed sack would bother him and keep him awake. I went ahead and kept this but we'll be using it a year from now when he's 2! Seriously.	
- 1	The flow of these nipples is way too fast. It says it's for a 6 mos baby, but I got them when my baby was 9 mos and she still had trouble drinking with them. The flow is so fast on these that if you hold the bottle upside down, the liquid inside will shoot out in a steady stream. I was breastfeeding my baby when I first tried to switch to this nipple from the 3 mos stage nipple, so I thought that might be the reason she was having trouble adjusting to such a fast flow. However, even after being weaned for 2 mos, she still refuses to use this nipple and prefers the 3 mos stage nipple. So, I would not recommend these to anyone who's been breastfeeding their child. I don't know if a completely bottle fed child would react the same way. Also I think I might be able to use these once she gets a little bit older (she's 12 mos now)so I gave it a 2 star rating.	
- 1	If they do, buy more. But if they don't, you'll feel silly with 16 doorknob covers lying around.These barely work on our doorknobs, but our doorknobs are slightly oddly shaped. I find the tabs on the sides frustrating to use, but that may be due to the odd doorknob shape as well.The one thing i really don't like about these is that the little tab to cover any locking mechanism has become my toddler's new favorite toy. He'll stand there and play with it for ages. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the point.	
1. 	I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs. Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time. We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it. She doesn't use it every time, but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros:Comfortable for the little one (she is about 20lbs)The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons:Won't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth, slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip: If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh, be aware she may try it on herself at some point. D'oh.	
1. 	It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched.	
1. 	I bought this swing used and it has done the job so far. It was the most quiet and space saving. My only complaint is getting my daughter in and out of it. The bar above can get in the way and you have to put the baby in a specific way to keep the head form bumping into it. The lights are also a bit annoying b/c they will only continue to play if the baby grabs the fishes hanging. If your child isn't grabbing, or even if they are but not at the fish, you have to do it for them if you want the lights. I do it, b/c my daughter loves the lights! I guess you can't have it all!	
1. 	Nothing quite gets my goat more than waking up in the middle of the night covered in milk because of a leaky bottle. Temper, angry words, hurt feelings, the inevitable rest of the night sleeping on the lumpy couch because you blamed your wife for leaving the bottle on the bed after putting the newborn back in the crib. These were the events that followed due to the dysfunction of every set of bottles I have ever owned before receiving the Playtex VentAire bottle set.These bottles do not leak as long as you screw the lid on tightly. I am really glad that these bottles do not contain BPA and relieved that they are supposedly easy to clean but what makes me really pleased is that if the bottle makes it through a night on the bed I do not wake up doused in milk.For the good of your relationship with your SO, for the sake of your back, for the sake of the environment because of all of the laundry required due to a leaky bottle just go ahead and add this item to your shopping cart.	
1. 	My baby had a lot problems with the flow of milk which caused a lot of colic and sleepless nights.  I decided to try playtex drop in and all my problems seized.	
1. 	These bottles are easy to use and don't leak!  They are great for breastfed babies as they do not flow super fast and are wider nipples.  They are relatively inexpensive compared to many other bottles.  One of my favorite things about this bottle is that you can take it apart.  Yes, it's more parts to wash but you know the bottom & inside of the bottles are actually clean.  I often wonder if other bottles actually really get cleaned well (especially in the dishwasher).	
1. 	I love this jumper! Both of my kids got a lot of use out of it, enjoyed it immensely, but also got there fingers slammed on more than one occassion between the large, hard tray and the door jam.	
1. 	Simple, basic, functional.  As indicated, the pad comes with strap that can be screwed onto your changing table, but once our twins got too wriggly for the pad on the table, we moved it to the floor.  It has a low enough profile that it can just slip under a bed, or a sofa, and be stored wherever you find you change your baby the most!	
- 1	When I place the baby in the car seat the straps get pulled off the magnets and stuck under him anyway. A hook or clip design might work better	
- 1	Even though it almost fits my GRACO chair this is Padded as its looks in the picture, this cover has no padding at all, its plain fabric. I needed to change my son's high chair cover badly so I had do it. But look for better options.	
1. 	When I first starting breastfeeding, my daughter couldn't latch onto me.  I still wanted her to get my milk, so I opened the playtex pump that I had put on my registry.  It was WONDERFUL!  My nipples were bleeding and bruised because of trying to nurse, and I was scared to death that the pump would make it worse.  But, it didn't hurt like I thought it would.  It was uncomfortable at first, but breastfeeding is uncomfortable at first too.  Once I got used to the feeling, I didn't even feel it pumping.  I chose this pump over the medela because it worked with the Playtex Nurser System - which were the bottles I had decided to use.ADVANTAGES: 1 - It has a nice carrying case that's fashionable.  It holds everything you need to pump.  The pump itself just unzips out of the bag, so you don't even need to take it out.  There are some extra parts in the bag and it also includes a freezer pack for storing expressed milk.  2 - It has a car adapter, so you can literally take it with you anywhere.  3 - It's comfortable.  4 - The Playtex bottles just screw onto the suction pieces so you don't have to worry about transferring milk.DISADVANTAGES: 1 - After 6 wks of just pumping (I was never able to nurse my daughter), the pump motor starting acting funny.  I was pumping about 6 times a day for a half hour at a time, but the pump is supposed to be capable of everyday use.  It never stopped working, but I was afraid to see what would happen because it was the only way I could express milk.  So, I called Babies R Us even though everything says you can't return personal care items.  They were great.  They switched out just the pump mechanism with a new one, and the second worked well.  I slowed down on my pumping though, so I wasn't using it as much as before.  And I stopped pumping at 12 weeks.  So, the 2nd pump didn't get as much use, but I never had any problems with it.  I would assume that Playtex would do the same as Babies R Us did for me.Overall - an EXCELLENT pump.  I don't have anything to compare it to.  But, it's worth spending the money if you are going to be pumping on an everyday-basis.	
- 1	I never thought about how I was going to clean this when I made the late night purchase.  At the time, I just wanted a pacifier to stay put so I didn't have to hold it in place all night.  It's very cute, and the stuffed animal was easy for us to hold to guide it into their mouths.  It also made it easy to hold in place, instead of sticking my finger in the hole of the soothie or holding onto the little tab to keep it in place, I could hold the dinosaur.  But then my twins both got a case of Thrush and everything had to be sanitized constantly.  And since the pacifier is attached to the stuffed animal, it's not practical to clean.  Keeping up with laundry is hard enough, but to have to arrange a special load of clothes that can be washed in &#34;hot&#34; in order to sanitize this wasn't practical.  Nor was holding it over a pot of boiling water.  I think if I didn't care so much about keeping things clean (or HAD to keep them sanitized bc of something like Thrush) this could be worth the $15 or at least half that.  As for us, having Thrush for three weeks really turned the kids off of pacifiers in general (because it was a bit too painful to suck) and we haven't reintroduced the wubbanub since.	
1. 	I enjoy these bibs that are waterproof. The are so practical and wash up so easily. Cover baby well too.	
- 1	I purchased this mattress because i wanted to avoid nasty flame retardants and the price, even though quite high, was still lower than most other organic crib mattresses. However, after 1 month of use we decided to return this product and amazon was great in refunding the full amount.Pros: fits well in the criborganic without natural flame retardant barrierCons: extremely heavy - my husband even had trouble changing the sheets since I couldn't do it at allvery soft - even though it says it is a firm mattress, it was giving in quite easily and. my 10lb baby made a dent in the middle  that wouldn't go away. After just one month!cover deformed - the waterproof cover seemed well made at first but after just one month use and the formation of the dent in the center the cover started to have folds(for lack of a better word)overall, I was very disappointed in this product. I am still looking for a reasonably priced mattress without FRs that will last. This is not it.	
1. 	We purchased this cot for a two-year-old who visits over the weekends. He immediately took possession of his bed and slept soundly. We didn't worry about his falling off at all. The cot is perfect for small kids. We throw on a comforter for a bit of cushioning (which is the only thing the cot lacks.) For the price, this cot is a great investment.	
1. 	I use this to store 3 Dr Brown's narrow neck bottles to and from daycare. Sturdy and fits them well.	
1. 	Received two gingham sheets.  Nice understated pattern.  I'm happy with the quality.  They keep baby cool during the horribly long AZ summers.	
1. 	Highly recommend use with mattress.  Bed still remains firm but makes the bed so much more cozy and I wouldn't have a baby mattress without the waterproof cover.	
1. 	My son loves this swing now at 7 weeks old. He actually took his first two naps in it yesterday. I normally hold him almost all the time, but yesterday was in the upper 90s and I just needed to set him down for a while to cool off. He fell asleep.He loves how the swing goes from side to side, and about 2 weeks ago, he started noticing the mirror and mobile up above.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the swing is just a little too fast. We still have it on the lowest setting at 7 weeks old. He hated it at first, and I didn't like him being in it anyway since it was so fast.It's perfect now.	
1. 	My LO is a major drooler, so we and the nanny have taken to putting bibs on her all the time. These are our favorite so far. They are large enough to catch the drool. They are very absorbent - other bibs I have tried seem to repel the spit, which isn't helpful. Or they soak through easily, which means having to change LO's clothes. Two or three of these bibs can see my LO through the day, whereas other bibs have to be changed more frequently.My only gripe is that we have a problem with these weird dark greenish stains that develop and get worse with subsequent use and washing - I'm afraid it could be mold of some sort. I searched the other reviews and looks like only two other reviewers mention a similar issue. Not sure what is going on. We do laundry every other day and have not seen these dark stains on any other baby items. We had actually borrowed a set of these bibs from a friend and managed to ruin nearly all of the bibs before returning them to her. (I bought her an Amazon gift card to replace the value!) Since we needed more bibs, I bought a brand new set and paid close attention to the issue. So far, I've seen the stains develop on one of the bibs after a few weeks of use. I had initially thought they were food stains, but these are dark, spotty discolorations, and not really consistent with food. (I have not used the new set of bibs with food.) So the mystery continues...	
- 1	I originally liked the design of this snack cup because it's easy to hold, has a nice no slip grip, the opening is a good size for my daughter's tiny hands, is easy to open and fits perfectly into the cup holder on a stroller or high chair, however, after using it for a week, the latch lost it's grip and won't stay shut anymore. I can't even keep it in the diaper bag without it popping open and making a mess. She also dropped it once in the store and her snack went everywhere.I much prefer theOXO Tot Snack Disk, Aquanow. It's super easy to clean but hate that it doesn't fit in the cup holder like this one does. Find a way to combine these two and I'm sold!	
1. 	My son loved it right away. He felt like a boy sitting in. The tray was great while he was younger but we don't use it any more since he sits at the table. The height adjustments are great for growing toddlers. Very easy to clean and store. I am very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I like the things this gym has to offer but my baby hasn't gotten into it yet.  The music can be a little too loud even with the volume control (2-settings).  I love the rain forest sounds, which is very soothing.	
- 1	This would have barely covered my lap. How I use these now is just for under my baby's butt whenever she gets changed on her changing pad in case of accident. It helps delay us from having to wash the Kushies waterproof pad that we have over our changing pad cover, which are much better for the job. Our baby tends to have lots of accidents so it worked out I guess but I would have never bought these if I had realized how small they were.	
- 1	The lid doesn't close properly. The spring works only some of the time because it gets stuck. I would have done better with a tupperware container.	
- 1	I bought this along with a cute velvety cover for my son. I found out instantly that leaky boys=the cover needs washed often. This pad itself is made of waterproof fabric so I just started using this without the cover. After about a week, the pad was stained and gross. Not even bleach could remove the discolored areas.  The fabric is very porous.  Also, the vinyl ripped on us! I ordered the LA Baby changing pad next and it works great without the cover. 2 months and it looks brand new still.	
- 1	My toddler is really loves to pull plugs out of the wall and put them back into the outlets.  This seemed like the perfect fix.  Not exactly.It's flimsy.  The backplate and the door come apart easily.  My toddler just has to shake the door hard and it comes off.  One day, he somehow turned the entire unit upside down (it was empty)!  Plus, only thinner plugs will fit into the case, not one with a stiffer cord like my vacuum cleaner or a computer cord.	
- 1	So.....why is this flawed, non-working product still on the market? Munchkin has some really good items, and some crap....this...falling into the latter category.  Strange that  they haven't done a complete redesign with all of the product returns. Mine is definitely going back. I don't give my son disappointing, crappy, non-working toys.It's a bubble blower. I doesn't blow bubbles, I don't even care what the reason is....fact is it doesn't do the one thing it is marketed for....or anything else, for that matter.	
- 1	This may be top 5 most worthless baby products I now own.  Honest.On top of being made of the cheapest plastic available, its completely pointless!  This is they type of thing they push at first time moms who think it will somehow make their baby's life easier...WRONG!My daughter is 8 weeks old (b. Aug 3, 2011), and according to her doctor VERY advanced with her coordination and head control etc.  Her head is also perfect.  She first rolled over at 6 weeks.  My husband and I have made her do tummy time since she was 3 days old, at first she HATED it with a passion but now she almost has fun with it - straightening out her legs and lifting her chest off the ground (like a superman workout pose) while cooing and smiling.Instead of using a flimsy expensive little tummy triangle get a soft blanket fold it and put it on the floor. Voila.  Baby will probably hate tummy time at first, but a couple minutes a few times a day adds up!  I just saved you $ and told you the secret to a perfectly round little baby head..maybe I'll write a book. :)This thing is a pain to put together, has annoying music and is ROCK solid.  I cant imagine it to be comfortable.  My daughter screamed her head off the minute she was laid on it and she isn't a crier.What a total waste of money.  Avoid, and if you really want to give $$ away you're welcome to mail it to me.	
- 1	If your toddler is anything like mine, he WILL destroy this brush within a week.  Let me start by saying my son had all of his 1st 16 teeth by the time he was 1, earlier then that actually more like 8 or 9 months.  so he loves using his teeth and he often will chew something to death.  This toothbrush doesn't make it and I found myself buying troughs of them just to use one that wasn't completely macerated.  I did end my quest, but this was the last brand I used before finding the one that worked for me.  Ironically it costs less but does withstand his biting frenzy.  regardless these brushes lasted about a week and it started becoming an irritable cost to have to keep replacing them.  If you have a perfect little toddler that keeps his mouth open and brushes like a miniature adult, by all means these will work fine. But if he or she likes chewing, which is natural for them to do, these will not last long.	
1. 	These wipes are perfect to throw into the breast pump bag and clean everything between uses.  Small packaging allows you to take only what you need.	
- 1	I have 2 sets of twins. With the first set we just bathed them in the tub (kinda a nightmare) So with the second set my husband brought home Euro Baths (WAY TO BIG AND EXPENSIVE!) So we thought that a tub sid seat would be good. We it works, I can bathe them at the same time, BUT...I have to fill up the ENTIRE tub, for two 8 month olds! I can not clean their bottoms or thier backs. Their legs get scratched and so do their, privates. I get VERY nervous that the seat will fall (so I put a stool under it just incase). Its a nightmare to clean out, (SOOO many nooks and crannies, what bright light thought to do THAT?). All in all I liked the idea, but it needs ALOT of work. Now I just use two tub rings that stick to the bottom of the tub (Less water, dont worry about them falling) And now I just have to pick one up at a time to wash their bottoms (need two people, one to wash them and one to be ready to hold one when the washer has to get the second ones bottom clean). Its pretty much the same thing, but its in ONE piece NO NOOKS AND CRANNIES and my boys LOVE them. I suggest this for all parents of multiples who bathe at the same time! If your a parent of one child I recomend one of those big tubs. SKIP THE TUP SIDE THING AND USE THE REGULAR RING! (to keep my back in check I use a step stool to sit on, or I bathe/shower with them!	
- 1	It just has a bad feel to it.  I know it's priced low and I probably should've expected it, but I just don't like how the material is almost plastic like.  It works fine, but I prefer a more cloth like material if my baby is going to be strapped in it.	
- 1	My daughter is exclusively breastfed and never takes any bottle. This is the only bottle she will take to drink her water. That's why I have 2 of these bottles.Cons:1.the strawd broke after used for a while2.the bottom part with handle of the bottle doesn not come off and clip back on easily, maybe you are not supposed to do so, but it gets mold and I wanna to clean up the mold.3. Some mold issue happen is the lid part.	
- 1	I thought this nursery projector was the bee's knees until it randomly stopped working after 3 months.  It wasn't the sounds, but the projector.  No light at all.  At this time, my baby was an infant, and it was never dropped or damaged in any way.I emailed customer service, who gladly said they would replace the item since it was still in warranty.  I bought a second one, so that I would still have a sound machine while I was mailing this one off (I didn't know how to avoid this).  Munchkin also said that I would have to pay to ship it to them.  It cost me $10.  They send me a &#34;gift&#34; to make up for the shipping cost, which was a stroller cup holder.  Neat idea, but it doesn't fit ANY of my strollers.  It seems that they think stroller handles are very very thin.  I'm guessing they chose this gift because it is a poor seller?It took a while to get the new one, but I did receive it.  On the second one, the projector part stopped rotating after a month.  I'm not paying $10 to ship it to them again.  The other one I bought also had the projector part break very soon after.Basically, these things are a really neat concept, but obviously have very poor quality.  Too bad.  Munchkin.... why don't you just  charge us $5-$10 more and use quality parts that last???	
- 1	This things is so awkward to use, that I gave up after 2 times. My life doesn't have time for stuff that over-complicates it. My kid has been in shopping carts without a fabric barrier for a year and a half without illnesses or injuries.	
- 1	Baby choked on the milk flow. Nipple size was intimidating for our over term baby. Didn't help with nipple confusion as I had hoped-as I feel medela advertises.	
1. 	this is easy to use and maintain. Just have to make sure to keep it level on all the time...works great	
- 1	Original review:I've been cloth diapering for 17 months and have a few brands in my stash.  I recently purchased a couple Charlie Bananas on sale at Target and I wish I bought more! At first I was hesitant to buy these because I thought (maybe read a review) that these were similar to fuzzibuns.  I have 1 fb which I hate- hard to stuff and the elastic adjustment is annoying.  For so long I had mad love my bg 4.0s, which I still like and actually  prefer the CB pockets for a few reasons: The adjustable leg elastic is super easy, super soft- much fluffier than my bg's, the liner is narrower, and the back elastic is wider and never leaves a mark on my babies skin which all other diapers seem to do (especially grovia).All in all, I prefer them over my BG's, grovias, fb, heros, and some generic china made ones I bought on craigslist.***Updated review***I have been using these cd's for 7 months.  I have followed manufacturer washing/care directions with CD friendly soap.  ALL of the elastic has stretched to the point where a couple have broken.  The metal adjuster has corroded which I suspect has caused the already weak elastic to snag and rip.  I'll try to post pictures.  I've contacted CB so we'll see what they say but the warranty for elastic is only 180 days and I didn't save the receipt (doh!).  It's a bummer because I really like these diapers per my original review but cloth diapers should last through toilet training if not a couple kiddos.  Hasn't even lasted a year :( I do live in humid climate but these get sun dried per directions so the corrosion should not have happened, right? I dunno, maybe it's a fluke and I got the bunk ones. Disappointed and surprised, they haven't even outlived my generic ones.FWIW/IME: Of all of my stash, BG pockets have proven to be high quality and show NO wear in 24 months of use.  I will sell everything I have (if I can) and use prefolds/woolies, BG's and the 2 Hero Pocket Coqui (They are ok, good for extra stuffing for nap, and I'm a sucker for the cow print) exclusively with next baby.***Customer service update***Emailed customer service and they will replace them with proof of purchase. Responded in a timely manner, good customer service.	
- 1	Seemed to work fine... Clip wouldn't attach to any convenient part of my baby trend jogging stroller. Clipped it to the shade to keep my 13 month old cool while I worked out outside in Texas summer... He tore two of the blades off within 30 minutes. Waste of money for me... Too bad	
1. 	I've been using these for a few months now and I think they are great.  The lid lets me stack easily in my drawer freezer.  I wash them in the dishwasher (including high heat dry and sanitize setting) and haven't had any issues with the lids fitting or warping.  In fact, I just got two more as a hand-me-down from a friend who used them for her children (several years) and they still look great, so they hold up well.	
- 1	It is near impossible to suck liquid from the straws. I could barely get anything out and my son definitely couldn't. The parts are near impossible to clean as well. The only positive thing I have to say is no they don't leak but that doesn't matter if you can't drink from it. Don't waste your time with these.	
1. 	This is the best sleepsack out there. It's reasonably priced and it works great for us. So far we own 6 Halo sleepsacks in different sizes, and if I were to buy more, they'd definitely be the same brand.	
1. 	This little guy is an adorable addition to our bathtub.  With the cup, ledge and his fingers/toes, its a wealth of storage!	
1. 	This is by far the most used single item I bought for the baby. She loves to hang out in this so she can see the world.	
- 1	I ordered the pink burp cloths for my first born because they were cute and the price was fantastic. I thought to myself, why would I want to spend more than I need to on something my child is just going to throw up on?. I ordered three sets, and after checking out realized the shipping was more than the price of all three combined! No thanks, I'll just make my own.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews about other bottle warmers.  Some claimed that water would get trapped and were hard to clean.  This one is pretty easy and straight forward.  It does an excellent job at warming our bottles.  It will simply warm up any water that's in the compartment.  With that said, if you pour too much or too little water in, that will alter the results.  The only downside for me is that it won't let you warm glass baby bottles.  I think it's a great product for the price and simplicity.	
- 1	Not worth the price. Battery does every so quickly.	
- 1	when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased. the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in, so it was a pain cause I couldn't go outside and relax, had to stay near the unit where the plug was. as I live in another country I couldn't call for the warranty. would not recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	My husband bought this swing and we love it so much.  Our newborn loves it too, she slept 5-6 hours at night and also she loves the music.  I will recommend it to all my friends... Nice Job Fisher Price!	
1. 	This is a great first toothbrush. Our son likes to chew on it, but doesn't let us help him with it. So while it does get his few teeth clean, soothe his gums, and provide general merriment for him, it isn't preparing him to use a toothbrush. Overall, a good product. I'm glad we have it.	
1. 	It was a cute turtle , and my 10 month old was amazed by the stars and the moon on his bedroom ceiling.We are sleeping training him and this is a good distractor when he is crying ...even though his crying does not last more than 10 minutes.. i can see these colorful stars and moon distract him and there is staggered crying lol ...The turtle is very cute in the day is being used as a toy to play with..I have the sheep which was very helpful when he was infant..I will watch out for other good products in this line.	
1. 	Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.	
1. 	I like this pillow because it didn't give me neck pains. I used to have two pillows (on top of each other) to elevate my head to help with the acid reflux and end up having soar neck in the morning. This pillow is great. I highly recommend it. I am 17 weeks pregnant and it works great. The construction is great. It takes about two days to find the sweet spot. It is not mushy like other brands, so, it holds up.Enjoy!	
1. 	My daughter loves her Bumbo! She is able to 'participate' in family dinner time because of it! It's a great way to practice sitting up	
- 1	For a little while, these worked great in my car to block the sun. But pretty quickly the suction cups were not sticking properly and then the shade would just hang there awkwardly and wouldn't roll up. Poor quality product. I would NOT recommend this!	
- 1	I put new batteries in both units & only 1 unit worked.  I returned the & amazon.com was quick to send the paid return UPS label.  They refunded my money as soon as they were notified I dropped the box off at UPS.  Thanks again Amazon'I bought Safety 1st Crystal Clear Audio Monitor (1 RX) & it works great.	
1. 	I love these bibs. Not only do they look cute (and not cheap like other soft bibs like this) but they work so well. The food catcher is easy to clean because it's a scoop as opposed to an enclosed pocket. The adjustable and easy snap on neck part is nice too as opposed to velcro. It's very durable and probably will last to use for my next baby. But they're not too expensive so might just buy new one anyways.	
1. 	This wipes are so convenient.  They are a requirement in my pump bag for when I am at work. I use the Madela soap at home and love it too.	
- 1	We loved this chair at first... but then after using it for a few months we have come to realize the truth. First of all, it's dangerous. When not using the tray part my daughter has gotten her arms stuck between the rails (that the tray attaches too) and the seat part itself multiple times. While it didn't require any medical attention, it caused her pain and gave her a red arm and upset her to the point of crying. The last time that her arm got stuck it was stuck so badly that we weren't sure we were even going to be able to get it out!! 2ndly, this chair is difficult to clean and to keep clean. I like the pad, but food is constantly falling between the pad and the seat and getting underneath and you may not realize there's anything under there for weeks..... yuck. One tip though, the pad says it can only be handwashed, but we have washed ours in the washing machine on cold/gentle cycle, and dried it on tumble dry low with NO issues at all. The fabric has held up very well.OH, and also, the tray is very hard to get on and off the chair.. it worked like a charm at first but after a bit of wear and tear I guess... the mechanism is getting worn out. Very regretful that we spent $65 on this chair......I see that the 2012 model no longer includes the tray arms, so at least they redesigned it... I still wouldn't buy it though, I am looking into other options.	
1. 	If there is one way to swaddle my son easily it is using this sleepsack. I highly recommend this for a newborn and to aid in getting some great sleep. So soft too!	
1. 	We wanted a play pen to serve as a bed for my one-year-old grandson when he stays overnight. I looked at a used one from a neighbor that was quite questionable. For just $15 more, I found this amazing one that is even a big longer so that it will be more comfortable. So glad we got this! It's easy to put up and take down! I like that the ends are NOT see-through because keeping light out is important for my little guy to sleep soundly. :)	
1. 	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.	
- 1	This seat is TINY! I opened up the box, put it together and thought, oh, is this one of the play doll seats? Oops, I thought it was for a baby! My daughter isnt all that big, she barely fits in it. She looks ridiculous sitting in it. It looks like a giant baby sitting in a dollhouse seat :) The backrest barely goes to the middle of her back. She is 16 months old, 30, I dont think you could fit a toddler in it. Its best for 6 months and under IF your baby is small for their size and can sit by themselves. Yes, its inexpensive, like they always say, you get what you pay for!  I will keep it to take to restaurants, and get a regular sized one for the kitchen table. Also, the toy that attaches just easily pops right off, so, it gets tossed to the floor right away! No suprise, though, there is a giant baby sitting in the seat!!!	
- 1	You already have a choking hazard regardless of what type of foods your baby or child is eating. I feel like this item is a step backward. You go from bottle, to cereals and mashed foods to this? Sucking out their food? It'd be like bottle feeding again. Do what normal people do and cut up the foods and watch your child. I feel like this is a product for the over anxious mother. Your child is going to have to learn how to eat. Somehow sucking out strawberry juice isn't it.	
1. 	Great item. Baby sleeps well on it. Not too hard, not too soft. Just right would recommend to family/friends. Love it	
- 1	I purchased this tub because of the high rating. I hate it!Here are some pros...First, the sling works really well for the new born. It's very easy to bathe the new born. The problem starts when we removed the sling. Second, the hump at the bottom works very well. It helps my 2.5 month old baby sit while bathing.Here are the cons:1. The plug. I put this tub in the adult. Since the plug is at the bottom the dirty water does not flow out once I unplug it. It's block tightly against the big bathtub. I have to lift my baby up while my husband pick up the tub to dump the water out. He is wiggling in my arm, wet while my husband fill the tub again with right temperature water. It's definitely a two men job. This doesn't happen if you bathe your baby in the kitchen sink.2. The tub is too short. My baby start to kick against the plastic wall at the end of the tub. Everytime he kick it, he lifted him self and his back ends up on the hump. Again, my baby is very wiggly.	
1. 	I have a two month old who is 12 pounds and 23.5, with long legs for her age.  This swaddle works great and allows her room to kick around while still keeping her arms snug.  It also leaves room for her to grow.	
- 1	It looks great. My daughter was happy as it is pink...she sat in it and thought it was comfortable...but when I looked for the instructions to get her into the harness there were none. When I called amazon - amazon was lovely - I was told that that was how it arrived from the manufacturer. Ok. But so manufacturer also sent it simply in a box with a plastic bag on it. Hopeful that this wasn't thrown around too much in transit. I really wanted to like this...we need a new car seat ....but I am returning this tomorrow. (Note: many of the reviews that I have read on this said that it was very important to read the manual as it is hard to install)	
- 1	I found it easy to use and it sticks to the bathtub great, BUT my two month old is constantly slipping down and I have to keep pulling him back up onto the hammock.  I would buy one that is built with a slanted back and a short basin so baby doesn't have far to slide down.  Maybe it will be more helpful as he is older and we don't need the hammock.	
- 1	We used these when my son was born, and ended up replacing them within 6 months. The fleece pilled up, and the cotton on the other side was rough. He was screaming through changes. They also fell apart rather quickly. They just didn't work for us.	
- 1	I gave these to my 2 year old for Easter, which was 2 weeks ago.  They have already broken, as the screw fell out of one side.  Plus, the &#34;Babiators&#34; logo on the sides is already coming off.  (They will send you a new pair if you registered them and then you pay for the shipping.)  I'm going to fix them myself with an eyeglass kit, as it will be cheaper than the shipping on a new pair.  I won't be buying these again, though.  Carters sells similar glasses for just $5.  My daughter got a pair of those in her Easter basket as well - and they are still in one piece.  I'm going to stick with the cheaper brand.  Bottom line:  unless the brand name means something to you, buy something cheaper versus being disappointed, like I was, that I spent $20 on something that broke in 2 weeks.	
1. 	Any baby would hate a cold wipe. When my daughter was only 1 week old, I was going crazy and went to the store and bought this. She screamed every time we took her diaper off, and it was b/c she knew that cold wipe was coming!!! After we got this, she dosent mind at all. I haven't had a problem with it at all. Once in a while, a drop or two of water will spill out when you open it (I still havent tried the pop up wipes) but, usually it is b/c I have a little too much water in the bottom. Do keep the wet 'cusion' wet though... if you forget to wet it (usually 1-2 times a week) it becomes hard, and you will have to soak it to get it back to normal. I have bought the refill pad/ cusion for it as well. They come 2 to a pack and I think it cost me about $6 - $7 by mail including shipping. However, I just put the first replacement in - I used the original for almost 6 months.	
- 1	...but then after only a couple of washes, it got thinner and ended up with an overwhelming wet dog type of odor. It made the entire nursery smell. Not great quality, and after the smell issue, I definitely won't be buying more. It's too bad that it's too late to return it.	
- 1	My newborn can't keep this in his mouth very well. It keeps falling out. He can latch onto the Nuk ones a lot better and actually keep it in his mouth. Would not recommend.	
1. 	These bibs are nice and big, stay on, clean up easily, and you can put them in the washer.  Perfect.	
1. 	We use summer infant swaddle me for our baby girl, but her twin brother wasn't so fond of them for some reason.  So we got htis miracle blanket.  He likes this one quite a lot.  When we sit him on it, he'll hold still with his little arms down by his side ready for us to tuck the little flaps in and wrap him up.  He CAN squirm an arm or even both arms up out of it, but rarely does (and maybe he likes it more because of that possibility?).  He's 12 weeks now and we've stopped swaddling, but used this wrap from 3 weeks-10 weeks old.  It washed up great and was definitely worth the buy.	
- 1	I bought this because my older daughter had one just like it about 9 years ago. This clip is being used only when we go on car rides, so baby doesn't lose her pacifier. Well after about 4 months of occasional use the clip itself won't close all the way, so it doesn't secure to anything. Pacifier constantly falls onto the floor. Very disappointed as it's a cute design and it fit in her pacifier holder. Now its only purpose is to take up space in a landfill. Junk, do not buy!	
1. 	We own more than 10 of these bibs, and we love them. As far as I am concerned, they cannot be improved upon. Buy one and see. They are totally waterproof, roll up and stuff into diaper bags easily, and they come out of the wash looking like new. Even after 2 years of heavy use. Seriously, stop researching and buy this product (or any other Bumkins bib!)	
1. 	I bought some of these and also the KidCo Universal Outlet Cover to compare them.  These worked much better for me - they fit up against the wall better, they're sturdier, and they come with the foam gasket to help make a seal against the wall.  It's easy to insert a plug, but the cover snaps closed as soon as the plug is pulled.  And, even though it has nothing to do with safety, I just liked not having the two loose buttons on the KidCo cover that would have popped out to fit a decora-style outlet.  But order these from Amazon, not Quality Deals -- the Amazon purchase came with each cover in the original packaging, and had the foam gasket.  The Quality Deals purchase was a loose cover in a plastic bag, and didn't have a gasket.	
1. 	My daughter uses the rapid flow during the day, however at almost 6 months we are still using the slow-flow at night, or before naps, when she gets sleepy and too tired to guzzle like she usually does.	
- 1	I ordere these sippy cups along with the safe sippy and the foogo stainless steel sippy in my search for the perfect leak-free sippy cup that was also stainless steel. These, of the three, were my least favorite. The avent top has holes in the spout for getting liquid out and then one single hole on the opposite end of the led for releasing pressure. Every. Single. Time. my toddler took a sip, milk 'volcanoed' out of the single hole on the back of the spout. There is a silicone flap inside the sippy that regulates how much milk comes out and whatever is left in that flap after you child is done sucking comes out of that hole. Some reviews say that it depends on how tight you twist the lid - so I tried to not tighten it as much as I normally would. This did decrease how much came out of the hole but then it leaked from the neck.Overall, the Foogo sippy cup is your best bet in terms of leakage.	
- 1	I am petite - and this is way too big and fluffy for me. My dog loves it though....I curl it up like a cinnamon bun and my cocker spaniel climbs into the middle of it and snuggles in. He seems to be in heaven. For me...not so much. It is bulky and too thick. I imagined that as my pregnancy wore on and my belly grew that it would fit better. Not even. If it doesn't work for you the first time - it won't work better later. Some folks seem to love it though - so give it a try, but if you are like me and petite you may want to find a softer alternative. I use two king size down pillows that I can squish up to where I want them.	
1. 	I think this bottle brush is much more effective at scrubbing the sides of the bottles instead of one of those normal brushes that have the bristles in a round shape, those seem to be much harder to scrub the sides. This brush holds up, does a great job of cleaning the bottles. Just remember to face the bristles down when you pull the brush out of the bottle or you'll flick water all over yourself!	
- 1	Seemed to work fine... Clip wouldn't attach to any convenient part of my baby trend jogging stroller. Clipped it to the shade to keep my 13 month old cool while I worked out outside in Texas summer... He tore two of the blades off within 30 minutes. Waste of money for me... Too bad	
- 1	I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.	
1. 	Get a nice cover for it and a diaper pad and you're ready to go	
1. 	My daughter is 18 months old and we've been using these since she was about 5 months old (prior to that we used the Halo swadlers).  She is still moving around a lot in her crib at night so a traditional blanket would just come off of her and get bunched up.  She likes to be warm when she sleeps so this is great for keeping her toasty as she does her overnight gymnastics.	
- 1	These got the job done, but as others have commented they don't fit as well as the original parts. It's probably better to just replace the whole cup, but I had an issue with throwing away otherwise fine cups so I tried these. When hey didn't work well, we moved on to the Sassy Grow up cups, and we love them.	
1. 	I had already written a review on the Isis, saying how great it was. And then I bought a Medela Harmony in an emergency the other day and was blown away by it! The main differences between the two are the ease of use and the easy clean-up (less parts to disassemble) on the part of the Medela.The handle on the Medela swivels, allowing for comfortable pumping with either hand and any position. There was no squeaking whatsoever with the Medela like there is with the Avent, and the handle doesn't fall off too easily.The Medela was a snap to clean, since you only have to wash the flange, the body and the valve, and they are smooth and easy to wipe down with a Medela cleaning cloth in a pinch. The Avent has quite a few pieces that you have to take apart to clean, which can be a pain when you're pumping in a bathroom or in the car.I pumped a record amount in very little time using the Medela Harmony, and now I plan on carrying it with me at all times in case of any future emergencies with my electric pump.***I also wanted to note that I use the Playtex One-Step collection kits for my milk, and they come with an adapter allowing me to pump directly into the Playtex Drop-Ins using a Medela Pump. I also have an adapter from Playtex that allows me to pump directly from the AVENT pump into the Drop-Ins as well, and you can receive one for FREE if you call Playtex.	
- 1	I was excited about this purchase but it's not as stable as Id like it to be. I'm still afraid that my daughter, after some continued force, will knock this over. it bows if you look at it top down. it's kinda secure, but it's really not something i would recommend due to the width. the smaller gate I have (different make) is very stable.	
1. 	These are ok and worked great for me but be advised, if you don't have inverted or flat nipples and are using them solely for cracked and bleeding nipples, the baby could suck the ends of your nipples through the holes.  It also leaves the baby choking on milk from too fast a flow.	
- 1	I already hadOXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Setfor cleaning milk sippy cups, but wanted more straw brushes for smoothie cups and straws.  These seemed like a bargain.Upon first usage cleaning baby straws, I felt the Munchkin brush dragging when pulled.  Upon closer inspection (you can also see from Amazon's zoomed picture), the tips of all of these Munchkin brushes are merely bent back, not capped with a smooth ball tip like the Oxo brush.  The bent tip's edge cuts up and flakes off anything brushed:  silicon/plastic/metal, you name it.  You'd be better off just running straws under running water than using these brushes.  Or, better yet, just order another set of the Oxo.	
- 1	these leak al the time. i've had to double stuff them to prevent the leaks. my favorites are the bumgenius freetime with velcro fasteners.	
1. 	More milk for half the time! This pump truly is wonderful...don't give up until you've taken this pump for a test ride!	
- 1	I started using thepump in January and I used it once a day at most( not even every day). After a month one pump stop working, and month later the second bump stop working. The company gives only 90 days limited warranty and since I bought it in advance, the 90 days had already passed. I bought it because it was the cheapest one, but it definitively does not worth the money.Update:I contacted the company and they shipped me a new motor and tubes and extended my warranty until the babies first birthday. So the customer service is good after all. However, would not recommend buying it if you need to pump a lot. Buy a more expensive unit that will work longer.	
1. 	This is a really nice and handy little set of bottles.  I love the size, it is perfect for a newborn to 6 month old baby, and even can be used later for juice or water.  The design of these bottles is amazing and I love that it cuts down on gas for the baby.  And of course BPA free is a must.  This would make a lovely baby shower gift as well because what new mom couldn't use extra bottles?	
- 1	This rocker is cute but does not support babys head from falling to the side. Not suitable for infant. My baby is 11lbs. When he sits in it his chin touches his chest and it looks uncomfortable. Im sure he will grow using it but not now...	
- 1	This things is so awkward to use, that I gave up after 2 times. My life doesn't have time for stuff that over-complicates it. My kid has been in shopping carts without a fabric barrier for a year and a half without illnesses or injuries.	
1. 	Exactly what I wanted: a super soft, easily washable, nice looking cover that's easy to put on the changing table pad.  Will be buying another. Best cover out there. Its nice that the cover has holes for the changing table straps too. Bought the same thing in crib mattress size too and my baby girl loves it.	
1. 	I really like this changing pad. I feel so much better changing my son on public tables when I use it. It's easy to unravel and re-fold using only one hand. It also fits perfectly in the outer pocket of my diaper bag. My only critique is that the red wipes case that it comes with has been leeching dye into his baby wipes, so I'd recommend using a different wipe container.	
- 1	Oh, I was so disappointed.  This toy looks like so much fun, but our grandson was able to grasp the objects and actually pull the toy down on top of himself, so we had to send it back.  I wish the company would tell you how high the item sits about the carrier AND what the reach-length limit is for babies.  I'm thinking this is one of those toys that will be outgrown too soon to make the cost worth it.	
1. 	these are great bottles. I got them for my great-grand son who is due in March. Mother was very pleased to receive such good bottles.	
1. 	I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it.	
- 1	My twins figured this thing out in no time flat. Just another thing to toss into the nice idea pile of products that do not work as advertised. What a waste of money.	
1. 	I bought this when my 5 month old got too big for his small baby bathtub (he was 20lbs then).  He was a really big baby and his arm and legs were starting to hang out of the other one.  The baby seat my mom got me wouldn't stick to my bathtub floor and would tip over. So I'm so happy I found this.  It worked perfect. Exactly what I needed. Super easy and my son had so much fun taking a bath since he could play with a couple toys.  My son is 15 months old now and I have started putting him in the regular bath tub now and he does fine now that he has good balance and everything.  He is 30 pounds now and for him if he leaned over the side he would start tipping the whole bath.  But I think it's pretty sturdy, maybe just that my boy is a big for age.  Lifesaver for me when he was 6-12 months though! And it still looks brand new now, so I can use it again for next baby.	
1. 	All my girls have reflux and this bib catches fountains of formula without leaking or getting on any clothing! They are awesome and saved a ton of outfits and my carpet!	
- 1	I had to return this. It's impractical to have the zipper at the top, but regardless of that feature the zipper was so hard to zip even without a baby in it! And I didn't like the fabric. Not as cute as the picture.	
- 1	I like the design and thought. But it is just not functional in the manner that I needed it to be. We used it for about 3 trips through the store before it broke. My little girl is about 18 months old and about 22 lbs. She tripped which of course put a little bit of strain on the leash and it tore. It is more a of cute fashion toy for a kid to wear vs. a workable kid leash. If you wanted it just for that purpose I'd give it another star. If you want it as a leash, consider something more durable or maybe having the stitching reinforced.	
1. 	Like L.Flack posted, my daughter too looks up at the straps but with any toy, you need to always supervise your child (not that L.Flack didn't by any means).  When my daughter does this I puller her attention to her toys and the handle bar and she gets to jumping and watching the lights flash.  When I see her putting her hands off to the side, where they could be smashed between the door and the bounce  I always tell her (though she is only 7 months and doesn't understand, but someday she will) that she needs to keep her hands inside the ride at all times.  I would not reccomnd this toy if you are busy with something else, because you do need to be watching her, like any toy.  If you are busying try the ExerSaucer (read my review).  But overall this toy is pretty safe if you are there to supervise and well worth the $40 to see you child bouncing away.  I like to keep the lights really dim at night so she can see the pretty lights.  It is really fun watching her jump around in this.  I can see though how it is very possible for fraying to occur, but I think as long as you inspect it with each use and make sure it is secure you will be fine.	
1. 	We have a gas stove and a 16 month old who likes to turn knobs, pull out drawers and generally get into mischief. Like any parent, I was nervous about my daughter turning on the gas stove without us knowing. These covers are wonderful- and give me peace of mind. They're easy to open, sturdy plastic and easy to install. Recommended for any house who has toddlers!	
1. 	Another child to potty train and anything they are into to get them to go is where I head and this seems to do the trick. It holds up well and she seems to enjoy seeing Dora.	
- 1	The snail cannot float staying up it only want to float on its side. My daughter enjoys the rings like they were rattles but that is pretty much it.	
1. 	What a terrific invention!!  We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.  Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!  Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to snack on the go.My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can.  I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!	
- 1	I was very disappointed when my 5 month old threw this toy to this side. She didn't even look at it twice. Maybe when she gets a little older and is able to push the buttons she will like it. It got really rave reviews but who knows all babies are different.	
1. 	My daughter was small when she was born and we had trouble latching on.  The nurse went and got a nipple shield and an hour later she was eating away.  I have been using this since she was born almost two months ago and I have yet to notice any decrease in my milk supply. Highly recommend this product if you have trouble latching on.  Don't give up it takes time.  Also this product is very thin so the baby can still smell your milk and you still feel everything that you would without using one.	
- 1	This thermometer is a complete waste of money...it says it reads in 5 seconds but i haven't had one 5 second reading yet. Horrible product, especially if you have a squirmy baby....please don't waste your money!!	
- 1	As you can see in the picture the bottles are (supposed) to be clear and NOT the BPA free ones. I ordered these because I wanted the ones that are not BPA free. I wanted them to be completly clear. When I recieved them I was sad to see that they were the BPA free kind. If I wanted the BPA free ones I would have order them for $7 cheaper per pack..needless to say I am getting a refund. But apparently Dr. Browns doesnt make the clear (non BPA free) ones anymore :( So I suppose I will have to get the BPA free kind, but at least I will be getting them cheaper then this.	
1. 	This is a great swing and my daughter loves it.  She likes to look at the moving birds and leaves at the top.  I love that you can change swinging directions.  Worth every penny!	
- 1	I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!	
- 1	We bought this and hoped it would be used for a few years.  But, I noticed the chair was squeaking when my son moved his head.  Somehow, the styrofoam came apart from the frame (the 2 buttons on the back didn't work to hold the styrofoam on).  Neither my husband nor I can recall doing anything to the carseat to make this happen.It gets 2 stars because the roller adjustment to the straps was great---when it wasn't stuck.	
- 1	I have had the Dora ones for about 3 days but am posting the review here since this design seems to have the most traffic. For my daughter only, who is almost 4, these are probably fine though I wished they held more than 9 ounces ( wanting to move on from our 12 ounce nubby straw ones which have been my stand by for 3 years). I was trying it out on my 15 month old seeing if he could manage this type - which he seemed to be able to do and get out some milk. The problem is that he throws the cup over his highchair when he's done, and the inner cup already cracked. So the liquid would get in between the two layers.  I don't want the milk inI there to go rancid so that one has to go bye bye.	
1. 	Great Product!!!!We ordered two 2 bar extensions and one autoclose gate.We love it! We have a 48-inch hallway and it fits perfectly.	
- 1	These are cheap in cost, and as expected, cheaply made. I guess you can't expect much. I do not like these because they do not have a lip on the straw to keep it inside of the cup. My LO just pulls the straw right out and then dumps the water out. I have a few adult sized plastic cups that have the lip on the straw so that it will not come out. Why can't you do this on a kid's cup?	
1. 	I'm so glad I bought this monitor with the larger 2.5 screen. We are able to see our daughter clearly even in black-and-white mode. Note that there needs to be good bright lighting in the bedroom for it to show color mode clearly.This monitor has great reception, as I can take it down to the garage to do laundry or out to our patio to water the plants. It does generate some interference when we set it near our computers or tv.You do have to keep it plugged in for it to show the picture constantly, otherwise it goes into standby mode with only sound (you have to press the top button to get picture).I do wish that they had numbered volume settings on the side so I can always set it at the same level every night. I find myself fidgeting with it each night to get just the right amount of sound. We have a sound machine that runs in her room at night, so we try not to make it too loud.All in all, this will save you the hassle of running to the baby's room all the time. Good quality and effective!	
1. 	I wish I would've had one of these with my first baby!  We live in New England where it is COLD in the winter and this keeps the baby so toasty! I can put him in his seat with just regular clothes on and he is as warm as can be.  I've also had a ton of compliments on how stylish it is.  I love that it's not babyish!	
- 1	I was really excited to use this bottle, because I wanted a good anti-colic system which didn't require the many parts of Dr. Brown bottles.  However, I ended up abandoning it for the Similac SimplySmart bottle.  Here's why:1.  The cap is impossible to open.  I thought it would loosen with use, but I couldn't stand to wait a significant amount of time.  I once asked my husband to open one for me, and he almost instantly went to get a flat-topped screwdriver.  There is no other bottle I've tried that has this problem, and I find it inexcusable.  This was the most significant reason I hated this bottle.2.  There are no 1 ounce markings on the bottle, which is difficult for newborns.  Our baby required accurate monitoring of how much he was taking at first due to medical issues, and I found it frustrating not to be able to see anything less than 2 ounces.3.  The bottle is opaque, which makes it hard to see the line when filling the bottle or the markings when checking to see how much the baby drank.  This is especially true at night, when I had the lighting on low.  Very annoying--there is a reason most of the bottles out there are clear.4.  Water leaks out of the bottom.  I never had a real formula leak, but water would somehow get trapped in the sealing ring at the bottom, and I would get wet when I shook the bottle to mix it.  This would always make me panic that I had placed it incorrectly and that formula was leaking.  I was never sure that it wasn't formula, though, in the middle of the night when I was groggy.	
1. 	My daughter has a lot of fun playing with this.  I got it for her when she was 6mos old, she still plays with it now at 9mos.  The one we got is a different color than the one pictured (not that it bothered us; but just wanted to note that colors may vary).  My daughter likes shaking and biting this, but also has fun spinning and watching the beads.	
1. 	We really don't have a lot of room for more furniture, so after agonizing over the $100 FP high chair and the $200 Boon, I decided to give this little $23 booster seat a try. What the heck, right? If it doesn't work out, it goes to grandpa's and I break down and get the big chair. So far it's been great. Our son loves sitting in it and playing with his toys, either on the floor or on a chair while we eat, and it packs up so we can easily take it to friends' houses.  Sorry, but you can't do that with a Boon.I find snapping the tray on mildly annoying, because you have to line it up and it's hard to see where to snap it when you're looking from above, but that's my only complaint. The straps are plenty long to secure it to any dining chair and it's easy to clean.  Our son is 8 months and big (21 lbs, 30&#34;) and he fits in it just fine with the tray snapped on the closest setting, so we know there's room for growth.	
- 1	I thought this was cute but Its not realistic when it comes to trying to pump with it regularly.  The Nipple openings were really close together and didn't fit me (I wear a 38D)  I didn't like that it clips together....I prefer a zipper because its faster getting it on and off.	
1. 	This diaper pail is easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't require any expensive refills-just regular 13 gallon trashbags. It doesn't keep odor in very well, but other diaper pails don't really seem to, either. I mean, it's poop. It smells! We have two of these-one for cloth diapers/laundry, and one for trash. They're a good size, and hold up well after continuous use.	
1. 	I only found couple reviews on this product but I thought I'd risk it and order it. It was bit tricky at first to assemble, but after the first couple times it's so easy. I think it's awesome. I throw this in my purse in a quart size ziploc bag and carry a bottle with a lid to store for when I'm out and need to express myself or when I'm traveling. It's so much easier than carry my double electric pump and looking for a place to plug in and hookup. I never used the flexi shield and it works fine for me that way. I feel that the hand pump has stronger suction than my Ameda Purely Yours electric pump!It's great to put it in your purse or to use when you can't be hooked on to the pumps. I would totally recommend this product and I have!!	
1. 	We bought this for when we went on vacation. We have had issues in the past with places not having a high chair when we needed one, so we planned on using this. Well, vacation has come and gone and we loved it so much that we have gotten rid of our full size high chair and just use this instead. I love the height adjustments on this. It is perfect for a growing loittle one. When traveling it folds up nicely and the tray cover is great. I can't say enough good things about this chair. We love it!	
- 1	We have an older Summer Infant monitor and we really loved it, but recently the night vision stopped working on it and it's kind of annoying.  So, I read a bunch of reviews for this one and decided to replace the Summer Infant.  I wasn't really impressed.  The sound was very tinny and the unit felt so lightweight, bordering on cheaply made.  Then we realized the frequency hopping was interfering with our wireless router signal.  We couldn't use our iPad, laptop or phones around it and stay connected to the internet.  It was very annoying.  We finally decided the working night vision wasn't worth the hassle of it and worth another $99 so we returned it.	
- 1	I borrowed this swing from a friend when I had my twins.  Within 6 weeks the controls shorted out.  Once you turned it on, you could not turn it off unless you removed the batteries.  So I bought the same swing (I wanted to return a working swing to her).  I used it for about 6 weeks & it did the same thing.  Since it was new I called Graco & they sent me a replacement motor.  Just a few weeks later I had to call Graco again because, yet again, it shorted out.  They have sent me another replacement motor & I am going to put it together & return it to my friend because I HATE this swing.  The reason it got 2 stars is because Graco has been fabulous.  The swing would get 0 stars from me, but the customer service would get 5.  My Fisher Price swing is still working great after 4 years & it has survived toddlers!  If I had to buy another, I would get a Fisher Price swing.	
- 1	Unless you have a less than 6 pound baby this is useless.  My son was 8 lbs 14 oz at birth and could NEVER use this insert.  It was a  waste of money and it was too late to return.	
1. 	Our baby can get out of any normal blanket swaddle.. this is great because you just wrap it a bunch of times around, no messy velcro or anything. Its nice and thin, so baby doesn't get over heated which I think is one of the best featureds. Most babies are actually over dressed... plus I am in Georgia so it doesn't snow much here... the house is always kept around 74 degree's so no need for something super hot. Cotton i just better. We also just got gifted the pink one so now we have two.The first time I used it wasn't a good moment, she wasn't having it, but the last 3 times I've used it, it worked liek a charm.	
1. 	I received a smaller portion of these at my baby shower and waited way too long to use them.  I figured I would save them for special occasions such as travelling or something, only because I would never normally spend money on a bag just to throw it away.  Well, I have recently decided to change my ways by not hanging onto something waiting to use it for a special occasion that never happens.  Now, my husband and I drop every deadly poopy diaper into one of these handy dandy little bags, tie it up, and throw it in the garbage bin.  It saves time and trips from having to empty the garbage so often by eliminating the explosion of rotting poopy diapers when you open an air tight garbage bin.  This is a smell-saver must have.	
- 1	I have been pleased with a number of my other Munchkin purchases, so I decided to get this bottle brush to replace one that I have overused. Unfortunately, this brush is not useful for us. The blue bristles are so stiff that they cannot get into the corners of bottles. For some of the bottles, the brush hardly fits into the mouth of the bottle at all (4-5 oz storage bottles from the hospital, and regular Dr. Brown's bottles). And, there is no way this brush can be used at all on any pump parts. The white bristles are actually more flexible, but since the blue bristles are at the top and bottom, it makes it virtually impossible for the white bristles to get into corners. We have toyed with the idea of cutting off most of the blue bristles, but that is pointless.The &#34;nipple&#34; brush, which is at the base of the brush, is slightly more useful, but there is a bent over piece at the tip of this brush, which makes it slightly too large to fit into some parts. Also, these bristles are also quite stiff, but this part of the brush is still more useful.I would recommend getting another brush, like the Dr. Brown's bottle brush, instead. They also sell tiny nipple brushes. Both of these items are more useful than this Munchkin one.We have been using this brush to wash vegetables.	
1. 	The height of this play yard is awesome! My daughter is 7 months, and 26 in tall. I can't see her being able to climb over this any time soon (or my 2 dogs being able to get her toys). I wish I had bought the extension for this though (and probably will). It has a decent amount of room inside, but I could use more because she basically doesn't let me out of her sight, and I have to sit inside with her most of the time. The play yard is very easy to fold up and transport, and stores easily. The only real negative for me is the space inside. Otherwise it is great!	
1. 	I have a baby 4 months old and asked many of my friends what crip I should buy.After a long period of searching here and there, and considerations, I decided to get this item.The conclusion is that this item is fully satisfying my expection and more over.Very sturdy and hard in its frame, the crip also shows a luxurious look.My wife urged me ordered other item(diaper changing table) from the crip manufacturer, so I ordered one yesterday!It took about 30 minutes to assembly it. I had a lot of fun to do that. (needing a screw driver, which was not included.)The only flaw I have to mention is that it gets scratches easily. Be cautious when you are around the crip!However, my wife and I strongly recommend this item.	
- 1	I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.	
- 1	I just got this in the mail today. I put the battery in, correctly. Nothing happens. No LCD display, no light, nada. What a piece of junk!(The battery also has an expiration date of December 2011, so, maybe I have to go buy another 9V battery... this is so disappointing.)	
- 1	This brush fell apart after only using it for two weeks. The sponge at the very top of the brush completely came off and is now useless to clean the bottom of the bottle. Don't waste your money on this one....it won't last.	
1. 	Although my son hates these, they work well to get stuff out of his nose.  Never had a problem with them hurting him.  They broke after almost two years when I squeezed them the plastic broke.  Ordering a new one.  Just wish it had a more comfortable tip, but at least it isn't sharp.	
1. 	Fantastic! My 7 month old loves to gnaw on his new toothbrush and I am so happy we are beginning these wonderful habits now. He is teething, with teeth coming any day now so this has been a welcomed soother without having to freeze his hands holding a standard water filled tether. I do recommend having a spare as they are easy to loose! :-) Dog grabbed one too... darn it! I also recommend NOT leaving baby along with this to avoid any choking issues. I'm sure the packaging states this as well but important to repeat. This is a great product and is 3-4 bucks more at retail baby stores. I also like that my son is doing the 'brushing' verse me putting a finger brush on and putting my fingers in his mouth. He can bite! LOL... Only improvement? Make the loop bigger to prevent the brush from going into their mouth too much.	
- 1	Dont buy or waste your money really bad. It gets a star because >The hippo is cute but it's piece of garbage. Sending back hope I can.	
- 1	These are way to big for a 1 to 6 month babies wrists.  They fit my 14 and 17 year olds wrists, and almost mine!  They just fall off of babies wrist.	
- 1	I used this play yard for a couple weeks, until my baby, who is just learning to pull up to a standing position, fell and cut his head open on the rough plastic edges that stick out on the frame!  It's also not very sturdy, and super easy to push around, so when my son would try to use it to pull up, it would slide around the floor.  I'm returning this and getting a different type of enclosure for my son to play in that is safer.	
- 1	i didn't use these very long. they slid all around and didn't catch no poop for me. i don't even think i got to flush one down the toilet.	
1. 	I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.	
1. 	Works great. I keep it under the regular 'waterproof' mattress cover for when there is (rarely happens) a full bladder whoops from my recently potty-trained daughter.	
- 1	As of February 12, 2014, Graco has a recall on this buckle on other car seats, but not on this model, for some reason.  Graco's spokesperson is quoted as saying that if you have this model and call Graco will still replace the buckle for you.  Ever since we got this car seat we found the buckle to be extremely difficult to unbuckle, so it is not a surprise to find that a recall has happened.  The government criticized Graco for not expanding the recall to this model.  I called the recall number to get a new buckle and a recording said that they are getting too many calls that I should call back later.Overall this system has many flaws, is very heavy, does not ride nearly as smoothly as expected, and now Graco recalls the buckle but ignores this model to the dismay of government safety regulators.	
1. 	In regard to what some have posted about toxins in sheepskins--this Bowron product is safe. See below.From: [...]G L Bowron & Co uses a combination synthetic tannage process for all its shortwool (SWW) and longwool (LWW) Sheepskin production, including Babycare products.The tanning process for Babycare products includes the use of Chromium III, which is a non toxic and non carcinogenic chemical.All Bowron Sheepskins are free of chemicals specified in the Oko-tex Standard 100, which include:(1) Pesticides (PCP/TeCP) (Pentachlorophenols, Tetrachlorophenols)(2) Organic Tin compounds(3) Azo Dyestuffs(4) Extractable Heavy Metals (Chrome VI, Antimony, Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium,  Cobalt, Copper, Nickel, Mercury)Although the wool on Bowron Sheepskins is bleached during processing, it is done so with hydrogen peroxide--no chlorinated chemicals are used at any stage of the tanning process.From [...]Proven and loved by millions of babies around the world.In the crib or playpen, or on-the-go in stroller or car.Clinically tested in hospital and laboratory research to betotally safe and secure to calm and comfort your baby.This is considered one of the safest baby sheepskins in the world, which is why it is so popular. The natural color is a tell-tale sign. Stay away from snow white sheepskins--this means that they have been bleached and excessively treated.	
- 1	These covers are a waste of money! No, my 22 month old cant turn the knob with it in place, but he can easily just pull them off, THEN open the door. The two halves snap around the knob, and just as easily come apart.	
1. 	As a lot of other reviews have stated...this bassinet has everything!  I live in an apartment so space saving is crucial.  The only feature that I haven't used on this is the bedside sleeper.  The first week or so my baby slept in our room...I really didn't want or need something so big in my way of getting out of bed every morning.  I got tired of pulling the big thing from my room to the living room...I just didn't like my baby practically sleeping on the floor all day when you use it as a portable bassinet, so I just moved the whole thing into my living room.  I only use it during the day now, but it was still worth buying.  (Plus it gave me a chance for me to get baby used to her crib at night.)  She loves to nap in it & the vibration & the song Fur Elise helps soothe her.  (She actually now perfers that song than the one her mobile plays...not a good thing at night!)  I do use the changing table a lot...it is a little hassle to lift of the top since it is a little bulky...but no biggie for me.  I also use it as a portable bassinet sometimes when she is awake & just wants attention.There are a few minor complaints about this bassinet. One of the most important pieces of material on it (the material on the changing table) isn't removable...so I use the Huggies changing pads on it...they are big enough to cover most of the surface area.  Also the sheet isn't a normal bassinet sheet so its not like you can use any store bought one without cutting out slits to pull the straps through, which isn't a good idea because you will get loose strings.  Oh & the part that goes between the legs that the straps plug in to...sometimes that needs to be washed too..but no, that too is permanently attached.	
- 1	I wish I didn't purchase these nursing pads. They are expensive, but I thought I'd finally find nursing pads that work well for overnight use. However, I leaked through these gigantic wool pads when I used them overnight. Instead of the milk spreading through the whole nursing pad, it just leaked right through so that most of the pad was dry except the one spot where the milk was leaking. On top of that they are not comfortable. They are very bulky and not soft-- they made me itchy. I tried washing them with wool soap and curing them with lanolin like I do my wool diaper covers, but they still did not perform well. I finally did end up finding something soft and absorbent enough to handle my nighttime leaking-- washcloths! Too bad I didn't figure that out before buying these.	
1. 	My LO is a major drooler, so we and the nanny have taken to putting bibs on her all the time. These are our favorite so far. They are large enough to catch the drool. They are very absorbent - other bibs I have tried seem to repel the spit, which isn't helpful. Or they soak through easily, which means having to change LO's clothes. Two or three of these bibs can see my LO through the day, whereas other bibs have to be changed more frequently.My only gripe is that we have a problem with these weird dark greenish stains that develop and get worse with subsequent use and washing - I'm afraid it could be mold of some sort. I searched the other reviews and looks like only two other reviewers mention a similar issue. Not sure what is going on. We do laundry every other day and have not seen these dark stains on any other baby items. We had actually borrowed a set of these bibs from a friend and managed to ruin nearly all of the bibs before returning them to her. (I bought her an Amazon gift card to replace the value!) Since we needed more bibs, I bought a brand new set and paid close attention to the issue. So far, I've seen the stains develop on one of the bibs after a few weeks of use. I had initially thought they were food stains, but these are dark, spotty discolorations, and not really consistent with food. (I have not used the new set of bibs with food.) So the mystery continues...	
1. 	Initially, we had purchased the Munchkin 6-pack Soft Tipped Infant Spoons and loved them. Once my kiddo got up to three meals a day, we were going through the spoons so fast we were constantly running out. For the same price as the Munchkin spoons, we got 16 of these! They aren't as pretty or quite as sturdy, but they are great. These are smaller so they fit better in his little hand. The colors are wonderful. And with the amount that you get, if you lose one or two, it's no great loss. If we'd started with these, we'd have been fully stocked from the start!	
- 1	My little one didn't like using the sippy cup spout and we ended up using the bottle only twice b/c she was EBF.  Oh well, at least it was a great price.  You might find success if your little one is on a bottle more often and/or likes a harder spout.	
- 1	My 8 month old baby and I both liked this toy until she got her leg wedged through the bars so well that we couldn't get the toy off of her without cutting the bars to get it off. I would NOT recommend this toy at all. I feel it is terribly dangerous.	
1. 	used this for my son once it got cold, kept him warm and swaddled all night. love it. much better than tying up blankets	
- 1	it's good for traveling.  we took it on a trip and it got a hole somehow so we had to inflate it every night. It does not offer good support for baby, you have to watch them super closely.  It is also very slippery and baby kept going under water.  Would not recommend.	
1. 	This conversion kit allows me to pump into the large 9 oz Avent bottles, which is very helpful as the Medela bottles only allow up to 6 oz.	
- 1	I regret buying this, it seemed so convenient to have all the listed items in one package, but it is just poorly manufactured items, and there are much better items out there. Just buy them separately because you will end up doing that anyways if you buy this set.	
1. 	With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket.  The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby.  We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm.  Our baby is big (11 lbs 22 1/2 inches at 6 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer.  We shouldn't have worried.  The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard.  Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants.	
1. 	My daughter and I both love this toy - she loves the music and the 0-3 month side of the mobile paddles, or arms (the flat ones with stickers).  I love the music as it is all classical, and a fair representation of the actual music (only Chopin gets a little tinny on a few notes, but nothing I cannot live with).Other favorite elements include:  1)it plays continuously (I hate musical toys that turn off after a preset period of time - so annoying), 2)it has a mute setting, for movement without sound (great for restaurants and bookstores) and 3) it comes with the lobster claw attachment, which is removable from this mobile, and useable to attach a multitude of other toys to just about anything (I totally disagree with the reviewer who said they could not attach this to virtually anything - I can attach it to virtually *everything*...I use this all over, with multiple toys from multiple brands.  It was most useful in attaching everything to the hood of a bassinette).I like that one can attach the mobile via the lobster claw OR the velcro-ed elastic strap:  very versatile for a multitude of objects.  It is a perfect size for travel:  not too small, and not too large.My daughter ADORES this mobile.  She would stare at it contentedly for parent-friendly blocks of time (from 3-5 mo. or so) in the bassinette.  She never liked the older-child, soft plush figures as much as the flat, 2D, images in black/white/red (even after she could see color, and 3D).  She loves the music even now at 8 months, so it's not a big deal, but Tiny Love (TL) could improve the color contrast or interest of the plush guys.  She and I also liked that the plush figures stick w/ velcro to the three rotating paddles, but can also be pulled down to dangle via the attached string below the paddles for added movement/interest (they don't come off completely).  Three different viewing modes for the price of one.I gave it four stars due to the so-so interest on the plush toy side.In general (not affecting my review of the mobile), TL should include this lobster claw attachment clip with all sold-separately accessories such as the Baby's First Wind Chimes - Garden.  I highly recommend both this mobile and the chimes as a perfect pair for months 3-5...and beyond.	
- 1	I registered for this item and received it as a gift, why, I don't know.  I never really even travel by car too often.  I decided to try it out the one time I did travel, my son was 4 months old.. I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up.  It just remained cold.  I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back.  My advice on this item is, don't buy it, even if it does work, you will probably never use it.	
- 1	These are great as burp cloths but do not use these as diapers! The absorbent batting in the middle is no comparison to real cotton prefolds, like those from green mountain diapers. Your baby will soak right through these Gerber diapers and you will probably not want to cloth diaper anymore. Regal prefolds are pretty inexpensive also, so if you want to try cloth diapering, do your research! Try green mountain diapers or diaper rite.	
1. 	The best thing is that this rocker is made to serve children from newborn to toddler who can sit and rock by himself. So far I have tested it on my newborn. The chair offers two options for him - a rocking chair with entertaining toys (including one musical) dangling over his head and a sort of portable bed where he can comfortably take a nap (this is converted from a rocking chair by a lever). My child as of now can only stare at the dangling toys, but I expect him to be able to play with them in a few weeks. The chair has been very helpful in getting him to sit up when he is awake so that I can face and play with him, and the sleepy position - for keeping him asleep but away from his crib.If there are any suggestion I would make, they are: it would have been nice to have a head holder (like car seats have) and that the rod holding the toys was a bit sturdier. Otherwise, not a bad investment.	
- 1	The baby isn't due for a little while but I washed these in preparation. After reading all the reviews I was very careful in my washing and air dried them. Won't be wanting to wash them in cold water when they are covered in poo though.I am very disappointed how rough they feel after being washed. I also had to iron them as the band around the outside must have shrunk less than the rest of the material. The ironing sort of worked although they still roll up a little around the edges. I have all the time in the world now compared to when baby arrives, so I hope that this problem resolves itself.  Won't be ironing them when baby is here! My current advice...don't bother with these. I'll let you know in Dec when baby arrives if  they suddenly turn out to be utterly wonderful.*****UPDATE*******The baby is a year old and I used 5 of these in rotation for the last year. Only one is ready for the rubbish, the rest have gone into storage for if we have another baby. I have realised my initial assessment was too harsh. These saved me having to remove and wash my changing pad cover every time the baby did a #2 that escaped when I changed him - quite regularly. For the price, I think that they were, in retrospect, quite a good buy. Sorry Boppy.	
- 1	The picture on the monitor is great. I like the rotation feature. The major problem I found with this monitor is that it does not hold a charge. You basically need to keep it plugged in for it to work. It would go from being fully charged to beeping obnoxiously after about 15-20 minutes of usage (with the video screen OFF) and then it would DIE. There are better video monitors out there, even if the picture is not as great, you want the thing to work so don't bother with this one.	
1. 	When I babysat 10+ years ago in junior high I always got confused with the diaper genie, but this is so simple and easy to use. I did find that this was about $10-$15 overpriced on Amazon compared to Babies'R'Us and Buy Buy Baby. This product has held up well in the 8 months we've used it and keeps the room from not smelling.	
- 1	Sad to say these weren't worth the money spent on them.  They were terrible!  The fabric wasn't soft at all, and they kept rolling up and wouldn't stay on or around her knees.	
- 1	This item just wasn't very sturdy and eventually just fell apart. I couldn't even figure out how to get it back together. I think if you keep it stationary it might be okay. It supports a baby's weight and all that, but... don't move with it. It'll let you down.	
1. 	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!	
- 1	The only good thing I can say about this unit is that it does allow me to hear and see my baby.  Most of the time.  Unless it is broken.  Or out of battery power (in which case there is no alarm to let you know that the battery has worn down, a point I will get to later).  So I am now on my third unit.  Thank goodness I bought this at a reputable retail store that exchanged the broken one for a new unit. (Unfortunately they wouldn't allow me to get a different monitor.  I had to get the same one.)  Both times, the handheld unit stopped charging. I would plug it into the wall to charge (or use the base) and it just wouldn't charge.  So I don't think I just got a lemon.  I think it's a problem with the product.  The major design flaw is that when the battery runs out and the handheld turns off, there is no alarm. Nothing to let you know that the monitor has turned off. This is also an issue when the unit loses its signal (which happens frequently, and we don't have a large house).  The monitor is no longer monitoring but there is nothing to let you know that.  In my view, this is a MAJOR PROBLEM!!!!  The second time my unit broke, it stopped charging in the middle of the night and eventually the battery power went all the way down.  When I woke up, it was just off.  What is the point of a monitor that can shut off without letting you know???  I don't understand how this has gotten so many positive reviews.  Please DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!	
1. 	I was a little hesitant getting these- as some of the reviews weren't great... but, tbh, these work just as expected! Yes, they do tent to get creases or bubble IF you don't take your time installing. I got a bit impatient at the end so there are a few creases in mine. But I'll just go back and fix later- not really a big deal. It's asthetics, not function. They keep the sun out of my Little Ones eyes and THAT is most important. I didn't roll on as instructed- it was too hard to manuvear. LOL. So I pulled the whole thing off the tube and started at the top and worked my way down (using the foam tube as a roller). I wasn't sure if 1 or 2 came per package- must not have read that clearly- so I bought two sets. So we have enough for 4 windows. Which is perfect as my SUV has one large window and a smaller one right next to it- so I cut a template and then cut out the correct shape to put in there. Worked great with a little effort. For the price I think these are great and better than the roll down shades as those can't be cut to fit and don't stick as well. I'd recommend for sure- and would give 5stars if only a bit easier to install and a bit larger as they are a tad small on my SUV windows... but overall, very pleased.	
1. 	I'm surprised to see that people do not like this product. I love mine. The only downside is that I wish it would hold more bags. Each drawer/tray holds 6 bags (6 oz ea). That means you can store a total of 12 bags. I don't know how people bought this and didn't know that ahead of time though! Not only is it clearly labled, but you can easily count on your own by looking at the photo!When I purchased this I bought two. That way I could store 24 bags (Thats' a lot!) They are stackable so I put two side by side and stack two on top of those. They will fit almost any type of freezer storage bag so I'm not sure why people are complaining that they don't. Make sure you put the bag in the tray BEFORE its frozen. Liquids will mold to any shape, so you won't have a problem. If you try shoving a bag in after its frozen, sure you'll have issues!There are 2 things I love about this product.1) It keeps my breastmilk away from all the other foods in my freezer. Its nice that its in a bag and also in this nice sturdy plastic tray. It keeps it from absorbing any smells from the other frozen foods2) I can organize my milk by date and I never have to go searching through a pile of milk bags. I open the tray and pull out the oldest milk in line. I rotate when a tray empties. I NEVER have to wonder if I'm missing a bag. For any extra milk I have around (beyond the 24 bags I store using 2 units) I keep it that in a plastic grocery bag and when I empty a tray I go through and put in the next 6 oldest bags. I'm always organized! I love that.Personally I LOVE the medela Pump and Save breastmilk freezer bags. They hold 6 oz, have a zip-lock top, and a place to write down the name, date, and amount of oz in the bag. ALL freezer bags are inacurate with their markings because they are BAGS. Squeeze the bag, alter its shape, and the milk shifts, there's no way to know the exact ounces! It doesn't matter the brand! Plus, liquid expands when frozen. The best bet is to collect your milk in a marked BOTTLE first. Note the ounces then write them down in the provided spot on the Medela pump and save freezer bags. That way you and your caregiver knows EXACTLY what is in the bag. Don't try and guess!I recommend this product if you want a nice way to organize your milk and keep it fresh and protected. I wish they could hold a few more bags, but 2 units (4 total trays) has been working out for me and I've been breastfeeding my little one for almost 6 months.	
- 1	So while I loved these spoons the first time I used them (after hand-washing them out of the package), once I used them to feed my little one and then cleaned them in the dishwasher, they warped. I thought that it was because I had put the two spoons I used in the utensil rack of my dishwasher (on the bottom shelf), until I used the other two new spoons and put those on the top rack, because they also warped. And not a little, but a LOT. The spoon part (where the food rests) melted, and the handles became twisted and bent. So disappointed because these really worked great otherwise. I am debating whether I should get another set and just hand-wash them, but then I'll have to be vigilant about it (as will my husband) and with a little one, it's hard to remember small details like that.I am also annoyed that it doesn't say on the package that these are hand wash (and no, I don't have a super duty dishwasher, or a heat sterilizing one - in fact, it pretty much doesn't clean my dishes at all - just dries them after I wash them in the sink and put them in there). I would call it a dishdryer instead of a dishwasher at this point. :)	
- 1	My fault for not reading the fine print, but these wipes are not fully organic.  As a matter of fact, the description (to be honest) should say Fuzzi Bunz Organic Cotton/Polyester Fleece Double Sided Wipes because it is possible to make a double-sided wipe out of one side organic cotton and one side organic fleece...I am a first time mom, and am trying cloth diapering with organic and natural fibers.  Luckily, I bought only one package of the FuzziBunz wipes and one package of each of several other types.  When cloth diapering, you cannot use fabric softener in your laundry or else the absorbency of your diapers and wipes will be reduced dramatically.  Without softener, these wipes generated enough static electricity to power my house.  I found them stuck to everything--my daughter's clothes, her diapers, towels, sheets, you name it.  I wasn't about to wash them separately from my other diaper laundry so, instead, I got rid of them.  For me, they were a total waste of money.  Why pay more for organic cotton if, in the end, you are rubbing your little one's most sensitive parts with polyester?!	
- 1	We got this step up ladder to help my 3 year old get onto her potty. It is made for a low to the ground round toilet.We have a tall, elongated bowl and the feel swing and wobble on the ground making it not very safe.I try the step up ladder on a low to the ground round bowl toilet and it still had some wobble and slid around on the seat.I would up throwing it away as i deemed it unsafe for my daughter on both toilet types.	
- 1	I had used these for 2 weeks when the drawers started falling out. I screw them in again but  Now, after 4 months of use they cannot be screw in again because the fixed wall hole is already too big. The worst thing ever. It seems like it was made of cardboard. DONT BUY THESE!!!	
1. 	This is the perfect on the go feeding bib.  It rinses easy in the sink when we get home, had a pocket to catch falling food, and dries quickly.  It even protects clothing more that others I've tried.	
1. 	I bought this potty for my[...]when she started using the potty because it is small and portable.  I also have a baby and this fits in my diaper bag even with all the baby stuff.  I use it mostly in the car, but also in the park, in public bathrooms so she doesn't have to sit on the dirty seat, and everywhere else when we are not at home.  The only complaints I have are that it is not that comfortable, it is flimsy (the legs do colapse sometimes and create a bit of a mess on her bottom!) and you have to buy the bags made especially for it.  I do use regular shopping bags when I run out, but they don't work as well.  But the benefit of it being so small and convenient greatly outweighs the cons!	
1. 	I love Avent bottles & nipples!  They hold up over time & my son has had zero issues with them - no gas, no hesitation when transitioning from breast to bottle, nothing.	
1. 	I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.Pros:-very comfy seat, good padding-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my EvenfloCons:I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it.	
1. 	My son loves his sleep sacks! these are so nice and warm and very large so the child can grow without replacing them all the time! we love our sleep sacks!	
1. 	Not sure how good of a toothbrush it is but my daughter loves to put it in her mouth and chew on it (she is 11 months).  We have been &#34;using&#34; (chewing&#34; on it for a couple of months now with no damage.	
1. 	Tihs play yard works well for us right now. We needed a space for our 10 month old to safely play while we did other things (cook, clean, deal with the pets, etc.). It's sturdy enough that he can pull up on it.  However, we he gets going, he can slide it across our wood floor.I like that it easily folds. When we have company over or the cleaning lady is coming or we just don't want to look like a playground anymore (!), we just can fold it up and slide it in a closet. Overall, it meets our needs and we are happy with the purchase.	
1. 	I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old (not at the same time of course).  I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.	
1. 	My son really likes sitting on this seat, it's comfy and he likes sitting on the &#34;big potty&#34;, but the first time he peed, it ran in between this seat and the toilet and went down the front of the toilet and onto the floor. But it's a good seat when your kiddo knows how to &#34;aim&#34;.	
1. 	This seat seems very comfortable for my little girl to ride in. Like the Decathlon Odyssey, it reclines very well for rear facing (we haven't used it forward facing yet) and is also very padded for her comfort. The print is so adorable and super soft. I love that Britax has the hugs system because not once have I had to untwist those darn harness straps like in her infant seat. This seat is also a breeze to install. This is definitely one I recommend!!! 5+ stars!!!!	
1. 	I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them. I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.OH!! And if you would rather, the bottles and all parts fit in the munchikin dishwasher basket.. even the sraws can be put in the straw things on the side of it!!! just discovered that...	
1. 	Bought this to sit on top of a dresser.  I am so glad that I did.  Love the high walls around all 4 sides.  Large enough to fit my tall baby comfortably!	
1. 	My 8 mo old loves these. She mostly just knocks them down and bangs them together, but she does actively play with them. They have tiny holes in the bottom that are die cut in different shapes, so you could use them in the tub, count the holes (they correspond with the stacking order of the cups). They are durable, colorful and they stack well. The set we received had colors that were different from the pictures, but I actually like the colors we received more.	
- 1	I choose this because of its compact size which it's prove to be good for 1-3 hours trip. However, the one I've got has a red/white bag color with red/yellow changing pad which make me feel not comfortable to bring it along.	
1. 	Let me first say that I didn't buy our pacifiers from Amazon, so I haven't had any problems with colors or anything.This pacifier is my son's favorite. Now that he is old enough that this paci fits in his mouth, he loves the bulbous shape of the nipple. He can hold it in his mouth easily, and it doesn't seem to bother his sore gums, now that he is teething badly. With the more narrow base, he can compress the nipple inside his mouth without putting a lot of pressure on his gums. The large round base makes it easy for him to manipulate on his own, and it doesn't make any goofy imprints on his face.Update:My twins are now 18 months old, and not only does my passi-loving boy still adore this pacifier, now his typically thumb-sucking brother likes to walk around with one of these pacifiers in his mouth, too. We have tried other pacifiers, because these particular ones are becoming difficult for me to find at my local store. My boy didn't like any of them. Only this one will do. We did have to look over all of the bulb portions of the pacis, to check for wear, so some of our older ones had to be thrown out. It's not a mark against the product though, since my boys have plenty of teeth, and like to bite and pull on these.	
- 1	This pump is the worst one I have tried. I have a cheap little $40 pump that I bought to use at work a few days a week and it works significantly better than this one. I might not have noticed at all if I had nothing to compare it to because it does appear to work and express the milk. However, I normally pump 6-7 ounces per session. The first time I used this pump, I got very nervous that my supply had diminished because I only got 2 ounces! I immediately tried my other pump. Thankfully, I got another 5 ounces from that pump, but I will definitely not be using this one anymore. Very disappointed in Ameda.	
1. 	The Playtex Nurser bottles are not the first bottles I tried with my baby.  I honestly had no problems with the Avent bottles I had been using, but it was a pain to wash them constantly and sterilize them.  So I decided to give these a try because the liners are pre sterilized and I could use the bottle a few times before I actually washed it.The liners fit nicely into the bottle and then I pour the milk from my pump right in the bag.  I do not recommend using the bags for storage because they are not as strong as true milk storage bags.  I have had leakages with these in the refrigerator and I did not try to freeze milk in them.As the baby drinks, the bag prevents air from being released through the nipple and to the baby.  It makes sense when you see how it works, it does not allow any air out. I rarely get a burp out of her after I use these bottles, and she has not had any issues with gas.  The box the bottles came in actually state two different trials in which this type of bottle system significantly reduced colic.  If I have a colicky baby, I will definitely be using these bottles.The negatives-You have to buy the bags.  However, they come in boxes of 100 for less than 10 dollars which is enough to last 2-3 weeks if you use them at every feeding (less for newborns).Like I mentioned earlier, the bags are not great for storage.Overall, a great choice for new moms.	
1. 	I have purchased several infant/toddler seats for my children and this one by far is the best for the money.	
1. 	It is warm and comfortble. Before ordering it I read other reviews and noticed that many parents complain that the zipper does not go all the way up - I agree, it doesn't. I added buttons and loops couple of inches above the zipper ends, it took just few minutes but helps a lot when it's cold and windy - just a suggestion, maybe someone else would find it useful too. Though you still will need warm hat and scarf too keep your baby warm.	
- 1	As one of the other reviews said, this looks fancy, but is rather unpractical.  The removable wipe dispenser is hard to open and keeps falling out.  All and any wipes I got would always get stuck in there.  It's not functional.  The little trays for extra stuff like lotion are TINY.  The only thing this has going for it is that it looks cute.  MAJOR WARNING:  When the tray keeps falling out, there were a few times when the wipes would get stuck and the entire tray would basically FLY out with the wipe toward the baby.  Very very very dangerous!!!!	
- 1	These are heavier and harder than the original Gumdrops made by Hawaii Medical. If you want the authentic pacis like from the hospital or a lighter version that doesn't fall out of baby's mouth than don't buy these.	
- 1	The mirror is very small and it does not stay in place. If the day is sunny and warm in a few seconds the mirror will fall down from the window. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	our little one loves the way it feels on her gums and teeth, that every time we carry her into the bathroom she spits out her pacifier in anticipation for it!	
1. 	Love that the cover has the pillows on the side for the grocery store trips but hard to use in highchairs.  (I just bring a different cover in the car for eating out)  Folds up great and attaches to the shopping cart over the handle so I can put snacks there.  Great cover	
- 1	Originally I loved the idea of being able to see at a glance whether the room was the correct temperature, and overall the look is very pleasing. But these are my issues with it:- Like other reviewers have mentioned, I do not think it is accurate. We also have a baby monitor that shows the temperature on the parent handsets, and they are rarely the same. I think the baby monitor shows the true temperature as it matches the aircon unit display.- I only have one shelf surface suitable for this thermometer, so it is placed about 1 ft from a lamp. If the lamp is on, this affects the thermometer. Not very useful.- Because of its basic design, you cannot program the temperature boundaries, which would be a nice feature. Personally I like the nursery to be around 69/70 degrees but according to this thermometer, that is too hot.- The thermometer doesn't seem to register some numbers. Like 68 degrees, for example. So it flips between 67 and 69, which happens to be over a color change point. So the egg has a mini disco light display for a while, fighting an internal battle to show 68. To be honest I'm not sure that it bothers my baby (who is 3m) but I find it VERY irritating when I am doing night feeds.So its a shame really. I haven't returned it only because the baby monitor I have doesn't show the temperature on the nursery unit, only on the handsets. So this is better than nothing. For now.	
- 1	This is completely useless for breastfeeding, or anything else. The opening is really small so it didn't fit around my waist.  (Maybe if i was a size 0 right after giving birth it would have!) Also the curves along the length of the pillow put a baby at the wrong angle for nursing. I have nursed 2 babies through one year and have never used it once! I tried the first day at the hospital until a nurse suggested I use something else. If you are pregnant, don't waste your money! I use a pillow and blanket, or try a product called my breast friend.	
1. 	We brought our daughter home at just over 5 lbs and she was a little too small for the swing when it was on, but loved to just sit in it and look at the mobile.  I'm glad it has a feature to JUST watch the mobile.  After about a month she loves it and sits in it for fair ammounts of time.  She doesn't ever fall asleep in the swing, but that's okay.  She is always very comfortable and this swing accomodates small babies very well.  The motor is quiet, and I love that the swing will go side to side or front to back. I also love the neutral colors.  We keep it in our living room and it just blends in.  It is a little expensive, but our baby is so comfy in it, I'm glad we got this one.	
1. 	It worked until i put it in dishwasher. just surface wash it. if you squeeze the nipple while washing, the water gets in and there is no way to get it out.	
1. 	My daughter received the cloud b twilight turtle for her first Christmas (she was 6 months) and my two nieces received the ladybug's (ages 2 and 3). These night lights were the it toys that Christmas (2010) - especially with the older toddlers. These adorable little critters are soft, and project beautiful soft stars onto the ceiling and walls. For us, all of the colours showed on the ceiling - the amber is a bit fainter than the blue and green, but still lovely. The product does project better if placed in the centre of the room (on a stand), or at the end of the bed. It is also best enjoyed by older children, especially those who have a fear of the dark. These night lights are very user friendly (which means the children can turn them on and off as desired without us parents having to be called back in all night long). The automatic shut-off is an excellent feature as well, to conserve battery power. We have found that our daughter, now 2, does enjoy this toy more than she did as a younger baby. She finds the stars comforting at nap time and bed time, and is actually falling asleep much quicker (fingers crossed that this continues). In sum I think this is a fantastic product and very well made, (these little guys are stilling going strong after two full years of use and abuse by my families toddlers)! For those of you who are looking for a combination of sound and light, cloud b is releasing a Tranquil Turtle this June 2012.	
- 1	We returned this product.  I didn't like the fact that you could never really get all the water out of it which led me to believe that over time, mold would grow inside.  Also, the plate part and suction base are not one piece so my child was able to easily pull on it to remove it from the highchair tray and spill all the contents all over herself and the floor.  Not good in my book :-(	
- 1	When I started making baby food, I thought I would appreciate the small serving size.  Unfortunately, one ounce is just too small for anything really.  They quickly ended up at the bottom of the baby food container options.	
- 1	first off it was extremely hard to mount to the carseat safely.  no matter how hard my husband or i tightened it, the slightest tug from our daughter would make it collapse and fall on her.  i can't believe that this was ever tested out by children, because if it was they would have made some huge changes in design!	
1. 	We have had this in Mommy's car since baby was born. We got a new car for Daddy that we intend to take on trips and since we got her a new carseat for Daddy's car we put Mommy's mirror in Daddy's car. He loves that with it in the middle seat he can see her in the rear view mirror without straining. He won't give it back so I am glad I found it here to get another one. The original was from Wal-Mart but they don't sell it anymore.	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to travel with! Works great in crib or playpin.  Our son is now able to rest thanks to this product	
1. 	You get more than what you pay for here. Its got solid stitching and holds a considerable amount of stuff. Just purchased 2 more.	
- 1	This is a great concept and has lots of pros, such as large size, a valve-free straw that goes to the very bottom of the bottle.  However, I am afraid the cons outweigh the pros.  The biggest problem is the clear plastic second top that twists to close and open the silicone straw. not only is it hard to twist it and almost impossible to clean underneath it, but the liquid the child is drinking from the bottle gets trapped between the bottle and the clear plastic top and then leaks from the hole in the clear plastic top.  Therefore, you cannot use this bottle for anything other than water. I like the idea of a valve-free straw and have been looking for one on the market for a long time (the only other one like it was the Green Sprouts aqua bottle but the plastic it is made of cracks the second it is dropped) and was happy to find this one, but it has proven not a very good design after all.	
1. 	Love this containers.  These work well with the Avent on the Go breast pump system.  I haven't had any problems with freezing them and they haven't cracked. Love the fact that they are small containers (4oz) so they freeze well and when it's time for the milk to be defrosted it doesn't take long.  I plan to make my own babyfood and I am going to use these containers.  LOVE THEM	
1. 	I ordered four different kinds of prefolds to try: Gerber birdseye, OsoCozy bleached, OsoCozy unbleached, and these Kushies. Initially, I just used the OsoCozy diapers because they were smaller in size than the Gerbers or the Kushies. However, they were all dirty one day and I pulled out a Kushie and a Gerber. HELLO!! The Kushies are so much more absorbent than either of the other two brands. Even though they are large, they fit very well into my son's Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps Size One, which was my initial concern. The extra material increases their effectiveness, but the fabric itself (flannel) is more absorbent than the other fabrics. Even when the diaper is soaked through, it does not feel as wet and soggy as the other brands. For that reason, I think that it is more gentle on my son's skin--AND it's softer than the other fabrics! For now, I just have one pack, so they have become my overnight diapers. I will soon be ordering more and make them my sole brand.My diaper system:I use Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps with prefolds; I have tried several brands, but prefer Kushies. I stash dirty diapers in a Planet Earth wet/dry bag until I have a chance to spray them off with the Mini-Shower Bidet & Handheld Sprayer, them I dunk them in the Bambino Mio diaper bucket half-filled with water and a 1/2 cup of Borax until I wash them. I run them through one rinse cycle, then wash them in hot water with Charlie's Soap with a single rinse. So far, no stains, and no skin irritation! I do one load of diaper laundry per day.	
- 1	I should have listened to other reviews. I don't like that the sleeves are open and food can get inside. Besides that I don't like the material. I wiped it down and it got all wrinkly and crinkled. Looks really bad now. I bought the Bumpkins instead and am happier with that.	
- 1	I've tried EVERYTHING to get this piece of junk to stick to the bathroom tile with no luck!  The Boon Frog Bath Toy Scoop is way better and worth the extra money as it actually sticks to the tile.	
1. 	I hadn't planned on getting a stroller.  I think they are too heavy and bulky.  My friend recommended this one to me.  I love it!  It's so lightweight.  It's also very sturdy and high quality.  I love the snap-and-go functionality.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	Shipped through low cost carrier LASERSHIP which is notorious for losing packages.....like this one. Never received product.	
1. 	I don't pump into the bag because I don't pump 5oz on each side and then it would waste a lot of bags.  So I pump into the plastic containers and pour into the bags. It's a little tricky to get the milk in and out.  The new design of Medela bags are worse - they have holes in the top for a direct-pumping contraption and the milk can pour out the holes as you pour it into the bottle for feeding if you're not careful!  My husband cuts the tops off the bag before pouring to avoid the milk coming out the attachment holes as he is pouring it out.  Otherwise, I have been very happy with the bags.  I've used hundreds already and never had leaking or freezing issues.  You do have to do the ziploc up really tight - I go over it 5 times to make sure it's sealed - because otherwise the milk can come out if the bag falls on its side.	
1. 	I have two of these placemats. One for the diaper bag and one used as a backup while the other is being washed. I have bought this for numerous friends and everyone LOVES it. The one drawback for one of my friends is - their daughter learned right away to pull it off the table and refuses to use it. Eveyone else I know has had no problems with it. It catches food in it's little pocket, keeps the table clean and is easy to rollup and store away. I can't say enough about this product. My husband, daughter and I eat out 1-2 times a week (she is 230 mths old and we've dines out since she was born) and we use it everytime there's a table it will stick to (which is everything but tablecloth). We've used it sine my daughter was old enough for the high chair.	
- 1	I washed these several times, then tried to use them with a hemp doubler for overnight. Within less than an hour after my 1 year old was in bed, he was soaked. After doing a water test to see if water beads up on these or the doublers, these fleece liners failed. They were not absorbing at all...the water just collected & beaded on the surface. So, this liner was the cause of his diaper leaking as soon as he urinated one time while trying to go to sleep. How many times do you have to wash these for them to be effective? I wish I could return them. They were a waste of my time, water & detergent to wash, & money!	
- 1	We have had no luck with this cup yet.  My daughter just doesn't get that she doesn't need to tilt it as far as she would a sippy cup in order to get liquid out.  The holes in the top of the cup go all the way around so when she tilts it too far, she gets drenched.  It would have made more sense just to have a small section with holes in it so that if she tilts the cup too far, the solid part of the lid stops the liquid and it can only come out the small section where the holes are.	
1. 	Because of initial problems breastfeeding, I used the hospital grade Medela symphony for the first month of my son's life. After returning that rental, I went out and bought the PIS Advanced backpack. This is a great machine that gets out a good amount of milk in a short amount of time. This has been great now that I am back at work and sometimes only have a quick break for pumping. This is so easy to set up and store that I can set the pump up, pump, store the bottles and put everything away all in about 20 minutes and still get as much as 10 ounces in one session.I don't use the bottles that came with the pump for long-term storage. I use Lansinoh storage bags for the milk that I freeze and for the refrigerated milk, I bought an adapter that allows me to pump straight into Avent bottles. I'm not sure the bags or the adapter are on sale here on Amazon, but they're worth looking into.	
1. 	These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I have experienced no leaking thusfar.  I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful (and they are acrylic, so reheating is much easier).  My only complaint is that they are slightly too small.  I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz. and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk (which is too precious!).  However, I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product!	
- 1	Since I had already made the commitment to make homemade baby food for my little one, I figured why stop there. I began searching for what I thought would be the best reusable Baby Food Pouch, and came across these from Go Fresh Baby. I really liked how the zipper was on the side instead of the bottom and how the feeding tube was on the top instead if the side. I was so excited and placed my order fairly quickly. I really appreciated how the product came with easy to follow, step by step instructions. I followed the instructions so that I could wash the pouches for use this upcoming week. The zipper was extremely hard to open. In fact, on one of the pouches the zipper separated from the pouch. Now there is an opening to the pouch and the zipper remains sealed. This was disappointing because I haven't had this product very long at all. I'm hoping I'll be able to get this sorted out.	
1. 	My son has loved this bouncer since he was just a couple of weeks old.  The fish really keep his attention.  I love the fact that you can play music, water sounds, and wave sounds.  It keeps him interested.He is only 2 months, so he is not old enough to bounce it, yet.  It helps me a lot when I have to take a shower of do laundry.  I can place him in the room with me and not worry that he will not be entertained!	
- 1	I have a 3 year old girl who loves Minnie and Pink. She loves this potty but I hate it. Everytime she pees on it, it leaks. So not only do I have to dump the potty and clean it up, I have to clean the floor. So disappointing. She loves the noise it makes when you potty. It had great potential. The fact that it turns into a stool is nice but It's basically a $20 stool...	
- 1	I bought it after seeing a friend using it for her daughter. It worked very nicely for them. What I didn't know before I bought this was whatever you put inside this need to be very very very smooth and fine. The apple sauce I put in was slightly chunky and it cannot get out easily. Unfortunately my son never liked his apple sauce so smooth. I hardly used this once.	
1. 	I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.	
1. 	This goes well with the new Prince Lionheart wipe warmer as well. A bit bulky but really useful.	
- 1	I bought this on whim during a trip to Babies R Us without reading any reviews first-MISTAKE! It was $40, which I thought was expensive, but it also warms baby food jars so I decided we would be able to use it long-term--WRONG. First, the settings for each type of bottle and whether it's room temp, frozen, etc. are totally inaccurate. We tinkered with the settings for a few weeks to finally find a set that worked for our 8 oz. refrigerated formula in glass bottles. The settings? Wide neck, frozen breastmilk. Even then, we sometimes had to reheat it several times. Other times, it was too hot. After cracking 3 of our glass bottles, we returned it. I later read reviews on BRU that indicated it melted some plastic bottles as well. This warmer is a total miss and waste of $$. We are now happily using an old-fashioned pan of hot water.	
1. 	These are awesome training pants! They hold one accident really well and are the trimmest training pants I've found. They look like real underwear. Great for when the child needs protection from occasional accidents. They are not as absorbent as a diaper so they should be used once the child is doing well with potty training.	
1. 	I have a large one-year-old - in the 90th percentile, and this fits him perfectly. It's been great for winter and has kept him toasty with some fleece footie pajamas underneath. I highly recommend all HALO sleepsacks. The material is soft and the zipper is easy to pull up and down. Big thumbs up!	
- 1	These clings, just never worked for me.  They ended up clinging together and just never performed as desired.  I would not purchase these again nor recommend them.	
1. 	I like this sleepsack.  It's soft, and not too thick and not too thin.  My son sleeps really well in it.	
- 1	I randomly got pink, which my 15 month old son doesn't really care about.  The spoon is really flat so it doesn't actually hold food very well; either the food won't get onto the spoon and I end up pushing it on with my finger or it just falls off once it is on.  The fork doesn't really spear food either, so I end up having to put food on the tines with my fingers.  Feeding toddlers is really messy, but these require a lot of messy work on my part to get the food into him!  Got some mini forks and spoons elsewhere that do the trick (meant for super-fancy table settings)	
- 1	I ordered this for our early teether thinking that maybe he could put it his mouth and would help his teeth and gums.  However upon recieving ..this thing is massive what baby could get this in their mouth?  I did not open and will be returning ASAP wast of money.	
1. 	My 3 year old is terrified of the dark. We tried every nightlight on the market it seemed and this is the only one we could all agree on. My daughter loves that she can turn it on herself from bed. I love that it automatically shuts off. We all love the adorable ladybug.	
1. 	My daughter is 6 mo and loves these. No funky smell, bpa free. Just dont kneel in them! The star has rounded edges. So far so good.	
1. 	I don't have a baby but I gave the bottles to a friend to use and give me feedback. Her response was good and she told me the best feature is the Micro-Channel Vent Technology that keeps air at the back of the bottle rather than mixing it with the milk.  She indicated the baby burped less and noticed there was no spit-up as there was using her other bottles.  She also liked the form of the bottle because it seemed easier for the baby to hold.I noticed others said the air vents leaked and were messy.  I asked her if she had any issues in this regard and she said she didn't.Playtex has always made a good product and it seems the bottles are certainly in that category.	
- 1	save your money. this brush scratched all my bottles and sprayed water all over me when i used it. i'm better off using a soft sponge and a spoon to use as a handle to swirl the sponge around	
1. 	This bib set is really good - waterproof but soft. For the price you get a lot of bibs! The only quibble I have is that you can't put them in the dryer, so I have to take extra time to fish them out of the wash before I transfer clothes to the dryer. I just lay them flat on top of the dryer and they do dry super fast. It's just a little hassle of a step to have to do.	
1. 	I breastfed and formula fed my baby for the first 5 weeks. My baby did not fuss at all when I offered her these type of nipples (compared to the breast).  I also tried the Dr. Brown's, Gerber and Evenflo and she did not like them at all.  I think because the base of the nipple was not as big as the Playtex nipples.  Anyhow, it is very convenient for at home use.  It is not convenient when you are out and about.  You still need to have some type of regular bottle.  I found that out the hard way.  Something in my diaper bag punctured the plastic liner and the formula got all over my brand new diaper bag.  I suggest the Playtex ventair system for a regular bottle because it has the same basic nipple shape. Overall I think Playtex has the best bottles and nipples.	
1. 	This is a great bath tub and fits perfectly in my bath tub inspite of its hugh size. Its has a lot of space for the baby to grow in. The only thing I was surprised is that Toyrus is selling this for $26.99 as the regular price which is definitely cheaper than what amazon is offering at.	
- 1	I love the features on this mirror, but unfortunately they don't work.  I ordered two of these because of all of the great reviews, so I'm really surprised at the low quality of this product. :(1- The mirror makes the baby look too far away, so I can't even see if his eyes are open or not.  It just shows a little pea head really far away!  Not too helpful.2- I returned one of these because the remote didn't work, and when I got the replacement, I accidentally dropped the remote on the floor once, and now it doesn't work either. Unfortunately the features don't work without it, either.3- The light is a great idea, but is nowhere near bright enough to light the baby. Unfortunately neither I or my husband are handy enough to replace the bulb with LED lights, like the other reviewer!Unfortunately, I have thrown away all the packaging so I can't return these products now, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.	
1. 	This pillow saved me! Well, honestly, I don't know anything different bc it was my first and only pregnancy... but I used it every night... you can survive without it... I did on vacation. But it was the best! I tended to have the long part behind me and I'd sort of halfway lean against it and I'd  have it between my legs... and under my head... AND I used a regular pillow for my head and a regular pillow under the stomach, which made it so I could lean back on the prego pillow. I am a side sleeper, but I also like to sleep on my back. So this pillow made that sort of possible. I wasn't on my back, but I was at least leaning against something so was better than nothing! You get tired of sleeping on your left side!!! Oh, also... when I was really far along, I started sleeping with it under my hip versus between my legs... that was when my hips hurt and I wanted to sleep on my back so bad to get the pressure off but you cant!	
1. 	My teething baby LOVES to chew on this.  I am not sure how much she is &#34;brushing&#34; but this is one of her favorite things to chew on.  It must feel good on her gums. The handle is also just the right size for her to hold onto.	
- 1	This is a really big waste of money. $9 for a piece of rough wood on a string? It doesn't look like a  bird from most angles, just a wavy shape. I recommend going with another teether.	
1. 	I love these monitors. Upon reading great reviews for baby monitors we chose to get this one. We have a basement and an upstairs so we wanted the 2 receiver deal. We have never had a problem with static over either of the channels and it's amazing how much you can hear over them. Turning them up all the way is a bit much, but we can hear our son breathing over the monitor. It truly does give you peace of mind.	
- 1	I purchased 2 of these bibs and really wanted to like them, but ending up returning them and keeping the Bibbity bibs instead.  The pocket on this bib is fantastic, and catches most of the dropped food.  However, I ended up returning these bibs because as other reviewers stated, the neck is too rough.  The material is a very hard plastic, which is fine for the bib, but not for the enclosure around the neck.  My son didn't seem to mind this bib around his neck, but I chose the softer material of the Bibbity bib instead.  This bib did stay in place around my son's neck, but when he pulled on the bib, I thought he was going to get a mark on his neck from the hard plastic.  This is an ok bib that could be great if the neck enclosure was changed.	
1. 	I hated the bulk of the car seat in a regular Graco stroller, and a friend recommended this. I considered buying the cheaper one (not made by Graco), but I read in reviews that the seats weren't always secure in that one and that it was harder to use.This keeps the seat secure in the stroller and has ample space below for storage. If I try to remove the car seat carrier without undoing the clips, I end up picking up the whole thing - carrier and stroller - because the connections are that secure. I'm guessing to woman who reviewed this saying that her child's seat fell out of it when she hit a bump is actually using the non-Graco model that's similar to this one. There is NO way, with proper use, that could happen with this product.I also like that my baby faces me in this and that she is closer to eye level. I hated putting the carrier on the floor where the only stimulation she saw was feet instead of being developmentally stimulated with faces to look at! I love this, and it's the only stroller I use for the first six months.	
1. 	The size seems right - my 22 month old son holds it, and is able to put it in his mouth, but the bristles seem to be spraying out a bit from the limited use already, so I'm not sure how much longer it'll hold up. Seems well designed though, with a thicker handle. It's good that you get two - I pretend to use one while he uses the other since he has to have exactly what I have. Ofcouse, he ends up holding both at the same time as well.	
- 1	I had the standard Munchkin bottle brush and loved it, so I thought I'd try this one since it holds/dispenses the soup. This brush is actually quite different from the non-dispensing one. This brush's middle is thicker, and the bristles are denser and more rigid, so I had a hard time getting this brush in and out of the bottles. Also, because of the rigidness of the bristles, I would get a spray of soapy water on my arms as I pulled the brush out of the bottle. I went back to the cheaper and more simple Muchkin bottle brush and am much happier.	
1. 	This high chair is great.  My son is a little over 6 months old and we've been using it for about a month now.  It attaches easily to your standard kitchen chair - but the straps are long enough to even attach to a bulkier dinning room chair if needed.  It is very stable.  My son is quite tall/big for his age and we've had no problems with stability at all.  It comes with a 5 point harness - but we only use the three.  I love how it can be adjusted to tilt to multiple levels.  It's also very easy to clean.  My son is a spitter as they call them and has a very slight gag reflex.  So if a little bit of cereal goes down the wrong pipe or he catches some extra air with a bite of squash then all it takes is a couple good coughs and all of dinner is up and all over the place!  Granted I can't wait until he's over this stage, but until then I need a chair that is easy to clean and this one is!  The cover and the straps come off very easily.  I just take it all over to the sink, hose it off and hang dry it on a drying rack.  I've never tried washing it in the machine.  This routine occurs a couple times a week and I can have it all apart and back on in under a minute.  I would definitely buy this again, especially since your child can use it through the toddler years.	
- 1	I don't understand why not more people are complaining about this, but the volume on this monitor is really low! I've seen some other reviews that are saying the same thing, but it seems most people aren't bothered by it!? Maybe we did something wrong and should have placed the baby unit differently or done something differently on the parent unit - but I tried all kind of different constellations and locations and it didn't seem to make a difference. We were without a monitor for a while until we got this one and during that time we had to listen out for our baby when we were in the living room at night. That worked ok, but I preferred using a monitor just to make sure we'd hear him even if the tv or dishwasher was on. But when we turned this one on it make NO difference at all! The noise we heard on our own, by listen out for him across the hallway was pretty much as loud as what came out of the baby monitor! I'm sure the reception and other features are great and it seems like a good quality monitor - but all that seems pretty pointless if you still can't hear your baby! I returned it for a Graco monitor that didn't have as many good reviews - but I can hear my baby on it!	
- 1	I did not realize there was a deluxe version of this product until I ordered this online. I already have, what I now know is the deluxe version, which I purchased at my local baby store. I loved it so much that I wanted another one for my husband's car. This potty is extremely flimsy. It's too low to the ground & cannot hold my daughter's weight. My daughter is 37inches & 32 lbs. Unless you have a super petite child I would not buy this. When my daughter sat on it the legs buckled (& yes I made sure they were clicked in).	
- 1	I should've listened to other reviews and passed on this purchase. The cup leaks so it isn't worth the money I spent.	
1. 	We started potty training my daughter at 2 and a half.  Right before her little brother was born.  We decided on the BABYBJORN potty chair because it seemed easy to clean, comfortable, and didn't have anything that would make her want to continue to use it as opposed the the real potty.We bought this when she was 2 just to get her used to it.  She sat on it while we were in the bathroom and read her books.  She was comfortable and nothing pinched her causing her to not want to use it. Eventually she got the idea and started using it herself.  At 2 and a half we ditched diapers and were exclusice to the potty training.She loved this chair because, gross, she loved to pick up the seat and dump the contents in the real potty.  Lucky for us there wasn't any huge mess.  We rinsed the chair out nightly with hot water and I cleaned her potty when we cleaned our bathroom, weekly.  She made sure I did as well.  She enjoyed using this potty, but when the time came to move exclusively to the big potty she wasn't sad to see this go.I'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase another one when we potty train my son.  Reason being I think I accidently tossed this in a made rage to declutter.Overall, cleans very easily, no weird places for poop or pee to hide, and she didn't become attached to it.	
1. 	Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!	
- 1	The first few weeks after my baby was born I was pumping and bottle feeding. I researched the Brestflow bottles and figured they would be the best breast/bottle feeding combination bottles. While the idea of the two part nipple sounded great it made a mess! When baby was done with the bottle and I went to disassemble lots of milk came leaking out- it had gotten trapped in the nipples. I worked too hard for it to end up in the kitchen sink. I stopped use of Breastflow bottles immediately. Another thing I didn't like was the flow- although it is stage 1 slow flow it seemed to come out too fast. We switched to Dr. Browns bottles using a premie nipple and found that it worked wonders compared to these! I wouldn't recommend Breastflow- I ended up using the bottles to store milk only.	
1. 	We were trying to transition our daughter to sippy cups and we were having some difficulty.  We were able to get her to start using the soft spout cups for water, but milk she would still only take from a bottle.  Maybe it was just time, or maybe there was something to these cups, but now she drinks milk solely out of these.Pros:- They are a nice size for little hands to manage.  Now at 16 months she is able to use the largerGerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Varyones as well, but when we first started transitioning, the bigger ones were too awkward for her to maneuver.- It's nice that the lids and valves are all interchangeable between the 7 and 10 ounce models. Organization has not been our strong suit since the baby came, so it's nice not to have to worry about finding the right one.- Everything cleans easy in the dishwasher, we just place the valves in thisMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Varyand have had no problems.- They have lived up to their spill proof name, as well as proven rather sturdy.  My daughter still likes to toss these to the floor, though with less regularity at least.  Despite all the impact to the hardwood floors, they have held up to the abuse and continue to not leak or spill.- The cups have little ounce markers on the side so you know how much liquid you put in the cup and/or was consumed.We liked these so much, we bought two more sets of them.	
1. 	I love the playtex dropins system.  Always just need to make sure that I have enough liners.The pricing is good (it's worth 4 cents to me to not have to wash a bottle!).  And the product is secure.Very very occasionally it leaks if I put it in carelessly and didn't make sure the liner was solid and not a bit crumpled.  But that's my fault.  Overall, no complaints.  Even the pricing is fair.	
- 1	They stain horribly from baby food. I had to throw away 4 of the lighter colored bibs after my daughter used it while eating green bean/pea puree. I threw them in the wash and it came out looking like there was mold all over it. No, it wasn't mold but all the green specs of food did not come off and it just looked gross and unattractive. I also didn't like the fact that it makes crinkly noises every time you touch it. This is just a terry cloth bib with a waterproof lining inside. There is nothing great or special about it. I give it 2 stars because the waterproof lining does work. I definitely prefer the larger Aden + Anais muslin bibs over these!	
1. 	I love these bibs. Not only do they look cute (and not cheap like other soft bibs like this) but they work so well. The food catcher is easy to clean because it's a scoop as opposed to an enclosed pocket. The adjustable and easy snap on neck part is nice too as opposed to velcro. It's very durable and probably will last to use for my next baby. But they're not too expensive so might just buy new one anyways.	
- 1	This grinds food fine EXCEPT for the huge space between the top of the plunger and the blade - it wastes a ton of food.  I've used others that don't do this and cost less.	
- 1	I liked this product because it's a good rubbery material to chew on, but it only fit on the sides of our crib as the front bar is much wider. I had actually gotten these & put them on when my daughter was in the crib, but after being on a few months, they almost looked kind of liquidy underneath and when I went to remove them, they removed some of the wood varnish as well, so I left them on to look better. My daughter actually never did bite on the crib railings but my son does (3yrs later) and prefers chewing on the front bar best, of course. At least the side bars they fit on will not be used when it's converted to a full size bed, but there will still be those teeth marks on the bed footer. Oh well, it's kind of cute. I plan to use one of those wood color markers to cover the teeth marks if it really bothers me.	
1. 	Like it a lot. They are great made material. I change this silicone nipples for 4 months. Only works for evenflo bottles. Highly recommend.	
- 1	My baby doesn't really like this. he shows no interest in the toys. the mat is too thin and so I have to put the baby gym on a thick blanket so that it wont be too hard when my baby lies on it. the music is also really annoying	
- 1	I have the Fisher Price Sit and Stand Pull up Ball Blast playzone.  These balls are way too big for it!!!!  I'm not sure if the other reviewers have a newer model or something, but these don't fit my model. I had to return them for this reason.  These must work for some other similar Fish price product, but not for what it's described as.	
- 1	I guess when they say &#34;colors may vary&#34; they don't consider the boy/girl factor. I have a boy, and would have been happy with any other color than pink, but that's what I got. Sending them back, probably not going to order another.	
1. 	Can't say enough good about this product - best thing I ever bought!  Easy to take to relatives or a restaurant.	
- 1	First off, I love the Tilty cups and so does my 8 month old. However, these lids just don't work very well. I'm not sure if they are intended to go over the original sippy lid or replace it, but either way doesn't make sense. If they replace the lid, you have to find a place for the sippy lid to go while you travel, which is a pain. Plus then they have the awkward sippy top sticking out still. If it goes over the sippy lid, it doesn't seal at all and pops off all the time. Either way, the little tab is perfect for getting caught on things and pulling off. This sort of works to just keep the sippy spout clean, but serves no purpose as far as containing liquid if you want to put the sippy in a diaper bag. I really hope they would redesign this lid!	
1. 	soft and durable!! i can only recommend it if you got the summer changing pad :) i wash it 2-3 times a week (changing accidents all the time, lol) and it is holding up.	
1. 	We have tried so many different sleeping bags but have found the Halo SleepSack to be the best. Bub sleeps like a dream all year round in these.	
- 1	I am a professional nanny of about 10 years and I have come to view swaddling as one of the best baby care tricks you can ever use. I have NEVER dealt with a baby that did not sleep better when swaddled. There have been many babies who strongly fought the swaddling process if they were not used to it but after a few times it worked like a charm to keep them alseep. I have cared for dozens of babies including several sets of twins and triplets and truly, I could not have survived if I could not swaddle. Many parents told me that their baby did not like to be swaddled because they would always get out of the blanket within a few minutes. I always tell them that just because the baby gets out does not mean that they dont like it. You just have to find the right products to help keep the baby wrapped up tight. I have found that the Swaddle me does not do the job very well for most babies, but the Miracle Blanket really does! I love the miracle blanket, I have only found one baby who could get himself out of it and he usually only removed one arm so it did not wake him up. It is pricey but very very worth it! The Miracle Blanket will change the way your baby sleeps for the better so it is worth the money. The Swaddle me just cant get the job done, or at least not as well so I never recommend it to any parent.	
1. 	My wife and I chose this Playtex feeding system for our first child.  We had some standard bottles, also.  We found that the Playtex system avoided the baby ingesting a lot of air when sucking.  Therefore the baby got more nutrition and we had to do less burping.  I highly recommend this system as a baby shower gift.Be careful putting these plastic bottles in a bottle warmer and dishwasher with a drying coil.Gunner  March,2012	
1. 	In what ended up being one of the best decisions we made in terms of product purchases since becoming parents, my wife and I discovered the glory of the HALO SleepSacks when we bought the newborn sized ones with the built in velcro swaddle. The swaddlers sleepsacks took the headache, hassle, and difficulty out of swaddling. We were sold and have been buying SleepSack products in larger and larger sizes as our son grows up.He has slept in a HALO SleepSack product every single cool or cold night since the day he was born. They are extremely high quality, they hold up perfectly wash after wash. He looks comfortable and sleeps soundly while wearing this sleepsack. We have this micro-fleece version for the coldest nights, and the thinner cotton versions for the more mild nights. The design of these SleepSacks is incredible. The SleepSacks zip from the top on down, keeping the zipper at the bottom of the SleepSack where your child cannot easily find it and unzip it, and it also won't be a bother for children who sleep on their stomachs. And it's nice knowing that this product is much safer and provides way more peace of mind than putting a blanket in the crib.This particular one now marks the sixth HALO product we have purchased in the first 14 months of our sons life. We will no doubt be purchasing the larger sizes as he grows, and are sold for life.	
- 1	This rocker is great as it has different recline positions. However, it is noisy. When my son is asleep and he moves, it makes creaking noises that wakes him up, which is a problem for me when I'm trying to get things done around the house as he naps. I have to stop and put him back to sleep.	
- 1	my daughter would get hot in the carseat and my wife and i needed something to cool her down when we drove her home from daycare.we thought this product would help, but it did nothing. it doesn't cool the seat down at all. she was still sweaty. we kept it there hoping for some improvement on temperature, but nothing happened.	
1. 	Works great. Exactly what I needed to bring to work for longer shifts away from baby. I know some people do have problems pumping, but I never have and it worked great for me.	
1. 	My triplets were born at 33 weeks and from the beginning they did great.  Except that the biggest (4 lbs 9 oz) had reflux almost after every feeding.  It was so bad that when it happened he would scare himself and would not be able to go back to sleep without being held and rocked.When you have to feed 3 babies every 3 hours, holding a baby and rocking him back to sleep, cuts down on your sleep.We bought the Inclined to Sleep.  During the first night, after his first two feedings he was reflux free and at his last night time feeding he had a minimal episode, which he quickly returned to sleep afterwards.We did cover the head area with a cloth to catch any spit up.  He did slide down after having an episode of reflux.  When babies get reflux it hurts.  Babies arch their backs to try to get away from the pain and that is usually when they start to slide down the wedge.  I never have any concerns with my baby sliding down and pressing his nose against the side barriers because I am right there to clean him up.  .I would highly recommend this product to parents that have babies with reflux.  It may not prevent your baby from having reflux but it does cut down on the episodes and brings comfort to your baby.	
1. 	I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this monitor!!  It really picks up the tiniest sounds - as I sit here writing this, I have the monitor volume turned down to half-strength, and I can hear the clock ticking in the nursery (which is on the opposite side of the room from the receiver and is not that loud in person).  The range is awesome - I was able to walk across the street and sit inside my neighbor's house, and I still had half the bars on signal strength and could still hear the clock clearly.The lights are really convenient because if I am watching a movie and have the monitor turned down (to avoid hearing the ticking clock) I can have a clear visual on whether my daughter is making noise in her nursery.  The lights are as sensitive as the sound, but are not too harsh that they light up a whole room at night.The battery life is great, and it beeps when the battery gets low to remind you to plug it in.The only problem I have had with it is that if you have the monitor in your hand and you walk too close to the receiver, it makes a terrible noise (due to interference of the signal) - but since there are 2 receivers, and the volume and sensitivity are so incredible, it is easy to avoid.  We keep one upstairs and one downstairs and it works perfect.  I would recommend this to ANY new mom - there is no need for a video monitor (you'll never watch it, or you'll spend WAAAAY too much time watching it) - this gives you the visual you want with the lights, and the sensitivity that you need to make sure your baby is safe and sound.	
- 1	This thing rattled from the moment I moved the car, even if leaving the driveway at 2 mph.  Drove me crazy.  Found this is a common problem when I searched the reviews for 'shakes' and synonyms like 'vibrate', 'rattle', 'wobble', etc.  Also heard that the mirror can pop out of the ball-bearing joint in a crash.  I returned mine.  Same issue with the similar Britax model.	
1. 	The best drool-catchers I've found.  Soft, absorbent, chew-able (Important to the wearer.  I asked.), and with 10 I got one for every outfit and a backup.  They wash up nicely and don't get weird curly edges.	
- 1	I bought this because of the reviews and the name.  I had never seen it in person and if I had I would have never bought it.  I have a boy and the pee shield is very low.  When we first bought it he refused to use it so we just hung onto it. He's had a set back with potty training and I decided to take it out one more try to give it a try.  He used it.  He peed. All. Over. The. Floor.  Luckily I was standing right there to help him, how shall I say-direct-him where he need to go.  But it was too late, he peed down the front of the seat right where I needed to pick it up which mean I either clean it before I empty as well as after I empty it or I get pee on my hand.This seat doesn't have the high seat like the other one does but I think all that will do is cause them to lean back and have a bigger chance of accidents.The non-skid bottom is nice but I don't know of any potty chairs that don't have them.  Not having a lid is a good-bad thing.  We have an extremely small bathroom which means we also need a stool for him to reach the sink, if it had a lid it would take care of having the extra item in the small space.  However, having a lid is just one more step a child has to do when they are bouncing around trying not to go.The potty seat came in an unsealed, plain plastic bag in a the Amazon box only, it did not come in the Babybjorn potty chair box.  I couldn't help but wonder if I received a returned item.	
1. 	Initially, we had purchased the Munchkin 6-pack Soft Tipped Infant Spoons and loved them. Once my kiddo got up to three meals a day, we were going through the spoons so fast we were constantly running out. For the same price as the Munchkin spoons, we got 16 of these! They aren't as pretty or quite as sturdy, but they are great. These are smaller so they fit better in his little hand. The colors are wonderful. And with the amount that you get, if you lose one or two, it's no great loss. If we'd started with these, we'd have been fully stocked from the start!	
1. 	I'm so happy that these medela parts came so quick. They have made my constant pumping a little less busy.	
- 1	I thought this would be a nice teether for my three-month-old, since her mouth is too small for most teething aids. Wish I had looked at it in person first - it really is nothing more than an organically-sourced dog toy. The thing even smells like a dog toy, not something I would want in my mouth, let alone my daughter's. The squeaker is loud, not soothing at all, and the skin has an unpleasant texture, like the inside of a powdered latex glove. I would recommend this to the owner of a small dog, but not to a parent.	
- 1	I gave this tub two stars based on my baby, who is long and heavy. He was born at 8 lbs 3 oz and 21 inches, and by the time his umbilical cord stump fell off and he could use the bathtub, he was two weeks old and 9 lbs 6 oz... Thus, we couldn't really make use of the newborn 'net'.When we put his bum in the tub, we used the little seat (which is not removable), and most of his body was out of the water, so he got cold very quickly if we weren't constantly pouring water over him. He was too tall, so constantly slid sideways and his head would hit the side of the tub from sliding so much.  He was visibly unhappy and not really enjoying bathtime.  We also couldn't sit him in the bottom of the tub, as shown in one of the pictures on this page, because he was a newborn with little head control and was unable to sit up.The toys that come along with the tub are great, though.We preferred this tub instead, because our baby sat down lower and was actually in the water and could splash his feet around. The little bum support is also removable for when he's older, and works better for our long baby.  (It's also cheaper).Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale Tub	
- 1	I love the idea of these sun shades, but because of how they are twisted and folded to fit in the package, I could not get them flat enough to stick to the window. I put them under full diaper boxes for more than a month to try to flatten them, and they still would not lay flat. The cling side would stick to the window on the left side (for example), but the frame was so twisted that the right side was not against the window.It is cold here, but I also tried on a day above freezing and that didn't make any difference. I don't think it was too cold for the plastic cling side. The problem was the bend in the frame. I am returning these and trying a similar one that has a suction cup in the middle. Hopefully then a frame that is a little bent won't really matter.	
1. 	I love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. They fit great and arrived in record time.	
- 1	This toy is completely useless. The fish have magnets on the top that weight them down and they flip over so they won't connect with the fishing pole. Not much else to say. It doesn't work, plain and simple. I don't understand how this has so many positive ratings or how it even passed testing and went on the market.	
1. 	The Sleep Sheep is now a necessity for sleep at our house.  The soothing sounds that the sheep produces effectively elliminates the noises that would potentially wake our baby allowing us to carry on normal routine household tasks while our baby sleeps.	
- 1	I bought these for my teething toddler twins in the hopes that they would give them more relief than a regular pacifier. Saying they didn't like them would be an understatement. They literally screech and chuck these at the walls with the force of a major league pitcher. Even if there is no other pacifier in a five mile vicinity, they hate these on sight and refuse to even touch them. My two love pacifiers, if you can't already tell. These are not pacifiers. Ah well. Hey, I tried.	
1. 	and was afraid this wouldn't work with the model I had. After some online research I was fairly confident it would and am happy to say it does. It is very different from the original base, but I actually think it is better. Good value for the price.	
- 1	I agree that it came incredibly creased, but it didn't matter because it was too small anyway. My toddler wears a 2T/3T hat.	
1. 	I like the look and feel of this gate and the concept that it's a hands-free design for opening, because let's face it--a gate that requires that you use your hands to open is worthless for a mom holding a baby.  It seems to be a pretty solid construction, and for a tension gate, it actually holds pretty well.  Not only does this gate confine pets and babies/toddlers/little kids, it seems to be adult-proof, too.  Every single adult that has come into my house has hesitated at this gate because they couldn't figure it out.  HA!There are definitely some downsides to it, but it has been serving us well as a dog and baby gate for close to two years now.Pros:- Hands-free opening- Clean, simple, solid design- Ability to add extenders which work great for wide hallways (I use one on each side of the gate)- Tension-mount system so it's movable and you don't have to put holes in your walls.Cons:- Beware if you have painted your walls recently (Recent for us was maybe a few months prior).  The rubber grip pads just ripped the paint right off when I released the tension in the holding rods.  I'm not sure if the paint on our walls is cheap or if it's because there are just too many layers of paint or what, but I ripped a large chunk out of the wall upon moving the gate.  So yeah, having to patch that sort of defeated the purpose of avoiding a gate that required mounting hardware.- Pedal can get stuck and become temperamental.  I think this also causes problems with closing.  You should be able to close this easily by just pushing the gate back, but it always sticks in one of the directions and requires more care to close it properly.- I don't know how, but my now almost 21 month-old has managed to open this gate maybe 10 times by now.  She refuses to tell me how and every time I try to watch her try, she acts all helpless and can't open it.  So yeah, she's apparently a step ahead of all our visiting adults who can't open this thing.Despite the fact that she can open it from time to time, I still like this gate and it has really been an important feature in our home.  Even before she was crawling or walking, it was perfect for keeping our two big dogs confined to one side of the house.  If I had to purchase a replacement gate, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these.	
1. 	This is a good swing, I like the two different swinging modes, front to back and side to side.  The only problem I had was that the music quit working after 2 weeks.  I did not want to disassemble the whole thing and lug it back to the store and I did not want to ship it back to FP and wait for 3-6 weeks for a replacement.  We didn't need the music anyway, so we just used the other features, my son is now 8 months old and is still under the weight limit and he enjoys the swing once in awhile, though now that he is mobile, he wants to be on the floor, crawling around.  My son was quite fussy and the swing often helped to soothe him, a few nights he actually slept in it for 5 hours straight, if he took him out he woke up and cried and cried!	
1. 	I received this item through Amazon Vine, and while it is a very cool, well made item, it just didn't fit our nine month old quite right.  The bar that goes across is as such that anytime she'd sit up even a little, the plastic items on the plastic bar would hit her in the face.  When we took the bar off, she would lean as far forward as she could and have the thing about tipping forward.  For the record, I think it's designed so that it can't tip all the way forward, but it had us nervous nonetheless.If she were a little younger and not yet sitting up and wanting to walk, I think it would be great match for us.  Or, if she were a little older and content to sit in it as a rocker, it also would have been great.  For us, though, because she's pulling up, she's not really happy in it in either the recliner or the rocker stage.That being said, it was a simple item to put together, very pleasing to the eye, and I thought it was well made.  The transition from infant to toddler rocker is easy.  My only complaint is the bar that, for my daughter, was right in line with her head when she tried to sit up.  Again, though, this is more a circumstance of her particular growth stage than anything.	
- 1	This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature.  In a tub full of ~100 degree water, he consistently read 72-74 degrees.  Tried resetting, no luck.  If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp, I could have really scalded my kids.  Cute, but unsafe, unsafe, unsafe.  Returning it immediately.	
- 1	Tne keyboard part didn't last but a few weeks. It stopped working so we thought it was the batteries. We replaced them but still didn't work. We took it apart only to find the insides completely covered it spit up and drool. They definitely didn't take this into account when making this. Plus the seat itself is not easy to keep clean. I also don't like the fact that the back wheels are fixed. It makes it hard for baby to maneuver. I was really hoping for a better item with all the good reviews.	
1. 	We got this tub as a hand me down when our baby was born, but due to all the craziness that goes along with having a newborn and all the hand me downs that we received and had to sift through, we didn't start using this tub until after baby was a month old.  So we never used the hammock/sling that came with it.What I love about the tub is that it fits perfectly in our kitchen sink which is the perfect height for washing baby standing up.  I've always seen others wash their babies in a tub on the floor or in the bathtub.  I've tried that, and bending over or even sitting on a little stool to do so was cumbersome and not very comfortable at all.  So far so good. I don't really have any complaints about the tub. We'll see how it goes as baby grows.  We're still using the reclining infant side for our 3 month old.	
1. 	i always scared to use this product. but, since my baby is 21 month old, she will be able to release any extra gas from all the air of this bottle liner. i've seen younger babies use this. i'm concern for colic. great for travels and yes the measurement is not accurate.	
1. 	I bought this as a transition between crib and bed for our grandsonWe still have not used it yet, but the time is coming soon. My grandsonDid try it and felt it was great.	
1. 	such a space saver for the cabinet and everything is so much easier to reach now  this is my 2nd organizer	
1. 	This bib has been great for my messy eater. It catches more food than other pocket bibs and I can throw it in the dishwasher at the end of the day.	
1. 	This was the best thing I received for my shower.  First of all, I used it immediately on myself after coming home from the hospital.  I used it to sit on to take the pressure off of my stitched area.  I could sit on the couch, in the bed and at the kitchen table without needing any medication..THANKS BOPPY!!As for my son, I use it for him to sleep on while I'm doing housework.  I prop it on the couch and lay him in the middle on his side, which adjusts to the perfect size for him.  He sleeps like a BABY!Next, I use it when I feed him.  I breastfed and went to bottles later.  It was/is perfect for both.I use it to lay him it after he eats so I can talk to him and he can explore the world.I use it sometimes when he is doing tummy time.I use it for my nieces so they can hold him without having to wear their arms down since they are only 5 and 7.I have several more, but those are the main points.  I would buy it over and over again if anything ever happened to my Boppy.Also, I wash the slip cover many times, and it is standing strong.  I have only had to wash the pillow a few times, but it still looks brand new.BOPPY GETS MY CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT VOTE...A+++++++++++++***UPDATE...It also helped with my son sitting up.  I would place it around him so he wouldn't get hurt if he would fall over.  It keeps going and going and going...	
- 1	November 25, 2011 update:I have dropped my review from the original 5-star last January, to today's 2-star.  After 10 months of use, things about the monitor are horribly wrong.  First, the battery included with the monitor quit on us about 4 months ago.  Won't hold a charge anymore.  The instruction manual said to contact Motorola for replacement.  So I did.  THE BATTERY IS UNAVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  So Motorola sells a baby monitor with a rechargeable, replaceable battery but they no longer carry the actual battery.  I even Googled the battery and I can't find even a 3rd Party selling it.Second, I commented originally that the parents' monitor needed a larger footprint.  This has become such a annoyance.  Even in the light, even with us awake, the monitor is nearly impossible to stand.  It invariably will back onto its front or back.  It is nearly impossible to stand upright.Why still 2-stars instead of one?  While it has to remain plugged in, the monitor is an awesome monitor.  Clear, no snaps or pops.  We get incredible range within our home.  It still is very handy and used daily.January 2011 reviewI was surprised to find Motorola making a monitor.  You just don't see them in stores.  But knowing Motorola's rep with regards to handheld radios, I figured if Motorola was making a monitor, it must be pretty good.  It is.  We get good distance with the unit and more importantly get loud operation with no annoying blinky lights going off in the master bedroom as we sleep.Good looking monitor too.  My only drawback and it is minor, is that the parents' monitor needs a larger footprint.  It is a very tall unit for the size of its base.	
1. 	I used the diaper dekor 8 yrs ago with my first daughter and purchased it again with my new little girl and it's just gotten better. They've made improvements to make it easier to use and very clean.  Would highly recommend.  Keeps the mess and the smell where it belongs.	
1. 	Easy to install and works great for the price. Keeps my dogs at bay and my baby safe. I hate the bar on the bottom though and the opening is pretty skinny.	
1. 	I bought this for our granddaughter for napping and for when we are visiting overnight elsewhere.  She likes it so far.  Very easy setup and just her size.  She is just turning two, but it should work for at least a couple of years.  I also bought a Disney Nap Mat that works well with it for nap time.	
- 1	I really tried with these bottles but my daughter didn't like them at all. They didn't have good flow and she was having gas issues. For the first trainer cups, I use the Pampers bottles and she really took to those well.	
1. 	We got this carrier as a shower gift, and we really like it. I have to agree with the other reviews that it's a little tricky to get baby in and out - but you get what you paid for. We thought about buying the Baby Bjorn, but I think it's too expensive for a carrier that we won't use that much anyways. So we have the Cozy Rider and also the EuroRider(also by Infantino), that is much similar with the Baby Bjorn and have a much better system for getting baby in and out - we can do it without waking the baby, and cost half of the Bjorn.So if you plan on having the carrier for occasional use only, I recommend the Cozy Rider. I used it in supermarkets, the mall, and at home too, when my baby was fussy and wanted to cuddle all the time. It does start hurting your back after a while(30-40 minutes or so), but it didn't bother me that much. The EuroRider has more padding, which helps a lot, but cost twice as much as the CozyRider(we bought it gently used though!!)So, bottom line, this is a great carrier for its price - easy to adjust and our baby loves it. If you plan on hiking or wearing it for longer periods of time, you might want to look into a carrier with more padding(like the Euro Rider or Baby Bjorn). If not, this one will do just fine!!! I recomend it.	
- 1	I bought this unit with high hopes.  I did a lot of looking and research and thought this was a reasonable choice.  Since I have had the unit it has gone through three power supplies.  The company will send out a new supply but they are located in California while I am on the East coast, so it takes a few days to get somebody from the company to talk to you, then a couple of days for them to ship the item, then a week or so traveling through the mail.  So for almost two weeks you are stuck without the unit and not able to use it!  This has happened three times now.  I thought I was being smart and actually purchased a back up power supply for the next time.  Well the next time happened last night, so I plugged in my back up supply and it doesn't work.  So now I'm thinking maybe this time it's the unit itself that has stopped working.  Unless I got a bad power supply when I ordered the back up.  I guess I should have checked it out and not assumed anything.  So now I'm waiting for them to call me back and start this entire process over again but in the meantime I don't have a working monitor for my daughter.  I would look at another company.  I know as soon as I can afford to buy another one I will be moving on to one of the other ones.	
- 1	This thing is enormous!! Way too big for my 9 month old to get in her mouth. Disappointed!	
- 1	I bought this because it was supposed to work with the pack and play. But it doesn't! It's too big and it makes the fitted sheet on top super bulky! Don't waste your money on this!	
1. 	I coupled this with the summer infant changing pad and baby is much more comfy. He used to be crankier with the other stiffer folding change pad and I decided to get the contoured pad with this plush cover. Baby likes it. I like it, it is very very soft and it seems soothing to him when he is on it bare skinned too. I bought this in blue and it is a darker blue than pictured but I don't mind that. So far it has not fell apart in the laundry as well which is good. The material is thick enough and feels sturdy enough. The elastics holds the cover well onto the changing pad and fits as the picture shows on a 2 sided changing pad.  BTW this one is cheaper than many of the others I've seen but feels and performs just as well if not better.	
1. 	We have made batches and batches of baby food using these trays.  The cubes are about 1 oz each so it makes feeding (and figuring out how much baby eats) really easy.  The lids are very nice and seal well.  We would always freeze the food in the trays and then pop the cubes out into freezer gallon bags for storage.  The trays do go through the dishwasher just fine.  Hand washing works, but the trays sometimes will still smell like the food that was in it, especially if it is a strong smelling food like parsnips.  But if the trays go through the dishwasher they come out perfectly clean and smelling fresh.  Regular ice cube trays work just as well, but the lids that come with these are a nice feature.	
- 1	Well when I placed the order I did not realize that these were an older version of SG wipes... Ugh! These are horrible. They are dry, thin, not very absorbent and seem to have a rough texture. I have tried the new ones when I ran out of the Honest Co. wipes that are home delivered. The NEW SG wipes were good. These old SG wipes I ordered from Amazon were cheaper than Honest Co. for just wipes. Hence, why I bought these in bulk as my back up (remember, not knowing they were different than what I bought last week at my grocery store). Bad idea. I like the Honest Co. wipes better, and will just order more of them. These are so harsh, I may just donate these.	
- 1	If your looking for a good teething ring/keys this is definitely not the one! It's too bulky and hard for little hands to get the 'key part' into his mouth. maybe for an older baby but I still think it sucks.  Also,I just read a few reviews that this product is for children OVER 3 YEARS old (still teething??) & could pose choking hazard!?  My 5 month old son received a cheap dollar store set of keys on a ring that are much smaller and plain and he prefers them to these. I would not recommend to anyone or at least with younger teething baby...	
- 1	IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP, BUT I HATE THAT IT DOESN'T FOLD SO MUCH AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HUGE BULKY THING ON YOUR HOUSE. I ALSO HATE THE FACT THAT IT DOESN'T STAND WHEN FOLDED. I REGRET HAVENG BOUGHT IT.	
1. 	My baby plays with this toy often. He is attracted to the mirrors inside the ball and the happy face. It's a great toy to develop his hand eye coordination. There are many ways for him to hold it, and use his hands to spin the happy face inside. Negative reviews complain the ball doesn't spin or roll. It is the middle piece that spins, and you can roll the ball if you throw it hard enough, or it will roll a little bit with normal play. I liked that it didn't roll too far when my son was younger, because he wasn't able to crawl after a ball, but had fun with toys that moved around a bit.	
1. 	It fits in even the smallest bottles (medela breast milk storage bottles) and seems to get every inch! My absolute favorite bottle brush!	
1. 	Each time i open and have a warm wipe in between my hands, i feel better and glad or this purchase. Before having it, my daugther was shaking when i cleaned her with a cold one. Now, we r enjoying to change diapers	
- 1	Disgusting.  The pillow arrived and I opened it to air it out b/c it is a bit stinky.  I am so glad I took the pillowcase off of it because then I saw a dead SPIDER inside the sheer fabric that is sewn around the foam.  A spider was sewn into the pillow and it died there.This pillow is MADE IN CHINA - so that was a dead Chinese spider that travelled all the way to Minnesota to freak me out.This pillow is being sent back unused and hopefully they don't try to sell it to someone else.As for the pillow itself, the foam is a bit firmer than I expected but the thickness does seem right for a toddler.  I was looking forward to letting my little guy sleep on it this weekend (after the chemical smell aired out for a couple days) - but not after I discovered the spider sewn into the pillow.	
- 1	PROS1. Easy to assemble. I just had to put together the arm rests, back rest, and cusions.2. The arm rest cushions. They actually snap on to the seat on the bottom part, keeping things (or baby) from dropping through. Moreover, there are handy little pockets on the outsides of the arm cushions.3. It's cheap and comes with the ottoman.CONS1. The paint on the wood is sparse in some spots and, even worse, had some scratches on the wood itself, up on the top of the back rest. Thankfully, the cushion covers it, and the other paint issues aren't too noticeable since they are toward the bottom of the glider.2. Uncomfortable! When I fall asleep in this, I wake up not being able to feel my arms. Also the chair area is kind of small and makes it so that I have to sit up stiffly with my back straight. I don't usually notice it until I'm getting off the chair and realize that my back is a little sore.3. The arm rest is too short. My baby has the habit of leaning back for a stretch after she is done nursing, and on this glider, her head dropped off the end!04. The cushions are very squeaky, kind of like the hinge of a door that needs to be oiled. The back cushion as well as the seat cushion will make these loud squeaks with any amount of movement. Even after three months of use, they are just as bad and have become more and more annoying. And the sound is loud enough to wake my baby up when I want to leave the room. Terrible!I would definitely rather buy a used Dutailier on Craigslist than buy this again.	
- 1	Standard round toilet, nothing fancy. Even had the non skid mat that another reviewer recommended. Less than a minute after install and my toddler had the whole device off the toilet. Repeat install, trying every spacing with spacers and different positions within the allotted pie space in instructions. Same results. Wait for hubby to come home. Repeat. Luckily Amazon has a great return policy. Ordered the one that attached to tank and has an arm that comes down to seat lid. Toilet stays closed now. Fun to watch visitors try to open.	
- 1	This crib is awful.  The only good thing about it is that it is so small and lightweight.  Here is why I hate it1. It is so hard to set up.  You have to shove these tight bungee cord things into the legs each time.  It takes two peole at least a half hour and leaves you sweating.  Not cool when you have a screaming baby in a hotel room at midnight!2.  The matress is uncomfortable and my baby hated it.  It is so thin!3.  It is hard to take down and you can't stuff it back into that little bag correctly.4.  The bag it comes in is cheap, mine tore after two uses.If you want something almost as small and light but 10000 times better go for the baby born travel crib!	
- 1	Although the bug is cute, my daughter really wasn't into it. She started out with the Eric Carle ladybug that is similar overall, but she preferred the ladybug to the bug. My daughter from 1 month now to 9 months, just chucks this toy aside in preference for more interesting toys.	
1. 	We use one of these everyday for naptime. My big boy is 17 months and this fits him perfectly and probably will for a few more months.	
1. 	Our son loves this bath tub! I love that it is his own inflatable tub within our tub. Makes me feel like he is a lot safer bathing.The duck is super cute and fun for him to play in.	
1. 	These are a great, inexpensive solution to oven knob safety proofing.Pros:-Takes seconds to install-Easy to use-  pinch to open, use knob, and easy shut-Nice  looking- clear plastic allows you to see the actual knobs and isn't a huge eyesoreCons:-The  knobs on our oven are pretty close together so the covers are hard to control	
- 1	This is a nice idea but like anything thats not washable it gets nasty after awhile. Also does not fit my tub but we are in germany so that may be why.	
- 1	Does not stay on my toilet very well and it is easy to pull off.  My son is able to open the toilet still.	
1. 	I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars b/c it's kind of bulky with everything I need in all of its available products. But, we still like it!	
1. 	These are the only ones I will use - absolutely.  I would pay twice the cost of these w/o a doubt!  They're the perfect size, thin, contoured, absorbant, and the lanolin is comfortable.  I would recommend these to every breastfeeding/pumping mom out there! I only wish they came in a larger quantity and were a part of the subscribe and save program.	
1. 	Works great in locking the kitchen cabinets. Our 13 month old kept trying to open them for couple of days after I installed them and now has just given up :). I had to use a handheld drill to make holes in the wood before inserting the screws.	
1. 	My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep.  This is a very small wedge, but I don't think you'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly.  She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed.  When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor, this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring.  She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout.  Sometimes it is under her belly.  Sometimes it is wedged into her back.  Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it.  We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more, so I think I got my money's worth out of this.  I'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA:  Found another use for the pillow.  It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars!  Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard, but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that.	
1. 	Baby #4 is due in a few weeks and we just assembled this today.I think my biggest concern (ordering site unseen) was the scattered reviews that said a normal mattress didn't fit the crib.  I have a Sealy baby mattress (probably really Kolcraft) - nothing fancy - and it fits just fine so that worry has been laid to rest.  Maybe some people had wonky cribs or wonky mattresses, I don't know.My other big concern was how solid is the crib.  I had a crib collapse on one of my daughters - luckily she was not hurt, but she was stuck by her neck which is not something I ever want to experience again.  What happened with that crib was one of the bolt plugs that the mattress support screws into popped out of the wood.  It was a drop side crib, but not exactly a drop side issue.  Still, I am sure the extra wiggle of a drop side crib added to the plug working lose.  For the record - I think drop sides CAN be made safely.  The problem is nowadays things are being made CHEAPLY - which is the real issue.  This crib is not a drop side, so it is super solid to begin with.  Then at each corner of the mattress, rather than a single bolt plug (sorry, I don't know the wood working term but you know it if you see it!) is a strip of metal with 4 holes, held in with 3 screws - which seems MUCH more secure to me than one single bolt plug.  This crib DOES NOT move when you shake it.I'm a little concerned about the gap between the two top rails that some have mentioned their kid getting stuck in.  Truth to tell we'd have gone with Kalani to skip that issue if Kalani was available in natural - but everything else we own is natural and I really wanted natural  so I am going to hope that is not a problem for is - or if it is it is something the child does once and learns not to do again.  Time will tell.  There are covers you can tie on to prevent this if needed.The wood IS on the softer side - I am hoping having it in natural will make scratches less apparent.  We live in an 80+ year old house, so I'm used to things having character.  None of my other kids have been crib chewers so I am not too concerned about that being a problem - if it is there are covers you can buy (the same ones to prevent the arm wedging).I love that it comes WITH a real toddler bar - none of this take a side off and call it a toddler bed when it's not, or having to order the toddler bar as an extra piece for a LOT of money.  That's just baloney.  LOVE that this includes it.OK all that said.  It's gorgeous.  It went together fairly easily (though I was surprised at how many pieces it came in - but I managed to get it all together myself except for the mattress support, even 9 months pregnant with 3 kids under foot).  The price is nice.  It's SOLID.  There is one thing I hate about it, though.  The curvey fronts make it very hard to side-car against an adult bed, which was my plan with this crib.  There is a BIG gap.  I don't like this at all.  So it's possible for the first year we might put one of my twins in this crib in toddler mode, and sidecar her current crib to our bed - or I might devise some sort of sling to go between this crib and our bed to close the gap (would also prevent the crib from sliding away - we have hardwood floors and the crib moves very easily).  I'm not annoyed enough by the problem to pack the crib back up and ship it back, but I wish I had gotten a crib with a flat front.  If you're planning to side-car, keep looking.  If you want a gorgeous solid crib and don't care so much about that, this one should do nicely.But stick with natural, since it scratches somewhat easily.  And because natural looks nicest anyway, LOL.  (I think I am out of the loop here, espresso and cherry seem to be the current trend in nursery furniture...  but I just love the look of real wood myself)	
- 1	I found that this seat pinched my child's legs/hind area on the sides where the seat unfolded. It also has some foam on the backend  (I assume so it doesn't slip on a toilet seat) that just didn't seem to get clean when I would try to sanitize the seat. I ended up throwing it away.	
1. 	You have to have these replaced every 1-2 months depending on how often you pump.  Every 6-8 weeks I feel as if my milk production has reduced - but then I stop and ask myself when was the last time I changed the membranes?  and a-ha!  Once I change the membranes - the production is back to normal.  SO it is not you, it is the suction that reduces.  To the human eye, they don't look worn out after 2 months, and you don't stop to think about it.  But something about their strength vs. elasticity that makes the difference.	
- 1	I bought this for the color and was happy with just that. This is pricey for just 9 square feet. Also, color is lasting ok, starting to see bits flake off to show white underneath. My  toddler has been able to pull the squares apart pretty much since he was an crawling infant, so keeping all the squares together has been an issue too.	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these, one for my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law's home as they are beginning the potty-training task with our grandson.  Although he is still too young to be able to handle climbing on this by himself, having it around the home now will get him familiar with the item and what its use is for.  I purchased all of the potty training items now for both homes so our grandson will become comfortable with them at both homes and learn what he needs to do at both homes too.  This step is very well made, sturdy, and doesn't have any sharp edges to hurt the little ones.  The top is slip-proof and has a rubber strip on the bottom to keep it from slipping on tile and wood floors as well.  Highly recommend.	
- 1	We bought this cup for our 6 month old and from the very beginning it leaked.  The nipple was very soft and my daughter seemed to enjoy biting it more than using it to drink.  But when she would tilt it back all the water would just soak her neck and shirt.  I could never give her this cup without her shirt being soaked.  Also it would leak in the diaper bag as well.  Very disappointed... currently searching for a new cup to transition from bottle.	
1. 	this hat is adorable and keeps my baby warm. I read other reviews that included issues with the elastic. My baby's head is a normal size, and the hat fits her perfectly at two months. It was too big and covered her eyes at one month old. So far it has been great during these colder months.	
1. 	I purchased this toy for my baby when she was just a couple months old. She has always enjoyed playing with it and now at six months she can sit and hit the keyboard. This has always kept her entertained for at least half an hour even from the beginning! It is easy to reconfigure to sitting and standing positions. I like the music and the different modes. Volume control is nice too. It is very good on batteries as well which is a definate plus. The only gripe I have is that the orange mirror pulls off way too easily but other than that this toy is very durable.I'd say this toy is a must have.	
- 1	I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say recline.  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the in-between stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position. ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat. ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them. - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base. - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.	
1. 	This fits perfectly on our dresser next to the changing pad.  It holds everything we need for a change (I.e. diapers, wipes, rash cream, etc.  Plus I also have a brush and comb, thermometer, and hand sanitizer (for me) in it too.  This is exactly what we needed!  Thanks!	
1. 	I originally bought a Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad based on all the good reviews.  I did not have any luck with it, was very hard to bathe baby alone so I searched again and came across this one.  It is exactly what I needed.  I am able to bathe my little one without any help.  She was probably about 8 lbs when we started using this tub and it cradles her so nicely so I don't have to hold her up or worry about her slipping under the water.  She is able to kick her feet and feels cradled and secure up by her arms.  This is really an awesome design.  It is a really big tub though.  We store it in her bedroom after it dries because there is no room in our bathroom for it.  That is the only downside, but it doesn't take away from the product at all so I didn't lower the rating.  Would highly recommend this tub.	
- 1	On the first use of this item a sliver of metal fell off.  If I was not in a well lit room and paying close attention, my 7 week old could have gotten seriously hurt.  To add salt to the wound,  I tried to return the item and I got two separate emails from the seller.  The first email asked me to describe the defect.  I responded to the email. After which, I received a second email asking me to send a picture of the item; SERIOUSLY!  1. Do you think I am storing the sliver of metal to take a picture of it?  2.  If I described the defect as a sliver of metal, the product would look the same as in the original picture of the item, as a sliver denotes a very small piece, so the seller already has a picture of what the product looks like.  3.  If the seller needed a picture, this should have been requested in the first email, not in a second email.  I shop online because I have limited time.  I do not have time to respond to an email trail for a $3 nail clip.  However, I am so irritated with the product and the seller's response that I decided to write this review.  In addition, my request to return the item was closed before the return approval process was completed!	
- 1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.	
- 1	I was so looking forward to putting this window valance in the nursery but was disappointed when it arrived. The color was not that really pretty pink that was pictured but rather more of a pink-purple. Also the tulle looked very cheap and nothing like the picture.	
1. 	My daughter likes the sounds and interaction with the toy, but gets frustrated that she is trapped and can't roll easily on carpet.	
- 1	My toddler and infant both love these sippies, since there isn't much resistance to get the liquid out (some sippies are ridiculously hard to drink out of) but these straws are total junk. They're thin and if your child bites on them at all, they rip. We ordered these replacements, and they ripped within a couple months. Really need to find a new sippy to switch to, but my toddler is pretty resistant to sippy change. The sippies also leak like crazy after a while.	
1. 	I bought some outlet covers at Lowes that were the rotating kind, like this:http://www.amazon.com/Safety-1st-Swivel-Outlet-Cover/dp/B000BQL7CI/ref=pd_sbs_ba_15?ie=UTF8&refRID;=1ZRRBYQ38MHFS52XZMM3These sliding ones are so much better! The rotating kind can get stuck in the open position (they usually do not spring back to their closed position). Additionally, they will not fit all cords - for example, an iPhone charger does not fit in the rotating kind.THESE sliding protectors are so much better because they always spring back automatically to the closed position when you're not using the outlet, and they accommodate all kinds of cords (every electrical plug will fit into these).I bought standard electrical plugs too, like these:http://www.amazon.com/Mommys-Helper-Outlet-Plugs-Pack/dp/B00081J3N6/ref=pd_cp_ba_0Personally, I recommend putting the cheap, standard kind in most of your outlets, and only splurging on these sliding covers for your frequently used outlets, unless cost is not a factor for you.	
- 1	this only worked for food that was already soft.  My wife and I used it briefly then decided it was more of a hassle to wash then a fork that would accomplish the same job.	
1. 	These are awesome straw cups.  Unlike the other straw-type cups, these cups don't leak, don't have tiny parts to clean, and are not super expensive.  We've used a flip straw type cups only to get frustrated with small parts that are difficult to clean, and lots of leaks when tipped on the side.  We've tried similar straw through lid type cups only to have a mess of leaks, and flimsy straws.  The Take and Toss cups beat them all - the straws are made of fairly hard plastic, and they go in smoothly and tightly through the lid of the cup.  We've used other straws with this cup, and found that they work fairly well also.  The cup will leak only a tiny bit when tipped.If you got a kid who tosses cups still, this cup may not be for you, as I'm pretty sure a lot more liquid will come out, but if you've got a sippy cup transitioner on your hands, this cup is great!  On a side note, if you don't want to use the lid, kids can drink out of the cup without it - the edge of the cup is curved enough to allow drinking without drooling.  Highly recommended!	
- 1	Personally, this didn't help in my case. I purchased these to reduce cleaning throughout the day, pumping on top of caring for newborn and 4 year old and running household. My nipples are small and what I really needed was the 25 mm that came with the pump but I can't find them anywhere.	
- 1	Pros: fun, entertaining, many ways to attachCons: 1. poor design, in order to mount it correctly, kids can only look at the back side of the toys attached. the sun and butterfly need to be facing at the kids not facing away.2. it's nothing like the picture showed you. less quality. and the windmill made of plastic without any protection. when you pull the string, it spins very fast and it could hurt the kids if they are too young. (picture showed in the description has soft cushion around the windmill blades.Overall, my son loved it but took us a little while to figure out a semi-ideal location and direction to mount this. It's definitely a fun toy for any kids.	
1. 	This is good for the price. Its a decent white noise machine for a baby. My daughter has slept much better since we got it. I keep it on all night as well at during her naps. Satisfactory product. Might get one for my sons room.	
- 1	I wanted to like this because I'm all about my baby having a clean nose, but the rounded tips make it hard to see what I'm getting at in his nose. The rounded tips are a safety feature; I understand, but I just can't seem to work around them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe my baby's nostrils are too small; he's currently 6-months-old, but I've been trying to use this since he was a newborn. Anyway, it still sits in his little hygiene bag, but I don't use it at all. Instead, I either just use my pinky or theBaby Vac Nasal Aspirator 2012 Modelaspirator (with saline) to get those boogers out.	
1. 	This seems like this would fit different size pads and it is very soft and the color was as shown.	
1. 	It's well designed to fit a number of bottles and all the accessories.  My only problem is that the bottles take a while to dry.  I sometimes have to let them air dry off the rack.	
- 1	Since there were great reviews and this thermometer was so pricey I figured it'd be great. Unfortunately I haven't liked this at all. I could do four readings in a row and get vastly different temperatures each time. Getting an accurate reading is really important so I stopped using this and will probably have to get a new thermometer.	
1. 	I really like this stroller frame. It fits nicely in the trunk of my car, unlike many of the other travel systems. I love that it is sold separately from the car seat because it made for two reasonably priced shower gifts instead of one massive travel system that wouldn't have been affordable as a shower gift.A few things:- The wheels get tangled up after I close it so that I have actually injured myself trying to get it open. This is probably me just being dumb. When you realize where you need to untwist the wheels, it opens fine.- Where the car seat attaches to the frame seems a little unsturdy, though we haven't had any problems.- Be careful where you push this thing because it WILL tip over on rough terrain. If you hit a big enough bump in a sidewalk I can see this thing going over.But, it is perfect for running errands at the store and I used it a lot that way. It is generally small enough to maneuver between tight aisles. The basket in the bottom is nice and big and fits many items. Many times I moved the sleeping baby from the car to this stroller to multiple stores and back to the car without waking him.- I never bothered with the cup holder again after I put a soda in there once and the baby ended up wearing it.- This thing was perfect the time the baby had a 103 fever and it was 90 degrees outside and no one was around to get me ibuprofen at the store and I had to take him with me.	
- 1	I bought two of these Summer placemats thinking they were identical to the Kiddopotamus product we mistakenly left at a restaurant. I was wrong. These are far less sturdy than the Kiddopotamus placemats, warp easily (in hot tap water), can't be put in the dishwasher (see warp easily) and are much more difficult to adhere to a table than the others. We'll keep using these as backup, but they are definitely an inferior product. Spend a few extra bucks and get the Kiddopotamus mat.	
1. 	This is as easy a manual pump to use as I could hope for. The pumping action is smooth and easy to operate. My hand doesn't get tired. I get good milk from it, too. I also have a Medela Swing (electric single pump) and a Medela PISA (electric double), and I interchange what I use depending on the timing and situation, and I never have to worry that the Harmony will pull less milk than the electrics. I can get 5 ounces from one side in 10-15 minutes, same as the electrics. I wouldn't want to use the manual as a full-time pump, of course, but this is ideal when I'm trying to be particularly quiet with my pump.	
1. 	Breast feeding is wonderful but trying to supplement with bottle when you are away can be a challenge to finicky babies. These bottles are wonderful and well accepted as an alternative.	
- 1	I ended up returning this... it would most likely be best for a flat bottomed baby bath. The suctions are too small and in effective in my regular tub and the mat it self is not enough room for even my little one to sit on (if I could get the suctions to stick). If they made a bigger one, I would try it as I generally like their products.	
1. 	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).  This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.  For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.	
- 1	Hard to read mark, my son was not able to get any milk out of the nipple, the nipple squeezes in every time he sucks on it.	
1. 	My baby hated being swaddled when he first came home from the hospital.  And only this blanket works for my loves to kick little man.  My son is now 11 weeks old and we started using this blanket when he was a month old.  We only swaddle him at night and do not use a pacifier.  He currently sleeps from 11p-7a.  I have many friends having kids right now and tell people to buy this as a gift for the baby shower!	
1. 	I love that this is a simple visual mobile, no noise, no nothing. I hung it using an eye hook in the ceiling above the crib - had to add a chain to make it hang low enough.	
- 1	The ball that we received looks similar to the one pictured, but the packaging is completely different! It makes no mention of being non-toxic or BPA free. It just says easy to hold, squeaks when squeezed, great for teething , made of soft vinyl and washable and soft and squeezable.  Plus it is made in China.  This is going back to Amazon. No thanks!	
- 1	I am too particular to keep this item.  It did not fit the mattress and slid around so bad it was hard to put the sheet on over it.I like giving honest reviews for one main reason, MONEY!  I just can't afford to buy things that don't work or seem too cheap to hold up in the wash!  and I don't want other customers to waste time or money on them either.I am particular, and spend as wisely as I can.try the J lamb products, they are much nicer.lilyput	
1. 	I love this thing! It's inexpensive, east to use, easy to clean, portable, secure, and takes up very little space. It's the only high chair my child has ever used, and we use it at home, bring it to restaurants, to other peoples homes, and even brought it on vacation with us! She's 2 years old and still has room. I buy this for every new mom now. There's no need to spend $$$ on bulky high chairs that can tip over.	
1. 	The product itself is great! Works like it's supposed to and my little one is unable to put things into the openings if she takes the plugs out. Matches my trim color nicely, not noticeable at all.The only qualm I have is that I expected both plates to be center screw style (as stated) and I received one center screw and one decora style (two screw). It's fne because I have both in my house but I was looking to cover specific areas and now am short one. Sigh.	
1. 	It is very easy to carry and very practical too. I can keep a couple of diapers and other hygiene items inside the bag.	
1. 	This swing is an absolute lifesaver and it was worth every penny I spent on it. From the moment we brought our son home from the hospital he has enjoyed this swing. We keep it in the side to side motion mode (though you can choose front to back as well) and he will literally stay happy and occupied for hours--this includes the time he spends sleeping in the swing. When he turned about 6 weeks old, he really started to enjoy the lights, sounds and circling fish. Now at 8 weeks, he talks at the fish all the time! It is fun to watch, and on a more economic point, for as much as we use the swing, it does not seem to drain the batteries as much as we thought it might.Honestly, as a brand new mother, if there is one baby product that I could not live without, it would be this swing.Be forewarned, it does take up a lot of space, but if you can make the room, it is worth the sacrifice.	
- 1	My toddler is very active and able to open and close objects very easily. She is comfortable with sippy cups but my wife insisted on using glass so we purchased the whole set of life factory bottles only to be dissapointed. The concept of tightening or loosening the cap for the flow does not work for us, my daughter would just unscrew it open and spill it if I did not tighten it all the way causing the flow to be non-existent.	
1. 	These bibs are wonderful for those heavy duty spitters!  The pack of 10 is a must for my daughter, who wears bibs as a part of her daily outfit because she spits up so much!  I love the terry-cloth feel, without the bulk!  The inner, waterproof material keeps her shirt dry throughout the day.  Changing bibs after each meal is much easier then changing outfits!	
- 1	This product looked so beautiful online.  What a waste of money it was.- It was very annoying to put together and it doesn't fit through doorways, so it needs to be assembled and disassembled in the room where it is used- It was cheap materials - the mattress was so thin the baby was basically laying on plywood.- The bedding fell apart when washed (ribbons frayed & they weren't attached high enough to hold the bumper to the frame beacause after the wash, the bumper sagged over into the bassinet)- The way the canopy works is incredibly crappy - it's like a coat hanger- I did find the round sheets but they were also threadbare and crappy- My daughter outgrew it way before the manufacter suggestions - she wasn't very long, but always needed to be perfectly centered in the bassinet or else would touch a side	
1. 	Now when am going out with my son he can have safe feedings.i just need water and my dispenser filled and we can hit the road.and when he out grows it it's his snack cup. love it!	
1. 	This play gym has survived through two children and looks just as great today as it did when we bought it. We wash the mat and the plush toys often. The items are easy to clean. The butterflies do not spin automatically like I kind of assumed they might, but they are fun for the kids none-the-less. Colorful with great sounds and great detachable toys.	
1. 	The label states this product was tested for lead and BPA. Since there is no regulation for these things who knows how accurate this is. But the cups are well made and the colors are vibrant. cute simple toy.	
- 1	After buying and returning three different monitors we tried the Sony BabyCall.  A couple friends recommended it and we were running out of options.  The sound on this monitor was pretty good for an analog signal.  The problem is that the out of range alarm (a really loud, annoying beeping) kept randomly going off as we walked around our house.  We have a single floor home that isn't huge.  There is no way the receivers were actually out of range.  We tried exchanging our Sony BabyCall for another unit hoping we had gotten a faulty one, but the second one was even worse than the first!  I couldn't even leave the receivers on because they beeped non-stop.  It could be that we have too many devices operating on the analog signal for this to work for us, but other analog monitors did not have this problem.  Don't bother with the Sony BabyCall.	
1. 	My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.	
1. 	I was looking for a gate to go on wrought iron stair railings (wrought iron on both sides of the gate) and noticed that most gates need special attachments for this, or just won't work at all on railings.  I couldn't believe when I stumbled upon this one - the price was just amazing and it came with all the necessary parts!This gate is easy to install - you basically attach 4 &#34;holders&#34; using either screws or sticky tape.  The holders are just areas that the gate uses as pressure points - they keep the gate from moving around while it's in place.  I did it by myself and it took a total of 15 minutes.Once the holders were installed, you just put the gate in using the pressure mounting system.  This is a little annoying since you need to make sure the gate is perfectly aligned with the holders, and it's a bit difficult to do alone.Taking the gate down is very easy (pull and turn the lever to release the pressure lock, then close it and put it to the side).Because it's annoying to put the gate up though, we end up not using it as often as we should.  It would be a perfect gate for low traffic areas, but in high traffic, it's just a pain to keep putting it back on.  It takes at least 2-3 minutes to attach it properly (maybe a little less if you have help from somebody else)So while this gate is great for what it is, it doesn't fully serve my purposes which is why I had to give it 4 stars.I will have to buy another gate for the bottom of my stairs, but I will keep this one to be used at a lower-traffic location.	
- 1	My daughter has pulled off, yes off, one of the hanging objects. It didn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes. The beams went flat rather quickly and she now uses them to climb over. I would not recommend this product to anyone.	
- 1	These are by far and away the worst baby wipes I have ever encountered.  The baby poop smells better than the wipe.  It's nauseating.  And, they are thin and kind of dry, but that would be fine if there smell weren't so awful.  I'm getting a sense from the other reviews that this might be a cilantro type thing-doesn't bother most people but some may just have a terrible reaction.	
- 1	I ordered this product because I had used one with my sister's 3 boys when they where very yough but by the time my youngest nephew's little girl came to visit she was too young to use it & then the next time she came to visit she was over the wt reqmt. So its never been used & that is why I only gave it one star. However, I would highly recommend this product. It easy to use and u don't need a chair to fasten it to first...just slide the arms of the portable highchair onto the top of the table, tighten the screwers to ensure the chairs stays upright and fastened to the table...when done, reverse all procedures, slide it off the table, and away u go.	
1. 	So far these are the best I have found. Though they do have one downfall. After weeks or so of abuse from 4 boys ranging  from 1-5 they eventually start to leak. I do wash them in the dishwasher and my kids are in no way easy on them. But they leak proof for a while which is the best yet. We have tried over 10 different brands and so far these are passing. I would give them a 5 star rating except that I cannot find anywhere to buy just lids!!! The cups are insulated and so cute. We have all of the different themes... boy related anyways... no princess stuff here!	
- 1	I got these as a gift along with the Fresh Baby Trays at my baby shower.  I made my own baby food and put it into these cubes, and then froze them.  When I first opened the cubes up, I noticed they were dirty and desperately needed washing. The containers aren't perfectly clear to begin with but I was surprised at how dirty they were right out of the package.  The cube lids do not stay on all the way either.  Even if you don't overfill the cubes as the instructions say, the lids still do not seal all the way and there is a gap that food could spill out of (if it was in the fridge).  I had trouble with the lids completely popping open too and had to put Scotch tape on them to keep them closed.  The cubes also do not stay on the white tray and tip over and fall off very easily.  Also, you must defrost them in the microwave to get the frozen food out.  I think you are better off buying the Fresh Baby trays.  These are very high-quality trays, where the thick rubber lid stays on and the frozen food pops right out for storage in a zip-lock bag (just like regular ice cubes).  Don't waste your money on these flimsy individual cubes!	
- 1	I really loved the look when they first arrived. However, as soon as i out them to use, they started showing little cracks - 1 got 4 and all had the same issue. Within a month or so, all broke. These are meant for toddlers and infants and are super expensive. I wouldve expected them to last longer than they actually did.My daughter did love them while they lasted though - easy to hold, easy on the eyes!Had i written this review a few months back, i wouldve given a positive review. Not recommended at all!	
- 1	I ordered 6 of those, each different color, for my baby which will be born in April, will use it but this one came with a broken snap at the top- so not to happy about it , will try to fix it, color is nice thought	
- 1	This bag is okay, but it is thin and tends to leak after a full day of diapers. I also bought a PlanetWise bag with a waterproof liner and it's so much better.	
1. 	We have the good fortune of taking our 8 month old daughter to work with us at our family owned business. The first one of these we bought was the blue/green version. We liked it so much we came back and bought a second chair for home. Cleanup is super easy. The only bad thing is that my daughter has already figured out how to remove the top tray. No big deal, we just take that off and feed her in the bottom tray attached to the seat. It also seems that she will have plenty of room to grow in this seat.Great chair and Great price!	
1. 	About 5 months into my pregnancy I was really having trouble getting comfortable at night.  Regular pillows as barriers, did not work well. I looked into several pillows and purchased this one because it was a total body pillow.  It's been so nice because I can put it behind me and between my legs, which keeps me from rolling on my back (I'm 5'2, and feel like I have more pillow than I need, which tells me it would work for a taller person).**I recommend purchasing a cover for this pillow**  I thought I would just use the white cover that it comes with, but found out I really needed a pillow case!  Still worth absolutely EVERY PENNY!!**Also, there was a paper included with the pillow that showed 8 different ways to use the pillow including nursing positions, which I found very helpful (because I won't need to purchase another pillow for nursing later).Update:-I did purchase a boppy pillow for nursing.  I found that for a chair or couch, this pillow is just too big and bulky.  It would probably be great if you are staying in bed to nurse, though.-We have a queen sized bed and I had enough room.-Still so glad I had this pillow during pregnancy!	
1. 	I bought this when my son was born. It fits our single kitchen sink perfectly and he has enjoyed his bath since then. After he could sit up good, I bathed him in a tub but my mom likes it better than a tub because it would use less water and maybe easier for her to wash him that he wouldn't move around too much. (She watches him during day time). So when I bath my son now, he would always brings this tub to me because that's how he is bathed during the weekday so I'm sure he still enjoys it too.I like this product has different bathing positions and an area to put soap/toys. We did use the sling few times when he was born, slightly over 7 lb but he out grew the sling so fast so mostly he was bathed without the sling.Oh, you have to be careful when pulling the plug. My nanny broke it after few use (she is not the most careful person in the world anyway) so it's not so easy to unplug it anymore. My mom just lives with it.	
1. 	I received this as a shower gift. When it was first hung with the sticky pad, it fell down almost immediately. I purchased the suction cup mount and it's been hanging ever since. It's easy to just scoop up the toys at the end of bath time and it easily drains out the water.	
1. 	Last pregnancy I ordered the &#34;Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Leachco-Belly-Contoured-Pillow-Ivory/dp/B0002E7DIQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1390183256&sr;=1-2) since I thought having a symmetrical pillow would be easier. It was pretty comfortable, but even on my king size bed, it took up a ton of room. It was hot, and I felt like there was this giant divider between me and my husband. I also felt like the top of it dug into my shoulder - and I was never quite sure where to put my bottom arm (I'm a terrible side sleeper. Hence the need for the pillow.) It also seemed to lose &#34;fluff&#34; by the end of a few months.This time I decided to go with the &#34;Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow&#34; - and I'm hooked! I haven't used it long enough to see how the &#34;fluff factor&#34; works out, but my concerns about not having a &#34;symmetrical pillow&#34; have been alleviated. It's super easy to use, intuitive, and takes up so much less space. I love the support, it's isn't hot like the other pillow - and it allows me to snuggle with my husband if he's on the right side - and added perk!I feel way less 'isolated' in bed with this pillow. Would definitely recommend.	
- 1	Given all the high reviews, I bought these spoons along with the Munchkin ones, thinking these would be so much better. Our little one doesn't like these at all. The rubber part over the spoon isn't smooth, it's a little bumpy, and she hates the texture. From my perspective, the spoon is way too shallow to get any reasonable amount of foot into/onto it. I'm really bummed we bought these. My advice is to try the Munchkin ones first (they're great!).	
1. 	Purchased for my nephew in 2009.  The booster seat was easy to carry along with to restaurants during family outings.  Used at home, you could change the tray easily by adding the different covers to the main tray.  No longer used since my nephew grew out of it, but useful when originally purchased.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
- 1	I have a 21 month old toddler and have had this gate up for a few months. It has served its purpose but I would not buy another one of these.  I will upload some pictures to show you it is not as advertised as well.The gate does stay mounted between a small doorway I have and also move it to a larger doorway sometimes. Every time I seem to pinch my finger in the gate closure and also have to readjust the sides and line it up. Once it is secure, I would not trust too much tug or pull on it. It will fall down. I keep it in a doorway that is not a heavy traffic area so it has been fine for me.I kept the outside covering and it clearly shows the gates with a white bar across it, or maybe a very light gray. Mine is a very dark gray. The Amazon sticker also has white written on it. Unless they are referring to the cheap mesh plastic, it is not all white so be prepared. Also in the picture it clearly shows the top bar coming across the top, covering the two side bars. Not the case. The two side bars are in between the top bar and are exposed with an unfinished wood that can cause splinters. The worse, under the locking area is a wood piece that sticks out. It is not shown in the photo. Mine sticks out rather far and just barely tugging it, it pulls further. It is very sharp.If you have a young child I would not recommend this gate because of the poor quality but also the exposed wood that can splinter and also the sharp pieces that are exposed. I would go with a higher quality gate. I bought another gate by a different brand for another purpose but it was $14 something and made a lot better than this gate. I used it outside on my deck and it did not have any sharp pieces and was not flimsy. It was theNorth States Supergate Top-Notch Gate.Again, this gate is marketed for 6 months to 24. I have used it for the last few and my daughter just turned 21 months. If she was under one year and learning to stand up and walk, I would not have this up at all, does not do a good enough job. Munchkin is a good name, I own a lot of their stuff but when it comes to gates, they need to work on improving them.I will be uploading pictures to the photo gallery so you can see the gate.	
1. 	We wanted a potty for our daughter to start using once day when she was about 7 months old. This one has been great - it isn't so big that her butt falls through the hole, but it definitely has room to grow. She seems to like sitting on it and using it and it is very easy to clean.	
- 1	This product initially worked well on our coffee table to protect our son from bumping his head on the edges. Only issue is that after a couple of months, he started pulling on it like it's a bungie cord. It's become a game to him to pull it off of the table.	
1. 	We have a four-month-old daughter who has been using Playtex VentAire standard bottles for the past month with notable success.  They have worked nicely for the following reasons:1. The bottles did not cause the dreaded nipple confusion when transitioning between the bottle at daycare and breastfeeding when baby is with mom.2. Although it does have a lot of pieces, the fact that the bottle disassembles completely makes it easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect its various parts.The bottles have presented one challenge:1. Replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - can be hard to find.  Nipples wear out, and wanting extras to have on hand, I ended up buying extra bottles instead because it was nearly impossible to find the slow flow variety (and it was cheaper to buy extra bottles from Amazon than to pay the exorbitant shipping from the two sources who sold the nipples separately).UPDATE (3/2012): As my daughter has reached her first birthday, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. We have also used Playtex Drop-Ins. This is how the two compare:1. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).2. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). (In both cases, this refers to the slow flow nipple variety for each bottle.)2. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider.	
1. 	This is one of my favorite baby products.  We have a tiny kitchen with a small island that has two stools for my husband and myself.  We absolutely have no room for a high chair.  With this booster seat, there is no need!  This seat is sturdy enough that we can sit it on top of the island and feed baby.  It does not slide around on a flat surface.*Disclaimer* -obviously once your child is big enough for his/her feet to reach the table surface, there is the risk that he/she could potentially push the seat over backwards, but for now, with our little one's legs sticking straight out, it works great with our infant.  We will have to move to the dining room table when she gets bigger.The trays are very easy to clean as is the seat.  Just a quick wipe and it's clean or throw the trays in the dishwasher.  We also find it quick and easy to fold up and we take it when we eat out.  It's also very light weight and easy to set up quickly.  No digusting sticky public high chairs to use!  Whenever we travel to the grandparents' or a friend's we have our high chair ready to use.  The strap that hooks beneath the chair has velcro on it so you can secure the excess strap (after tightening) off the floor where it won't dangle and get dirty.The layers of tray and tray cover snap together easily and come apart easily too.  Also, this chair is much cheaper than any high chair on the market.Highly, highly recommended.	
- 1	Love the idea but it just doesn't work quite as well as the pictures say.  The thing sags so much in the shelf/pockets that stuff falls off...even with the plastic supports inserted.  The velcro fasteners don't have enough grip to stay attached, so nails are really the only option and I didn't want to nail this stupid thing into the side of my convertible changing table.	
1. 	These are the typical rubber replacement valves. It's good to have a few extras on hand. I appreciate that I don't have to replace an entire cup.	
1. 	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	
1. 	We borrowed this from a friend and it's just so darn cute. My daughter loves it. The music is charming. It lights up with different colors. It's soft and cushy to lay on. Bright and colorful. Everything you could ask for in a floor play gym.	
- 1	These toys are extremely hard and do not allow comfort for my teething baby. There's no give when you squeeze the toy. The plastic material is just really tough.	
- 1	Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out. I returned it immediately.	
1. 	This toy is made in Germany and is made of wood.  It is absolutely beautiful as well as very baby engaging.  We buy NO baby products that are made in Asia, where almost all used-to-be-American-made toy companies outsource their products.  It took some digging, but now that I've found this company, there will be NO turning back and trying to find a Made in America toy company anymore!	
- 1	Super flimsy and rip easily. I ended up having a mess in my cloth diapers anyways so these were completely pointless. My daughter got a major diaper rash as well.	
- 1	Well, I bought these and I bought Bamboobies. These nursing pads were not absorbent enough, but also shrunk when I washed them. I washed the Bamboobies all the time and they do not shrink, they absorb well and they super soft.	
1. 	I'm not sure what &quot;not impressed&quot; review meant by it bunches up...it depends on the mattress.  I got the Sealy Superpedic Firm mattress and the cover fits perfectly.  Quilting gives extra comfort and it's thick and waterproof.	
1. 	I love these and the Sleepsacks. Every parent should have them. They make swaddling you child so much easier than using a blanket and the material is super soft. I highly recommend these and Sleepsacks for when they are older.	
- 1	You attach this shade to a window by either the tabs (open window, hook the plastic tabs onto top of window, close the window) or by the suction cups.  Pull down on the shade.  Push the plastic button on the right side of the housing to roll the shade back up.Pros:1.  It does block a lot of the sun.2.  Easy to install and use3.  You can still see out the window with it on.Cons:1.  Bulky and cheap feeling - plastic everything and I'd be afraid of what kind of missile it becomes in an accident.2.  When you push the release button, you have to help it roll up otherwise, it has a tendency to get all askew as it rolls up.3.  Breaks.  I like to drive with my window down and found out the the wind comes in my car, tugs on the shade and made it hyperextend itself.  Now it cannot retract at all.If I really needed shade in my car, I would rather use those ultra-light pop open sun shade things.  They are super light and wouldn't be a danger in case of an accident, there's nothing to really fail on them, they work better than this over-engineered piece of junk.Not recommended at all.	
- 1	I have been searching for a way to keep my 3-year-old out of her closet, and so I was thrilled when I found this product.  However, it won't stay on the door.  First I tried the original sticker-thing that came with it.  No luck.  Then I tried gorilla glue.  Both the lock and the paint came off the closet door.  My husband says he will try drilling a hole in it and attaching it to the door with a screw.IF you can get it to stay on the door, it works great.  However, good luck getting it to stay!	
1. 	I got two of these for my younger boys unfortunately my 5 year old is to tall for it but I have plenty of other kids around so it will get used very handy at nap time or when we go out at the lake pop it up under a tree when one is tired or even just for them to sit on. love this product I have sat on it to make sure it will hold more then one I am about 150 did just fine didn't bend or tear very well made	
1. 	I would not recommend for dirty diapers. It is not air-tight, so it does not hold in odors well. The benefit of this diaper pail is that it is cheap, and uses regular tall kitchen trash bags, rather than the expensive proprietary ones. We bought a Diaper Genie specifically for dirty diapers. It keeps in odors very well, but is much more expensive to refill. However, since we use it for dirty diapers only, we only need to buy refills about 4 times a year. All the rest of the diapers go in the Safety First pail, which saves us a lot of money on bags.	
1. 	I'm very happy with the stroller. It seems to be well-made and sturdy, folds quite compactly and steers well. The colors are fun and bright.	
1. 	We use these bath toys inside and outside of the bathtub :- ) they are very well done, good quality and grab your Childs attention of you are looking for this kind of activity in the bath tub. They also hold up pretty well. All and all, I would recommend this set.	
1. 	The best thing is that this rocker is made to serve children from newborn to toddler who can sit and rock by himself. So far I have tested it on my newborn. The chair offers two options for him - a rocking chair with entertaining toys (including one musical) dangling over his head and a sort of portable bed where he can comfortably take a nap (this is converted from a rocking chair by a lever). My child as of now can only stare at the dangling toys, but I expect him to be able to play with them in a few weeks. The chair has been very helpful in getting him to sit up when he is awake so that I can face and play with him, and the sleepy position - for keeping him asleep but away from his crib.If there are any suggestion I would make, they are: it would have been nice to have a head holder (like car seats have) and that the rod holding the toys was a bit sturdier. Otherwise, not a bad investment.	
1. 	This hamper is so cute and goes very well with the Osh Kosh &quot;Bears Bears Everywhere&quot; border, valences, and bedding set that we picked out.  I like that it folds up easily, and that the inside liner comes out to use like a laundry bag.	
1. 	It is VERY hard to get our changing pad buckles through the holes.  Other than that, it is a great cover.  We have to wash with towels, otherwise it leaves lint all over our clothes.	
1. 	I needed to pump when I went back to work and I bought a couple of these on top of those that were provided with the Medela Pump In Style. They are very resistant, easy to clean, and the rings and caps are very useful.I only put 4 stars because the nipples are useless if your baby is already using another brand, and I would have prefered another bottle and accessories instead.	
- 1	I got these for my 6 month old and they were too tight on his head.  He hated them, kept pulling them off.	
1. 	i GOT TWO OF THESE FOR MY TWIN GRANDSONS WHO ARE TWO YEARS OLD.  THEY FUNCTION AS DESCRIBED AND THEIR 8 MONTH OLD SISTER CAN USE IT TOO.  THEY WERE EASY TO INSTALL AND FIT SECURELY ON BOTH MY DINING ROOM CHAIRS AND A STANDARD FOLDING CHAIR.  THEY TAKE UP LESS SPACE THAN A TRADITIONAL HIGHCHAIR WHICH MAKES THEM EASIER TO USE IN MY HOME. THE TRAYS ARE SMALLER THAN A STANDARD HIGH CHAIR, BUT I DON'T SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE TRAY HAS A CUP HOLDER - THAT'S THE ONE WE USE THE MOST.	
1. 	Never thought I would get so excited over booger tweezers... then I had a baby. These things are great - a must-have!	
1. 	My baby is absolutely fascinated with this toy.  You can't tell from the pictures but the teether twists into many shapes which kept my baby busy for what seemed like forever.  There is also different textures on each of the twisting/rotating pieces.	
- 1	I ordered this sheet knowing that Aden by Aden + Anais is their lower end line so it was pretty much what I expected, but I still didn't like it enough to keep it. It is thin, so I didn't think it would hold up to a lot of wear and tear. For the price I felt Carter's brand was a better choice for what I was looking for. Personally, I think it is worth paying for the Aden + Anais line of products to get the higher quality item.	
1. 	We have tried so many different sleeping bags but have found the Halo SleepSack to be the best. Bub sleeps like a dream all year round in these.	
1. 	This sling has been amazing for going back to work. It's great for nursing hands free so I'm able to work at my computer. I can even lay baby down in his crib or on his nap mat with the sling and pull my head out when he falls asleep. I also have theMoby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Almond Blossom, and theBABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original- Gray/White, Mesh, but really prefer this sling. It's much cooler to wear than the Moby, and easier to get in and out of than both the Moby and the Baby Bjorn. The sling is very convenient for running errands and getting baby in and out of the car multiple times. The only drawback for this sling is that it's not as comfortable as the Moby for walking longer distances. Of course, probably the most important factor is that my son really enjoys riding in the sling. He's four months old, now, and we've been using the sling for work and errands since he was a little over three months.	
1. 	We use these bowls all the time! They stack great in a refrigerator or cooler. They don't have the worlds best seal (so don't put anything liquid) but they are perfect for baby food or finger foods.	
- 1	This tub seemed like a no-brainer based on the many reviews, but I'm not thrilled.  Here's why:1) You only need the sling for about a week until the baby's cord falls off.  After that I find it far preferable to put the baby in the water because he is much warmer and happier.  Not worth buying this for the sling, just do sponge baths until cord falls off2) It's massive for a small baby.  There is a bumper to support their behind, but at 4-5 weeks the baby can arch his back and slide right over it.  I used a much smaller tub at my mom's, just a simple rectangular plastic thing that was just long enough for the baby to sit in with my support and he was much happier since he could push his legs against the end of the tub and not feel so out in the open.  With this thing his legs are everywhere3) Because it is massive, cleanup isn't fun.  Rinsing the whole thing out in a kitchen setting is awkward because it is huge. Would be OK in a big bathtub though.	
1. 	Works well so that you don't need a step stool in every bathroom. It will not work if you have a more circular toilet, also it doesn't fold up very flat so unless you have ample space (about 10&#34; wide) to put it plan on it being on the toilet all the time.	
- 1	I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package and seen they were covered in dirt and grass. Maybe the 5 year old Chinese worker was using them to keep his sippy cup warm while they packaged retail goods outside one fall day.	
- 1	This is not very soft. It is better than nothing but not nearly as comfortable as his crib mattress. We use a pack and play with mattress when we vacation and I feel so badly for how uncomfortable the mattress is. I keep meaning to look for a new one!	
1. 	I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!	
1. 	Baby loves to chill on this. Its great for tummy time and also used to hold baby while breastfeeding or bottle feeding.	
- 1	I bought these thinking they'd be a great solution to not having to drill into dresser drawers, and to keep our toddler out of the cabinet that holds our fish tank stuff that can't be closed another way.  I WAS WRONG.1.  The sticky stuff isn't sticky enough to work on a semi-gloss or high gloss finish on furniture, or really any very smooth surface.  I used these to try to keep dresser drawers closed, and my son figured out how to pull hard enough on the drawer that the sticky part would just pop off. I've had no problems with them ruining finish on furniture, because it doesn't stick well enough to damage.  I think the command hook sticky things are stickier, honestly.  I've had those cause a lot more damage than these.2.  They're UGLY on dark furniture, they're pretty chunky and super obvious.3. They're not very easy to open, I have to jiggle the &#34;male&#34; part when I squeeze the tabs to try to wiggle it out.  Save yourself the trouble and money, and buy something that attaches with screws on the inside.  Also, IF you buy these, keep in mind they can't go too close to an obstruction (counter top, for example) otherwise you can't fit your fingers in to squeeze the tabs.I guess the only real way I'd recommend these is if you're trying to keep a pet out of a drawer, or if your kid(s) aren't trying to constantly get into whatever these are closing (maybe a medicine drawer out of reach, and you're using this as extra security?).	
1. 	I bought outdoors to write, my son will sleep here.He is more like this than his own bed.Although a little uncomfortable, a good nap self.He slept well in the comfort of home.	
1. 	This worked as a nice jumpy toy for a home with odd sized door frames. May want to choose an option with more padding if you have a child with very strong legs and greater chance of hitting door frames, but we thought this was perfect for use in a small home with most kids.	
1. 	I ended up loving this little booster seat even more than I thought I would. I use it instead of a full size high chair.The tray has adjustments as to how far back against the baby it can go. When he first started using it, I put the tray the whole way back. At 9 months old, he is at the next notch. By the time it would be too tight against him, he would be using it without the tray, jut as a booster at the table, so the amount of notches for adjustments is perfect.You can raise and lower the seat in the base as well. So far, I have kept it at the highest height and that has worked perfect for sitting it on a chair as a booster - at the highest height, I am still able to slide the whole seat with the tray on it, under the table while it is on the chair. Of course this will vary depending on your own table and chair heights.I love that I can just move this around so easily from room to room. He can use it to sit and watch tv in the living room or just sit in like a big boy chair. I can sit it on the kitchen counter while I cook or clean and have him right there. There are rubber pads on the bottom of the base, so it won't slide around. I can sit it on  top of the table to feed him while I sit on the dining chair, or bring it in the living room and set it on the floor and it is still high enough to be comfortable to feed him while I sit on the floor.At first I bought this thinking that it would just be a temporary or once in a while item that I would use. But now, I can definitely see using it instead of a full size high chair for as long as he fits in it. I would think it would fit him up until the time he would be sitting on a regular dining chair on his own. It has so much more potential for use than a full size high chair, since you can move it around to pretty much anywhere.It is a decent size. Not too big and not too small. It doesn't take up much space at all. Storing it away is as simple as sitting it on a dining chair and pushing the chair under the table as usual.It is easy to clean - no fabric to worry about. Trays can go right in the dishwasher if you want.It is sturdy enough. I am not concerned that anything will crack or break.The color scheme is very neutral and nice looking.Price is definitely good and I feel like it is such a great value since it is such a versatile item. Definitely one of the best baby products I have chosen and I am so glad I bought it.

1. 	The Miracle Blanket was awesome.  My daughter went through a flailing phase where she would startle in her sleep, flail her arms and hit herself in the face and then wake up screaming.  Every few hours we'd be up trying to reswaddle her in a blanket, then in the SwaddleMe, then in the Sleep Sack Swaddle... everyone of them she wriggled out of and would then wake up screaming after she inevitably flailed and hit herself in the face.  It was awful.  Then I bought the Miracle Blanket and the child finally slept for more than 2 hours at a time (she slept for six hours straight that night, woke up for a bottle and then immediately fell back to sleep in the Blanket for another 6).  She didn't even cry when I wrapped her up in it.  The Miracle Blanket works better than the other swaddle systems because it has two flaps that hold down baby's arms next to her sides and then a very long swath of fabric that wraps around baby's body a few times.  It seems excessive, like maybe this is a baby straight jacket, and why would I put my child in a straight jacket?  But my daughter found it to be calming and comforting and it enabled her (and me!) to sleep.	
1. 	I bought this bath to use with my infant when he was about 8 or 9 weeks old. Prior to that, we were holding him (making bathing a two person job -- one to hold the baby in the bath and one to wash him). He got too heavy for me to hold the entire time while bathing him and I needed a way to wash him by myself when my husband was at work. This seat works very well. I put the seat inside a small plastic baby bath tub and fill the water about half way (so that when I put him in the water level doesn't rise too high on him). I think this bath is better for a baby that's a bit older (I wouldn't have used this with him when he was a tiny newborn). It was perfect for my son at 8 or 9 weeks because he could recline and have a nice soak while I washed him without needing a second set of hands. He's 13 weeks old now and loves sitting in it and kicking his legs. Once he's able to sit up independently, we'll just let him sit in the baby bath tub without this seat.	
1. 	Keep in mind that this adapter is not for new Medela pumps. I don't recall what year the cut off is for this adapter, but you should research that before purchasing. The cord length is great: would have easily spaned the length of my vehicle. The speed of the pump is faster using the adapter vs. the regular electric cord, so I just used a slower speed when I pumped. No complaints at all.	
1. 	I initially bought this pail for cloth diapers after searching all over the internet and in stores for one that would work. This one is great! You can close the lid down on a cloth pail liner and then use the push-button opening to drop in the dirty diapers. I wash the load about every two days, and the pail does well to keep the smell in. I do use the air freshener disk in the lid to help as well.The first few weeks I used the pail for disposables that had been given to me at baby showers. The bucket is great because you can use regular trash bags inside, though it's a little smaller than a 13 gallon trash bin. I used it each time until full and only noticed an odor on hot, humid days.Over all, great pail!!	
- 1	I was rather disappointed in these sheets. They aren't at all soft to the touch, but are bumpy and a bit rough. I hoped that washing would improve the situation, but after several washings they're nearly as bad as when I took them out of the package. In addition, they have a strong astringent (chemical) smell which is - very slowly - being washed away.If you're looking for a soft organic crib sheet, I highly recommend this instead: [...]	
- 1	The product does cling well to the window and does keep some sun out.  However, if you try to look out the window everything's blurred, which can make you car sick (in addition to taking away the fun of looking out the window).	
1. 	I bought this up an up coming trip to the states from Europe, and my 5 year old won't leave it alone! I had to take it away from him to make sure he wouldn't distroy it before we left on our trip. The stuffing was getting weak in an area that he liked to bend it. Its not an everyday toy...so I just keep it up when we are not traveling.	
1. 	This style of nursing cover with the structured band so you can see the baby is wonderful, especially in the early days of nursing when your baby might need more help/maintenance during sessions. The one thing I would caution is that if you don't have nursing-specific tops, this cover doesn't cover your sides/back like an all-around cover, so you might want to wear a belly band or something so you are not exposed when you lift your shirt. That said, I love the pattern of this particular cover!	
1. 	I ordered the orange sheet (my boy picked out the color) and it is true to color, well made and fits nicely.  It's not too tight or too large.  I will be purchasing more soon.  My crib mattress size is 28x52x6.	
1. 	These worked great with the Medela Pump in Style double-pump. My pump came with the standard 24 mm shields which uncomfortably pulled my nipple too far into the tube and caused significant soreness / chafing. I was so glad to find the next size down (21 mm small) on Amazon because they were not available via retail stores nearby. These came in retail packaging and fit much better - they still cause a little tenderness, but nothing long and am able to comfortably have the baby latch shortly afterwards if needed. I ended up ordering two more spare sets so that I don't have to clean / sterilize as frequently!	
- 1	These sheets do fit okay on the crib mattress, they breath good and have kept shape quite well after being washed, but it annoys me to the core that they are not made like normal sheets. Instead of being seamless on all the edges, and having seams only on the corners where the edges meet, they have seams that run along the long sides of the sheet and after constant use the seam ends up on the flat part of the bed where the baby sleeps making it look all &#34;fat guy in a little coat&#34;. It doesn't prohibit the sheet from doing its job, and it isn't a safety hazard, it just looks so crummy. I wouldn't buy these sheets again because my OCD wouldn't dare allow it.	
1. 	I bought these when my little one was still in the womb! I am so glad i did! My son is 7 months now and these have been great. They last pretty long and can be used for cloth diapering or as a wipe. Only thing is that they won't remain that smooth and soft texture once youve used them for awhile. I don't really mind, they are still soft enough and highly durable.	
1. 	So I am a huge researcher in products for babies and toddlers that are organic or BPA, free.  My son is VERY picky and I had a very hard time convincing him to drink out of a sippy cup.  I literally tried about 4-5 different brands and shapes.  He was just not having it.  The day i tried this particular cup (sippy not straw version) he used it!Now, most kids are not this picky and would probably drink out of anything.  I like this product also because it is 1) BPA free, 2) LOW PRICE 3) You can sometimes find cute versions of this cup with Disney Cars on it or Toy story etc.  You can also lose or forget these sippy cups and not feel bad because of how incredibly cheap they are.  I have bought this product least 10 times over the last year and a half and that is only because I can't stand when my son starts to chew and leave teeth marks on the lid.	
1. 	This is a great seat to leave at Grandam's house.  We leave this seat at my mother's house and it works great when we come over for visits.  It's light weight and easy to tuck away into a closet until needed.	
1. 	Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.  I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.  I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.	
1. 	Bought these for our long car ride as well, since the belt covers that came with the seat weren't that comfy looking and her neck kept tilting over. These are nice, soft and keeps her head up a bit more. Fits snugly under her chin and looks cute. I looked at the neck pillows but i thought it would push her head too far forward. She likes them so it's all good.	
1. 	Okay... I admit that I was drawn to this thing because it is adorable. Imagine my happiness when it came and not only was it as cute in person, my son loved it.The construction is remarkable in this day and age, and they are completely honest on the product about what surfaces it should be used on (smooth and flat... this isn't a big mover on any sort of carpet, but that is obvious to anyone with a desk chair). The bolt on handle does not have coverings over the bolts on the bottom, just a warning. I am frankly happier with that because things like that invariably fall off and wind up in the fix it later drawer. I would recommend shoes and dont even think of rocking this thing in on a sidewalk or driveway or you are going to chew up the wheels. but for doing laps around the kitchen or empty garage, it's brilliant.	
1. 	When sitting down to write my review I read some of the ones that had given the product low stars. I was amazed to hear of their problems. We have been very satisfied with these bottles and they are definitely the favorite of several different types that were received as gifts. They are very easy to hold when feeding our grandson and he does not experience any problems with gas. I like the way the bottle is put together into 5 different pieces because it makes it so easy to clean them properly. I would recommend them and be very comfortable giving them as a gift.	
- 1	I bought this to add to some old panels and was glad they are compatible, as one panel did not get fully assembled.  The first customer service person was downright rude, but the second time I called, I was helped by a courteous woman who agreed to send a replacement panel as it was unclear which part(s) were missing.  I have yet to receive the new panel and that part is frustrating.  The product is well constructed and compatible with a set I had purchased for dogs years ago.  The mechanism used to separate is a tad tricky to do initially, but after a few tries we had success.	
- 1	I bought the pink one...wanted to love this cup...paid $$$ a lot for it. Brought it home from the store...assembled it...tested the nipple part with my mouth...barely any liquid water came out. I had to turn the cup to the awkward edge of the nipple and squeeze and then liquid came out. You naturally want to put your mouth over the obvious wider flatter head of the nipple, but nothing comes out AT ALL. I am an adult too with heavy suction ability...NOTHING....but sideways, at a weird angle, I can get some out. Also, this frackin bottle leaked all over me. You have to really really really attempt to line up the nipple head with the screw indentions on the bottle. It doesn't naturally screw on. Poor Design.Update...the top is getting easier and simpler to screw on properly. But I still don't use it because of the nipple...I don't want to cut it either.	
1. 	We haven't used this much yet, but it appears to be just what I expected.  It is a little tall, so putting it down in the diaper bag doesn't work.  But there is plenty of room for a cold back in the bottom and full sized bottles.	
- 1	Pros- NoneCons-It is really a very thin strap. I got green color and it is so YUCK!!!. it was that birght shiny green color. They are so thin that they slide down. I returned them the very next day.JUST DONT BUY IT.	
- 1	We bought this for our 20 month old baby and she likes using it, but the toothbrush is really made of cheap quality materials and the vibration switch doesn't always work. This product is just so poorly made and not ideal for infants because it just falls apart and can be hazardous.At the time of writing this is the first review, but make sure you read the review onSummer Infant Gentle Vibrations Massager And Toothbrushwhich is essentially the same thing. You can see there are lots of reviews mentioning pretty much the same defects.	
1. 	I am very happy with this item! We were afraid to clip our son's tiny fingernails because we didn't want to accidentally cut him or cause him to hate the fingernail clipping process for the rest of his life. Luckily, I read a number of different reviews on Amazon, and found these Pigeon Nail Scissors.These are small, tiny scissors with which to cut the tiny baby fingernails. Baby fingernails are flexible, so they are hard to clip and impossible to file (we tried filing unsuccessfully). Baby fingernails grow SO fast, and babies can scratch themselves easily, and sometimes scratch you.The Pigeon Nail Scissors worked perfectly on the small, flexible nails of our 10-week old. We have had them about a month now, and I've used them several times - about once a week. Those baby nails become daggers quickly! I find a time when my baby is relaxed and will sit fairly calmly in my lap, then I carefully get one finger at a time, line up the scissors and cut. I like these a lot, because you can see the nail so it is easy to line up exactly where you want to cut. It really only takes one quick snip per nail, every once in a while I will go back for a second pass if I cut crookedly or miss part of a nail.The blades seem sharp because they cut so effortlessly. The ends of the blades are curved, like safety scissors. The scissors come with a yellow safety cover for storage.There is not much more to say - these are so effective and useful!	
1. 	I'm a nurse, so I'm extra picky about health care products.  This is my choice for my two girls.  It's fast.  It has a ridge to indicate how far in to insert the thermometer rectally.  It's backlit so you can read it in a dimly lit room.  And it's accurate.	
- 1	We inherited this seat from a friend as we started to potty train our son. Not only does it bend when my 26 lb son sits on it but if he shifts his weight or leans to one side the seat jumps and moves. This seat really made him feel uneasy. We bought the Primo seat after we read the reviews and have used it constantly for the last month. I would give it 5 stars. Not only is it sturdy but it stays in place. The seams are not flat like this seat with big bird so be careful if you like to slide your child's bottom all over it but I feel there is no real threat using the primo. I also believe that's what makes the primo so much sturdier. Good Luck! BTW we have used the primo everywhere: Planes, Porter potty, mall... and so on it works great EVERYWHERE.	
- 1	There are a few problems with the design.  The biggest one is that the part that is supposed to be under the kid's head is too thick and makes my son's head fall forward.  I wish it was totally flat or maybe had puffier parts that go on the sides of the head (similar to the neck support).The pillows on the sides of the neck are ok although my son's face looked a bit squished when I looked at him (pic attached).It is too bulky for the kid to have it on while awake, at least for an almost-2-year-old, so it needs to be put on after the child falls asleep.  I guess this would be a problem with any of pillows like that.When he was asleep I put it on and he stayed like that for 45 minutes or so.  When I tried to adjust his head tot he other side, the magnets let go and I couldn't make them stick any more.I am going to continue my search for a travel pillow.	
1. 	I couldn't tell you if this is the reason my son's head is round in the back (smile).  But I can certainly say that this is excellent for keeping the baby's head in a straight and comfortable position, specially when they are newborns and they spend a lot of time in their carrier, bouncy chairs or swings.  This is not intended for use while sleeping in their crib.I would not recommend using this product in lieu of the standard car seat headrest while transporting the baby in a car.  After-market headrests that have not been crashed-tested could cause serious injury in the event of a collision.	
1. 	I originally used those Munchkin bags that come in the holder in my son's diaper bag but I soon realized that they were small and you didn't get much for what you paid. They didn't have handles to tie and I didn't like that feature either. At home we were just using a regular garbage to throw them in but it STUNK! So I started my search for a new product and found these at our local Kmart! Needless to say....I LOVE THESE! I wish I would've found these sooner. Now they don't work well for in the diaper bag because they are all folded into the box and I would get annoyed having a bunch of random bags thrown in there but for at home use they are awesome! They are cheaper than a Diaper Genie too. Here are some things I like about these bags:1. They have a handle for easy carrying and closing the bag2. They are bigger. They hold all the wipes we used PLUS the messy diaper3. They do not smell up the room they are stored in. We just throw them in the bag and toss it in the laundry room garbage. No stinky diapers! (We have left them in there for 1 week till garbage day and they haven't stunk)4. They are excellent for potty training! My son is now 3 and only wears a pull up to bed at night so we only use one bag a day. You do the math on that deal! ;)Overall, they have a baby powder smell so they absorb odors and are just overall a great deal. I highly recommend them for anyone who has a child in diapers or are potty training.	
- 1	I have used other stroller hooks that work. These are pointless. IF you hang even the lightest thing from them, it pulls the velcro away and it all falls right off. Ridiculous! Waste of money, have to throw away.	
- 1	We started using the playtex drop ins and have used them for a while without problems but now the slow nipple is too slow but the medium nipple is way too fast, so we are looking for a new bottle.  Tommee Tippee is supposed to be wonderful so we decided to give them a try.  Unfortunately the nipple collapses every minute so my daughter has to stop and I have to fix the nipple multiple times.  Very frustrating.	
1. 	I used this at a company picnic and occasionally in the backyard. It's made well enough to not feel sharp sicks or grass poking through. It also doesn't appear to have any undone seams or rips.  Water that spilled seemed to bead up and wipe easily.I love that it folds up into a perfect little &#34;purse&#34; and has a carry strap. There is a &#34;guide&#34; of sorts that helps you fold it perfectly every time. It is a hardened panel stitched in that you fold around and it ends up being the rectangular little package that makes it easy to transport. It fit well in our stroller basket inside a mesh beach bag.The print is very nice and neutral. Not too loud.I used it for me, my husband, my 2-year old, and 4 month-old all together sitting at once. My husband 5'11, was able to sit with his legs extended and so was I, 5'4&#34;, while our little ones lying down in between.I had the KidCo Peadpod tent on the side as a private area to change diapers and store our valuables. It was so nice to have our little &#34;haven&#34; to eat our lunch and relax in between playing at the playground and activities.The only thing missing for next time would be a mini cooler with ice and drinks cause it was hot outside!The only cons I have are that it was just about the right size to fit us all. I wished it would have been larger so we wouldn't have been so confined, but then again, I can't complain since it suited our needs. I think if it were bigger, it would probably make it heavier or more cumbersome to lug around.	
- 1	Our breastfed baby isn't interested in these bottles at all. I was pretty disappointed because I wanted to switch over to glass bottles, but he wouldn't go for it. We use the Pura Kiki bottles instead. Wide mouth nipple, no plastic - that works for us. I wrote Lifefactory to find out if they're considering making a wide mouth nipple version and got no response. Will eventually use the one we bought to try out to hold snacks. Bummer.	
1. 	These are wonderful. Please wash a few times before wear to increase the absorption of the organic cotton. These pants, as well as the velour version, are much thicker than most and hold more pee. The brilliant part though is they-feel-pee and your-sofa-isn't ruined because there is a PUL liner hidden. This is the same thing that the baby's cloth diapers use and the reason they are more expensive than others. If you are at the late stage of training and just want a little extra coverage, buy something cheaper. These protect your house without another bulky cover. They also contain poop really really well. Even uper big accidents--never a leak once.Some people expect training pants to contain as much pee as a diaper or a toxic/potting training delaying/expensive disposable pull up. Um, no, and you shouldn't expect them to. A few accidents and the occasional pair of pants that need a change are fine and just part of the process.	
- 1	I bought this monitor with the thinking that if it was made by Motorola, the picture would be great. I was completely unimpressed. The picture was incredible grainy and disjointed. I returned it the next day. Ended up buying the Summer Complete Coverage Day and Night. More expensive, but well worth the money. The picture is so clear that I can see my baby breathing on both the flat screen and handheld. Go that route!	
- 1	I read all the good reviews and bought this miracle blanket for my 8 weeks baby. It was too many steps to swaddle the baby, and almost impossible to swaddle a cranky baby. My daughter did like it once she was swaddled, but in the morning when she was crying & kicking, the longer side of the wrap was wrapped around her neck, and her legs were already out. Dangerous!! I don't know why others like it so much, but it did not work for me.	
1. 	After trying many other brands and styles of bottles, my wife and I agree that the Playtex Ventaire are the best.Less pieces than Doc Brown, excellent venting system, inexpensive nipples to replace as your baby grows and you need higher flow.	
1. 	I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for.  I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it.  I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up).  However, this advertised as no tip over which is another reason I bought it.  I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere.  Other than that, so far it's good.	
1. 	I personally love the gummi rail. I bought it 3 years ago and put it on my daughter's crib. It stayed put and protected her crib. When my son was born he used the same crib. He was a chewer. He destroyed everywhere that did not have the gummi rail. He is now 1 1/2 years old and only one part of the rail is starting to come up in the middle. But seeing as it lasted 3 years, for me, it was definitely worth it and I will be buying a second one to fit an entire crib after our third is born.	
- 1	These cups are impossible to put together and take apart w/the handles. There are little ledges that hold the handles in place over the lid. I had to take a knife to pry it up to take it apart. These are also not leak proof. Milk ran all down my daughters shirt. Stupid pc of crap cups! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!	
- 1	I would be very careful when purchasing this!  This product is made of very good material (heck, I'd like to be bundled in one myself!) it is soft, washable and looks great.  The downside is that you should not be putting anything between the baby and the carseat because the carseat was not crash tested in such a manner.  Additionally, we have a Britax infant seat and because of the additional head support used in that carseat, there is barely any room for my daughters head and she's only 8 weeks old!  Sadly, we are returning this product and we're going to try one of the covers that only goes over the seat.	
1. 	16 pieces seems excessive until one drops on the floor, one is thrown, he'll want to hold one and feed himself, etc. It is amazing how many spoons you can go through in one day.	
1. 	I bought this because I already known the brand. But also I was curious about the &#34;Hot&#34; safety button, which is really helpful when having 2 kids. They understand if they can or not touch the window in order for them not to burn then selves.The price is quite right for a product like this!	
1. 	Cute, durable and fun!  My son absolutely loves these nesting buckets.  Two have bottoms where water can pour out.  Extremely durable.  I am considering buying a second set to keep in the bath tub!	
- 1	I rarely buy things on amazon that I never use, due to my diligent research prior to buying anything online.  Unfortunately, this product just did nothing for me.  I expected something very sturdy, since it's for your floor and you will obviously be putting things like a highchair on top of it.  Within a couple uses it ripped when I accidentally bumped my highchair.  I was shocked at the cheapness of it when I opened it, and totally amazed when it ripped so easily.  Waste of money, fold a waterproof table cloth in half and put it under your kids when they eat.	
1. 	This bib works perfectly for my 6-month old, who's just getting used to having solids put in his mouth. It rinses off in two seconds and catches everything. I can't imagine using a fabric bib, or one without a nice, open pocket like this one. Baby would have half his dinner in his lap.UPDATE: My son is now 2.5 years old and this is the best bib on earth. We use it for every meal at home and even some meals out (it's a little big for that, but oh well). No other design could conceivably prevent food (especially applesauce or yogurt) from going into the lap. I have no idea why any other bibs are even still on the market, except for drool-catching and spit-up absorbing.LOVE THIS BIB! Get two. You will want two.	
1. 	The seat is cute and easy to attach to just about any chair.  I wanted a booster seat to take to friends' houses or when we travel.  It folds easily/quickly, making it easy to transport.  When we're home, I use the seat when we're sitting at the table coloring or doing other crafts.  It has worked for me exactly how I need it.	
- 1	I read the Raving reviews and I am really confused on why.First off the beeping is driving me crazy. We live in a 1200 square foot home so when I am in the house, I am no further then 30 feet away from the baby. If you get too far away the monitor beeps if you get too close the monitor beeps and you have ZERO privacy. At 3am this morning I was woken by a squeal and a scream. I thought it was my baby but it came out to be that I was intercepting another radio call. It scared the daylights out of me.Another thing this Monitor has so much static it's crazy. I regret ever getting this monitor.I would avoid this monitor with a 10 foot pole.	
1. 	My boy really likes the toothpaste. I think it's because there is a fruity sweet taste that tastes like banana. However, the toothbrush damages easily. As kids, they tend to bite the toothbrush.For toothbrush, I will recommend the following. It's much strongerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KJBK3E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003KJBK3E&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20	
- 1	&#34;Fits most faucets&#34;... but this did not fit ours. Its cute, but we won't be able to use it. Too bad, its the only faucet protector to fit our baby's rubber ducky themed bathroom.	
1. 	We LOVED this item.  We were concerned about rolling over on our daughter while we had her sleeping in our bed, so this item avoided that problem.  We could check on her during the night and feed her without getting out of bed.  We used it for the first nearly 4 months, until she actually got so big that we cut the end off (obviously, not recommended) so she could stretch her legs for the last few weeks (she was unusually tall at 4 months, at 27).  I can see using this only with a king-sized bed.  One would be too cramped in a queen-sized bed.  Note that each parent will have to use separate top blankets and sheets on either side of the sleeper.  The only downsides were (1) the nightlight, which I found useless because the light points up and so did not illuminate her face.  However, the light is removable, so I suppose one could use it by taking it out.  And (2), the manufacturer did not make extra fitted sheets last time I checked.  The sheet has velcro which keeps the little mattress in place (although it does not move much), and loose sheets are not recommended for reasons of safety.  Therefore, if the sheet gets soiled in the middle of the night, then good luck.  The mattress did flatten a little where her head was by the end of 4 months.  I have seen comments that the mattress is not soft, but it's really softer than our crib mattress.  The entire unit is machine washable (once certain parts are removed, which is easy), and we dried the whole thing in the dryer.  We would have brought the sleeper with us on a trip we took after she turned 4 months if she hadn't grown out of it so early.  The item was perfect until we transitioned her to her crib at 4 months.	
1. 	Agree with much of the positive reviews here, and wanted to add that the baskets are slender enough across to fit our standard dishwasher top rack without straddling wires, which I was a little worried about. Taking away one star because the nipples undertray is great but tends to squish the nipples a bit when you close it -- either I'm not loading properly or the nipples are too big (? because they're newborn) or it's just a bit shorter than it needs to be. Still, everything seems to get clean and I'd say this is a good buy.	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
1. 	A great way to freeze fruit and introduce safely to baby.  Need to get a few more of these and give to friends as gifts.	
1. 	My son uses this style of nipple. It really helps with him inhaling air while he eats. Since we switched to the wide nipples his gas, tummy aches, and projectile vomiting has stopped.	
1. 	Our 3 year old has had these squirters since he was a baby and he still demands the crab and turtle for his baths.  As a baby I think he liked that they were soft and squishy and colorful.  As a toddler he loves filling them with water and squirting them.  When my niece visits, she loves the dolphin and octopus and together they have loads of fun squirting each other.They are soft enough that my son can still fill them with water when he can't with other squirters.  It's just a great, colorful set.	
- 1	So this form of recycling actually sounds like a good idea until you actually receive the product. The texture feels like a thicker version of a milk carton, even after it's been formed into utensils. Typically this wouldn't bother me, or my kids for that matter, but they bend for anything and are extremely cheap. I wouldn't recommend this.	
1. 	My baby girl loves this bunny. It has all sorts of knots she can chew on and it's soft and cuddly.	
1. 	We have been huge fans of Halo products from the start. We used the swaddled all the time for our daughter for the first few months. We even had an issue with one of the swaddles and my husband emailed the Halo company about it and received a response from the FOUNDER of the company who seemed genuinely appreciative of our feedback.For that reason, we have stuck with this brand and have been using the wearable blankets as she has grown. She currently wears a fleece one to bed every night and will wear these cotton ones during the spring.  These are wonderful products made by a great company who stands behind them.	
1. 	This basket is made well enough - not exceptional, but fine.  Bedding is kind of thin.	
- 1	This is a really big waste of money. $9 for a piece of rough wood on a string? It doesn't look like a  bird from most angles, just a wavy shape. I recommend going with another teether.	
1. 	I have 30 of these. I got one pack as a gift and bought the other.In nearly 4 months of daily use, several of them have lost stitches on the edges. It does not affect the functionality of the wipes, but I wonder how long it will be before the fabric frays. However, as many others have mentioned, these are very inexpensive, and I suppose I could find some time and maybe figure out how to use that sewing machine I have stuffed away somewhere and restitch the edge. But honestly these are so inexpensive that when they really start to fray and go, I will have gotten my money's worth out of them.

- 1	I should have listened to other reviews. I don't like that the sleeves are open and food can get inside. Besides that I don't like the material. I wiped it down and it got all wrinkly and crinkled. Looks really bad now. I bought the Bumpkins instead and am happier with that.	
- 1	The Ziploc seal rips away from the sides within a couple uses!! This must not be a problem for all batches of this product (Lots of people love these!) I did my research and thought this product would be the best. I only hand washed them and after the first one broke in less than 1 week, I opened the other 3 as carefully as possible (only to have all the pouches rip the same way). We so wanted these pouches to work, so we could make our own purees and save money on the dozens of pouches we go through each month. Like others with this problem (read the 1 star reviews) the company sent us 4 new pouches, but after 3 of our 4 original pouches broke, I wanted a refund (which they agreed to....after I return the 4 replacement pouches). This product certainly won't hold up over time (which it needs to do to make the $20 cost worth it!) Plus, it's made in China! Come on!	
- 1	These bibs are cheap but you get what you paid for.  The velcro comes off easily and the loopy side is very rough and sharp.  My husband tried to take the bib off of our baby once and it slipped and gave him a bad gash on his neck!  Our baby drools and spits up a lot too and it goes right thru the bibs and onto his clothes.  It's not worth it.  We'll stick with the Carter's ones from now on since their velcros are very soft and it actually sticks.	
1. 	This is a brush of really good quality. I've been using this for about 3 months now, and it still works great and is very clean. The brush fits in very well with my Philips Avent, Dr Brown's (narrow mouth) and Ameda bottles. Does a great job cleaning bottles and nipples.	
1. 	Very soft, good amount of padding, fits great (even with the 2 1/2&#34; mattress we purchased extra), and has held up to washings on delicate cycle.  We also have the Carter's one, and this is much better quality.  Buy it - you won't regret it!	
1. 	Now that my daughter is eating finger foods I use this bib all the time. It's very good to avoid a big mess at meal times. The material is very good. It doesn't create mildew like other bids, it's very easy to wash and it dries really fast, so I can have it ready for the next meal. It's worth buying it! The reason whay I only gave 4 stars it's because I don't like the designs that much.	
1. 	These are really easy to install if you line them up how you want them and mark where you need to drill.  I like them because they stay in place, and if installed properly its easy for adults to open the cabinets, but too difficult for babies.	
1. 	My son loves to watch the water come out of the hippo's mouth and has saved his head several times. Highly recommend.	
- 1	I purchased this stroller after reading other reviews. My tires pretty much came to me flat. I am a 5 K runner. I like to run on nature or paved trails. If you have a sharp curve then you may want a swival wheel. Not sure. I Am more disappointed the tires are flat after three runs.	
- 1	I initially liked the feel of the bottle and the ease of flow through the nipple-much better flow than others I have reviewed thus far. I appreciated being able to see it closed by lining up the blue arrows on the bottle with the opening on the plastic ring. I get a little impatient since it is harder for me to open when I'm busy and used to opening bottles up with one hand under my arm. When performing a similar task, I had to pass this bottle off to my older daughter to open.However, the nipple is another matter-you can easily grab it, pulling the whole thing out!This bottle is designed with a U shaped indentation at the base of the nipple where it pokes out over the ring. This space yields a frustratingly LEAKY BOTTLE, aside from the fact that the WHOLE NIPPLE can be easily removed from the top.Also, the mixing paddle (attached to an inner ring within the bottle) didn't work well for us...Powder remnants plastered against the inside bottom...Thankfully, it's removable, but we still can't get past the rest.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend.	
1. 	It took quite a bit of trial and error to find the perfect sippies, but these are the ones for us, without a doubt. I love the fact that there's no valve to clean or lose, and we've never had problems with leaks. So simple! There are plenty of cute designs, and they've held up well for us. I was relieved to find they were BPA-free, because I can't imagine starting all over again and trying once again to find a great sippy. These are lightweight and easy, and they work. Probably not best as a first sippy for infants, but definitely the right choice once your babe gets the hang of drinking from a sippy.One nitpicky detail: the lids of the princess sippies we own are opaque, not translucent as they appear in the product photo.	
1. 	I got this for a friend's child and he loves it!  It saves the random tags around their house from getting destroyed too!  The ball itself has soothing pastel colors and is very soft.  Great for rolling or tossing.	
1. 	This works great in our master bath since we have an oversized tub and I need the added height this kneeler provides to reach/bathe my baby. In our other (smaller/lower) tub, I only use a towel -- since the step/kneeler would give me too much height and cause me to bend over more and hurt my back. So ... figure out if you need added height before buying this. If you don't, go with a pad (or just folded towel).	
- 1	We use cloth wipes pretty much exclusively when we are at home, and I purchased several types before my son was born based on reviews and cost.  These wipes are very rough compared to the grovia and organic magnolia wipes I purchased at the same time about 5 months ago, and they are smaller and hold less poop than the grovia wipes (grovia wipes are made of polyester, so there's that).  The magnolia wipes are similar to a soft, thick cotton t-shirt and not absorbent, so I use them for pees only if I can help it.  These also started fraying heavily at the edges within a couple of washes, and hold a funky odor when used in my Prince Lionheart wipes warmer (my cloth diapers don't smell and they are laundered at the same time, so it is not my washing routine).  I've had to stop using them in the wipes warmer because they were making my other wipes and the warmer smell.  I am still using then for washcloths, if needed, but am tempted to throw them away.  I really like under the nile as a company, but these wipes kinda suck.  I'm giving them 2 stars because I guess they technically work for wiping bottoms, I just don't care for them.	
- 1	I am disappointed with this mattress. It has cracks allover and unfortunately after a year of using I have to replace it with new one.I would not recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	I love the Ventaire line of baby bottles but these are by far my favorite. The wide bottle makes it easier for baby to hold on to while the feeder is also able to hold on to assist the baby. I don't think Ventaire can get any better than these!	
1. 	I actually *am* one of those moms who bought a fancy travel system, but I ended up sticking it in the closet and using this stroller most of the time!  It is SO much more convenient.  Initially, I bought the Snap 'n Go just for travel (to accomodate the car seat provided by the rental car company), but I loved it so much I kept using it at home.  I can grab it out of my trunk and it literally falls open ready to go (don't worry, there is a clip to keep it closed for when you need it!).  So incredibly easy.  Don't underestimate how much you will appreciate having:  a) cup holders that actually accomodate different sized containers, b) a tray area for your keys, cell phone, etc., c) a huge basket so you don't have to cram everything under the stroller, d) wide-set wheels so you won't constantly be kicking the stroller when walking, e) great turning / smooth rolling, f) a stroller you don't have to fiddle with for 10 minutes to get your carseat attached.  It really is a great product.  (Only downside....hard to find a solution for shading the sun.)  (Note...obviously this stroller has no educational value!  :)  But I'm being forced to provide a rating for all categories, so I'll just give it a 5 for everything.)	
1. 	We registered for this diaper pail after a lot of research online. Now that our son is 8 weeks old, we've loved it so much we purchased another one so we have one on both floors of the house. It's very easy to use - just flip the handle - and allows absolutely no odor to escape. It's very easy to empty and change the bag. What I love is it uses regular trash bags so there's no expensive refills to keep purchasing. This is what I'm going to buy for every baby shower I go to from now on!	
- 1	Took forever to put on and didn't keep the bottles close enough to my body to work correctly. Plus, who has time to take off her shirt at work? Once I learned to hold the bottles with my left hand and forearm and had my right hand free for iPhone-ing, I never looked back.	
1. 	My daughter has been using this swing since just after birth.  At first she only liked the sided to side motion, but now that she's older likes front to back motion.  Batteries hold up pretty well.  Music and light turn off after a few minutes.  There is a reset buttonto turn music back on immediately.  My daughter doesn't care much for the music, but the water sound relaxes her.  Only drawback is that it is huge.  Takes up a lot of space.  We were in the process of moving when I was pregnant, so we didn't know that our new place would have a small living room.  Other than it taking up a lot of space it's great.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor at the Apple store.  It was really easy to set up and the picture quality is great.  It's nice to be able to easily launch an app and view the baby from anywhere, not just on the home network.  BUT - the sound doesn't work.  All you hear is a staticy white noise.  Not only that, but the volume on the white noise is inconsistent.  It would get super loud suddenly, then cut down to nothing.  At one point in the night, the sound turned off altogether.  Thankfully the baby's room is close to our bedroom otherwise I wouldn't have heard her crying.  I contacted customer support about the sound issue and they had said an update to the app would be released near the end of the month (March 2014).  I was skeptical since the issue had been reported before and was even in their FAQs.  I asked if they were positive an update would be sent since I had only 2 weeks to return the monitor to Apple.  They advised me to return it and get a replacement.  I returned it, but I purchased the Medisala Monitor instead and couldn't be happier.	
- 1	I bought this after purchasing the Bugaboo Donkey but unfortunately it does not sit right on the handles. It flops down & is very cumbersome. I wish I still had to packaging to return it because we don't use it at all. Just attach your diaper bag & use the pockets in that because this doesn't sit right at all.	
1. 	This was a life saver as the original play yard that we bought was not big enough. We found that when adding these extensions it was the perfect size for our son to move around and still have room for his toys	
1. 	we did not buy a traditional high chair, one because this one received so many great reviews, two, because i didn't want another item at the dinner table taking up too much space, and lastly, because i wanted something EASY to clean and many high chairs have the seats that you have to take off and throw in the laundry. This booster is perfect - just like everyone else seems to think. as soon as my girl could sit up, we put her in this at the dinner table and it's been great ever since. wipes up easily on the sides where her food-dirtied hands touch, and the other peices clip right off and fit into our dish washer - easy breezy! love this and highly recommend.	
1. 	saves headaches looking for pacifiers that seem to always get lostplus it is cute and doesn't tear clothing when it gets pulled off	
1. 	These are not easy to remove....actually, they are a nuisance if you decide you want to use the outlet.  However, they need to be because it doesn't take much for a curious or dexterous child to figure out how to remove other styles of plugs.  I have three kinds in the house, and these are by far my favorite.  There is no way he is going to be able to remove these!	
1. 	Good quality, very soft, and excellent fit on pairing changing pad. I do wish they had two packs available for sale like they do on many other brands, though.	
1. 	We keep this stool under the sink in the bathroom so our son can wash his hands. When he's taller he'll be able to use it to get to the big potty as well. It seems completely safe, it is pretty innocuous looking, and we have no complaints. He can't quite reach the faucet yet, but it gets him close enough that with a little adult help he can wash his hands by himself which is all we need. I am confident it will last a long time. It's light enough for him to pick up and put into position, but the rubber bottom means that he can't really drag it or kick it around without picking up -- a plus in my book, as it trains him not to just push things around when they should be picked up and carried.	
1. 	Baby Einstein rocks!  This activity mat was the best baby gift I received.  From a few weeks old through about 6 months old, this was my baby's favorite toy.  In the beginning she's stare lovingly at the ladybug.  Then she discovered the star and she fell in love!  Once she discovered how to kick the mat to make the star play music, she was in heaven.  As soon as the music stopped, she would kick the mat again.  She would do this over and over again.  For months, the only way I could escape to take a shower was to put her on this mat.  When she got older, she loved playing with all of the hanging toys.  I got this as a gift, but if I had bought it, it would have been well worth the money!  I highly recommend this product.	
- 1	The suctions do not work.  It falls off no matter where you try to stick it in the tub.  I returned this product.	
1. 	I love this as a snap-n-go for my Graco35. We were going back and forth between buying this and buying the adaptor bar for our City Mini but opted for this since it's lighter and more convenient.  I actually don't love the car seat itself (Graco35) but this in combination as a stroller was perfect for the first 6 months.  It's lightweight, has ample storage and cupholders, steers well.  Not a lot bad to say about it, except that sometimes when it's folded the &#34;one-touch&#34; open button doesn't work because the wheels kind of lock together.  Then you have jiggle the wheels a bit then the button works.  It was easy to snap the car seat in to place.  All in all, this is a product I'm glad I bought and would use again if we used the same car seat for the next kid.	
1. 	i love them. they are small enough to pack in a  diaper bag without taking a ridiculous amount of space.	
- 1	The product works but it is not as pictured. I had specifically bought this brand because it is the same as one I had bought for my older son. The tab to open it is not as pictured and makes it difficult to use. I thought I made the mistake and didn't really it was their mistake until I already opened and used it. So beware!!	
- 1	After reading about how great this kettle was, I finally gave in and bought it. At first use, yes, it was great. But after only ONE month of use, the sensor/connection between the kettle and base stopped working. I tried cleaning the base and the kettle, tried unplugging the unit and replugging, turning the unit on and off... nothing worked. Now it is just a water jug, that doesn't even keep the water warm.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews about other bottle warmers.  Some claimed that water would get trapped and were hard to clean.  This one is pretty easy and straight forward.  It does an excellent job at warming our bottles.  It will simply warm up any water that's in the compartment.  With that said, if you pour too much or too little water in, that will alter the results.  The only downside for me is that it won't let you warm glass baby bottles.  I think it's a great product for the price and simplicity.	
- 1	I bought this to replace a larger whole-house style humidifier and ultimately it was disappointing.Pros:- Quiet enough not to disturb baby- Ability to aim mist from top (it turns to direct mist)- Tank is not heavy and could be filled in bathroom sink- Bottom base, easy to clean (not easy to clean water tank)- Tight seal on bottom of tank- No filters to replace (though does require those useless protect cartridges)Cons:- If you don't leave some water in the base (walk it carefully back to your room), when you load the water tank onto the clean, empty base about 1/3 of the water in the tank is immediately lost so you have to refill the tank again to make it through the night- Impossible to clean water tank (despite soaking with bleach and vinegar) - we had nasty pink stuff growing and it couldn't be reached - soaking in vinegar didn't work, neither did the bleach- Plastic was flimsy - tank cracked in the middle of the second winter (though I was washing this thing every single day and did my best to be gentle and not bang it on the sink while attempting to reach the mold inside)For the $25 I paid, it got me through a winter and I learned a valuable lesson about cool mist humidifiers - AVOID. I actually ended up writing a review today because I was researching safety of these types of units and as it turns out, cool mist humidifiers have the potential to cause some real harm by spreading microbes and minerals from the water into the air. My next purchase will be a warm mist humidifier, with a UV light.	
- 1	Reviews were great so I bought it. Waste of money. Doesn't recline enough for them to even call it a &#34;reclining&#34; stroller. Feels super cheap and rickety. Very bumpy ride. My daughter couldn't begin to nap in this - and she naps anywhere. Regret the purchase. Spend the extra money and get an uppababy g-lite or something. Wish I had.	
1. 	My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's not too loud and lights up with pretty colors.  He goes back to it time and time again but never gets tired of it.  I highly recommend it!	
1. 	We bought Max to attach to our son's stroller when he was under a year old. He turns 4 this month and STILL likes to fiddle with it when he's in the stroller. I was concerned that the elastic might break, but 3+ years of heavy tugging haven't damaged or stretched it at all. When our son was very young he would stretch it up to his mouth to chew on and it survived that as well. We are now on our second child and she is as fascinated with Max as our son was. I definitely recommend this toy, especially for a stroller distraction. We didn't use a clip to attach it, we simply widened the elastic and threaded the entire toy through the loop for a secure fit. We also attached it to the stroller lap strap (the one that comes up between the legs) and the bonus is that we never have to search or fish for that strap--we just grab Max and it's there.	
1. 	We have an awesome little girl who just turned 4, and my husband and I thought she would like this. She has Autism, and isn't easy to buy for! She LOVES this! It is amazing how well it projects stars and the moon onto her ceiling, I had no idea it would be as amazing as it is. Even her 8 year old brother loves this thing, and her dad and I like it too. =) The colors are bright and vivid. Beautiful! If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just do it! =) Your little one will LOVE it!	
- 1	We used the grovia liners at first, but decided to try these when we ran out because they were cheaper and had pretty good reviews. We hate them! They are so thin and soft that they basically fall apart when anything wet touches them, and we change diapers frequently. Solid material has actually broken through the middle of the liner because of the weight of it and the thinness of the material. Changing dirty diapers has become a messy ordeal, when these are supposed to simplify it. I reordered the grovia liners and will not be finishing this box.	
1. 	This is a nice option for those without electricity or if you want a silent pump. It took me 30 mins to pump 3 oz. With the electric version it takes me 15 mins. Would definitely recommend to all if you are looking for a hand pump.	
- 1	It works OK. Using the top opening doesn't keep the extender attached while the water is running and the back opening causes a pool of water to collect after use.  When you use the back opening, the angle of the extender points up rather than towards the bottom of the sink.	
1. 	Our little grandson loves these small, easy to grasp toys in the tub. They don't squirt all that well, but he doesn't care and loves holding and sucking on them anyway! Cute and durable, and for more than just the bath.	
- 1	This seat was recommended to me by someone who owns a caravan and who had luck with it. Unfortunately i have a Mountaineer and this car seat just does not fit comfortably anywhere in the back seat in the rear facing position.Problems: The latch cord wasn't long enough so we had to do the seatbelt install instead.The seat is so huge that our only option was to put it behind the front passenger seat. In order to have it reclined correctly, we had to remove the base, use 3 pool noodles AND a blanket....but now the person in the front passenger seat is too close to the dashboard. For a family of long legs, this doesn't work out too well.The buckle is very tricky.....with practice, you eventually get used to it and the straps keeps twisting.Good things: Seat is comfortable and safe. Height adjust is super easy, especially in New England weather...when baby may be wearing a snowsuit one day and a sweatshirt the next.  Fabric is easily washable.I wish i had talked to other SUV owners before i bought this one to see what else they recommended. I will be much happier with it when we can switch to forward facing in 6 months.	
- 1	I received this mattress today, and was excited to begin using it, it seemed nice and firm and like it would last us a long while without wearing out.And then we put it in the crib....and it didn't fit. It clearly slid around inside the crib from front to back.  It is very important for the mattress to properly fit inside a crib, with no gaps, and this clearly had gaps. I thought it was strange, since our crib has fit other mattresses just fine, so I decided to measure the mattress.  It clearly states on the Moonlight website and on Amazon that it is 52'' long, but the one I received was slightly under 51'', leaving a gap big enough for me to fit my entire hand in on the end of the crib.Im not sure if I received a defective mattress or if they all measures this size, but its something to keep in mind before purchasing this mattress.	
- 1	Loved the design. Stopped using it after two days. 1) It leaks. 2) If dropped the cap opens up. I'll keep it for when my baby will be able to drink from a regular cup.	
1. 	We were using a high chair for some time, but when our toddler graduated to a booster seat we put our high chair in storage.  We do not use the tray attachment, but rather pull him up to the dining table with us.  Perfect for meal time or activity time, he loves it so much he even points to it to let us know its time to climb on in. Attaches to the chair in seconds with two simple snaps for the chair seat and chair back, makes removal for cleaning a snap.  The only draw back is that it has a non-slip butt portion which can be hard to clean.	
- 1	These are awful.  Once you wash them they curl up into a tight scroll and will not lay flat again.  Terrible purchase.  After unsuccessfully trying to get them to lay flat I threw them away.  What a waste.	
- 1	I find these get stuck and I can't ever use the outlet. I am prying them out with a screw driver and switching to the outlet covers that close.	
1. 	I bought these with high hopes of using them with my son. I honestly never remembered I had them on the shelf and hardly used them. My friends love them and got a lot of use out of them.	
1. 	This high chair is great.  My son is a little over 6 months old and we've been using it for about a month now.  It attaches easily to your standard kitchen chair - but the straps are long enough to even attach to a bulkier dinning room chair if needed.  It is very stable.  My son is quite tall/big for his age and we've had no problems with stability at all.  It comes with a 5 point harness - but we only use the three.  I love how it can be adjusted to tilt to multiple levels.  It's also very easy to clean.  My son is a spitter as they call them and has a very slight gag reflex.  So if a little bit of cereal goes down the wrong pipe or he catches some extra air with a bite of squash then all it takes is a couple good coughs and all of dinner is up and all over the place!  Granted I can't wait until he's over this stage, but until then I need a chair that is easy to clean and this one is!  The cover and the straps come off very easily.  I just take it all over to the sink, hose it off and hang dry it on a drying rack.  I've never tried washing it in the machine.  This routine occurs a couple times a week and I can have it all apart and back on in under a minute.  I would definitely buy this again, especially since your child can use it through the toddler years.	
- 1	I registered for a bunch of these - different sizes and materials. I knew I'd try swaddling my daughter, and this seemed an easy way to do it.When I first used this, my daughter easily got her hands out and could wriggle them around (down under the bottom of the swaddle part) and would wake herself.The biggest problem I had with it, though, is it made holding my daughter for breastfeeding really difficult. I would unwrap her so she could have her arms free, but the sack part was hard to hold. I switched to theSwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Triplets Paisley, Kiwi, and now to theThe Miracle Blanket Swaddler formerly known as the Amazing Miracle Blanket - Green w/ Blue Trim. I have to fully unwrap her for both, but it wakes her less than taking the entire sleep sack off (which is more like taking off her pj's).Many reviewers say this is great for the transition from swaddling. My daughter is 13 weeks, and we'll try to move her from swaddling soon. I will try this again - she doesn't wake up much when I feed her at night, so partially removing the sack, without the swaddle part, may not be as much a problem.This is not a terrible product by any means. It's just that in my experience it made holding my baby for breastfeeding very difficult.	
- 1	I did not care for this because it  looked like a straight jacket for babies. When I put my baby in it she went ballistic until I unwrapped her. Back to the old fashion way.	
1. 	This is the perfect size! It's large enough for my 3 year old to get both feet on comfortably but not so bulky that it gets in the way in the bathroom. It also has a really nice rubber top so it's not slippery as well as rubber grip on the bottom so it's not sliding around on the tile floors.	
1. 	I love this because i can take it anywhere and have somewhere for baby to sleep. I comes with me when i go clean homes and I love that I can set My baby anywhere without having to put it together like the pak n play that we have. Doesn't take up very much room in our tiny bedroom. It seems very sturdy still after 3 moths of everyday use. I would recommend getting 2 sets of sheets for it.	
1. 	We use this tub for our newborn.  The tub fits directly in my kitchen sink, so no need to bend over and strain to wash the baby.  It has a place to keep my washcloth and her shampoo.  It also has a convenient drain that changes color when the water is too hot.  My baby seems very comfortable in the hammock with the padded head.The only drawback is that the tub is large.  For me, this isn't a problem - I store it in our guest bathtub.  But if you have limited living space, it might not work for you.	
1. 	This bathtub is great, but it only works for children who can sit up without support and even then, it probably won't last past a child's 2nd birthday.  It's too narrow for a bigger child.  I know it's a lot to ask that a tub work for a newborn baby, a sitting baby, and a toddler, but as a parent with tons of baby things already, I look for items that will accommodate and grow with my child.  Anything that will last longer and is multi-functional is greatly appreciated.However, like I said, it is cute enough that I bought it anyway and my son loves playing in it.  I agree with the other reviewer who said that the baby can't squeeze the beak.  It might just be that it's fun for us adults to watch their child play in such a cute tub.	
1. 	This is the only potty chair we used with our little one.  We didn't use bells and whistles.  We didn't use stickers.  This was all she needed.  It was very ergonomical for her little frame.	
1. 	Here is my comparison of the Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Cover to Safety 1st Swivel Outlet Cover.  We have two of each and all have been installed for between 2 weeks and 2 months.For Mommys Helper Safe Plate:Pros:Doesn't feel flimsyEasy to plug in/ unplug itemsEasy to installLooks niceIncluded screws fit and match the color of the outlet plateCons:Slightly more expensive than Safety 1st Swivel Outlet coverOnly replaces single screw outlet coversMight be slightly easier for toddlers to figure out than swivel coversI've never heard of Mommys Helper before	
- 1	These are really easy to put on, which is a plus. However, they don't really block the sun very well, and they kind of obstruct my view when I'm driving.	
1. 	this product saved us a lot of grief. baby would not nap without it for the first couple months.  Battery life is decent, but wish they had a AC plug in model.  also the music shut off every 7 minutes, should play for longer.  The legs started bending a little too, towards the end, but over very happy we got it.  you won't regret it either if you baby has some trouble sleeping.	
1. 	I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too.  Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off.  I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.**Edit 2/27/13: I had contacted the company about this problem who asked me to send the giraffe back. We did so and have since received a brand new giraffe and are very happy.  I have changed the rating from two stars to five for the satisfying customer service.	
1. 	This tub is great, not sure why people had to give it bad reviews. Tub doesn't float with the baby in it and my son loved it! Not once did it slide and he loved hitting the tub and hearing the sound of the beads inside. Very roomy tub and I even use it as a play pad after it is done drying. It helps sit him up and even if he slides the bumper sides are awesome. You can have baby on their tummy to wash their back comfortably.	
1. 	We tried tommee tippee before and was not impressed. It was awkward to hold and was bulky. My brother in law recommended this and since then my son did not have big spit ups or gas (since he was 4 months?) It is a bit annoying to wash all the parts but at least with the bottom coming out, I know it is clean. Sometimes, there are some drips that come out but only cause I didn't push the rubber thing on the bottom firmly in.	
- 1	I put these on my registry, and tried them out.  The baby couldnt figure these out, and just got frustrated.  They were ridiculous to clean.  I went on to try Tommee Tippee (only sold at BrU, fyi) and they were perfect.  We are a Tommee Tippee family, now.	
1. 	I can't say enough about these wearable blankets. My little guy is 19 months, and he rolls around all night. Regular blankets don't stay on so these are perfect. He wears these fleece ones in winter with a fleece onesie underneath.	
- 1	My LO doesn't like using this snack cup as much as I thought he would. He is not afraid of this line of products, but we have had a bad experience with the entire line from nuby (normally our favorite and go-to brand). His little 1 year old hand gets stuck in the mouth and he gets easily frustrated. I have the worst time trying to clean it out when we do use it. I didn't even realize that it came apart until I read other reviews. :( Very disappointed in this entire line of products.	
- 1	It was broken when it arrived.  I was very excited to get it and help to protect my kids.  But it arrived broken and I had to return it.	
1. 	This adorable toy by Haba has lasted well through two different children and over 6 years of play. I love how Haba uses quality paint. It never chips (unlike Melissa and Doug).	
1. 	Our baby doesn't love these, but they do a great job of removing those pesky boogers. A good friend warns that this can become addictive.	
1. 	I was in the market for something that would be easier to travel with, rather than my big bulky electric pump. This worked out perfectly! It was comfortable and easy to use. I also like that everything comes apart easily so that I would wash and steralize every part. This is great for moms who are on the road alot.	
- 1	this think fell off my car and i almost got into an accident. it doesn't stay on well and isn't safe. i would not recommend this stay away	
1. 	I bought this for my 7 month old baby to distract him and help him wind down when he's being fussy before bedtime. The colors are vivid and soothing, and it's the perfect amount of light to help him see a little without being so bright that he can't fall asleep. We put the turtle up on his dresser and the stars cover his whole ceiling. I love that it turns itself off after a while so the light doesn't bother him while he sleeps. I hope this lasts him a long time because I can see him enjoying it when he's older as well.Update: I just figured out that if you hit the on button twice in a row, the light automatically changes colors every few seconds! So pretty! I really love this thing.	
- 1	My toddler and infant both love these sippies, since there isn't much resistance to get the liquid out (some sippies are ridiculously hard to drink out of) but these straws are total junk. They're thin and if your child bites on them at all, they rip. We ordered these replacements, and they ripped within a couple months. Really need to find a new sippy to switch to, but my toddler is pretty resistant to sippy change. The sippies also leak like crazy after a while.	
- 1	On first glance, I liked this item, the color goes well with our decor. But it doesn't fit quite right. There are velcro attachments that go in between the railings and it doesn't fit our convertible crib as well as in the advertised picture. As a result, there is a bulge in the cloth in the middle. It doesn't look too great, but it does the job.... providing a soft space for teething... However, as soon as my son noticed that his previously hard and wooden crib rail wasn't available to gnaw on anymore, he didn't use the soft cloth as a teether, he just went over to the side rails and chewed on them! I was thinking of purchasing the side rail covers, but then he will just go for the back rail, so I'd have to purchase the whole system to protect all sides of the crib, and that's getting expensive. I think this product would be better if it was made out of a different material, soft is not something my kid likes to sink his teeth into.	
1. 	Our little guy loves this in our cold Colorado climate. It takes the sting off the cold changing pad in the morning and is so super soft. I still use a towel on top as well just to keep from having to clean this all the time. It fits the pad very well and seems to clean pretty easily. We haven't had any stains yet. The fabric is a wonderfully soft plush fabric so your baby will thank you for it. Overall, not completely necessary but i'm glad we purchased it, especially for colder climates.	
- 1	This cover did not fit the Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller.  The seams were in the wrong place and the front end of the cover did not reach to the wheel where the slit should sit.  We ended up with no coverage under the tray so baby's legs could be exposed to the cold air while we were in motion.  As we attempted to get the right fit, two sections of seaming tore away from the plastic.  We purchased the Jeep cover specifically because we had a Jeep stroller - so disappointed that it didn't fit.  As for the smell, I did open the cover and hang it in the basement for 2 days before attempting to put it on the stroller and there was virtually no smell.  I can't imaging putting my baby under the cover without airing it out first.	
1. 	Just received this item and it is exactly as described. Love the opening so I can look down at my little one. Although not expecting until Oct 2013 I am looking forward to using this. not sure if the size is too small but it looks good.	
1. 	A friend of mine recommend this and it is SO nice!  Love that it can be taken with you easily to restaurants and other places.  Very safe and secure.  I really am happy with this purchase and MUCH cheaper than other versions out there!	
- 1	Be careful with this old model. It only has a THREE point harness. My 7 month old son fell on his head when he leaned over without the tray on. The right strap came undone, the left strap held him suspended for a second, and then he slipped out and fell on his head. We called 911 and went to the emergency room. Tomy has a newer model with a FIVE point harness. They should not be selling these old ones anymore when they know it is an inferior product. I sent Tomy and the CPSC an email about the fall. I will destroy the chair after they contact me. Also note that in 2007, this similar high chair was recalled because the straps came apart from the chair.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEDecember 6, 2007Release #08-120Firm's Recall Hotline: (866) 725-4407CPSC Recall Hotline: (800) 638-2772CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908RC2 Recalls The First Years(tm) Children's Feeding Seats Due to Fall HazardWASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product.

1. 	No more kicking off socks, covers or blankets. I love that i know he is sleeping warm and cozy bundled up in his wearable blanket.	
- 1	My son has two other sets of stacking discs which he absolutely loved.  When I saw this item, I loved the idea that the magnets would offer a different take on the blocks from the Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Rock-a-Stack and Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker.  Unfortunately, the toy did not live up to expectations.  Although the wooden base, 5 brightly colored rings and bear head are nicely made from wood, the  magent is extremely weak.  In addition, at least one of the discs repels the disc above and below it, regardless of which way I flip the discs to re-stack.  As a result, it keeps collapsing and cannot be reassembled.  Although my son has enjoyed tossing around the independent pieces, this product did not serve its basic purpose as a stacking toy.	
1. 	It doesn't work as well as I had hoped for making bubbles for the kids, but it does waterfall effect the water away from the spout which is a big safety plus.	
- 1	I should've listened to other reviews and passed on this purchase. The cup leaks so it isn't worth the money I spent.	
1. 	All of my children have had dry, irritated skin in the winter time!  I have always come back to Mustela Hydra Stick with all three of them!  It is so easy to apply.  I use it on my 7 month old and I can still use it on my 6 year old.  Great product!  Nice, soft smell!  I just love it.	
1. 	nice product, works as described.	
- 1	I received three different sets of hooded towels for my baby as gifts and this one I like the least.  It wasn't as plush as the other brands (Carter's ducky towel is my favorite of the three) and it got even rougher in texture with each wash.  The frog applique on the hood is also stiff and not really nice against baby's forehead and it gets a bit rolled up after a few washes and wont lay flat anymore.  With the name of spasilk you would be expecting a softer material, and it just isn't.I would spend a couple extra dollars and buy a set that is more plush and soft, especially for babies delicate skin.	
- 1	Terrible!! These replacement lids are terrible. In fact, this is a terrible product all together. The cups leak really badly.	
- 1	I ordered this diaper pail because I just love Charlie Banana OS cloth diapers. I used it straight out of the box and the first poopy diaper I had to rinse leaked right through this diaper pail. The zipper is on the bottom of mine (which doesn't make much sense) and the water came right through it in the corner. If the zipper were not on the bottom, I'm sure it would work just fine. Thank you Figure 8 Maternity for giving me a full refund! I ordered a few Planet Wise pail liners to put down in a trash can instead.	
- 1	Cheap material, I returned it.It is not sturdyenough to use ever day.I was even afraid tobrake before returning the stuff.	
- 1	Well i bought this product with the idea that it would keep my wipes from freezing if left in the car since we live in alaska. but it doesn't seem to retain the heat well and dries the wipes out since it isn't large enough to put the wettable lionheart cushion in it. DOES NOT HOLD A LOT OF WIPES IT ACTUALLY ONLY HOLDS ENOUGH FOR MAYBE 1-3 CHANGES. It comes with a house and car charge but does not take batteries so the wipes do NOT stay warm once its unpluggged so what is the point i ask?! its pretty though and durable, but HEAVY, thick, and bulky! Takes up WAY too much room in my diaper bag. I've only used it a few times. wish i could get a refund. WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK FOR CLOTH WIPES, sorry all of us cloth diapering mamas we got shafted again!	
- 1	I have a 15 month old daughter that has started talking in her sleep so my husband and I decided we needed to buy a video monitor to make sure she was awake before we went into her room because we have accidently woken her up going into her room to check on her after we have heard her start stirring. I started researching video monitors and found the Levana brand had 4+ start reviews on Amazon. (Note: I am an Amazon Prime member and a frequent reader of reviews before I decided to buy an item.) I liked the price of this video monitor compared to the prices of the ones made by Motorola and Summer Infant. It seemed very reasonable and the online reviews of this item were very good. The reviews specifically said the day time color picture was very clear and bright and the night vision worked very well. I did not find either of these to be true with my experience.We set this new monitor up on a Friday night so we were not able to test the color picture on the first day of use. The night vision worked, but did not have a great picture (certain items were very bright and others were blurry). On Saturday late morning when we put our daughter down for a nap, we tested the color picture. The colors on the monitor were completely off and the room has to be extremely well lit for the color picture to even work. When we went to bed Saturday night, the night vision was still working, but by Sunday morning, we woke up to a black and blurry screen. It appears that the night vision LEDs had gone out. I called customer service for Levana on Sunday morning, per the instructions in the manual for the monitor, only to find out you could not talk to anyone until business hours Monday-Friday. The customer service line then walks you through a few trouble shooting measures to try and get the monitor to start working again (i.e. turn the monitor on and off, check the light in the room, etc.). I found this to be completely unacceptable. This is a product that sells items for baby safety. How many working parents are able to call about a defective baby monitor from their office? My husband and I returned this monitor to Amazon and ended up buying a much more, expensive but nicer monitor manufacturer by Motorola from another retailer.if I could give this monitor and Levana zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product as well as the lack of service provided by Levana.	
- 1	this towel is too thin. i would use it on the  beach as a light and bright towel but i don' t need a beach towel, i need a bath towel for my baby. i am returning this item	
1. 	I've bought other brands of sleep sacks, and regret doing so after I came across this one, which I think is the original sleep sack. I can see why it's the best selling one; it's cozy, thick, incredibly well-made, and doesn't pill/ball when stuck in the washing machine, which- let's face it- with a baby you are going to need to do quite often! My daughter's earlier sleep sacks have pilled like crazy, torn, and had zippers that were of such poor quality that they poked at her- which obviously defeats the purpose of having this blanket which should be helping put baby to sleep!	
1. 	These are helpful when you have a high bed. It worked well to increase the height. It makes the co-sleeper more wobbly and when you pick up the co-sleeper, the extensions can fall off so you cannot place it down without it being re-built. Would still recommend if you needed to increase the height.	
1. 	I shopped around for quite a while and I finally settled on this crib.  It was a more reasonably priced crib that I found.  It arrived within 2 days and was in perfect condition.  The wood is beautiful (we bought the espresso finish).  It wasn't too bad to put together either, might have taken an hour.  I can already tell that the finish will be sensitive to scratching and dings.  A light finish may be less obvious to any blemishes.  Otherwise it is very sturdy and fits a standard crib mattress.  We got the Colgate Classica I and it is a perfect fit!  We also bought the matching changer.  I would recommend this product!	
1. 	I haven't used this brush with any other bottles, but for the Avent bottles it is perfect. I always rinse out or soak my bottles immediately after use... And then use this brush to wash them out with hot soap and water and it is super fast. The nipple cleaner fits perfectly and works well. Worth every penny for a new mom... Makes my life easier!	
1. 	These do the job: they fit securely into outlets, meaning that little fingers won't be able to pull them out.	
- 1	These are awful.  Once you wash them they curl up into a tight scroll and will not lay flat again.  Terrible purchase.  After unsuccessfully trying to get them to lay flat I threw them away.  What a waste.	
1. 	This is our new favorite bib (and I want to buy more)! This bib provides full coverage. It ties in the back, covering baby's neckline (no need to remove baby's shirt) and covers baby's arms (no need to roll up sleeves). The print is really cute and it seems to wash well. The only thing I would change about this bib is the front pocket, which is (for some unknown reason) divided right down the middle, making food removal more difficult.	
- 1	I totally understand that crib mattresses need to be firm in order to be safe, but seriously, this thing is much harder than is necessary to be considered safe.  We purchased the Nook pebble mattress for my 1st born (which I LOVE,) but during my 2nd pregnancy when we found out we were having twins, I went hunting for more affordable options.  We decided on the Colgate Classica I based on the review in the Baby Bargains book. I wish I would have spent just a little more $$ or maybe just tested a few more mattresses out before buying 2 of these concrete slabs. The girls refuse to sleep on these.  My son just transitioned into a twin bed, so we gave one of the girls his Nook mattress, but now I've got to look for a mattress topper for the other baby.On a positive note, this mattress is constructed well and is super light which makes for changing the sheets very easy.	
- 1	We stopped using this and use the Kanga Care diaper bag instead. The design doesn't allow for one-handed opening and even if you leave it open it is impossible to put the diaper inside one handed.	
1. 	These bottles are superior to any on the market.  One of my daughter's had severe reflux and used the variable flow nipple so that she could have cereal in the bottle.  Avent is the only bottle company that offers this specific type of nipple, which was a life saver.  I tried using the Soothie bottles with my other daughter, because they were cheaper and she has no signs of reflux and I figured what the heck.  Wrong decision!  She ended up with a soaked face and bib every time.  Mind you, my little one is a health, full-term newborn with no latching problems.  So I switched back to the Avent bottles.  Feedings are now mess-free and pleasant!  As for the leaking issue, people should just take the time to read the directions.  Avent clearly states in their directions that if you over tighten the nipple ring onto the bottle, it causes the nipple to wrinkle and the bottle leaks.  The nipple ring just needs to be tight enough for the nipple to grab the bottle and seal.  It is specifically designed to do this.  It's not product error, it's user error.	
- 1	I don't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are. It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device. I've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once. I prefer to just hand wash our bottles, pacifiers, accessories, and breast pump parts. It's a good idea but ehh, not a hit.	
- 1	Not magical for us. Helped the first couple of nights we used it, but after that our son started sleeping WORSE, waking up 9-10 a night. We kept at it for a week and then stopped using it when we were travelling--when we didn't use it our son just rolled to his side and went to sleep. Turns out that's all he wanted!  i give it two stars b/c i'm sure the product does what it is supposed to, but it didn't help us at all.	
- 1	We used an older virsion of this munchkin sippy cups for my infant son when he was around 8 months old and started drinking from sippy cups.  That version had a silicone top just like these, and he liked it just fine.  As he was teething, he would chew on the tips, and eventually the tops became so chewed up that they were pretty much useless -- the plastic began chipping (it was never a choking hazard, but that is something you may want to think about).  So we tossed them, and we started giving him a cup with a straw, just to see how he'd do with that.Now, at 13 months, he regularly uses a straw sippy cup and loves it.  It's not the greatest cup, (there's something going on with the straw that causes leaks, which I'm pretty sure has something to do with pressure and physics that I don't fully understand) but he likes it and I just deal witht he mess.Still, I thought, let's try this one (as they were free to me through the Amazon Vine program) because the click lock function should help prevent spills, and he was fine with the silicone sippy cup before.  Well, he tried it once, and threw it across the room in disgust, because it was just too difficult to get the liquid through the spout.  So that's that.That said, if you're looking for a transitional cup from the bottle, I think they're worth a try.  They are pretty leak proof, and that's what you probably want most.  But, as a cup for a kid that's a bit more far along in the drinking-from-a-cup stage, these may be too tough for them -- it is pretty hard to suck liquid through them (I tried it myself).	
1. 	I find these cloth diapers very useful. I use them as burp cloths and to have handy in case of spills or other baby related messes. They are absorbent and comfortable to use. They are soft, so they don't scratch my babies face when I clean his mouth. I first bought 1 package and then went back for more. They are inexpensive and very useful.	
1. 	These sealing discs are great for traveling. They provide your Avent bottles the perfect airtight seal with no leaks, so long as you remember to use the blue ring. All you have to do is push these through the larger white ring on your Avent bottle and once you hear a small pop, you know that it's in place. Then screw it close, it's that simple. These discs also make your bottles smaller and easier to pack in your diaper bag/cooler as well, since you don't have to use the nipple and cap. Sometimes it's just easier to pack the bottles with the discs and store the nipples/caps separately.You get a set of six per pack, which for most, is more than enough. They're easy to clean, don't stain or warp, and store easily too. So long as you don't forget to use the blue ring on your bottle and properly use the discs, these sealing discs won't leak out any milk.This is a good buy if you can get it on sale on the site, otherwise look elsewhere for a better price. It's great for parents who are on the go and are looking to store baby bottles more efficently.	
1. 	Honestly, I don't just use these for babies.  In fact, it's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids.  They won't touch the metal ones, but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails.  The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails... but you can't beat the ease of clipping with these things!	
- 1	The name of the company is really misleading. These products are made in China. Just sayin'. So, if you're looking to buy American made sheets, this is not it.	
- 1	The mobile looks really pretty. However, I used this mobile for not more than 30 mins and the battery was dead. It uses 3 C batteries.	
1. 	After using cloth bibs for a month, I bought this bib and have been pretty happy with it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the velcro part needs to allow the bib to be tighter. The food my son eats slips down his neck because I can't make the bib any tighter. I also wish the bib was longer. The bib is still great to easily wipe spills when my son is done eating. I also like that there is a pocket at the bottom to catch spills.	
- 1	Despite the smart design of these bottles (nipple is sized and shaped similar to a breast, bottle is comfortable to hold, bottle is compatible with pumps), I would not purchase.  Invariably, there is a fast leak at the lids and a frustrating mess.  They are worthless for feeding and storage.	
- 1	I would give this product 3.5 stars if I could. When we first got it our baby was about 2 months old. She was suffering from some acid reflux and would often spit up in her sleep while lying flat. We tried elevating her bassinet but that didn't work. She never slept for more than 20-30 minutes flat in a bassinet or crib. This sleeper was a lifesaver. Her first night she slept 5 or 6 hours straight in it. Now, she sleeps at least 6-8 hours straight, wakes up for a bottle, and sleeps again for another 2-3 hours. But my only complaint is that it really isn't suitable for babies for a long period of time. While I enjoyed sleeping while she slept for long periods, she is now addicted to the sleeper (she's 5 mos). It's been really hard weaning her off it! This sounds silly, but it's a huge transition to go from this inclined, cozy, rocking sleep environment to a stiff mattress in a large crib. Any tips other parents have, I would welcome them! That's the only reason I give it 4 stars, I'd recommend parents only use it sparingly to help babies get their acid reflux flare ups under control and maybe for occassional naps. It was a lifesaver, so I can't complain, but now I have some regrets. Again, any tips on how to wean babies off this sleeper would be appreciated!!! :)I'm updating my previous review, which I'm not sure alot of people do for this product. So I finally transitioned my 6-month old to a crib from this sleeper. It was sooo painful, with many nights of crying. Although it helped in the short-term, I really regret using the rock n play. The transition is too hard. Now that she's in a crib, I also see how much it was restricting her movement, which is necessary for infants to settle into sleep. For this reason, I'm downgrading the review to 2 stars. It really wasn't worth it in the end.	
1. 	This little seat is great.  Bought it for my granddaughter.  It is so convenient to carry around, my daughter keeps it in the car, so we have it no matter where we decide to eat.  We love it.  and it is easy to clean.	
- 1	Yes, this bra allows me to pump hands-free, but if I'd researched things a little better, I would have ordered a different bra instead. The Medela bra is not adjustable and I've lost 20 lbs of baby weight since I started pumping so it's looser now. Also, some of the sewing is already coming apart; I've used it once or twice a day for about 3 months and washed it a few times. I haven't tried it, but Simple Wishes makes a similar product which is adjustable and was recommended by a breastfeeding counselor in my area; I would consider that one instead.	
1. 	Bought this for my 6 month old as we are working on starting solids. He really likes to sit in it, the first time we tried it he smiled really big! He likes to play with small toys on the tray. It hooks easily to our kitchen chairs or can be used on the floor. I also like that the tray is dishwasher safe. Of course, food generally finds its way to other places besides the tray, but it is easy to wipe clean. For the price, especially, this is a great product.	
- 1	I love this so much I bought a second. We used the first one to hold Sophie and it worked great. Unfortunately it only lasted a week. The second one broke the first time I tried to use it.  The problem is it isn't all one piece of silicone and the plastic nodes break off very easily. My 7 month old actually pulled one off and tried to eat it! The broken pieces are very small (much smaller than a dime) and are a choking hazard.I'm very disappointed and surprised someone would be selling these and marketing them to children when they break so easily. Please be careful using this product! It is not worth the risk.	
- 1	We had this rocker upstairs and a bouncer downstairs.  My daughter much preferred the bouncer to the rocker (and the swing).  Now my daughter is 18 months and wants to sit in the rocker, but she also wants to climb on it, making it unsafe.  She has other chairs that she doesn't try this on.  One other thing that I preferred about the bouncer is that you could pull the toys and they played music.	
1. 	I love these bowls. I use them to freeze baby puree food, to store and transfer food to daycare, when we are out and about etc. I use them every day. They work great!	
- 1	This is a waste of money and sleep. Move the baby close to you if it is an option. If you take the the reciever off the charger to walk around with it and it goes dead, it will stay dead. It will continuously beep at you with no receiving from the base. This is my 2nd unit in 5 months. I thought the first time it was just a fluke, no this is just a bad product. There are not many choices out there for long distance range. Don't waste your time on this one.	
1. 	Works great, but i'm not convinced the cubes are actually a full ounce.  Seem smaller than another tray I have with 1 ounce servings.	
- 1	At first we thought this product was great because it taught our 11 month old how to use an adult straw within one week, but after a few days we saw a few problems.Sometimes the straw gets stuck and doesn't pop up on it's own after you open it at the top.These cups do in fact leak but not a whole lot. If a product says it's leak proof, I'd prefer it to be leak proof, not just by a little.After being thrown down a few times, the part the slides over the straw became loose. There are also scratches.One of our cups actually doesn't click to lock.It is easy to clean, though. I use the Dr. Browns nipple and bottle parts brush to clean the straws.	
- 1	Don't bother with these.  I used to like these a lot but then they discontinued them and then came out with these ones that like exactly the same but the quality is crap now!!  The large sponge tore after 3 uses.  (FYI, I have the Medela bottles.)  And the little nipple sponge is not as resilient any more; it's a cheap sponge. If you want something similar, I llike this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Rotary-Spinning-Sponge-Bottle-Cleaner/dp/B00JQSO1L6/ref=sr_1_28?ie=UTF8&qid=1405008036&sr=8-28&keywords=bottle+nipple+sponge	
- 1	I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was weird - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.	
- 1	First one of these was great, so I bought another one and it leaked, bought one more to try out and it leaked and gave it one more try with my final purchase and that one leaked too. Ruined so many of my bags and my car and my fridge and anywhere else the cup was.  It just slowly oozes milk out of the straw regardless of whether it's closed, open, full, half full, near empty.  I don't know how I lucked out with the first cup that sold me on the product, but it's not worth spending $8 when the majority don't work.	
- 1	I am really glad it failed while I was present and not on top of one of my children!  This product lost its &#34;stickness&#34; a week after installation.	
1. 	very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.	
1. 	We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!

1. 	It was a little bit of work to put this together, but definitely not the hardest piece of furniture that I have ever put together. We are still using this now that my son is 9 months old. I put some baskets in the cubby holes and that works great to store diapers and many other things.	
1. 	I bought this pillow when my pregnant back started aching at around 14 weeks.  I have used it every day since then!!! I love cuddling with it and now that I am about to give birth I find the pillow that much more supportive! I highly recommend.  I also recommend you get some kind of pillow case for it as it comes with a cover, but it is extremely difficult to take off and put back on when you decide to wash it.	
- 1	I bought these first in the 4105 model and thought I would try this model.  They are sized all wrong, way too big.  When I contacted La Leche League they ignored my concerns.  I would not buy these at all--get the other model # 4105, they worked great.	
- 1	Sorry for waisting consumers'  time, but I feel the need to say this publicly -I put this on my wish list, and the price was raised OVER 140% on me the next day. I will not be purchasing this item.It's LOUSY sales technique, and it's lousy of Amazon to permit it.	
1. 	I bought and installed three of these latches about six years ago. Two of them are still going strong. The third fell off, but it lasted a few years before falling off, and it wouldn't have been difficult to reinstall.They come with screws or adhesive. I chose to mount with adhesive. The main thing to remember about any adhesive mount is to use a clean surface and let it cure for 24 hours, which means do not use it right away.My toddler son was into opening every single drawer and cabinet in the kitchen and he did not open the ones these were on. They do open a little, but the latch catches them. If you have small bottles or things that little hands can reach in and grab and pull out, you'll need a different latch. The latches are easy to unlatch. The secret is to never let the kids see how you open the cabinets.Neither of my kids ever successfully opened the cabinets these were installed on. At this point, they are much older and they have no interest in opening the cabinets, but they have never gotten in; and your guests will intuitively know how to open the drawers, unlike other locks like the Tot-lock.For very high risk drawers (for example, drawers that contain knives), I recommend Tot-lock. For ones you want to keep closed because the kids keep opening them and making a mess, these are perfectly fine._____________________UPDATE:  My kids are grown now, but the locks I installed so many years ago on two of my cabinets are still going strong.  One on a drawer has fallen off.  That one did not have a good surface to adhere to in the first place.  It's been seven years.  I'll say that's a pretty good record.	
- 1	Leaks and really disgusting to clean.It get that orangey buildup in the overlap part and the whole thing has to come apart to clean.  Go with the primo eurobath.  love it!	
- 1	The product serves it's purpose, but it's far too large. Since it extends out past each side, if a drawer is opened without moving the guard (ex, open a drawer to the left or right) the oven door comes flying open and the guard crashes off loudly. I guess it's not meant for leaving on full-time? It hit my baby last night (luckily not too hard) but gave us a big scare. It should come coupled with an oven latch and/or in unique sizes.The plastic pieces affixed to the oven door has turned dark in color and it concerns me that toxic chemicals from the plastic are leaking into the air when it gets hot.The plastic edges are sharp, and my husband cut his finger on it fairly badly.I feel better that my daughter can't reach up to grab a pan, but all the other problems are dangerous in themselves. I'm not very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	My mommy hook broke and it seems like it isn't made very well. If I were mountain climbing... I would die!	
- 1	Somehow missed the memo that not all Boppys are created equal.  Apparently I have the &#34;nursing pillow&#34; and this cover does not fit.  Since it's clear on the packaging, after the cover arrived, I checked the description to make sure I wasn't crazy.  While it says, &#34;Cottony cute slipcover designed to fit any Boppy Feeding and Infant support pillow (sold separately)&#34;, I guess the nursing pillow (which is more square, has a detachable strap, and a rubbery insert) doesn't count.  To my disappointment, Boppy doesn't make covers for that pillow.	
1. 	This bib covers the whole front of the baby's body including his shoulders, upper arms and the whole belly. The pocket does not necessarily stay open to catch all the food, but if you have your baby seated in something with some kind of a tray, you can just lay the bib on the tray and it catches the food pretty well that way. It's made of very durable waterproof fabric, and I like that the white rims are made of the same fabric too. It's super easy to clean. I usually wipe it with a wipe on the go, and then come home and wash it in the sink and hang it dry. I would wash it after a use and it's usually completely dry for the next meal. I have washed them in a washing machine and they came out in perfect shape. They fold up very compactly. I just fold one and roll it up with a spoon and keep it in my diaper bag with his food.	
- 1	This product is very unsafe.  The thick mat keeps the car seat from being in tight enough in an accident.	
- 1	The first one worked nicely for about 2 weeks. Then the battery died. Unfortunately we had the old version. It was glued together. IE you can not change the battery. We contacted customer support @ Potty Time inc. They sent us a new watch free of charge. Only it was defective. The screen is angled and only displays when you hit the button.A little disappointed I forced open the first one only to find that it was all rusted out from water via hand washing. This is a great idea that is red flagged by manufacturing defects. Great customer support only goes so far. Its like the newest designed Xbox 360 still has a 50% failure rating. Who wants to buy that?If you cant make it water resistant put a Velcro strap on it. Its not easy putting it on or taking it off.If you get one that works take it off to wash their hands.	
- 1	This is hard to get on and off and you can't see how many ounces are left in the bottle!	
1. 	These bibs are waterproof for sure. If your baby spits, everything will just slide down to his outfit. For spits I highly recommend Aden and Anais. But these are the BEST for drooling. The only downside is the velcro, I hate it, it will stick to anything, and it will make a terrible noise and wake the baby up.	
1. 	After reading all the fantastic reviews, I admit I thought I'd love this brush more.  It's definitely durable.But that little nobbin at the end to scrub the nipples with is completely rigid, so I feel as though my finger still does a better job by far.  If it was flexible, it'd be so much more useful.The brush itself can't get into some of the nooks and crannies of a medela pumping system.  Other brushes have issues with that too.  Again if the little nobbin had a bit of give to it, I could use that, but nope.	
- 1	As many others have noted: This humidifier does not humidify/moisten the air.We did not buy it on Amazon.com but ironically, have only found the replacement filters on Amazon.com. The big box store we bought the unit does not carry the filter.Our filter did not/has not gotten moldy like others have mentioned. But, we have been careful to replace the water every night and flip the filter.This unit is definitely loud, even on the quiet setting.I am buying one round of replacement filters and if I am still not happy with the quality of this humidifier, I'm switching to another unit.I wouldn't recommend buying it.	
1. 	I thought I didn't need this SwaddleMe blanket.  I thought I could swaddle my baby on my own since I watched the video and took the class.  Well no one told me how strong babies turned out to be and my daughter freed herself from every swaddle we put in her.  Plus she was born pretty long, which means less of a regular swaddle blanket for me to work with.This Kiddopotamus blanket held her in!  My daughter tried to break out of this but she ended up exhausting herself trying and went right back to sleep.  When she got into the habit of sleeping through the night at 3 months, I stopped using it.  It was a good thing I got the SwaddleMe blanket early because at 3 months she figured out how to sneak out one arm of the SwaddleMe blanket too.But this blanket did its job and got me more sleep in the first few months.  I've been getting this as a baby shower gift for my friends ever since!	
- 1	I really REALLY wanted to like this shell and this brand.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the diaper inserts by Alva- amazing.  The shells, however, are less great.  My daughter peed once, and the whole back of her pants were soaked- I don't think the shell material is waterproof... Also around the leg holes, there is a single elastic whereas other diapers (Best bottom) have 2.Again, great diaper inserts, but i'm going back to my Best bottom shells...	
1. 	I have this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It keeps her busy in the car and in the stroller or if she gets bored with her swing I clip it on that sometimes too. The clips are a little hard to get to work you really have to just use two hands to open them up and push down hard. But it's worth it, in the car when you go over bumps the turtle will play it's little jingle. She loves grabbing the little animals on it.	
1. 	I like the Bumkins bibs with the sleeves that tie in the back better, but my hubby prefers to use these. These bibs velcro in the back, and the baby can rip it off pretty easy, which defeats the point. I wish these ones tied, then I'd give it 5 stars.	
1. 	These spoons are the perfect size for first feeders.  The bowl of the spoon is narrow and not too deep, so the food actually gets into my son's mouth.  These are really light too, unlike the spoons that have metal conponents.  Don't go with the more expensive spoons.  These work the best, are cheap and are BPA free and recyclable!	
- 1	The suction on this always gives up so my baby whips it across the room  Its colorful but I wish they made it sturdier	
- 1	We received this monitor as a replacement for our Summer monitor that broke. The resolution on the video was awful (compared to the old summmer monitor and another brand we have recieved). I like all the features of the monitor but couldn't get over the bad video quality. Also we had an issue with the actual monitor breaking and you have to buy a whole new system at discount(at 109.99). I received a lot of recommendations for Summer monitors but this one was not great. We also had an awful experience with customer service. I recommend either looking at a different model of Summer products or a different brand all together. Unfortunately due to our experience, we went with a different brand.	
1. 	It fits in our summer infant changing pad great and the color is super cute - it brings character to the nursery	
- 1	I am 14 weeks pregnant, still nursing my 15 month old and my milk supply has pretty much dried up. I still try a few times a day though. I am almost to the end of my freezer supply and I just wanted to share a few things about my experiences in using up my freezer supply.1. You can never have enough frozen. There is no &#34;too much&#34;.2. All of the frozen milk I have fed her over the last month has been 13 to 15 months old. In a deep freeze. She drank every drop, not a bad bag. So I question the 12 month rule.3. Double check your bag is sealed before you freeze, keep the seal dry. Many popped open while thawing.4. I used 3 kinds of bags and lots of empty bottles. I will NEVER buy Medela bags again. They are the only ones that the sealed opened on and 4 bags so far either broke or the seal on the bottom of the bag leaked while thawing in hot water. No problems with Lansinoh bags. Not sure if Gerber still makes bags but I used some that were 7 years from my first baby and NO PROBLEM with Gerber bags.	
- 1	Its a bit of a challenge to get 2 in here (Nuk brand). I do like the easy clean part, and holes that allow air to help it stay ventilated while wet. BUT it does fall off the bag. I've dropped it a couple times and now just put it in a side pocket of my bag, easy to find, but defeats the purpose of hanging it on the diaper bag strap.	
- 1	Cut 2 holes out of old sports bra.  Voila!  A cheaper, better fitting, better looking alternative to this overpriced product.	
1. 	I was told that carseats stretch out your leather if you don't place anything between them so we decided to try this saver and boy does it save. I have just small pressure points in the very back that you can see when you remove the carseat but they have gone away within a couple days. The bottom of this is a harder plastic the the others I have seen in stores which I think is what helps this. No complaints here and I would defiantly recommend to anyone. In fact I'm ordering one now for my mom's car as the little bit extra cost makes it well worth not having stretched out leather.	
1. 	Love this &#34;easy to set up chair.&#34;  It is easy to clean, and it's easy to remove!  I read in an earlier review where it was claimed that this chair was not easy to fold up and that it was too bulky to use when one travels or goes out to eat.  I beg to differ!  It is super easy to remove, easy to fold and it slips right into the little bag provided, which is easy to carry.  I don't know how it could be made any smaller and still be of such good quality.  It is sturdy, and holds my 2 yr. old grandson who is rather long for his age without a problem. I suspect that he'll be able to use it for at least 1 more year.  He is currently 25 lbs., and an active little boy!  He loves it too, as he enjoys being up at the counter eating with the rest of us.  An added bonus is the removable liner in the chair that can be easily machine washed. It also wipes off rather easily too, with a damp cloth as needed.  I'd highly recommend this chair to all parents of little ones from 8 mos. on up to maybe 3 - the cut off weight is 35 lbs. so it just depends on your little ones build rather than age.	
- 1	These pads are too small and too thick. They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. They also look very unflattering under clothing. I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. Don't waste your money on Avent pads!	
1. 	This is great for on the go!  And your tray is always clean!	
- 1	This booster chair never made its way out of the box.  Its chemical smell was too noxious to warrant even a peekaboo.  Even the best designed chair fails miserably when you can't stand to get near it for the fumes.  My search continues....	
1. 	We use this with the KidCo G15 White Center Gateway with Walk Through Pressure Gate for the bottom of our steps. Our staircase looks just like the one they have advertised in the picture and it works perfectly for us. I was so happy to have found these two products!I would have given it 1 more star if it was not quite so expensive but highly reccomended to anyone in a similar situation.	
1. 	My baby doesn't sleep in his crib that long for me to know if its really waterproof, but it is very soft and fits snug on our Graco Pack n play in zurich.	
1. 	I read a lot of the other lower reviews about it being over priced, it's just a step stool or the grip is bad or it tips over...........Did you buy the same product?This is a clean looking great stool with good traction and easy to use for little onesIt's a trusted brand which I would highly recommendWhen you pay a little more you get better quality	
1. 	I bought this for my 7 month old who has been sitting unaided for months but tries to nose dive when he takes a bath. He is always slipping from having soap on his body and it makes me so nervous. I owned one of these tubs before with his sister but could not find them in any store. I ordered this online today and I am excited for it to come in the mail. The material in the bottom of the tub is non slip so the baby is stable, the sides are high and soft so if your child falls sideways they won't get hurt, and the design is adorable. I really enjoy this product.	
- 1	They don't really fit to your breast, so when I wear them under a thin tank top or bra you can see the edges.	
1. 	Used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center.  Works great.  We used it horizontally, unlike the suggested vertical method.	
1. 	I've attached this to our baby's car seat. He loves looking at it, catching it, and chewing on it. He starts looking for it as soon as I put him in his car seat.	
- 1	PROS1. Easy to assemble. I just had to put together the arm rests, back rest, and cusions.2. The arm rest cushions. They actually snap on to the seat on the bottom part, keeping things (or baby) from dropping through. Moreover, there are handy little pockets on the outsides of the arm cushions.3. It's cheap and comes with the ottoman.CONS1. The paint on the wood is sparse in some spots and, even worse, had some scratches on the wood itself, up on the top of the back rest. Thankfully, the cushion covers it, and the other paint issues aren't too noticeable since they are toward the bottom of the glider.2. Uncomfortable! When I fall asleep in this, I wake up not being able to feel my arms. Also the chair area is kind of small and makes it so that I have to sit up stiffly with my back straight. I don't usually notice it until I'm getting off the chair and realize that my back is a little sore.3. The arm rest is too short. My baby has the habit of leaning back for a stretch after she is done nursing, and on this glider, her head dropped off the end!04. The cushions are very squeaky, kind of like the hinge of a door that needs to be oiled. The back cushion as well as the seat cushion will make these loud squeaks with any amount of movement. Even after three months of use, they are just as bad and have become more and more annoying. And the sound is loud enough to wake my baby up when I want to leave the room. Terrible!I would definitely rather buy a used Dutailier on Craigslist than buy this again.	
1. 	We got this one and the Summer Infant and they're so similar you might as well get the cheaper one. This one is definitely taller but our son hasn't had better or worse luck with either one.	
- 1	I used it for my son.. it's really cool at first, but it wasn't as practical as I thought it would be.  It does help your back, but my son just didn't care much for it!	
1. 	I love these little animals, just not as a bath toy. The squirtie hole is the same as the connecting hole making it awkward (impossible) to get the water back out. But, the plastic is soft, great size for little hands, and the little knobs where the animals connect are great for teething babies.	
1. 	I did not want a fussy car seat or travel system so I bought this to use with our Baby Trend car seat. I got great use out of this. It was light weight and worked as it should have. It rolled smoothly. It resembles an old pram when the car seat is in it.Now we move on to a larger stroller since baby is no longer in his car seat. Bummer. :(	
1. 	We knew we were having a girl & when we saw this theme at Babies R Us we knew this was it! We registered for every matching Malawi item available-rug, switchplate, wall art, lamp, nightlight, picture frame, club chair, table & chairs, toy chest, receiving blankets, etc. Went a little crazy, but it all looks so cute-it makes us happy to walk into her room! We painted the wall butter yellow-matching the giraffe & put the border & window valances up-it looks terrific. The sheets wash very well. Get this set-you'll be glad you did!	
- 1	These bottles are terrible. Many reviewers complained of leaking and then said if u use the bottle as directed, notch up, it wouldn't leak. I still had a problem, when bottle used exactly as directed, with leaking. The nipple is flimsy, which causes the leaking issue because it does not keep good contact with the screw lid that attaches it to the bottle. It also collapses in when my baby is drinking, both with self feeding and assisted feeds and I have to stop and pull it back out before she can continue. Definitely not my favorite bottle. My baby and I prefer the cheap gumdrop bottles to these. Gumdrop has basic parts and perfect size for little hands and they are inexpensive. These bottles are too big around.	
1. 	This is an amazing product, instead of using a Qtip I can use this and not stretch my little baby's nose out.  And for my toddler as gross as this may sound, I can use some saline and then reach in a grab those toddler size &#34;boogies.&#34;	
1. 	I bought the cherry version of this bed for my granddaughter who is now three and using it in its toddle form, so I made this second purchase for the next granddaughter, with complete confidence. The crib is strong, looks good, takes some perseverance to put together, but is well worth it.	
- 1	These are indeed a very cute idea, but they don't really work.  Ideal if your baby sits perfectly still at a diaper change, but my baby never did!  (In fact, I don't know of any who do.)  I spent more time trying to keep this thing in place, and then the minute it slipped off, he peed anyway.  It's all part of the joy of having a baby boy!  Better just to work quickly, and you'll get quicker with practice.	
1. 	This pump is pretty good for those times when you want a manual pump. The massaging petals do seem to help with letdown. It is compact and you can use it anywhere. I have a nice Playtex Embrace pump that I can use in my car and at work, but there are times when I can't lug my big carrying bag around and the Isis works great in these situations.I have taken it to theme parks (we left the baby at home with a sitter because of the heat, etc) and I just put the pump inside a soft cooler bag along with an ice pack and a couple of bottles. I have pumped in the car while riding and even pumped in bathroom stalls, if necessary.The handle does make a little squeaky sound, but otherwise it is quiet. The parts do tend to come apart easilly, and the handle falls off, but it's not that much of a problem. It didn't make my hand tired, even though I pumped for 20 minutes altogether, three times a day. I get out just as much milk with this pump as I do with my electric, though it does take a little longer than double pumping.I have pumped into the Avent bottle and then transferred my milk in the past, but since I use Playtex bottles and the One-Step storage kit, I have learned that Playtex will send you a FREE adapter for your Avent pump which allows you to pump directly into the Playtex bottles (Yay!)UPDATE:I had to change my review on the Isis after I had to use another manual pump in an emergency yesterday. I tried the Medela Harmony. Wow, that pump was wonderful! It really was 'silent' and easy to use! It was also much easier to clean than the Avent and I got out a record of 5 1/2oz in twenty minutes! So I guess that although the Avent is a good pump, I would have to say the Medela Harmony was better.	
- 1	got this as a gift when my daughter was one mth old but I started using it she was 3mths old as there was no support for her head .....she liked hitting the lion but it would always bounce back and hit her in the head and its made from really hard plastic...i cut it off... she hated the chair...wouldn't stay in for more than 5 minutes...at about 5 months she used it to become a turtle....left her for a few mins and came back to see her creeping wioh it still strapped on...stopped using it immediately	
1. 	These bibs are the best. I've tried others and they stain or don't get completely clean.  Bumkins are the best.  They clean and dry easily. Once in a while I put them in the washer to get really clean.  I love the colors and size- not huge but big enough to cover baby's whole shirt.	
- 1	Haven't been able to use it-it's so hard to blow it up I think we need a bicycle pump to get air into it. Too much work when you have a baby!	
1. 	This was the second type of nipple we tried with our daughter who is primarily breastfeed when we were starting bottles for daycare.  She took to it right away and we haven't had any problems.  The nipple is very soft and the base is nice and wide, exactly what you want in a bottle for a breastfeed baby.  The slow flow is just about perfect for her, she isn't drowning in milk and does have to do some active sucking just like when she is at the breast.	
1. 	work great but a pain to clean. my daughter lovers them though	
1. 	Great fit , cute , safe for baby but deflated so fast. My husband has to re-pump it every couple days	
1. 	I was hesitant to buy this due to the price, but loved how they looked so thought I would take a chance - glad I decided to buy. My son (now 5 months old) loves the funky creatures (we unlinked the stuffed toys for him to play with when he was younger) and enjoys chewing on the colorful links. These are some of the best links I've found and we use them all of the time to link things together or to link toys to his stroller/car seat.	
1. 	My baby loves this gym.. The colors are bright to draw baby's attention. Also the design on the mat is great with so many different animals on it and some tiny tags for the baby to pull. The music and lights are nice. It is really a nice play mat for babies. My son enjoys it a lot. I use it for play time and also tummy time. He smiles every time I put him on the mat and show him all the animals and lights.	
1. 	My 9 month old loves this toy!  She may not like trying to get the shapes in yet, but she loves to spin the sorter and turn the tail.  She likes for me to put the shapes in and watch them spill out...	
1. 	I really like this product. It is made of good quality and does the job. I just wish it wrapped around more because I'm always having to use an extra blanket or something to cover my back and sides.	
- 1	Great idea. The reality of it is fine, and would work in a pinch.  It does need quite a bit more gel-filling to be a viable cooling pack.  Not enough gel makes the plastic under the cover hard and uncomfortable, and get warm too quickly.Also my toddler son just isn't crazy about it being a pink bunny (and bunny ears are far to swing-able for a little one). We would have preferred to have been able to choose our character.  Bears are his favorite, and since the photos are of bears, I thought we would get one... but it does say they send what they send so I knew there was that risk.  Unfortunately, because of it being a hard we never use it, though I do keep it in the freezer, just in case... though I've found after this, he now prefers to just use a regular cloth-covered cold pack since it's softer and mold-able, and he can lay with it when he feels the need to.When one of my friends has a girl, this pink bunny is definitely going in the donate pile.	
1. 	I'm so grateful for this product. It keeps my mind at ease knowing my baby is safe and comfortable. Definitely will be buying more.	
1. 	This fits on my Britax stroller perfect! When it's cold I throw it on and when it's hot I remove it! Very easy to change out and very soft and warm	
1. 	I picked this off the reviews and I am not disappointed! I love this pail... There is not stink, it is SUPER easy to use when you are half awake, and emptying it is easy as pie.	
- 1	The dispenser I got was defective! The lid of the dispenser does not snap shut to the body. Complete waste of money! Avent formula dispenser is much better and can be sterilized.	
- 1	(...)When your child outgrows the infant bath (between two and six months, depending on size and activeness), get a bigger baby bath. There are several models (though none via Amazon, that I see) that rock, including one we found that's inflatable - it holds thrice the water of the infant bath but still a small fraction of what's needed in the entire tub.Besides, you want the water to flow and be replaced for a baby, NOT have an infant or toddler sitting in a tub full of dirty and soapy water, which may contribute to genital and rectal problems.Related: With this seat, you either suspend the baby *above* the water or waste dozens of gallons getting the water line high enough to *reach* the baby. Either way, the baby's butt is inside a chair and difficult to reach or see, much less clean.Still not sure? Try wiping his or her buttcrack while they're in a high chair. You'll instantly realize that a chair such as this is *not* the best way to bath a child.	
1. 	Our toddler has a lot of stuffed animals, I only ordered two (one for her, and one for our small cat) and realized I need two more... They are a good price and the hardware is sturdy. Yes we let the cat sleep in one, but she is under the weight limit and would do it anyways, she loves it.	
- 1	It looks great. My daughter was happy as it is pink...she sat in it and thought it was comfortable...but when I looked for the instructions to get her into the harness there were none. When I called amazon - amazon was lovely - I was told that that was how it arrived from the manufacturer. Ok. But so manufacturer also sent it simply in a box with a plastic bag on it. Hopeful that this wasn't thrown around too much in transit. I really wanted to like this...we need a new car seat ....but I am returning this tomorrow. (Note: many of the reviews that I have read on this said that it was very important to read the manual as it is hard to install)	
1. 	I bought these for my great granson & his mother is very pleased with them. very easy to use. It helps not having to wash a dirty bottle, just simple to clean.	
- 1	They leak really bad.	
1. 	When I was expecting my 3rd child, my children were about 18 months, and 4 years old... and I needed to pass down my toddlers highchair to the baby...This saftey first seat is excellent!Features...*  The straps that attatch the booster to the chair can roll up underneath the booster seat.*  A handle to carry the chair by once folded*  A place to hook the tray on when the seat is folded*  Optional legs for different hights*  A VERY small compartment, we usually just keep a bibster in there (VERY hard to fit it though!)*  A lap belt that keeps my son in the chair.*  A removable tray, just one (nothing to loose!). It doesnt adjust, but if your baby no longer fits with the tray, they are probably old enough to use the booster underneath the table (like my now 2 year old).I really do not have any complaints, the chair is very sturdy, can fit on nearly every chair we use, and is great for travel, but now my son really doesnt want to sit in the baby seats at the restaurants, but I do not like the boosters without straps for the chair that they provide... so this may start getting out more often!	
1. 	The first night in this pillow and I was converted. 7 mos pregnant and had one of those long body pillows that just wasn't cutting it. This is simpler, easier to get in and out of and so much more supportive!	
1. 	These are lightweight and great to bring along in your diaper bag as it folds up very small. It's also waterproof.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a generous Velcro strip so you can adjust to your baby's neck size.  What I find from a lot of bibs is that I can't adjust it any smaller and the food ends up on the collar.  When you put this on baby, it also covers part of the shoulder area so if he rubs his face against his shoulders, you're still covered!  It's the little things that make moms appreciate this bib!	
1. 	Very cool to look at but easy for my 7 month old to hold and chew.  It rattles, is twisty and fun to play with as well as chew on.  So far, after 2 months of having it, no complaints. It is permanently with us wherever I go and easy for her to hold on to.Highly recommend this teether,it's a winner.	
1. 	My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....Although I have not tried the more up-to-date pumps, I bought this one because it was more affordable and it has worked just fine for me. I have not had to replace any of the attachments, they have all held up just fine and at 8 months.... its still doing just fine. I'm hoping it will last me for my 2nd baby, seems like it will make it!! Good quality for the price.	
- 1	I purchased these along with several other types of sippy cups because a friend told me it would take a while to find one that he would like.  The name is a little misleading...I thought soft meant the spout would be squishy...more like a bottle, but it's really quite rigid.  I will reserve complete judgement of these cups because I figure I'll give them another go when he's a little older, but definitely not a good cup to start out with.  If you're looking for a good first sippy, my son really likes the NUK Learner cup with the silicone spout.  We used the NUK bottles so this was an almost seamless transition.  Infact they use the same bottle and just add handles and a differnt shaped nipple.  Highly recommend those!	
- 1	My baby ripped this right off.  I could not even try it out since he could easily slip it right off.	
1. 	These are the BEST waterproof, easy-to-clean, bibs ever. We've had them for several months and use them daily with no issues at all. They wash very well in the laundry, too. My son loves to check out all of the patterns when I put these on him - it's really cute to see his reactions. :-)  We won't feed him solids in any other bib (we use soft ones for when he drinks milk). Love this brand and highly recommend!	
1. 	Bought it for her for Christmas and she loves it! Stares at it and smiles like crazy!  If she's grumpy I just show her this and she lights right up! Perfect for her little hands.	
- 1	My daughter hates these bibs! The strap is the same plasticy material and every time I put it on my daughter it pulls her hair. If your baby has any hair at all this is not the bin for you.	
- 1	Returned it right back after couple days. It never warmed any wipes, barely fit any wipes--What is the point of even having it?	
1. 	Playtex Original Nurser Newborn Gift Set (Assorted Colors)is a great way to get started with introducing your baby to the bottle, especially if you are nursing. However, as your baby gets older, you will need bottles that hold more. This package of bottles is the perfect complement to the newborn package.The reason is that first of all, they're larger. Obviously, as your baby grows, you will need to feed him/her more, and these bottles make it really convenient because they're larger. They're also more sturdy than the newborn bottles, so you don't have to worry about them being easily damaged and causing accidents.If you buy the nursers, definitely buy these as an accessory. Then you'll have all the bottles you need.	
- 1	i've had to air out new products before but these are deadly! they stink so bad i had to put them in the basement at night after airing them out all day. I'm on day 4 of having them outside and hopefully the smell will go away. if not, we'll never get to use these. i can't even be in the same room as them why would i put them on my child's bed?!	
1. 	I cannot say that I sleep through every night still, but I absolutely love this pillow.  It truly helps me with my level of comfort when comfort decreases with every passing night.  I was nervous about spending this much money on a pillow, but it was worth every penny!!!	
- 1	This thing did not stick for me at all, anywhere.....which was why i needed it, distraction during changing, so ...didn't do us any good.	
- 1	We got this seat for my wife's car.  I have a Recaro ProRide in my car so my basis of comparison is between using these two seats.The side impact features are excellent.  The size, positions, and height is good.  The bolstering is enough but without being excessive like the Recaro.  The fabric is different than other brands, it cleans up well but in humid weather is is a bit weird feeling to me (clammy).  The integrated cup holder is much better than the add-on one that Recaro has.My only gripes are with the harness system, which is sort of the soul of a child seat.  The push button buckle is way harder to push than it needs to be.  It just about cramps the heck out of my thumb everytime I use it.  This button has loosened up a little over time but it still operates no where near as good as any buckle ought to.  It is also difficult to pull slack in the shoulder belts, almost like it is caught on something**.  The release buckle is pressed all the way but there is still something adding resistance.  The little shoulder belt pads are nice but if they slip out of the way, expect the belts to rub against your kids' neck.  The Recaro hero feature is hands down the better feature to avoid belt rub.All in all my wife likes this seat and I still feel it is an OK value.  Hands down the Recaro has Maxi-Cosi whipped in some specific features.  The Maxi-Cosi is good in all of the important features.  The only great thing it has is the cup holder.Made in China**Update: This harness binding keeps getting worse over time.  The harness is tough to release and tighten.  I took out the seat to inspect what the heck is going on.  The split buckle back there is rubbing against the back of the seat causing resistance (seat is not really smooth).  The worst part is a tab that holds the tether buckle to the seat, it sticks out quite a bit and hangs up on the harness buckle as it drags over the tab.  This should not operate in this manner, poor design.  Also this fabric shows stains pretty badly.  I have not tried pulling the cover off to wash it yet.  My past experiences never result in a re-installed cover fitting as it did.  One star removed.  In comparison, the Recaro operates perfectly and still looks new.  So I replaced this one with my Recaro since I have to move into Radians for my car now.	
1. 	I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.	
- 1	This is a good instance of how some things look better on the internet. Me, for example. On my facebook page, I look amazing. I only post great pictures of me. I'm always having fun. My life looks perfect. Yup, I look better on the internet. So does this book. I wouldn't have bought it if I had seen it in person. It's thin and cheap, seems like a dollar store item.	
1. 	I don't beleive anyone will dispute that the barnyard bedding set is just beautiful, and can be used for a boy or a girl.I absolutely fell in love with it at babies r us, and kept going back to it over and over again. I found one place online dreamtimebaby.com, which has a wider selection that babies 'r us, and unless the price has changed since my purchase, had a much reasonable prices for all items in this collection.If you love this line, try dreamtime first.	
- 1	I bought a case of these wipes without previously using them. What a huge regret! I've now tried them several times and they always cause a diaper rash. I recommend pampers sensitive or burts bees. I hate these wipes!	
1. 	There isn't enough room for me to describe why I love these better than any other brand! I have read the reviews on multiple bottles and have been buying bottles for over 20 years. These recommendations I find are very personally fit. It's hard to determine sometimes!	
- 1	I guess other people found this helpful, which is why I registered for it.  But when I tried filing my newborn's nails, nothing happened. I think it would've taken ages to file her nails down with this.  On the flip side, it is very safe since accidentally filing my baby's finger won't hurt her.  This is one of those baby items I have never and will never use.	
1. 	This is an excellent tub. I tried one of the seats first, which pinched my baby and was really uncomfortable. Second I tried another tub, I wish I could remember which one to warn you, but she just kept on slipping down to the bottom of that one despite its no slip surface.Finally I tried the EuroBath. Never had a problem bathing my daughter in it. Its great for itty bitty babies, big babies, and even small toddlers. I used it all the way until my daughter was large enough to go into the tub herself.Only down side is that its huge. If you lack storage space, this can be annoying, but its definitely worth it.	
1. 	My 6 week old hated bottles until these came in. He had his choice of 5 nipples and likes the latex slow flow the best. Even my husband is able to feed him with ease (breastfed babies are picky!). I love how easily I can store unfinished breast milk. I recommend this to everyone. It would make a great Baby Shower present!	
1. 	I received this as a baby shower gift. Our little guy preferred this over the standard plastic baby tub. I think it's probably more comfortable for him. No hard plastic poking him. Also easy to wash his hair with him laying in this. Bath time became much more enjoyable once we started using this!Our little guy is 4 months old now and really stretches over the bottom so I think we'll only be able to use this another month or so. Well worth the price!	
1. 	This is a cheap and great device. I didn't experience the 'babyfood' texture, but it is certainly adaptable to my baby's palate. make sure you feed the baby with some water too whilst eating anything you grind in this. i've tried everything from fish, veggies, and fruits (ie. watermelon, which btw didnt work:). this works very well, i didnt get the case (dont need extra weight in my pack), and i am pleased that it makes the food quickly with very little noise (my baby hates the food processor and cried whenever i ground him something in it due to noise). it is simple to assemble, diassemble, and wash.notes: diassemble with every use completely (ie. separate the grinder pieces to wash, especially if using a food prone to bacteria). in order to 'open' and 'close' the grinding device solidly and quickly into the grinder storage portion, make sure to keep the spoon handle nearby, and loosen/tighten the screw portion with blade to slide it right into the cup slots.i had an issue of not really knowing if the food is getting 'pureed' by my grinding the blades or simply pushing it through the mesh. there doesnt seem to be any discussion on this anywhere that i have found, to know if i am doing that part correctly.also the watermelon turned into fibered (slightly) watermelon juice, that was quite tasty! also you dont need a spoon for it. :)i found the longer smaller spoon nicer actuallyfor solid babyfood feeding but obviously not juicier ones like peaches. an apricot goes quite well through this. you probably want to peel your fruits and veggies before you stick them through.	
1. 	I was hesitant to purchase this because it had so many bad reviews, but it was really the only one that would work for my needs. I had this on my baby registry and someone bought me a Diaper Genie instead and marked on my registry that they had bought this one. I returned the more expensive diaper genie because I didn't like the expensive refills on the special bags, and because I plan to use cloth diapers, it just didn't make sense to me. I bought this one and set it up today with a Planet Wise diaper bag. People mentioned in other reviews that if you did not use grocery bags, the lid did not open properly. So far I have had no problems getting the lid to open with the foot pedal despite the thicker bag. It is on the small side, but it fits perfectly next to my changing table against the wall.After I have used it for a while, I will update my review if necessary. So far though, I am glad I made this purchase. It did arrive new and not dirty or anything like that.	
- 1	I purchased this video monitor for a friend- we opened it up at the party, and it never worked!  I was so embarrassed. The monitor did not recognize the video feed at all.  If you're spending this much on a video monitor, I would recommend any of the Summer monitors.  They may be pricier, but at least they work.	
- 1	My toddler is very active and able to open and close objects very easily. She is comfortable with sippy cups but my wife insisted on using glass so we purchased the whole set of life factory bottles only to be dissapointed. The concept of tightening or loosening the cap for the flow does not work for us, my daughter would just unscrew it open and spill it if I did not tighten it all the way causing the flow to be non-existent.	
- 1	I bought this book for my 7 month old daughter.  It tries too hard.  There is way too much going on and she gets overwhelmed when reading it.  At 9 months she would still rather read the more simplistic Squishy Turtle book.	
- 1	I bought this then realized that it's for kidco pressure mounted gate only. So we had to buy more....The online description doesn't say so or maybe hidden somewhere??	
- 1	As a first-time father, I've had the opportunity to try out a range of different products. There are the ones I love. Then there are the ones I don't use. Unfortunately, the Freshfoods Mash & Serve Bowl falls into the latter category.While the concept is great, the materials are simply lacking. Unless you're mashing up already super-soft or hard veggies steamed to mush, this masher doesn't get you very far. And if the food you want to mash is already that soft, like soft pairs or bananas, there's no real need to mash it anyway. Any potato masher can do the same trick, and would likely be more durable, too.	
1. 	I think that my husband and I like the light even better than our son :) My son is only 3 months old, but he loves to gaze at the stars on the ceiling and walls. It calms him down when he is having a fit, so I call it the &#34;magic light&#34;.Love this!!!!	
1. 	med were to big, this was the perect size, no air went through and pump worked perfectly with the small shields. no local baby store carried this size, not even babies r us	
- 1	these suck because they don't suck for long. They worked at first but time has proved, getting a cheaper regular bowl would suffice.	
1. 	These bottles worked wonders for my son!  They are great for gassy and colicy babies!  And no matter what anyone says I have been using them for 16 months now and have never had a leak unless you don't pull the nipple in all the way, which any bottle will leak if you don't put the nipple in all the way.  Out of all the bottles I tried these are the best!  THEY ARE DEFINITELEY WORTH THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS!	
- 1	This purchase was a waste of money for my.  My son has had these for 4 months now and has never paid any attention to any of these.  They are made of very hard plastic and not good for teething accept for the squishy part of the butterfly.	
- 1	This mirror is great in theory but not in practice. The A shape that the mirror opens into does not stay, and it ends up folding flat. When it's flat, it's at the wrong angle for Baby to look in and see themselves.	
1. 	This works well with the contour changing pad.  It fits a little snugly, so the corners of the pad don't exactly stay as pointy as they were when it was new, but it works very well.  It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad.  You're right there with baby, anyway.	
- 1	The price on these were quite reasonable, so I figured I would give them a try.  The first month or so that we used these bottles they worked great - so we ordered a ton of them.  Shortly after we started to have a terrible time with them leaking, despite the &#34;SmartClose&#34; feature.  They would leak in between the nipple and the nipple ring.  After we stopped using them I noticed that my infant's gas dramatically decreased after we stopped using these.  We never used the &#34;EasyMix&#34; mixing paddles, either, since they were just more parts to clean.We ended up switching back to the Playtex Ventaire bottles from our first child and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	This is super soft and comfy for baby!  My daughter loves to lay on it!  I love the color too.  It can work in a neutral room.	
1. 	This was the only blanket that my little one didn't kick out of. She used it until she was five months old and way too old to be swaddled. It's light weight, so she didn't get too warm, but also easy to tightly wrap. No annoying velcro in the wrong places, just soft stretchy fabric and plenty of it. I now buy this for every pregnant friend.	
1. 	My baby loves to be bundled when she sleepsso I love this safe alternitive to a blanket they can get tangled in.	
- 1	We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.	
- 1	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.  Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was an infant. She loved that it jingled, liked the colors, could chew on the tags and nose, and liked the vibration of the toy in the middle.  Overall a good product for an infant.	
1. 	we love the Sleep Sheep! For now, we only use the ocean sound and it is a great help in getting our daughter to sleep. The only downside is that you feel sleepy as well... I also don't get the heart sound, it's just weird that it's not the double-beat, but a single-beat instead...	
1. 	I found this product cheaper at Walmart.  The only difference is the middle portion is white.  I like that I'm able to turn the shelves to view the baby food.  I don't like it doesn't allow you to turn each shelf individually.  I also wish it would hold more than 24 jars of food.  But for less than $9.00, it's a great deal so I recommend it.	
1. 	With our first kid, I've been glued to the computer trying to navigate and research all the crap you can buy. I really try to be a minimalist when it comes to parenting gadgetry, but after the first few attempts at non-bib feeding (and mostly subsequent cleaning...ughh) that rose to priority status. We came across these baby bjorns and decided to give them a try. I wouldn't exactly call them soft, they are more of a flexible plastic. Some friends of ourse have silicon bibs that are very malleable, but these definitely keep their shape.First of all, the tray is brilliant!! Catches the food and our kid gets a few more attempts to shovel it in before it inevitably falls to the floor. Cleanup has been significantly reduced and these are easy to wipe down or stick in a dishwasher I guess (though we've never had to do that).The neck strap is easy and secure and the bib doesn't move around when the kid's arms are flailing around so that's definitely a bonus. When we visit friends and family, or go out to eat, we get A LOT of comments and envious looks from other parents. They are a little more expensive, but really easy to use, reduce cleanup, easy and adjustable to wear, firm yet pliable for comfort and protection and effective at keeping food available for the baby.They really perform as I had expected and hoped, therefore 4 stars. I think I would prefer for them to be a little more soft and pliable, but so far they have been excellent.	
1. 	Excellent blanket, I used it to change my baby daughter's contact lens, so I if it fell off I would  see it, not the usual use I know, but now that she is older I will start using it for picnics and it is still in great shape.	
1. 	Most people look at the drop-ins bottles and frown because you have to continually buy liners for them. Let me tell you something, IT'S WORTH IT!! I love not having to wash the bottom part of my bottles.	
1. 	My son really likes this teether.He likes the bottom as well as the vibrating side.My only issue is that it is a bit large and a bit heavy,and he tends to slam it a lot (often on my hand or leg)when I am holding him. Overall, a winner	
- 1	I bought this product for my 5 month old son because it looked really nice in the pictures and my son loves playing with toys and jumping. When I received it, we set it up and it worked well for maybe about a month and then my son starting jumping in it and one of the blue caps popped out went down, and its NOT safe for your baby to be in if there is a older child around that likes to mess with things and who are curious about pushing buttons. My niece was curious about it and pushed it, and went down easily. I prefer something that is child proof. Also one of the springs came off. Also when he was playing in it, I noticed that he tore one of the paper labels and was chewing on it, I took it away. I think they really fix stuff on here especially the legging and the paper labels. I think its better of buying something else more expensive then buying this product because your baby could get hurt or swallow one of the paper labels.	
1. 	Great item, price, etc	
1. 	I like this product, as does my son (though he hasn't quite figured out how to jump yet). But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper.	
- 1	It is near impossible to suck liquid from the straws. I could barely get anything out and my son definitely couldn't. The parts are near impossible to clean as well. The only positive thing I have to say is no they don't leak but that doesn't matter if you can't drink from it. Don't waste your time with these.	
- 1	I ordered this bc of the 'airyness' of the product. I thought it looked sporty and would be great for walks bc it gets so hot in the summer. I was disappointed bc 1) the material is very stiff and was cutting into my baby's leg, 2) the fit was so much different from the babybjorn miracle organic. The organic gave so much more support. I usually walk about 40mins with the baby in the miracle organic but after 10 minutes with the airy I had to go home bc my back was hurting... I don't recommend this. I gave it a 2 star only bc the look is cool.	
- 1	For a little while, these worked great in my car to block the sun. But pretty quickly the suction cups were not sticking properly and then the shade would just hang there awkwardly and wouldn't roll up. Poor quality product. I would NOT recommend this!	
- 1	I only use this go pod when we're at a soccer game. I bought it because I was looking for a chair to place my 5 month old in while I washed the dishes. It turns out that when my baby sits in it, the go pod sinks in. Another thing that I didn't like about it was that the material is falling apart at the corners.	
1. 	Does the job perfectly.  It took me 5 months to finally buy this, wish I had done so earlier and saved myself all the boiling.	
1. 	My wife gets a lot of milk leaking from side A when she feeds from side B. We bought these and some O-cal-ette nursing cups at the same time. These are in my view far superior in design to the O-cal-ette (which has a hole where the milk will leak out), because they have no hole for the leak to milk out, well actually they come with two cups, one with holes, one without, and we use the one without. Great. Also they're apparently comfortable enough to put on while feeding.However!These are not 5 star because... they don't hold enough milk! So we are still wondering if we can find such a product which will fit inside a bra in similar way, but passively collect a larger amount of breastmilk.	
1. 	We use these bowls all the time! They stack great in a refrigerator or cooler. They don't have the worlds best seal (so don't put anything liquid) but they are perfect for baby food or finger foods.	
1. 	We have 2 of these.  They are a must.  Great color and I very much dislike the primary colored gates.  We needed to keep our young crawler and now toddler away from a gas fireplace in the winter and a console with electronics on it.  They come apart and are adjustable which is great.	
- 1	This was WAY different than I thought when I received it in the mail.  The part you're supposed to wear in your bra was probably 4 times the size of my actual boob and looked ridiculously uncomfortable.  Plus, if the idea is to save milk this is kind of a terrible system because it seems like it would be pretty messy.  Anyway, I returned it after a quick glance, knowing I could never make any use out of this.	
1. 	I own this cover in Eyelet Black, and it's awesome.  I have used others Bebe Au Lait covers, and I would specifically recommend Eyelet Black for two reasons.  1) The lighter colored ones allow light to pass through.  My daughter is incredibly curious, and she got distracted when could see shadows and suspected that something interesting was going on outside.  With the black one, it's not an issue.  2) There are two layers, the top of which is embroidered.  Because of this, it's thicker and more stiff than the other fabric options.  That means that it keeps the shape.  When I used a different cover that had been lent to me, it sometimes collapsed a bit and covered her face, which she and I both disliked.  I suspect that Eyelet Ivory would be just as good since it's also lined, but I haven't tested it.  I have never felt like it was too hot under the black cover (even in summer), but I didn't spend a lot of time nursing in direct sunlight.  The size of these covers is good -- large enough, but manageable.  In a pinch, we've used it to cover her stroller and to keep her warm.  The only issue I ever had is that my daughter will sometimes grab the fabric and pull it aside to see out, but I don't think that could be avoided with any cover.  She's just too nosy!	
- 1	If I had written this review when I bought the cup 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, my baby is 14 months old. We try and give her a regular cup as much as we can. Sometimes, though, we need to give her a drink in a cup that won't spill - and these are perfect for that. The problem now is that she has teeth and she bites on the end of the spout. We do our best to discourage this, but it only takes a second and POOF - she's bitten a huge hole in the end. (Check out the pictures of this listing - someone posted an image of EXACTLY what happens when the child bites off the end.) I've started to get worried about giving her the cup, as I found her chewing on a piece of silicone she got off of the end. It wasn't enough that she would have choked, but still not good for her. Thus, I've had to buy replacement nipples ALL THE TIME. I bought 5 of these cups in different styles and I am about to go buy replacement spout #6 & #7. Bottom line: this is a great cup for a transition from the bottle. But, once your baby has teeth, you'll be buying replacement spouts until the cows come home or you switch to a cup with a hard spout.	
1. 	We love love love our miracle blanket.  This is what baby sleeps in every night.  At 1 month old he was sleeping 6 hours a night.	
- 1	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.  While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.	
- 1	I bought these because they are washable and the box said they are 100% cotton.  However, while prepping them for first use, they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron. Why, you ask? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging! I started to iron the first one, and my iron began sticking to the pad. I peeled it off the iron, and there, in a perfect circle, were little melted remnant marks from the thread. It is not even polyester thread, which tolerates a VERY high heat (i.e., cotton) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed. I really wanted to use these because they are cotton. So, off to the drawing board, I will just have to sew my own. And in case you are wondering why I would iron them, they come out of the wash very wrinkly (whether you air dry or put in the dryer; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods). One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling, thus, my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you don't mind wrinkles, or are planning on using a padded nursing bra, then I suppose these would work for you... But if you are like me, and prefer no padding in your bra, then I would give these a pass.	
1. 	These fit the summer infant changing pad perfectly. I place a Carters waterproof basinet pad over it for quick washing when the baby has an accident mid-diaper change!	
- 1	These cups leak in two places, both from the air flow valve in the cap and all around the top. It's not impossible to get the straw back through the flip top after cleaning, but it's not terribly easy each time either. Within an hour after first washing the cup and helping my son learn how to use the straw top, there were milk spots, puddles and drops all over his high chair, the floor, my pants (he had sat on my lap), and his clothes. I actually would have been far happier if it had leaked from the straw! That I could understand, but how hard should it be to screw it on and go? I've played with how tight I twist it and I'm sure I'll continue to in hopes I can minimize the leakage as much as possible. But all in all, it just shouldn't be this complicated.The straw does take some practice, too. I tried it first myself. It's straw shaped, but you have to bite or press your teeth along the valve in the straw in order to get fluid. Not a bad design at all.My hope is I'll find the sweet spot and be able to get some real use out of the cup. We'll see.	
- 1	I love all the orange ones I bought and love this products so much. However for the blue one I bought, it leaks, turns out that either the lid or the bottle is not round shape so those two never go together. Need better quality control.	
- 1	We bought this because we were going camping and wanted to sit by the fire while our little one slept in the camper. The battery only lasts about 15 minutes on the one you listin to, so we had to find a plug so we could keep it going. It doesn't get very loud. If it weren't for the vibrating and the red lights, you wouldn't know your baby was crying. I had the volume up all the way and heard him through the wall yesterday rather than the baby monitor. I do like the vibration idea so you can know there is noise even if you are someplace noisy.	
- 1	My baby could get his hands out of this no matter how big he was and how tight this fit him. Disappointing.	
1. 	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.	
- 1	These are fine, but super tiny and stiff. I prefer the larger Kushies if you are covering your changing pad. These might be OK for travel. Otherwise, not sure how you would use them.	
- 1	I bought this because of the high user ratings / comments & a recommendation from my Doula. I also love the idea of wrapping him on because it seems more organic and natural.THE GOOD*Might be decent to use once the weather turns really cool (winter time).THE BAD*Too bulky:: Even with directions, I found the Moby tedious to handle and tie due to its bulk and length.*Thick material:: The material wasn't very breathable due to the thick cotton. In the S. California climate I live in, it can get pretty warm during the day and this just creates way too much heat.OVERALL*If I lived in a mostly cool/cold climate this might work for me but I don't. I put the Moby in storage and currently using (and very satisfied with) a Baby Bjorn carrier.	
- 1	This combo has such potential.  The colors are fantastic and very eye catching.  My daughter is drawn to it and you can see her eyes light up when I put her on the mat.  Unfortunately the toy bar falls down which defeats the purpose of that part of the entertainment.  This became very frustrating for not only myself but my daughter as well.  The included pillow is really not all that useful for support with the seat and only helps a little for tummy time since it is so slick.  The included toys are liked by my daughter and developmentally appropriate.  However, the actual seat positioner is so upright that my daughter slides down quickly.  It seems to me that once your baby is able to sit up in this seat it only has a very short window of usefulness before it gets tossed aside.	
- 1	Nicely made and holds pacifiers well, but they coat it in an antimicrobial, teflon finish, which contains countless toxic chemicals. Not the best for something containing an item designed specifically for a baby's mouth! I researched what Ju Ju Be coats their fabrics with, and the chemicals used are not safe. Teflon and Agion finishes are not &#34;non-toxic&#34; and should not be used on items that babies are going to be in contact with in any way...pacifiers stored in this and then put in baby's mouth...not a good idea. I learned this after I had already purchased this and a number of other Ju Ju Be products...a very expensive mistake! I wish I'd known what they coated it with before purchase because I would never have bought them. Ju Ju Be's products are so nicely made and so practical in thought, that I wish they would make them without the chemical finish!	
1. 	Seems to help with my son's colic. Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it. Air will flow through the nipple. We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving.	
- 1	Let me start out by saying I do not write reviews for things, because I really don't have the time.I registered for this monitor for my baby shower and was really excited when I received it. We started using it this week because our 5 month old has just started sleeping in his own room, and we wanted to be able to check on him. We turned it on and all was well until after about 15 minutes the monitor made a loud static noise and the screen went blank. Confused, I went in his room and noticed the camera had shut itself off. I figured it was just a fluke, so I turned it back on and got back in bed. 30 minutes later the same thing happened. These are not the only problems with this monitor, however:1) Above mentioned issue.2) The static was absolutely unbelievable. Even with no objects around to cause interference, the noise was still there.3) The set only comes with one plug, so you can't choose to plug both the camera and the monitor in at the same time. It's either one or the other.4) They are so light that anything that barely hits them will knock them over. So forget putting them in a crib, pack, and play, or anything.5) The camera doesn't come with anything to attach it to the crib wall. The monitor part does, but why would I need a clip on the monitor? Seems to me the clip should have been on the camera so it could be attached to the side of the pack and play, etc.Needless to say, I would not recommend this product. We are in the process of finding another set.	
- 1	The picture is correct - there are no stems in these diaphragms.  Now I'm at a loss as to where to find the replacement parts.	
- 1	I was shocked when I read all of the 5 star reviews. These are horrible bibs. They are listed as waterproof, and is very far from the truth. Never have these kept moisture off of his clothing. We would have to double bib him, and even then, both would be drenched in a half hour or so. We will stick with our generic Target brand ones that absorb and wash great.	
- 1	These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!	
- 1	Though pink and cute, this thing never seemed to work quite right. The baby wasn't stable in it -- she would flop over forward. Observers wondered if she would fall out. While that never happened, she'd get burn marks on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.  Ouch...An annoyance: I had to get help to clamp it into doorways; couldn't attach & detach it myself.It just didn't work for us.By way of comparison: our favorite jumper was the Graco Bumper Jumper. Still working very well for us. She bounces much more often and more happily in the Graco than she did in the Evenflo.	
1. 	Great price and sturdy! It is flimsy and lightweight but thats to be expected when paying this little for it. Very easy to clean and my 2 year old can set it up himself and replace it back to its home!	
1. 	This Nursery and Bath Care Set contains a number of highly useful baby items stored in a case that's compact and sturdy enough for regular travel.  Our son recently turned two and we still have the kit on-hand for almost daily use.The best items include*  the well-designed medicine spoon:  It stands upright on its own so you can pour liquids into it and see how much you've dispensed;  the guidelines are metric on one side and English on the other;  the spoon itself is sized well for baby with little to no mess* the nail clippers:  Big handle for sure gripping while holding a potentially squirmy customer* the bath thermometer:  Much more accurate than so many other bath toys that try to do double duty as a thermometer).The most disappointing component was predictably the thermometer.  It's a pretty simplistic digital model that needed to be held in place too long to get very accurate readings from a baby.  My wife and I use it ourselves and it works fine.  If your baby tends to get a lot of fevers, invest in a high-end ear or forehead thermometer for the best combination of accuracy and speed.  The toothbrush is also not very helpful because by the time baby is ready to begin brushing, he or she will want a less clinical-looking model with a smaller, softer head than this one has.One note on the negative review at the top of the page:  maybe everyone should move to Ann Arbor, MI before delivering because the hospitals and pharmacies are much more liberal with their giveaways there.  We loved our hospital experience, but our parting gifts consisted of a bulb aspirator (which wasn't as nice as the one in this kit), a pat on the back and a have a nice day now.  Leaving the hospital and coming home with a newborn, especially your first, can be an unbelievably hectic time - I wouldn't want to rely on the possibility of freebies to help us take care of our baby.Given the low cost of this kit, it's well worth knowing that you're prepared to come home with your newborn.  And the Nursery and Bath Care Set will continue to pay off with its travel convenience and useful contents for years to come.	
1. 	This is the best for me. It is very simple to use, even when you are a first mum and are giving baby his first bath, and convenient according to baby's age.	
1. 	Very light weight, flexible, VERY EASY to clean and has a large adjustable Velcro strap on the back  for attachment	
1. 	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!	
- 1	Very thin and they have no trim around the edge so they tend to just ball up and not spread out. I found similar ones at Babies R Us that are far superior in quality. The colors are cute though.	
- 1	I never used these because I figured that they would not be comfortable. What a waste of money and resources.	
- 1	The bottle itself seems well made, and the in-bottle mixer keeps the clumps from staying together, but my daughter didn't latch on to the nipple. She did not like the bottle at all, and, while it may have been just her, it was a shame seeing the order for this bottle go to waste.So far we've been using the Medela and Playtex bottles, which work fine.	
- 1	It looks like a good idea, nice size, good specs, etc. but this thing is a piece of junk!  Even 10 feet from the base it constantly clicks and pops and then randomly beeps.  Also I have been able to hear my baby crying down the hall but couldn't hear it through the monitor.	
1. 	This bed was purchased for our first grandson who has not arrived yet.  The only problem was when it was delivered by UPS the box and the bed was damaged.  They had this bed picked up and another delivered within 2 days. Our son put the bed together and it looks so nice and sturdy.  Our grandson, Autry will love it as much as his parents we hope.  GREAT CHOICE :)	
1. 	Good price and good product. Fit well with the pack n play mattress.  Mattress cover is a must have when you have new baby.	
1. 	Great to have baby at the table.  She shoves food up under the part that hooks onto the table though, and it's really hard to get onto a table with a skirt.  That's rare in a restaurant, so it's GREAT for out and about, but we have a hard time using it at home.  It's definitely worth the price though.	
1. 	No more plugs to plug in or pots to boil. Just pop it in the microwave and walk away.  It fits all of her bottles and pacifiers in one process and it fits perfectly in my small kitchen when I am not using it. Definatly worth buying! you will get good use out of it.	
1. 	I am a first time mom and have never used another bather for my two and a half month old.  It's easy to store, dries fast, and my baby seems very comfy in it.  It fits nicely in my sink and its mesh fabric allows water to flow through.  After reading other reviews, I want to try it in the bath with me and see how baby and I like it!	
1. 	This swing is great, my baby is both entertained by it and put to sleep by it, it's really comfy and soft, he loves the noises and especially the mirror.  The cover is easily removable and washes up great.  I gave it only four stars because it's larger than most swings and does take up a bit of space, so if you don't have a lot of room this swing is not for you.  But if you do have the room this is the swing to get.  I love that it goes either back and forth or side to side, it also reclines for sleeping!	
1. 	As a working mom, every moment counts.  These wipes have saved me a lot of time from having to wash and rinse pump parts after every use.  The wipes clean the pump parts very well, and my child has never had a bad reaction from milk pumped after using these wipes to clean the parts.  Highly recommended (just wish they were cheaper)!	
- 1	I bought this head support hoping that it would help keep my newborn's head from falling forward until she could support her head on her own. It didn't, I was very disappointed. It was actually more of a hassle to put in the carseat as well because it was bulky and didn't stay in place.	
- 1	it does not hold the cloth diaper well, and very sharp, I am afraid it will hurt the baby if the baby move and we are not careful.	
- 1	Just doesn't seem to work well.  You have to suck on it pretty hard for it to work at all.  And when you do, our infant would cry (I guess it was painful).  It never seemed to collect much mucus even though our infant was definitely congested.	
1. 	Any baby would hate a cold wipe. When my daughter was only 1 week old, I was going crazy and went to the store and bought this. She screamed every time we took her diaper off, and it was b/c she knew that cold wipe was coming!!! After we got this, she dosent mind at all. I haven't had a problem with it at all. Once in a while, a drop or two of water will spill out when you open it (I still havent tried the pop up wipes) but, usually it is b/c I have a little too much water in the bottom. Do keep the wet 'cusion' wet though... if you forget to wet it (usually 1-2 times a week) it becomes hard, and you will have to soak it to get it back to normal. I have bought the refill pad/ cusion for it as well. They come 2 to a pack and I think it cost me about $6 - $7 by mail including shipping. However, I just put the first replacement in - I used the original for almost 6 months.	
1. 	Yet another great product from Avent!  This is so very easy to use and in minutes you have sterilized bottles, pacifiers, toys, pretty much anything that you can fit into the the thing.  We have a dishwasher, but our doctor advised that newborns can be sensitive to the soap the first few months.  Plus with animals in the house, we just like the idea of a little extra peace of mind.  By the way, we started with the electric sterilizer but after reading the directions and seeing it's size we returned it for this one.  This one is easier to store and use and is faster.	
- 1	I am very disappointed in the size of this mattress... after looking for a while I was sure that it will perfectly fit the Dream On Me full size play yard but it did not! There is a huge gap! Can someone please tell me if there is a mattress out there that leaves no gaps in the play yard?? We only use it for the baby to sleep at grandma's and at the summer house so unless I can comfortably put my 16 month old to sleep I do not need neither the play yard not the mattress.... I'm not happy with this purchase.	
- 1	I like the bib but the Velcro is very had/tough and leaves scratches all over the back of 4 month old baby's neck. Would give four+ stars if they were buttons or softer Velcro.	
1. 	We have been huge fans of Halo products from the start. We used the swaddled all the time for our daughter for the first few months. We even had an issue with one of the swaddles and my husband emailed the Halo company about it and received a response from the FOUNDER of the company who seemed genuinely appreciative of our feedback.For that reason, we have stuck with this brand and have been using the wearable blankets as she has grown. She currently wears a fleece one to bed every night and will wear these cotton ones during the spring.  These are wonderful products made by a great company who stands behind them.	
1. 	Love their products.  Our son's been in halo sleepsacks since he was 1 month old.  Back then he used the swaddlers, then transitioned over at about 4 months to a newborn sleep sack, then to a small.  And now we're onto the medium sizes.  Crazy how they grow.This is a really cute print.  I love the light turqoise-ish color with cute little owls on it.  This sleep sack has served us well.  Durable, breathable and best of all, safe.  I think my son's so used to having a sleep sack on, I don't know what he'll do when we eventually switch to a blanket!We however, live in CA and get 100+ degree weather here during the summers and I just wish that halo also makes a thinner muslin version of this sleep sack for the really hot weather places.  Make a muslin version to compete with aden and anis please!	
1. 	We really like this bag - it has compartments to keep everything in order.  We also like the fact that it can be strapped onto the stroller.  Our only complaint is that because its fully lined, the bag is a little heavy even before we stock it with essentials.	
- 1	I was very eager to give Happy Heinys a try after receiving recommendations from friends. However, I was disappointed after washing them a few times because EVERY time I washed them, the laundry tabs came undone and they stuck to my other inserts, leaving nasty velcro marks on them. I could care less at this point whether or not they actually leak or not because if they are going to RUIN all of the rest of my diapers I don't want anything to do with them. Too bad, they are very cute.	
1. 	The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.	
- 1	Cute on the outside but the inside is just plain clear filmsy pages like a normal cheap photo album you get at a drug store. From the photo is seemed it might be more plush inside like pages from a true baby's book.I bought two as gifts to fill with pics and give as baby shower gifts to a close friend and family member. But now will have to rethink since the album isn't as nice as I was expecting.	
- 1	Glad we only got one of these. I've had my fair share of sippy cup reviews with three little ones. I preferred not to use this wobbly, hard to put cap on without spilling milk (handles get in the way). Also its germ infested...you need to pop off the dome slider that covers the straw, otherwise mold grows in there (even when run through the dishwasher). There also is a film of milk left behind (unlike any other cups) and this takes forever to dry because of its shape. Also mold grows in between the weighted base and clear cup...doesn't effect its use, just gross.	
- 1	The materials used to make these attractive bowls stinks! It comes out of the dishwasher with white crust that won't come off. When I washed the first bowl I thought it was a fluke and even tried to scrape of the stuff (didn't work). Then I realized it happened with all three bowls. I've thrown them away because now they're ugly!	
1. 	Pros:Interchangeable cards, a more versatile mobile than most availableLightweightNot bulky and obtrusiveReally like the stimulating designs/colors/black & whiteCons:The interchangeable cards can be hard to disconnect and connectDepending on the design of your crib, this attachment device may not work	
- 1	the blanket is very soft but every time I use it i have to get thefuzz off the baby. It sheds on everything!	
- 1	I bought this product to use on my 14 month old's teeth. When I used it I felt like my hands had a weird film on them afterward. It didn't make me super confident about using them in my son's mouth. Other than that it's a great concept, wish it had been executed better.	
1. 	My twins LOVE this toy. I credit this with helping them both become excellent sitters because it held their attention for long periods of times and helped build their core strength. I can't say enough good things about this toy.	
- 1	Sending back for refund. A bead broke in half and was in my daughter's mouth within the first hour of wearing. Dangerous product.  Also, the necklace is ugly and unpolished, unlike the photo in the description.	
1. 	we been through 5 different potty seats. This one is our favorite. We bought two. Very easy to clean and its comfy for our toddler.	
- 1	Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer.  Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time.	
1. 	This bottle system looks very intimidating at first but is anything but that.  We started using them after we recieved 2 free 4oz ones at the baby faire.  My daughter responds very very well to them and hardly spits up.  She still does but the reduction is amazing.  Once you work out a cleaning system they are a breeze to clean.  The disk that goes between the vent and the nipple makes it wonderful for travel and preventing formula clumps from clogging the nipple something I have noticed with Similac formula.  I am just ashamed I didn't listen to my fiancee's demands.  He used the regular ones for his son from a previous marriage and insisted by them.  If you are pregnant and going through the great bottle debate these are the ones to buy hands down.  You will kick yourself if you don't.  I know I did.	
1. 	Arrived quick. Always need these. Replacement valves save the cups. I love that Playtex offers replacements, since our other brand cups don't. When those get lost or broken, we have to throw the cups away.	
- 1	The problem with this monitor is that it doesn't hold a charge. I go to bed with a full charge at 100% and in the middle of the night I am awakened by the annoying beeping sound alerting me the battery is dying. I have a baby, I am awakened every night by him, why would i want to be woken up by this monitor TOO????  Why not keep the monitor in the charging unit? Because the manual says that if you consistently keep it on the charging unit, it will ware out the battery and limit battery life!!! Then I will have to buy a new battery. I have returned this item 3 times in case it was just defective and they were all like this. I finally had to buy a new monitor from another company who's monitor last 36 hours while in the sleep mode without being charged. Much happier!Other than that, I like the monitor but the charging issue was just a terrible.	
1. 	I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
- 1	We loved our K'tan when my son was a newborn, but it was borrowed from a friend. We bought the breeze when we had to return the borrowed one. It just didn't live up to the all cotton one. We had hoped that the K'tan breeze would allow our son to not be as hot in the Texas heat, but it just didn't feel secure. I'd been using the K'tan for several months before buying the breeze and my son would start to slip out every time because the mesh was so slippery. Love the idea and it would be great in the Texas heat, but it did not feel like my son was safe.	
- 1	Okay, this product stinks.  The concept is great, but the product isn't.  The spinning thing is quite hard and not comfortable to lay on for long periods.  My 4-month old is much happier laying in the same position on something that's much softer, like a boppy pillow (which we don't have, but he likes the one at his daycare).  We have 3 tummy time mats, and this one is by far the worst quality.  It constantly bunches up and is pilling even though it's barely been used.  The bunching up issue is even worse since the mat/spinner set are designed so a baby would really be grabbing onto the mat while spinning - so you'd think the mat would be a little sturdier to grab onto, but the way it is, it's really hard for the baby to grab and spin.	
- 1	I initially bought these to go in thristies pull up pocket diapers for my daughter who after a year and a 1/2 of complete potty trained success suddenly began wetting the bed at night sometimes multiple times...i absolutely refused to incur the expense of disposable pull ups...so i sought out a cloth alternative. To get to the point these would NOT stay put in the pocket they are wide and stiff so with no contour it is very odd to put on and to wear, needless to say my daughter wouldnt wear them and even when she did the insert just rode up onside in the diaper and she still wet everything. I kept them and them anyway and we shortly found out we were expecting so as soon as my ds was large enough to use them i tried them out but they arent as asorbent as i had hoped and as a doubler they add SO muchg bulk...they are not very soft and well they just arent a go to with me the only time i use them is as a by itself lay in(like u would a perfold) when we are home and he can just cruise in his diaper. It has ben dificult to get stains out of them as well...i am an immediate treater ie: i spray out and then treat with my stain remover mixture and give it a brush in a small circular motion then spray again wash within 48 hours. They just arent great so i gues u get what you pay for	
1. 	I am very happy with this purchase!  I wish I would have bought it when my son was even younger.I was going to purchase a different booster seat that was recommended to me, but some people recommended this one, and i'm so glad I went with this one!  it is great because it is so easy to clean, can be used with or without tray (we use it without any tray, pulled up to the dining table with us), and my favorite part is that it has adjustable height so it will grow with him and he doesn't have to be so low right now.  it also straps under the seat, around the back of the table chair, and the child is strapped in with 3 point harness.highly recommend!	
1. 	My son and I love this tub. I used the sling to give him sponge baths until his cord fell off. He is now 6 weeks old and no need for the sling anymore: he sits perfectly in the &quot;newborn&quot; side of the tub, without slipping. I also enjoy the fact that this tub has a separate water compartment than we put clean water to rinse the baby afterwards. The changing color plug is a plus, because it indicates if the water is too warm for baby.It fits perfectly in our sink too!I recommend this tub, it's great!	
1. 	Pros:Within 30 minutes of installing this, our 17 month old fell right on the corner.  She got up right away and kept playing, no marks or crying.  Bottom line is that it works, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.Cons:- I thought it would be bigger.  The depth towards the fireplace is okay, but it isn't very deep towards the floor. ...not sure if I explained that right, but basically it doesn't cover as much as I'd prefer.- I can't leave my baby alone near it for a second or she'll rip it off.  And half the time it rips the whole velcro off the brick instead of leaving one side as it should.	
- 1	Great idea, but what toilet does this fit?  I bought this with high hopes and it would have been great if I could actually use it. I've tried both toilets at home and two public restrooms and it doesn't fit any of them. It's going back.	
- 1	We needed a back up sleep sac since our baby has taken to puking at night.  We have a sleep nest which we love, but for some unkown reason i decided to try this as something different. The main thing that dissapointed me about this item is the thinness of it. You can literally see through the fabric it is so thin. I thought it would at least be somewhat substantial... but no... nearly weightless and totally see through. The sleep nest we got on amazon was much nicer since it was thick and the shoulders had snaps, so you can lay your baby down and then tuck them in with two simple snaps and a zipper. This one provides no warmth.  If i had not ripped the packaging when opening it.. I would have returned it.  Maybe we can use this for summer... but totally not worth the price of the item.	
1. 	This toy net works well enough, but it is not quite as large as I originally thought.  It's triangle shape makes it for corner use only, and can be a bit off balanced if not positioned perfectly.  If the netting came up further on each side, I would give it 5 stars.	
- 1	My mom bought this for my toddlers, and it is impossible to clean the top. It quickly grew mold despite my best efforts to keep it clean, and it had to be thrown away. It was just not worth the hassle when they are much better dippy cups out there.	
- 1	We registered for these and I thought they'd be a cute alternative to using a cloth diaper as a burp cloth. We used them once or twice, laundered them, and now they sit in the drawer.  They're wash cloths with a pretty piece of cloth stitched to one side.  Not quite big enough if your baby is even half as wiggly as our little guy.  They're not even that absorbent and the wash cloth is quite rough. The pretty material shrank up a bit, too, so now the cloth puckers on the sides because one side is smaller than the other.If you're looking for burp cloths, your best bet by far is a cloth diaper- they're soft, absorbent, launder really well, and can take lots of abuse and still last forever.  Gerber makes a 12 pack that doesn't cost too much more than a pack of four of these non-functional burp cloths.	
1. 	I got these because my son always wants to sip from my reusable straw cup. He tosses this around and it really doesn't leak much at all. He could get the straw out if he really tried but it stays in there pretty well.  The cups are durable and clean up easily.	
1. 	We used this product under our Graco infant carrier car seat base and it worked wonderfully.  Not only did the police officer who checked our installation not tell us not to use, he said it was one of the coolest things he'd ever seen.  After he showed me how to really get that base in tight, the seat didn't move it all.  I think we could have lubed the seat with WD40 and it wouldn't have slid around.  At first I thought the coolest thing about it was the mesh container that hangs in front of the seat - a great place to stash used bottles, diapers, etc., but when we recently took the base out to install the next size car seat, we saw a bunch of caked on spit-up and other nastiness that never made it onto the leather, thanks to the under mat!  Those having problems may just need to put a little more oomph behind their car seat installation.	
- 1	If I could give it zero stars, I would!  It is poorly made and cheap...I guess you get what you pay for!  The wood and joints squeak no matter what and it's VERY annoying when rocking a baby!  What a waste of money--you will regret this if you purchase it!!	
- 1	This product is so flimsy with the 2 piece extension that my husband is joking that it wouldn't keep a gerbil in. Really regretting purchase and will have to get something else as I don't even want to put my child in this. Only reason it gets 2 stars is that it was fairly easy to put together. Panels shake, gate drags on ground. Would not recommend!	
1. 	Our changing table has curved ends, and it still fits nicely on the end! The top is the perfect size for a variety of diaper cases, and diapers fit nicely underneath. The little baskets on the side slide on and off, so you can choose whether or not to use them. It's made from a nice strong plastic, though it would break if dropped like most clear hard plastics, do. I highly recommend it if you need extra storage or shelf space!	
1. 	We began by using this in the bathroom while potty training my son but now it travels all over the house. He carries it to the kitchen sink to wash his hands, help cook or bake and work on projects in the garage. I love that it is small and light enough for him to carry and still so useful!	
- 1	Like the pattern and the weight if the fabric. Piece at top to keep it stiff so you can see baby isn't stiff enough and doesn't work well unless in perfect position. Seen better ones my friends have.	
- 1	My son is 3 weeks old and I already have to replace this bottle brush, with very light use (I wash the bottles right away, then use the microwave sanitizer for a deep clean).  I'm disappointed because we love Dr. Brown's products, but the sponge on the top of this brush has already started to shred.  The bristle part is not sturdy enough to give the bottles a good quick scrub, either.  I do like the little stand and the fact that I can keep that on the sink so I can stand the brush up to dry.  I went out and bought another munchkin bottle brush because this one was quite a disappointment.  We used Dr. Brown's bottles with my daughter for a whole year and only bought two or three bottle brushes that entire time.  I really liked the one with the soap inside it for the 8 oz Dr. Brown's bottlesMunchkin Soap Dispensing Bottle Brush,Colors Varybut it's not necessary.  But the regular munchkin one is a lot less expensive and works great tooMunchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush, Colors May Vary.  The bristles are much stiffer and you have to really shove it into the smaller bottles, but they hold up well, unlike the Dr. Brown's bottle brush.  Lesson learned.	
- 1	Very short and doesn't hold much weight at all!! Also the hook at the top does not open so it doesn't work with most musical attachments. Very disappointed in this item!	
- 1	Its too flimsy to make a real difference...if you are looking into co-sleepers because you are afraid to sleep with your baby in the bed you are better off getting an Arms Reach co-sleepier bassinet, because this product won't instill too much sense of safety	
- 1	The seat is just a piece of fabric no cushion. The adjustments are so minimal it seams like you barely moved it. The walker is too tall for a 3-4 month old and I have a very tall baby. We returned this item and went to Babies R Us and bought the cheapest Babies R Us brand it is was way better than this one and cost less.	
1. 	Great for keeping his legs out of the crib slats for the most part (he somehow still manages, but this keeps them from going up past his knees I think).  Helps us all get more sleep.	
1. 	I purchased these instead of using regular ice cube trays because the included lids and were specifically for baby food/milk.  They work very well for our needs and I would recommend highly.  I bought two sets and use one exclusively for breast milk, the other for baby food (to avoid any allergy issues).  They are constantly going from freezer to sink and back again and still work great after 8 months of heavy use.	
1. 	I was thinking I could use it inside for my baby to crawl on and use as an indoor playmat. It is more for outside picnics. It is a little slippery, especially on carpet. I think it would work good outdoors for a picnic. It is not a playmat.	
- 1	I know, it's only four dollars, but I still feel it wasn't worth it.  One of the straps is already frayed, and one of the snaps doesn't close well at all.  The blurb states it's adjustable to two lengths; all that really happens is you choose a different snap - and for me this created a larger loop through which my son stuck his hand, twisted, and got it wound pretty tightly.  The ring of the toy to which it was attached could have made an effective tourniquet had I not been watching.  This product was poorly designed and poorly manufactured.	
1. 	bought this for our 4 weeks when she started tracking and looking at contrasting things...the mirrored section is a big hit, she will stare at this for quite a while and seems to enjoy it	
- 1	This would work if you had some way to keep it flat in travel or only used at home. We bought to use at reestaurants and because we had to fold it up everytime, when we unfolded it wouldn't lay flat or attach. Never attached to tables with the shiny varnish. Used about 5 times and passed along. Did like the catch trough though!!	
- 1	BOUGHT THESES FOR MY DAUGHTER IN LAW AND SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE AND THAT SHE WAS UNABLE TO USE THEM	
1. 	I use it with the re-usable cloth diapering Dekor Bags and it has been WONDERFUL.If you haven't already added it to your baby registry.... DO IT!  Love the low profile aesthetic as well!	
- 1	This is obviously not the product's fault, so maybe I shouldn't be giving it only 2 stars but every time I hang the diaper bag on the back of the stroller with these and then take the baby out, the stroller falls over backward. I guess there is a reason that they don't already have these hooks on the handles of most strollers!	
1. 	I bought one of these a while back when my daughter was teething (she is 15 months now, and almost all of her teeth now!) and they worked great with ice cubes. When she started eating more solid foods, we put bananas in there, and even some apple slices. I like how the mesh only allows a small amount of food to come through. The only downside to these, are how messy they are. But kids are already messy, and it's better than straight handing them a banana. She loved sucking on the ice cubes, and at times, it would be the only thing that would help her teeth. On a side note, make sure you put them in water RIGHT AFTER you are done using it. It will become way too hard to wash them otherwise, and I had to buy a whole new one after I made the mistake of leaving food in it .	
1. 	Although we bought it last July 2012, we just set it up this month for our growing baby. Her cradle was the same color, so the transition to the new crib was easy.Set-up: My husband started it and was having a difficult time matching the right washers and pegs, etc and he was using a drill. The wood is very sensitive and gets scratched easily. (We just used a magic marker to cover those minor scratches). Nothing is perfect. Since hubby was tired and then got sick, and I had been waiting for the crib to be ready to use for weeks, I finally took over while he and baby slept. I used a small hand tool (as recommended in one of the instruction papers) and was able to finish it after a total of two hours.Overall, we are very pleased with this product. We love how it looks and how sturdy it is. Hopefully it will last us a while for our future little ones...And our daughter loves how spacious her crib is (compared to her itty bitty cradle!).	
- 1	I like this bib but our baby hasn't. Got it for him at six months, still won't wear it at a year - he pulls it off.	
- 1	The concept of this product is good, but I found the snaps extremely difficult to snap and unsnap (maybe they get easier with a little wear, but I haven't used it enough to see).  Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.  Seems like most crib mattresses slide out pretty easily, making this product pretty unnecessary.	
1. 	Boppy's done it again!  My grandson enjoys his tummy time so much more with this great pad!  He also likes it for laying on his back and playing, too!  Great addition to his learning skills, highly recommended to all babies!	
1. 	Baby #4 is due in a few weeks and we just assembled this today.I think my biggest concern (ordering site unseen) was the scattered reviews that said a normal mattress didn't fit the crib.  I have a Sealy baby mattress (probably really Kolcraft) - nothing fancy - and it fits just fine so that worry has been laid to rest.  Maybe some people had wonky cribs or wonky mattresses, I don't know.My other big concern was how solid is the crib.  I had a crib collapse on one of my daughters - luckily she was not hurt, but she was stuck by her neck which is not something I ever want to experience again.  What happened with that crib was one of the bolt plugs that the mattress support screws into popped out of the wood.  It was a drop side crib, but not exactly a drop side issue.  Still, I am sure the extra wiggle of a drop side crib added to the plug working lose.  For the record - I think drop sides CAN be made safely.  The problem is nowadays things are being made CHEAPLY - which is the real issue.  This crib is not a drop side, so it is super solid to begin with.  Then at each corner of the mattress, rather than a single bolt plug (sorry, I don't know the wood working term but you know it if you see it!) is a strip of metal with 4 holes, held in with 3 screws - which seems MUCH more secure to me than one single bolt plug.  This crib DOES NOT move when you shake it.I'm a little concerned about the gap between the two top rails that some have mentioned their kid getting stuck in.  Truth to tell we'd have gone with Kalani to skip that issue if Kalani was available in natural - but everything else we own is natural and I really wanted natural  so I am going to hope that is not a problem for is - or if it is it is something the child does once and learns not to do again.  Time will tell.  There are covers you can tie on to prevent this if needed.The wood IS on the softer side - I am hoping having it in natural will make scratches less apparent.  We live in an 80+ year old house, so I'm used to things having character.  None of my other kids have been crib chewers so I am not too concerned about that being a problem - if it is there are covers you can buy (the same ones to prevent the arm wedging).I love that it comes WITH a real toddler bar - none of this take a side off and call it a toddler bed when it's not, or having to order the toddler bar as an extra piece for a LOT of money.  That's just baloney.  LOVE that this includes it.OK all that said.  It's gorgeous.  It went together fairly easily (though I was surprised at how many pieces it came in - but I managed to get it all together myself except for the mattress support, even 9 months pregnant with 3 kids under foot).  The price is nice.  It's SOLID.  There is one thing I hate about it, though.  The curvey fronts make it very hard to side-car against an adult bed, which was my plan with this crib.  There is a BIG gap.  I don't like this at all.  So it's possible for the first year we might put one of my twins in this crib in toddler mode, and sidecar her current crib to our bed - or I might devise some sort of sling to go between this crib and our bed to close the gap (would also prevent the crib from sliding away - we have hardwood floors and the crib moves very easily).  I'm not annoyed enough by the problem to pack the crib back up and ship it back, but I wish I had gotten a crib with a flat front.  If you're planning to side-car, keep looking.  If you want a gorgeous solid crib and don't care so much about that, this one should do nicely.But stick with natural, since it scratches somewhat easily.  And because natural looks nicest anyway, LOL.  (I think I am out of the loop here, espresso and cherry seem to be the current trend in nursery furniture...  but I just love the look of real wood myself)	
- 1	The brush is &#34;ok.&#34;  Only suitable for babies with very fine hair.  The bristles are so soft you can't really brush much.  Would be good for helping brush away cradle cap.  The comb is dreadful.  The fibers of the wood catch on my daughter's hair.  Horrible.  I don't recommend this at all unless by some chance I got the flawed one.	
- 1	I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.	
1. 	I got this little sweet sheep as a gift for my son.  From just a few weeks of age, he falls asleep to the soothing sounds. He gets calm from it so easily.  The best part is the batteries last a very long time and the sounds play very long.  The only complaint is that you have to turn the whole thing off to stop the sound, rather than being able to push a start/stop button.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	Love this! Carried all the essential gear to change my little one on the go. Converts any bag into a diaper bag, husband was willing to carry it, detachable and washable pad was a nice feature, great shape to cover flip down diaper stations. Minus one star as I would reverse the net pocket and the zippered pocket, I have a long baby and would rest his head where the zippered pocket is, so I kept the diapers there so it was soft instead of a hard wipes container or ointment. We are more minimalist now so this lives in the car to turn the back of our station wagon into a change station.	
1. 	We now own two of these in the same color for our boys.  Easy to transport, packs up nicely and easy to clean.  Overall a great product and highly recommended.	
- 1	Our baby found this seat very uncomfortable and cried whenever bathed. We were also disappointed to find that it does not fit in any of our sinks.	
- 1	I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it... but I think it's one of those personal preference things. My son just doesn't like it. We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly. Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer. He LOVES it. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down.	
1. 	This product works great - and solves the problem of how to clean your pump parts when you are on the go and don't have running water nearby.  I wish they were cheaper so I could use them work.  I'm not looking forward to standing there and rinsing the parts at the sink in front of other people.  I'd rather not people know I'm pumping.  But at $9 for 24 wipes, using these every day is not really practical.  If I pump 3x a day at work, than wipes will cost me like $5 a week. I'd rather use $5 that for a nice lunch on Friday.	
1. 	These bibs are great. They make my life so much easier. Once my child uses them, I just put them in hot soapy water then air dry. The velcro hasn't worn away at all. Still sticks great.	
- 1	I bought a nosefrieda (along with these extra filter packs) despite that nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that sucking the snot out of my son's nose is not a good idea.Turn's out, despite 1100 reviews and a 4.5 star rating (for the main product), that voice was correct. These little pieces of foam will stop the snot from getting into your mouth, but will do -NOTHING- to stop any microbes in your kid's nose. They are small enough to pass right though, and get lodged deep in *your* lungs.Let's think on this for a second. Your kid has a runny nose. why? Because he's harboring some kind of infection. You're sucking that snot out of his nose WITH YOUR LUNGS. Normally you wouldn't inhale these sorts of microbes that deep into your own airsacs because that's not how breathing normally works. They would normally get stopped in your sinuses (duh) or your throat, or at worst, your upper airway. This little device however will put anything in your kid's sinuses on a highway straight into your lower respiratory system.Anyway, long story short literally the *24 HOURS* after the first time I used the main product, *I* had a sore throat and a cough. This was 12/24. Went to the Dr today, Dr presribed corticosteroids & levaquin. So yeah. Like i said, Darwin awards.Honestly, this product should be recalled, along with the nosefrieda. DO NOT BUY.	
1. 	Bought this for the price and quantity. It's works great. It's very low profile so it's hardly noticeable. It's somewhat difficult to remove first few times but it become a bit easier after that.	
- 1	My daughter loves this toy but.....it broke within a few months!  I wrote the company and with in a few minutes I receive a reply that the toy is no longer in production!  If I mail the toy to them (spend more of my money) they will replace the toy with a similarly priced toy.  They provided no information as to what that toy would be.  Don't buy this obviously defective product!	
1. 	Cleans easy, vents great, works perfect for newborns.  These bottles also fit into standard size heating element.  Easy to fit into the mouth as well.  Lovely new invention!	
1. 	This was a gift for my now 13 week old son. He is just starting to grasp objects and loves the raised bumps on the teether-handles. The Square toys holds a cat ball inside and is a huge hit as well. He loves watching the ball turn as I rotate the toy. There are different fabics on the sides of the toys to stimulate infants (satin, felt, ribbed, mirror, ect)I love that the objects are extra large, so they are easy to grab and play with. Furthermore, there is plenty of the clear plastic top for him to be able to see the objects inside. (Some toys only allow a small hole and if difficult for that young age to see inside.) I was thrilled that someone gave this to us for it is defintely a Keeper!	
- 1	I gave these away within a week.  Unless you have a newborn there is really no food that will fit into this bowl.	
- 1	UPDATE:This sippy cut lasted less than 2 months. The handle kept getting more loose, until it came off completely. And it leaked. I was excited to get it at first, but it was too frustrating so we got rid of it.=====Pros:*BPA-Free (never let your child near plastics that are not BPA-free, especially little boys)*Two-handled*Handles remove, to convert into grip-able cup*Valve is good, easy to remove for faster flowCons:The only real problem is that the handles don't snap or lock into place. So they slide around the cup, sometimes covering up the nozzle.	
1. 	These food cube trays have worked well for my family.  We have a few different varieties and these trays are the ones I always use first.  Easy to use, convenient lid, easy to transfer cold food cubes to ziploc storage bag.	
1. 	I got two of these for my younger boys unfortunately my 5 year old is to tall for it but I have plenty of other kids around so it will get used very handy at nap time or when we go out at the lake pop it up under a tree when one is tired or even just for them to sit on. love this product I have sat on it to make sure it will hold more then one I am about 150 did just fine didn't bend or tear very well made	
1. 	My son sits in this swing fine he doesn't stay in it as long as his bouncer but I think that has to do with the motion, he can't handle that much motion. But he doesnt flop forward and the low setting is just right for him. He really likes the music. I put him in this swing on day 2 that we had him home. Out of all the swings I like this one the most because it has little toys that attach to the sides and a mirror to look at you can even buy more links and linkadoo toys and change out the toys that it came with. It is soo interchangeable with other Fisher Price toys. I wouldn't trade this swing for anything and it folds up real compact and is easy to fold and store!	
- 1	I had this very teether for my twin boys 8 years ago and they absolutely loved it.  So, when my new baby started teething, I sought out the same teether.  I was surprised when it arrived and the packaging stated that the product is, safety tested for BPA, lead, and phthalates.  It does not state ANYWHERE on the package that it is BPA free.  As a former regulator (of medical devices) I am very sensitive about company labeling and statements.  Perhaps too much so.  But, I would rather err on the side of caution where my child is concerned, and the lack of clear BPA free labeling on this product gives me pause.  Specifically, when they test it for BPA, lead, and phthalates, is there an acceptable amount allowed?!  If not, why wouldn't the company simply label the product as BPA, lead, and phthalate free?Eight years ago, when I gave this toy to my sons, no one had ever heard of BPA.  My boys put all manner of plastic toys in their mouths, and I'm sure it was all riddled with BPA.  But, in this day and age, when BPA is strongly suspected of being dangerous, I cannot in good conscience allow my new baby to chew on anything that MAY contain it.  And, though someone on this site indicated that a representative from the company TOLD them it was BPA free, I'm still skeptical.  Again, why not label it as such?  Most companies proudly label their products with that simple language that cannot be confused.	
- 1	It is soft and cosy, but- gets cold on ends (full od water)- heavy and full of water after bath, impossible to wash it, so I need to drag it to the washing mashing each time- better for dipper sink	
1. 	I love this tub for a few reasons:1. Sling was great for new baby's first bath as my daughter ws 6 pound at birth and cord came off at 10 days)2. Once she graduated to no sling she was comfortable and in easy reach.3. Fits perfectly in my double kitchen sink which saved my back!4. Has extra space for bath items or rinse water for washing hair...I used for bothand works.5.Lightweight but durable, even after daughter tried to teeth on it.6. The plug temp guage works well when we tested it and once when I did not realize the water had changed temp while filling.7.Now that she is sitting up on her own the toddler side holds her well without her sliding over or to the side like in the open infant tub at Grandma's. The nonslip bottom works!Now for the cons:1.I do not think we will use this until she is a full toddler (7 months now) since she is on the chunky side,(where would her legs go comfortably) and may use a bath ring then.....Has worked well for 7 months and may use a while longer.	
- 1	These are seriously the best toddler flatware I've been able to find, but the pricing on this is ridiculous at $19.99.  Go down to Wally World or Bulls Eye and pick up a pack for about $4.00. Hopefully, Amazon.com will fix this crazy pricing!	
1. 	I actually read reviews from other sources (like consumer reports and such) before I bought this gate. This is rated the top gate for the top of the stairs. My husband installed the gate with no problems, although we did use larger screws than the ones that came with it, and we made sure it was screwed into a stud. The locking mechanism isn't the most convenient (it doesn't lock automatically when swung shut), but it is secure and sturdy. My two-year-old cannot unlock this gate, but his 6-year-old cousin was able to, which is fine because a 6-year-old won't fall down the stairs! We had the problem of a gap in between the gate and the top stair just because of the location of the stud, but the gap is not large enough to crawl through or get stuck in. We also purchased the accompanying kit that connects the gate to a wooden banister, preventing damage. If you don't purchase any extra supplies (either the kidco kit or your own hardware), both ends will screw into the wall and/or banister. Overall, I think this was a great purchase. I know my son and soon-to-be-crawling daughter will not be able to get down the stairs!	
- 1	This doesn't stay where it's supposed to stay no matter how tight I pull the adjustment straps. She just kicks it off and pulls it up over her head.	
1. 	We used this for each of our three children.  It's a great buffer from sink to tub.  The only downside, which is why I gave it 4 stars is that eventually it won't stay inflated.  This one I just bought....it's already in the trash.  With that said though, I still bought it knowing that I might only get a few months out of it (which by then they are ready for the big tub anyways!)	
1. 	Wonderworld toys are made in China but certified to be sold in the EU and USA so I decided to take my chances since EU standards are higher. The paint and material are made with non-toxic materials so I decided to add it to our daughter's wish list for Christmas.The toy was smaller then expected-I should have read the reviews on it...but otherwise it's a nice toy.  I continue to change out the toys that I give our daughter to play with so this toy, like her others, seems new to her again. I think the little pegs playing peek a boo is cute plus the ball is small enough for her to grasp and play with.	
1. 	I really like these bowls for home-made baby food. I've bought them several times, and they last an acceptable amount of time, even going through the microwave and dishwasher. In fact, the reason we have to keep buying more is that with our two kids, we get ditzy and forget them places!!!I also use these for toddler snack food in the diaper bag or car, holding pre-measured formula for bottles, and for playing with playdough.As you can see, there are many kid-friendly uses for them...But wait, there's more:This is a great size container for multiple uses in the kitchen as well. I can make a small batch of cinnamon sugar and store it covered in my cupboard. Leftover vegetables or fruit salad fit perfectly in here and the lids are airtight to keep them fresh! I use it to mix cornstarch and water to thicken. And so much more. These are great containers!!	
1. 	Like another reviewer, I picked these up for only $8 at TJ Maxx. They have been selling tons of Boon products lately, which is great! My daughter loved these immediately. The pieces are a good size, interesting blob shapes, and cool colors (includes brown, teal, mustard, etc. in addition to your typical baby primaries). She loves standing up in the bath now (eek!) and sticking these to the wall. They stay on well with very little pressure and water. She has been chewing on them too, and has yet to tear one, so they seem quite durable. They show some teeth marks, but that's it. The scrubbies are a little rough to actually wash a baby with (stick to a washcloth), but they are another tactile item to explore. The balls in the new sets (shiny vs. matte) are PVC-free, and daughter also loves chewing on those. So does the dog for that matter, she's gotten a hold of and destroyed two! Overall, I'd highly recommend them, but try to find them on sale :)	
- 1	This drying rack is gigantic, and we have a really big kitchen.  It looks unfriendly sitting on the counter with its size and pointy shape.  I thought it would be perfect for us, but I couldn't get over how big it was.  I should add we only use bottles sometimes and typically use the smaller ones.  I would imagine if you're heavily using 8 or 16 oz bottles this could work for you, but for us it was really too big to be worth it.  I've also seen drying racks that are much easier on the eye.  Ours ended up as a baby toy and is now back in the box.	
- 1	product has cheap bright goldplate zippers, not the antiqued heavier metal look in the picture.  the fabric was pretty thin, i had expected a thicker faux leather so it would pass as a purse as well.	
- 1	Runs very large. My daughter will be in first grade by the time she fits in this. I followed the size guide.	
1. 	I am not sure what all the complaints are about. The color is great and exactly as I expected. The dimensions are given online and the size of the dresser and drawers are also exactly as I expected. I think the quality is great, especially for the price. My husband (who is in NO way mechanically inclined)put it together in about an hour and half and said it was pretty easy. I love this dresser in my sons room and it matches his crib from Graco. I would recommend this dresser in a heartbeat.	
- 1	My fault for not reading the fine print, but these wipes are not fully organic.  As a matter of fact, the description (to be honest) should say Fuzzi Bunz Organic Cotton/Polyester Fleece Double Sided Wipes because it is possible to make a double-sided wipe out of one side organic cotton and one side organic fleece...I am a first time mom, and am trying cloth diapering with organic and natural fibers.  Luckily, I bought only one package of the FuzziBunz wipes and one package of each of several other types.  When cloth diapering, you cannot use fabric softener in your laundry or else the absorbency of your diapers and wipes will be reduced dramatically.  Without softener, these wipes generated enough static electricity to power my house.  I found them stuck to everything--my daughter's clothes, her diapers, towels, sheets, you name it.  I wasn't about to wash them separately from my other diaper laundry so, instead, I got rid of them.  For me, they were a total waste of money.  Why pay more for organic cotton if, in the end, you are rubbing your little one's most sensitive parts with polyester?!	
1. 	This bottle is excellent in producing less gas.  But, I DON'T recommend these bottles for newborns.  The nipple is so wide at the top that my son kept getting a blister on his top lip. We had to switch to Gerber for newborns.  But I look forward to using this bottle again when he's grown bigger in a few months.	
- 1	This might be the first item i've purchased that I might return from Amazon.  I bought this babybook because the reviews seemed decent and I liked how others said it was modern and not overly cute.  However this book is just plain.  All the pages just have standard large font Ariel print, it could have been printed off a laserjet.  The pages don't seem professional at all.  It includes pages such as first christmas, easter, hanukkah, halloween etc.  It also includes first trip to doctor, a family tree to fill out, a few memory pages etc.  90% of the pages instruct photos to be placed in photo corners (which are also included) and at the end of teh book there are a few pages with plastic photo coverings where you can write a description of the memory.I am disappointed in the book because it is overly plain.  I like modern things and defintely try to avoid anything overly cute but this book doesn't do the trick.  I think kids might get a bit bored looking at the pages.Qualitywise the book is protected by a clear thick plastic covering you can take off or keep.  It also includes an ink pad.  I'd give it two stars but it seems like that would be overly harsh but a three would be too generous.  It's just mediocre.  About 5 of the pages were bent back and creased.	
- 1	I really wanted to love this seat!!!  I had seen the Advanced Air in a store and thought it looked great, and knew the main difference is that this one doesn't have recline settings.  But I liked the head protection pads (they are better than all pads I've seen).  Unfortunately, I didn't try lifting the one in the store!  Turns out, this weighs almost nothing and is made of thin plastic, almost like the thickness of a big trash can.  I already have a Chicco NextFit and have been looking for another, less expensive alternative for our other car.  Well in my opinion, this seat can't hold a candle to the NextFit, which has a steel frame and is HEAVY!  Also, the buckle and chest clip on this seat feel really flimsy, and I just got the feeling that they would be easy for a child to undo.I don't work for Chicco or anything - I just LOVE our NextFit.  Compared with all the other seats I've looked at and tried, it seems to be way higher quality than the others.  Unfortunately, the Safety 1st seat seems to be too flimsy and I'm not willing to gamble with my son's safety!	
- 1	I don't know if we have a faulty cup, by my 7-mo old cannot suck any liquid out of this. I finally tried it myself, and I could barely get a drop out either. No wonder my son gets so frustrated with this thing. I am still on the search for a good sippy cup...	
1. 	It looks great in my sons room and perfectly matches his Graco crib! The cubby holes are perfect for storing our cloth diapers and other diapering needs!	
- 1	Since it has changed the quality, I stopped buying them.Now I'm using Target wipes and works just fine, or better.	
1. 	We have this in a square with the foam floor puzzle mats under it. My son will play in here by himself for an extended period of time. We were debating between the rainbow and white and we're happy we went with color. babies love color! not sure how it will work when he starts to pull himself up but we'll see. for now it does what we need it to do.	
- 1	I didn't like these towels. They are very thin, and my baby felt cold in them. Although I give it 2 stars cause I'm a rainforest fan	
1. 	This item is perfect for cleaning the small holes of the dr brown bottles. I also use it to clean my plastic straws that come with my plastic reusable cups (ie Starbucks drink cup, green straw). This is a must buy if you want to keep your bottles clean for your baby!	
- 1	My baby was pretty fine until I got this bottles recommended but her doctor.The day after I use it was the first day she started having colics. It might not be related but I feel it is. i am back to Dr browns	
1. 	After reading the reviews on this, I also super glued the rails on as others have suggested.  They have stayed on, only coming off in one part once and I just glued it back.Other than adhesive, I would suggest they give the option of buying a pair.	
1. 	I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!	
- 1	While this is probably not the product's fault, neither of my kids will let me get this on their head.  Hair washing is still horrible.  Waste of money for me.	
- 1	I was kinda bummed that the soothie wasn't clipped to the monkey, it was sewn on. which means no sterilizer and no way to attach it to the other pacifiers my kid takes. kinda lame.	
1. 	I have several of these halo sleep sacks in 100% cotton. They are great - except that the fabrics are not all the same weight depending on the color you buy. Soft pink is nice and heavy as is the one that is sweet pea green (sold on another amazon listing) . The pink stripes with the bird is thinner (also on another listing) . It is still a bit heavier than the one Summer infant sleep sack I have (pink butterfly's) . The differing fabric weights are why I knock off a star. Of course fleece would be warmer but you expect that when buying fleece. I thought all the 100% cotton would be the same weight (warmth) but they are not. I will stick to the solid colors since I also have a solid halo swaddle that is heavy fabric.	
- 1	this rack is weird and doesn't fit the bottles, etc. I don't end up using a dishwasher basket at all because I don't wash dishes enough to clean the bottles as often as I need anyway. I've only used this once and it was a joke. not worth the money. You end up washing everything by hand anyway, unless you wash dishes every single day.	
- 1	These feel like plastic. They have such an overriding plastic feeling that I would even put them on my baby. They have a very scratchy thin feeling to them. I guess they may be good for the price, though. I guess I can't speak to that. If it's for catching drool. I find my preference is just a cloth bib. I'd rather change the bib more often and let the baby be comfortable	
- 1	The water vial that is attached to this unit just sits ever so gently on the side meaning IT FALLS OFF CONSTANTLY.  It was so annoying I returned it.  I'm a mom on the go so I would throw this in my bag and take it with me but it was always a chore to have to find the missing water vial.  I much prefer the Munchkin High Speed bottle and food warmer, the water vial stays firmly in place.  But with any bottle sterilizer you have to make sure you don't lose the ring that goes around the top, too bad those don't snap in.	
- 1	The connecting parts between the units serve as perfect little ladders for a baby to climb up and fall out. And the suction cups don't stick to the floor. So my 17 lb baby is strong enough to push the whole play yard wherever she wants it!Don't waste your money on this unsafe structure...	
1. 	They are spoons, really what can I say about them.  They go fine through the dishwasher.  I like them.  Pretty colors, soft tips.  Two thumbs up.	
1. 	Hard to clean but great for starting little ones out on fresh fruits that they cannot chew yet. Our little guy enjoyed strawberries in these	
1. 	This is fabulous for making baby food.  Easy to use and clean and does a great job of grinding food.	
- 1	As a baby gate in a standard doorway, this is perfect.  It comes with little cups that screw into the doorway for added security/stabilization, the gate swings bot ways, easy to operate and install, tall, and I think a child would have some difficulty trying to get it open.So why two stars?  Because it functions as a standard gate.  Yes, it expand up to 52 inches, but I wouldn't trust it with the extensions with a baby or even a cat.  The doorway I needed this for is 48 inches.  Putting the two extenders on left no room for the tension screws, so I had to take the 6&#34; extender off.  Next I screwed in the stabilizer cups and began to install it.  The tensions screws were so far out on each side that my cats were walking right through the gate.  But I didn't buy this for cats, I bought this for a baby.  Tightening it to the point where it locked made the gate completely unstable.  It jiggled back and forth and I could just see the baby leaning on it and falling over.Rather than go through the return process and package it up again, I decided to keep it for a small, standard doorway.  All-in-all, it's not a bad gate, but it's advertised as being super wide and once you get it to that point, in my opinion, it's just not safe.  It may work with one of the extensions in, in a smaller doorway, but for my 48&#34; doorways, I'm still looking.	
1. 	she loves massaging her gum with this all the time. wished it was more pink than purple.	
1. 	Product seems to be good for now, but already seems to be losing air. Doesn't seem like it will hold up to multiple children, but wouldnt hesitate to buy another one for second child.	
1. 	Haven't use it. I bought it for my 2 months baby boy^ but it looks so cute and good quality	
1. 	I wish I had this when my first born was in the infant carrier!this stroller is so light weight & easy to handle.  I bought it when my son was born & used it daily!The large basket under the seat is pretty easy to reach.. compared to my regular metrolite stroller.I wish Graco could keep the great features of this frame (easy to open & close & easy access to basket & great stearing, not to mention light weight) in other model strollers!	
1. 	These shields work great for any new mom who has inverted nipples or whose baby has a latch problem.They do feel up with milk and cause the shield to come detached from the breast IF you do not use lanolin as a glue.	
1. 	Fits perfectly in a pack n play. I use a king sized pillow case to cover it and that works well for us.	
1. 	I like these for several reasons.  The low price for a large supply.  The opaque color that blends with outlet color.  The quality of the plastic is sturdy but still flexible.	
1. 	My son loves a sleepsack, but some of them are so heavy.  This one is so cute and is super light.  I'm a big fan.  It's the favorite.	
1. 	I've been using sleepsacks on my daughter since she was born. She's now two years old and still sleeps with one! I love it because I can rest easy knowing she's always covered. It's also awesome because when your kid is wearing one of these, they can't reach their pants/diaper and take them off! I have so many friends who complain that their kid is constantly taking off their diapers during the naps and I don't have that problem! The zipper is at the bottom of the sack, so she doesn't know how to unzip it (she's two and STILL hasn't figured it out!) I love these and I will use them with all my kids!	
1. 	I absolutely love this product! It is my good luck charm when putting my son to bed. He loves the lights that project on the walls. I just wish I had got it sooner.	
1. 	This swing is awesome!  My daughter loves it and it soothes her when nothing else will.  She loves it.  It is also very easy to use for us.  The only bad thing is that she will outgrow it one day!  Thanks Fisher Price!!!	
- 1	I had big expectations for these dryer balls. However, was severely disappointed. They made all loads of laundry I used them with filled with static. I have better luck using nothing in the dryer than if I put these in.	
1. 	This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!	
1. 	These little outlet plugs have been around forever. This particular brand is great, they are tight in the outlets so baby cannot pull them out. Sometimes even hard for me to get out.. which is good because I wouldn't want baby to accidentally get them out. Plenty of plugs for the whole house, and clear so your walls dont look tacky..	
- 1	This company is local and I wanted to love this cup but it leaks right out of the box. Baby didn't have to squeeze, shake or bang the cup - she just tipped it to drink and her front was all wet!	
- 1	I bought this for my first baby. I was so excited to put him in it. As soon as we got home from the hospital it was the first thing I did and he HATED it. I tried every few days, all different settings, and we got the same screaming response. It just doesn't move fast enough....at all. Even the fastest setting is SO slow. I don't see how it soothes any baby.So we put it away and got it back out once we had our second baby (only 12 months later). I thought for sure my more easy going baby would love it since everyone else seemed to rave about it, but nope, we had the same response. He hated it, too. It just simply didn't move fast enough. Not to mention the fabric is so stiff and not the least bit comforting. We put a fleece blanket in it to try to make it more appealing and it did nothing. Not to mention the mobile is completely useless. It doesn't even move.We ended up getting a traditional cradle swing and both kids loved it SO much more.	
1. 	I received this pump as a gift at a baby shower for my first child (2 years ago). I wasn't looking forward to pumping, but when I finally tried this out, I was amazed.Pros:it didn't hurt (i had been told pumping hurt)it was easy to cleanI got 3-4 ounces within 10-15 minutesCons:it is a little loudit slowly lost suction over a few months time and stopped working by the time my daughter was 5 months old.Since this no longer worked, I found another pump for my second child. I did researched and found a pump that others recommended highly. I hate it, hate it hate it. It pinches slightly, there is no way to adjust the fit, it takes 40 minutes to get 1 ounce, its a pain to clean. It also still works after 7 month.MY CONCLUSION: BETTER RESULTS AND THE PRICE WORKS OUT TO ABOUT THE SAMEI miss my inexpensive Evenflo pump. The way I see it now is.. even if I had to replace this one (at $50 each purchase) every 4 months (that would be 3 times in a year), Its still a better deal then some of the more expensive ones. that would be $150 toward pumps that worked well for me but needed replaced often instead of $150-400 on pumps that don't work for me and last the whole year.I'm currently thinking of asking my husband to 'reinvest' in this one and using my more expensive one as a backup.	
1. 	Variable flow, great for the kids.Our 7 week olds prefer this and they spill less too....It has caused less spills than the fast ones and it is less frustrating to them then the slow ones.	
- 1	These spoons are a great concept!  LOVE the colors!  That's the end of my positives.Negatives? The bendable part of the spoons bends too much, which makes it kinda worthless after the first couple bites.  And the fork is not effective for poking things at all.  It's more like a spoon with a couple awkward slots on it.If your kid is a righty, we prefer the Sassy Less Mess Toddler Feeding Spoon.  We haven't found a good Lefty option yet, though!	
1. 	Rubber ducky doesn't look so tough, and won't talk. Tried: boiling water, water boarding, slow cuts, nothing worked. Not a peep.	
1. 	This sheet fits just as snuggly as does the original sheet that came with the sleeper.  The cotton is not as soft as it could be but seems to be fine.  My baby (now a month old) is very content to sleep on it, and I'm glad I bought it.  When he wets the bed in the middle of the night you need extra sheets.	
1. 	we love this baby wash- we still use it on our 2 year old in fact.  It smells great and is very mild.  I recommend to all my expecting friends.	
- 1	First the colors will vary is a horrible idea for baby items as I got hot pink ones with cupcakes in the mail for my son...  I didn't feel like going though the whole hassle of returning them to Amazon so I went to Target and bought the right color then returned the pink ones to Target.I do NOT like that the plastic ring for pacifiers without the bull-nose ring is only attached with Velcro making the ring a choking hazard.  I'd rather just purchase the Dr. Brown ones...	
- 1	I purchased this at a local store and I thought my daughter would love it. The design is cute and I really wanted a dual potty that worked as a potty and stepstool. Unforuntely this didn't work for us. The potty opening is tiny! Unless you're training a skinny, small child this gives little room for error or aim! It's definitely appealing in the looks department but other than that I would suggest passing this guy up!	
1. 	I liked the body rest but not the head reast...Read washing instructions...The body rest is very soft and comfortable...Nice color.	
1. 	We love this thing.  I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to &quot;unravel&quot; but it wasn't bad at all.  I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.  We bought a second one for upstairs and we're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions.	
- 1	If you are looking for cloth diapers, educate yourself somewhere like on the Green Mountain Diapers website. The prefolds they sell do work well, and absorb more than disposables do. These prefolds, on the other hand, hardly absorb anything, when it comes to baby pee. They do a really good job, though, with spit up.	
1. 	These bottles are exceptional and do everything they claim they do. They are a natural shape and make it easy to feed the baby. The ventaire system does significantly reduce the amount of bubbles, which means less gas, burps and a happier baby. They are easy to clean, and I love the fact they have covers to keep the nipples free of dirt/dust, etc. Overall, a great set of five starter bottles for twenty dollars. I highly recommend.	
1. 	I got this for my 2 yr old son and he loves the balls more than the net really but he's getting the idea.  It seems durable and suctions well to the wall.  I don't particularly like the bath toys or in this case, the balls, that squirt water because I've noticed if any water is left in them, they have a tendency to mold.  Overall a fun bath toy that my son likes!  I would recommend.	
1. 	Although rather large & cumbersome in my apartment, my newborn daughter was perfectly comfortable and secure in it.  My favorite feature was being able to use both hands to wash her or lather soap in my hands since the tub supported her so well. This is the ONLY tub I would recommend!	
1. 	Love it. Fits perfectly in our changing table and really snuggles our daughter into its center.	
1. 	This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet.  The first time I saw it I thought, What will they think of next... but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home.  It's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes, pineapple, watermelon, even strawberries!  It's great for regular feeding too, since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat, fresh brocolli, etc.  The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly, I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water, but after just two weeks of steady use, the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently.  The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself, but it's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder.  I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it's a great thing to have on trips.	
1. 	My son loves this gym. But I have a few complaints about this product. 1st the bird in the center falls off when he pulls on it, He is only 4 months old. 2nd the music skips and stops. I had to tape up the battery compartment for the music to work. I guess that even when it is screwed tight the batteries are not in the right place. This product is easy to bring back and forth to grandmas.	
- 1	I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.  The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.  It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.  I regret this purchase.	
1. 	I shopped around for quite a while and I finally settled on this crib.  It was a more reasonably priced crib that I found.  It arrived within 2 days and was in perfect condition.  The wood is beautiful (we bought the espresso finish).  It wasn't too bad to put together either, might have taken an hour.  I can already tell that the finish will be sensitive to scratching and dings.  A light finish may be less obvious to any blemishes.  Otherwise it is very sturdy and fits a standard crib mattress.  We got the Colgate Classica I and it is a perfect fit!  We also bought the matching changer.  I would recommend this product!	
1. 	You will get a lot of use out of this variety pack. I love the bowls with lids, they are convenient for storage and travel. I don't think you can have too many sippy cups or spoons when your baby starts solid. This was an excellent buy.	
1. 	My husband and I originally bought the safety first pack of outlet covers (which my son figured out in 2 seconds flat, and then thought it was seriously funny to remove every one he could find) for a higher cost.  We were fortunate enough to have a relative give us a few of this brand of covers to use in the play area that he could NOT remove.  We are having a second baby at the end of November and one of my first buys was this product to cover the rest of the house!They are a little difficult for adults to pull out (yes, especially on newer outlets), but that's what is needed for tiny fingers!  Would recommend these over any other brand so far!	
- 1	Oh please! Although Serta's Organic Contour Pad is free of phthalates and polyurethane foam, it IS treated with harmful flame retardant (see tag on back stating compliance with California law #133) and has a vinyl cover which contains PVC that can leach dangerous chemicals that at low levels to affect reproductive, endocrine and immune systems. How is this organic? Try again Serta.	
1. 	Great carrier for short trips and going out, however its not the best for their hip positioning so I tend to use a material wrap if I am wearing my son for longer periods. That is the only reason for taking 1 star off.	
1. 	It's freaking waterproof! And it fits a mini crib. It's great, because you can put it under your normal sheets, and then when your baby wets the bed, you can just toss it in the wash. It's easier than having to worry about cleaning the mattress.	
1. 	A sturdy, attractive, functional changing table at a reasonable price. (We also bought the matching crib but haven't set it up yet, as baby is still in a bassinet.) I love the classic style--simple yet elegant. The only drawback is that the changing pad it comes with is flimsy--but this is the case with most changing tables. Just buy a separate changing pad and you're all set.	
- 1	I am a mom of two and have owned several baby swings. My kids needed the swings to get them to sleep when they were infants - if you have a bad back and can't rock your child, then a swing is what you need! If you are looking for portability then this is a great swing, but keep in mind that NO travel swing will be as powerful as a full-size model. We have the full size Fisher Price papasan and the ocean wonders swings, and they were amazing and plenty powerful - colicky babies prefer vigorous swinging to soft rocking. Yes, they eat through batteries, but who cares when your child will sleep 4 hours in the swing as opposed to 1 hour in the crib! But I digress...As for this travel swing:Pros:Much more portable than a full size swingMore portable than the fisher price travel swing (I had the ocean wonders model)Folds pretty flat for travelNo noise at all (the full-size models always click when swinging)Decent battery life for a swingEasy to assembleHas a recline optionDecent music if you want itTimer if you want it, or just leave the swing on constantlyCute to look at for you and babyEasy to cleanCons:Speed settings are really all 1 speed - why bother with a speed dial? This seems to be typical of all swings though, both travel and full-sized.Will never move as vigorously as a full-sized swing - top speed is barely moving in comparison to a full-sized swing. If your child is used to a full-sized swing, this swing might not move vigorously enough to rock him/her to sleep. However, if they are not used to a full-sized model than this one might be fine.A tip for all swings: Use good batteries (Duracell only) to get the most vigorous swinging out of your swing. The cheap ones, even Energizers, will barely move your swing!Update: 1 BIG CON for this swing that I discovered last night - it automatically shuts off after 1 hour, even without using the timer feature. I wanted it to run continuously like the full-size swing would, but it won't. Why include a timer for 15 minute increments if the swing shuts off in 1 hour anyway? My babies wake up when the swing stops, which is exactly what happened. Argh! This makes the swing fairly useless to me if I want my baby to sleep in the swing during the night, because she will wake every hour when the swing automatically shuts off!	
1. 	Nice tight fit around the mattress.  Full elastic all the way around.  Fabric could be a little bit softer, but not bad.  Holds up well in the wash.  Note that the pack of two gives you one checked pattern and one plain white!	
1. 	We got this set at our shower and haven't needed any other bottles. My son started using them at about four weeks old and quickly outgrew the smaller bottles, but the set includes three larger ones, which is great. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that they don't include the medium flow nipples, just fast and slow. My baby was impatient with the slow flow and overwhelmed by the fast, so we had to purchase the medium ones separately. It's also a little irritating to have to keep buying the drop-in inserts, but it does cut down on the dishes.	
1. 	I love long sleeved bibs.  The Bumkins ones hold up extremely well. We have some that are 4 years old and still look perfect.  I like that they tie behind the neck as our daughter pulls anything with velcro off.  These bibs have fantastic coverage and we always use them when we are out on the town as we know that we won't have to change clothes after the meal due to mess.	
1. 	This organic cotton stuffed carrot is a really cute toy for a baby.  My son isn't overly enthused about it, but makes a really neat set along with the other stuffed veggies by Under the Nile.  The carrot in particular isn't real soft, and the outer fabric is similar to t-shirt fabric, unlike the mushroom that is more soft and cushy with a terry-cloth outer fabric.  So far I just purchased the mushroom and carrot, because I didn't want to spend the money on the entire set with the wooden bin before knowing if my son would be interested in it.  I'm not going to purchase the other veggies because he is 9 months old didn't find these to be very entertaining.  The Under the Nile organic veggies would make a great gift for a younger infant.	
- 1	I bought this as a Christmas present for my pregnant wife. At first, like many reviewers, she loved it, but as time went by it fell flat...literally. The pillow is filled with cotton fill, the kind you would buy at a department store if you were going to make a decorative throw pillow. This means the pillow falls flat and gets divots where there is constant pressure. My wife is petite so she is not wearing the pillow down, it is just poorly made. Not really worth the money, but it is a nice alternative to the larger pillows. My wife did like it before it fell flat and she does still use it from time to time.	
- 1	This cup is hard to assemble and very hard to clean. The straw is very breakable. In fact, I had a 3 year old bite off the end of the straw. .. then it could be a choking hazard.so it is a nice idea, but be careful with children with teeth.	
1. 	I LOVE this cover! Of all of the 'baby' things I received, this is probably one of the most practical and most useful gifts. I can't imagine being without it, and I have been buying them for friends as gifts since I received mine. I highly recommend this cover if you are a nursing mom.	
- 1	I bought this at Target because I thought it would help pump since I exclusively pump right now. It works to an extent but not like they advertise!First of all the women in their ads are obviously NOT breastfeeding, you can tell by looking at their breasts so it's a bit misleading. Second it does not hold the breast shields straight like advertised, they sag down so I still have to hold them to get the best milk supply. If i let them hang it doesn't pump as well. I bought this so I could be hands free!The bra itself is a bit too tight and I got a medium based on the sizing chart. It holds the breast shields in place no problem but it's a bit hard to get on.I will use this and see if there is a way I can fix the kinks in it. It does help some but not like I had expected and for the price it should have worked better.Ok after using this for over a week now I can't stand it! It is too tight and hinders my pumping! If I got the other size it would have been too big. This thing needs a strap that goes around the neck otherwise it just hangs the bottles down and it pulls on your nipples! The women advertising this bra are NOT breastfeeding so the ads are VERY misleading. Why not use an actual breastfeeding woman? This thing does not fit right at all. The lady in the ads has no boobs at all! Sorry but if you just had a baby you will have way more than this chick has in the ads. This bra is a waste of money. I am going to sell it to the lowest bidder and be done with it. I will now come up with my own device to pump hands free that actually works for breastfeeding mothers.	
- 1	I washed the lovely as per the label's instructions before giving it to my newborn. The leaf completely detached and the stuffed animal was holding on to the blanket by a thread. Too bad, it's adorable but very poorly made.	
- 1	This is a pretty exersaucer and it has a lot of toys, but you will not be using this as anything but an exersaucer. Here's why: all of the electronic toys only play music. The globe use to do abc's; the alligator did something with numbers, colors, shapes; and the lizard would sing &#34; red, yellow, and blue&#34;. The company did not pay for new dies/tooling so looking at these toys you would expect them to do more than just music and more music. For example: the alligator has shapes, colors, and numbers on his buttons.I wrote to the company to let them know I wasn't happy with the unexpected changes and they said they discontinued the more educational toys last year.Cute exersaucer and fine for an infant, but this will not &#34;grow&#34; with your child because of the sub par toys, so I don't feel it is completely worth the higher price.	
- 1	I was looking forward to the convenience of this for the nursery, and now I'm completely inconvenienced because it arrived broken: the latch doesn't work and won't close. OXO is usually a solid brand, so I'm obviously disappointed with the quality of this product.	
1. 	This is great for basics, but I wish the space to write things in was bigger. A lot times I need struggle trying to read what the caretaker wrote in because the spaces go together.	
- 1	The first one arrived damaged .. NOT damaged in the shipping ... obviously damaged and sent from the factory in an unsatisfactory condition. Amazon replaced it immediately! I love my Prime membership! The 2 table still has a couple of less than perfect spots but for the price I guess it's ok. Probably wouldn't but Graco again tho.	
- 1	I used this for almost 3 months and it was ok - there was a gross squish factor when putting the dirty diapers in it. I was also disappointed that you have to use the Arm & Hammer diaper pail refills - Babies R Us had an insert but it didn't work. I ended up throwing this away and getting the Diaper Genie II. Learn from my mistakes - don't waste your money!	
- 1	Unfortunately these don't work for me...Can't get any milk with any of them. Have to keep using the medela medium phlanges again... lots of people love these though. Also found these leading to the pump membrane deals falling off during pumping because the angle is different with these than the standard phlanges.	
1. 	I bought this when my 5 month old got too big for his small baby bathtub (he was 20lbs then).  He was a really big baby and his arm and legs were starting to hang out of the other one.  The baby seat my mom got me wouldn't stick to my bathtub floor and would tip over. So I'm so happy I found this.  It worked perfect. Exactly what I needed. Super easy and my son had so much fun taking a bath since he could play with a couple toys.  My son is 15 months old now and I have started putting him in the regular bath tub now and he does fine now that he has good balance and everything.  He is 30 pounds now and for him if he leaned over the side he would start tipping the whole bath.  But I think it's pretty sturdy, maybe just that my boy is a big for age.  Lifesaver for me when he was 6-12 months though! And it still looks brand new now, so I can use it again for next baby.	
1. 	I took my six month old son to Babies R Us to try out all the exesauers and he liked this one the best, and it was one of the least expensive. The bright colors and different toys keep him entertained and some of the toys I thought were boring (like the 2 page book) are his favorite. I agree with the other reviewer - the snack tray seems like kind of a waste of space, but I just use it to put other toys on which he promptly throws on the floor - a fun game.  The height adjustment accomodates babies that are on the smaller size and will grow with your child until he is probably to old to want to play in it anymore. A great choice and you can't beat the price.	
- 1	I had a baby in July 2009.  I purchased the Snugride 32 beforehand after doing a lot of research.  I read other people's opinions and, based on their thoughts, concluded that it would be best to purchase the 32 because I would be able to use it for one year or up to 32 pounds.  This logic was faulty for several reasons, which I will outline below. Before I do that, a little background:  I have a big baby. He is 6 months and already over 20 pounds.  I had a feeling he might be big, which is why I bought this seat.  However, the seat is almost at the end of its life already after only 6 months and 20+ pounds.  Here's why:1.  The straps are way too short. My son was maxed out within the first couple of months.  Why don't they make the straps longer?  Why isn't there another setting or two for height? It is a very tight fit.  We live in New England and it is now winter and we cannot put him in there with a couple of layers on.  We will have to switch to a convertible car seat very soon.2.  There is no way you'd want to carry a baby much larger than 20 pounds in his car seat.  You would never use this product up to 32 pounds for this reason.  You need a stationary seat anyway once the baby reaches about 20 pounds.Another major problem with the Rittenhouse model in particular is the lack of head support for an infant.  Our baby's head was always flopped to the side. I am giving the seats two stars because it looks nice (I have the Rittenhouse and get many compliments on the nice black and white pattern), seems to work fine and was comfortable for the baby in the first few months.  He especially liked it when he was a newborn but he seems cramped now.We are tight with money right now (who isn't?) and feel that the 32 was a bit of a waste of money.  You can purchase a regular [and more lightweight] Snugride for a lower price and use it for the first 3-6 months and then switch over to a convertible seat.  If you have a big baby, you will have to do this anyway, whether you buy the 32 or not because the 32 can't accommodate a very large baby.  While it is admittedly very useful to have a carrier car seat for a newborn, it becomes much less necessary after 3-6 months.  Convertible car seats can face rear so you don't have to worry about compromising your baby's safety.Unless you only care about style and not price or practicality, I would recommend saving a few bucks and getting the regular Snugride or some other inexpensive but functional carrier seat for the first few months and investing in a good convertible seat for later on.	
- 1	It looks cute  but it doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes it doesn't want to spin around.  Thought about sending it back but just haven't gotten around to it.  It didn't cost much but I guess you get what you pay for.	
- 1	These say they are compatable with Medela, but apparently not with the Medela hand pump.  I couldn't get any suction, therefore no milk.  I had already thrown the box away or I would have returned them.  I'm just glad they were cheap!I wish they would have worked because it would make freezing and storing easier.	
1. 	I am happy with this product, although it is smaller than expected, it is a good quality and small enough for little hands to hold.	
- 1	This is soft, flexible, and fits perfectly in the hard plastic tub I have from Babies R Us. My five month old seemed very comfortable - much better than sitting on plastic! Especially because she slides around on the plastic, while this cushion keeps her in place without her struggling.A major drawback though. When it is wet, it is HEAVY. And very bulky and hard to wring. It was so heavy I couldn't hang it on our shower rod or on the big suction hook in the shower. The bedtime ritual is complicated enough without having to slowly wring out each petal. The instructions say fold the petals into the center and press down - I'll try that tomorrow, but I don't see how that could possibly remove enough water. I'd never put something that wet into my dryer, besides the fact that I refuse to drag it down dripping from the bathroom to the dryer every night.I'm very sad because this is a super comfy way to bathe my baby. But it's impractical. The last thing I need is another piece of high-maintenance baby gear.If anyone has any suggestions for drying this (short of a steamroller), please let me know.	
1. 	It is supposed to have a convenient dispenser bottom. There are two perforations which would be great except they are not shaped like the liners and when you pull them through the bottom they get all scrunched up. Other than that...I love these. I use them with my playtex milk storage rings and connect to my breast pump...so easy to use, put the cap on and refrigerate or freeze. Baby also has less gas with the drop in liners than with the bottles. I stopped using bottles for breast milk and just use these exclusively. I recommend.	
1. 	I rarely will buy anything without looking at reviews.  This works fine at protecting me even with some of the issues I had prior to giving birth.	
1. 	I purchased this cooler mainly to transport expressed milk from work to home. I got the cocoa/pink one and I really like the color. The brown bag looks very discreet, but that pink lining adds a little bit of personality. The zipper on the top is great to seal in the coolness. The handles have a button so that they can snap together and hang from stroller handlebar.I fit four Medela 5oz bottles along with three ice packs, one of which came with the bag. I added two of my own, about the same size as the included one. They're all about 5-6 inches tall and about 1 inch thick. I put two ice packs on the side and one on top of the bottles. With my setup, there's still a little bit of room on the top (about 2-3 inches), therefore, it's easy for me to zip and unzip.My commute from work to home is about 30-40 minutes, and when I get home, the bottles are still nice and cool. It definitely met my expectations. This is great value for under $10 bucks!Update 9/14/2013: After a year, I am still using this bag for when I go out with my baby. It fits three 8 oz Dr. Brown bottles with some excess room. Most of the time though, I pack a couple food pouches, one or two jars of baby food, a small bag of Cheerios, one Dr. Brown bottle... it could get tight, but because sealing the coolness isn't the priority anymore, I can leave part of the zipper open if necessary. The front pocket I store some napkins, a couple baby spoons, and most of the time a waterproof bib... gets a little poofy, but who cares? Haha! All in all, I still think that the price I paid for this bag has made its return and I'm satisfied. =)	
- 1	Having twins, I have washed a LOT of bottles & gone through several different kinds of bottle brushes.My husband & I purchased this thinking it looked neat, brush would last a long time, attached nipple cleaner.Now I will go over each part of this item and explain what I like and do not like.The Silicone BrushPRO- I think it will last a long time and not wear out as regular brushes do.PRO- It doesn't scratch anythingPRO -The brush itself is easy to clean since it is siliconeCON- Being silicone it does NOT clean well. If you have anything dried on you will either have to let it soak or really give it a good scrubbing before it comes cleanCON- it does not lather well with soap, I am constantly pouring on more soap because the silicone will not hold soapThe Soap DispenserThere are no Pro's considering it does not work. I fill this thing up but the soap only comes out of the tip and it is not enough to build up a lather to clean. I have to pour soap onto the brush on a regular basis. It also leaks, no matter what way you put this thing if you have soap left inside it is going to leak out. I lay it flat and it leaks out the bottom.Nipple BrushHad it actually stayed attached it would have been kind of convenient, however in the beginning when it was attached we realized having a seperate nipple cleaner is easier. This one swivels and just seems more of a pain to clean than if it were a seperate piece. With only a couple weeks of use the nipple brush started coming loose so it would come out while we were cleaning the nipples or would twist so we could not twist it in the nipple to clean it. Finally we took it out and held the tiny sharp nub but that was too much of a pain. Now we just flip our nipples inside out to clean them.So, don't waste your money. I recommend the Philips Avent Bottle Brush but I'd recommend getting a seperate nipple cleaner since the attached one doesn't work very well. I also do NOT recommend the brushes with the sponge on top, they wear out & fall apart easily, plus sponges hold TONS of germs! You should buy 2 of the Philips Avent Bottle Brushes because they are great for regular dishes as well.	
1. 	I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!	
- 1	Won't fit our standard round toilet. It stays on until you put some pressure on the lid trying to raise it. Either the lid snaps the thing open, or the whole thing just falls off in the floor. Tried both of the pieces it comes with for adjustment. Neither works! Will be looking for something else.	
- 1	Top pops open in the freezer (even half full). Unlike freezer trays, it is difficult to get the content out to put inside freezer bags. I tend to cook in batches in the evening or at the weekend and Beaba Multiportion freezer trays are by far the best product for my purpose.	
1. 	This tub is HUGE!!!  You need to measure because you will need to figure out where you will use it and store it.  My master bath only has a shower stall, so I use this in there when I bathe my 6 1/2 month old daughter. My shower has an extra long shower hose, so it is very convenient to fill the tub.  While there is a plug it doesn't really do a good jub of letting out the water while the baby is still in the tub.  I let it drain as best as it can and when she is done with her bath, I just turn the tub over and let the water out.  I store it in the shower stall when I am not using it.  I would have bought the white tub, but Amazon had it priced at $15.00 more than the blue tub, plus the blue tub was eligible for free shipping with my Amazon Prime account while the white tub was not.I had this same tub in white when my son was a baby.  He is now 4-years old and prefers to take showers.  He is a big kid and outgrew the baby bath tubs so very quickly.  It seemed like every couple of months we were buying new baby tubs and then I found this tub.  He used this tub until he was nearly three years old.  I preferred using this tub because for some reason, it seemed like it kept the water warmer than the big bath tub in our main bathroom.  Also, there is nowhere for him to hit his head, which he did on the regular bath tub.  This tub, does hold quite a bit of water, but it even if you fill it completely full, it will only use a fraction of the hot water that the main bath tub in your house will use, so it helps you save on water and water heater costs as well.My daughter is 25&#34; tall and just under 16 lbs and just outgrew the Puj tub that I was using in the bathroom sink.  Instead of buying a smaller baby bath tub, I opted to just buy this tub because I knew from personal experience that it would be the be all end all baby bath tub for me.  Little Miss likes to kick, so this tub is perfect for her.  The infant supports hold her very well.  I do not need to hold herThe infant supports	
- 1	This is a horrible product!!!!  The pad burned to the bottom, and the wipes didn't stay warm long after leaving the warmer.  What's the point?  Terrible.	
1. 	Works great, but i'm not convinced the cubes are actually a full ounce.  Seem smaller than another tray I have with 1 ounce servings.	
1. 	I didn't use these for long, as I switched from Avent to Tommee Tippee due to baby having problems with fussiness due to gas. The products work as described with no leaking and attach easily to my Medela pump. Love that you can buy the Avent in a two pack for your double pump. I had to buy the Tommee Tippee converters individually.	
1. 	My teething son was chewing on his crib rail, and would come away with little flecks of paint all around his mouth, which can't have been healthy.  Now he still chews, but no harm done, to him or to the crib (convertible to a toddler and twin bed that my son will use for a long time.)It was annoying to have to clean the rail with alcohol before sticking the gummy cover to the crib, but overall, it took just a few minutes to install, and the toddler hasn't pulled it off, even though he probably could if he really wanted to.  I bought two packs, but only used one, since he only chewed on the front rail.  I've decided to keep the second roll. If we have a second child, I'll put this on the crib BEFORE baby starts teething.	
- 1	So, apparently I didn't read the reviews thoroughly enough, but this device makes a terrible loud static bark every minute or so. I had to return the product, as there was no reducing or fixing the issue, and we wouldn't have been able to sleep through any of that.	
1. 	It fit nicely,it was super soft, easy to remove and put back on for washing, and the color of blue just looks really good. It adds a little extra color to the baby's nursery.	
1. 	My baby uses this as a teether.  it is the right size for her little hands and she seems to like the bristles.	
1. 	This fit just perfectly in our stairway space.  Did order the larger one and realized it was a tad too big. Quick shipping as well.	
- 1	I bought this because my 10 months old are starting to open up cabinet doors and drawers. I tried using this to keep them closed but it has failed on me. I even tried putting them on differently thinking maybe I just did them wrong. But nope. Nothing worked. I got so frustrated that I wanted to just throw them away.First, it was very hard to get it to close tightly so the doors don't open up. Even after I have almost broke my fingers off trying to close it to as tightly as possible. The doors would still open up. That was no good because my daughter can end up closing the doors on her fingers and hurt herself. Aside from that, it was VERY hard to open/close this. To pull it close was kind of easy but to open them back up was hard. There is a small button on the side to press and at the same time, you have to push the little button up in order to release and allow you to pull it open.I don't have fat fingers. I actually have tiny hands and I found that to be very hard to do. It's a positive thing because that means LO won't be able to open up the lock herself. But, it was PAINFUL for me to open it. When I was trying to lock up the doors it was so hard for me.I tried any possible ways to do it so that it wouldn't be hard and close the doors tightly. Nothing worked.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I might give these a try in the future maybe...But for now they're just stored away. Eventually it might even become garbage.	
1. 	This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!	
- 1	I wanted to love this product and was excited to buy it when I became pregnant but am now hesitant to let my baby use it after reading about the recall in Europe. Apparently, as I understand it, their toxin standards of measurement are lower than ours so they have not been recalled here (apparently we are OK with low levels of nitrates in the toys our children put in their mouths, but Europeans are not...hmmm)...Be that as it may, toxins registering even CLOSE to a dangerous level made me nervous about using. After digging around online I did discover that the company claims to have changed the product after a certain date and lists manufacturing codes so you can check yours (those listed were made after a certain date and are said to be safer). Sadly mine was not made after the &#34;improved&#34; date but I could not return it because there was no formal recall in our country. I considered returning it and hunting for one with an approved manufacturing date but man that was just too much work. Bummed but not ready to take a risk with my baby.	
- 1	I bought this willing to try anything to get my kid to sleep more than 2 hours at night, for one, its pretty warm (I live in a warm climate, so this almost seemed like it made him too hot), it takes forever to dry in the dryer. It wasn't magical at all and didn't help my kid sleep. Definitely not worth the 40+$ I spent. I lent it to my sister in law in hopes that it would work for my nephew, no such luck.	
- 1	the cups are cute and easy to clean, but leak. after the child sucks on the spout a few times, the airseal doesn't allow airflow in the cup so the spout starts to invert into the cup. the air vent hole doesn't work properly and i have to continuously pinch the spout or unscrew and screw the lid back on so my daughter can continue to drink from it. the spout is somewhat leaky and messy too. i have to put a bib on her  so prevent a mess on her clothes with this cup. she's not a messy eater/drinker but the spout on this sippy cup just isn't designed well.	
1. 	I really love this booster. My ONLY complaint is that it is very easy to take the feeding tray out of the regular tray. So easy a baby can do....my son thinks it's wonderful fun to reach across to the front of it and pull the tray up. Because of this I've decided to just use just the tray part that snaps on. It's a little bigger to clean but way less headaches.	
1. 	I'm all about getting my money.s worth and this definitely is.  It's easy to assemble, took my husband about an hour. I love how I can use it for several more years. It comes with the half side rail and some extra screws, so I'm assuming you'll need to purchase more pieces for the full size bed.	
1. 	I had the original ( smaller version) for when my baby was 0-6 months and after she turned 6 months we started using this one. Is thicker and more bulky offering more cushion and keeps warmth better so now it's perfect. But I am not sure about summer time... it may be too thick.	
- 1	When I first got this, I saw no flaw in the design. As my daughter got older I was able to see the flaws and then some. You want to get something that seals the diaper individually, that is the only way that you can keep the stench from bombarding your home. With this as soon as you open it, whether it be to throw away a diaper or to change the bag, you're going to regret owning it.	
1. 	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  Both were huge and bulky.  When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!The Sunshine Radian is different!  It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  And a SNUG FIT!  Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!	
1. 	This is by far the most needed baby product for moms that need a good 15 mins to either eat, do some chores, or even take a shower (never leave the baby unsupervised though....yes that means place it in a safe spot you can see while in the bathroom). The mat is super cute and colorful and the toys are very entertaining for the little one. I watch him as he lays on the mat and tries to kick and grab different hanging toys. The music/light feature is great too. My baby just figured out that he controls the music (it makes noises every time he successfully grabs any of the hanging toys) and he is smitten! This gym is definitely a lifesaver for both the baby to enjoy and learn as well as stay entertained during tummy time and for the parents that need a break from the baby. This product is a must!	
1. 	I have a standard crib mattress (Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress) and this fits perfectly. It has been washed several times and I do not see any fraying or wear.	
1. 	First I would have to say what a great seller. I ordered pink and for some reason I got blue, I emailed them and they promptly sent me out a pink one!My baby also loves to lay on her changing table and feel the softness of the cover, sometimes i just put her on there to let her feel it.	
1. 	I have had this pump for only about a month and it has been great so far. Easy to assemble, easy to clean, pumps nicely. The only negative thing so far was the yellow piece that the milk flows through in the elbow does not detach easily---I cannot grasp it nearly enough to get it off. They say to twist it while pulling but I can't do either. It started to crack the little openings in the center when I tried.	
- 1	When I first tried to use the bottle, my son was screaming and I quickly put the bottle together.  I apparently did it wrong and it leaked everywhere.  When my son wasn't screaming, I tried again, and found that I had put the pieces in wrong the first time.  While I can accept that in my haste the leaking was my fault, I felt strongly that I didn't want a bottle that required concentation to put together.  Then, after using it a few times, it started leaking again and that wasn't my fault.  The reason I threw the bottle out, though, was because my son was getting terrible gas from it, worse than any other brands I was using.  Their anti-colic system did not work for us.  We have had great success with playtex ventaire, playtex drop-in's, and Nuk.  Tommee Tippe was ok as was born free.  I believe at this point we have tried every bottle on the market and for us, we keep going back to the same ones.  Every baby is different and just because the MAM didn't work for us doesn't mean it won't work for someone else, or even baby number two.	
1. 	I bought two of these about two months ago. At the time I thought they where a little thin and wondered how long they would last.ProFits both my 2yr old and 3yr oldwipes down easilyTies in backThe print is prettyConsmaterial feels like it could rip easily or stretch.One of the two I have is already coming apart at the seams.Still like for the price I got them at.	
- 1	This is not BPA free and is made in China.  Not safe to teethe on.It is also so loud and obnoxious.  You cant even put this away without waking the baby!Its crinkle sound is obnoxious and overstimulating.  There are softer crinkle toys out there.This was not for us.  Returning.	
- 1	I thought it would be worth it to sacrifice style to get zip-off sheets for the crib to make middle of the night sheet changes easier.  As soon as I put these on, I changed my mind.  You can see right through the sheets to the label on the crib mattress.  The outside part that goes over the zipper got a little warped from washing and didn't quite lay flat.  The sheets are thin and not soft, and I'm not happy with the quality.  I don't plan to use them at all.	
1. 	My toddler son is just getting into crafts. While I want to encourage him to do it, I also want his clothe to remain somewhat paint -free if possible :- ) This products helps with accomplishing just that. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and does not seem to bother my toddler...	
1. 	Okay, we are two guys and we don't have any experience with babies.  So when we had our daughter (by surrogacy) we got a lot of help.  This product line was one of the things we recieved and we use it all the time.  It smells fantastic, and people say it smells &#34;like a baby&#34;.  It works well, she likes having it put on her, and it cleans her up super good.  They also have a baby skin lotion that also smells the same, and works fantastically.  This is one of those secrets that you mom got from your grandmother, and they decided to let you in on it.  The product is golden!!!	
- 1	It sounds like a good cup in theory, but in practice, my son had to work too much to drink water and gave up after about a day, he has not touched this bottle ever since.	
1. 	The first time we used these we tried to spell out our sons name only to realize there is only 1 of each letter.  Makes spelling things tough.  They stick to the tub well and the bright colors are great for our son.	
1. 	These covers are very comfy and the fit is pretty decent (in my opinion). However, I don't really use them much. I found out pretty early on that it's easier to just change my son on the uncovered changing pad because he is constantly spitting up, urinating and pooping on the pad.  I was having to wash the covers every day! Now I just bring them out when we have visitors (like the fine linens, ha ha!)	
1. 	I have an 8 month old and she started splashing too much to bath her in the sink so we started using this tub seat we got as a gift and it works great.  She sits comfortably it it and can play and splash all she wants.  It's also easier on my back because I don't have to lean over the tub to make sure she doesn't fall back or forward into the water.  It's definately something I'd recommend.  My only gripe is that I wish the water was easier to drain out of it.  It seems like there's still water in it even after I tip it upside down to drain.	
- 1	We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2.4 GHz devices around the house. It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty, when the parent unit broke (the switch,  apparently). We couldn't return it, and couldn't repair it. Stuck with a child unit, and figuring it was just one of those things, we decided to buy a replacement pair, and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement. Gosh, what do you know, the new child unit broke down, and we had only one parent and child unit, and then the second child unit broke down.We didn't drop, wet, or otherwise abuse any of these units, and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T.Whatever the reason for the breakages, and however much the features may appeal, I don't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable. In fact, I call it awful. Avoid at all costs.	
1. 	We got this to help us with elimination communication on our 6 week old. She really wasn't digging the in arms position and we weren't feeling confident holding her in it. When we first got this it was hit and miss if she would like it. Because she is so small still and can't sit on her own and the potty is a bit big for her to lean on the chair part, we sit her very close to the front and hold her upper body up. I realized when she has been bundled up and then we take her potty she didn't like the cold plastic on her legs. So we bought some leg warmers and problem solved. Now she is 9 weeks and on good days we are happily catching most of her potty needs. Right now we keep the potty on our bathroom counter facing the mirror and some lotion bottles, she's loves looking at herself and reaching for the bottles while going. When she's older we plan to keep it on the floor so she can reach it by herself.	
1. 	There are a few other ones less expensive, but spend the extra buck on this one because the built in spout/funnel in the lid makes all the difference in the world.We ordered one of these from Amazon for on the go. It was really convenient and large enough capacity to scale as the baby ate more and more in a feeding. It was so handy we picked up another one (from a different manufacturer) at a garage sale. We immediately noticed how this one from Munchkin was so much better designed. The other version had four compartments but no funnel spout in the lid so it was much more difficult to get all of the formula out. It was like one of those frustrating marble games where you need to get all of the marbles to stay put in the little holes. We ended up buying a second one from Munchkin. We'll probably use the other one for cheerios or other snacks or give it away.	
- 1	This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product.  How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me.  This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite.  It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise.  In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)	
1. 	This is cute and serves it's purpose well.  It's a little tricky to figure out how to hang it.  But other than that, I would highly recommend it.	
1. 	These are great bibs! I saw one review comment that it was flimsy and they didn't see how it could ever hold up..... I definitely beg to differ! While these bibs are thin, they are strong! It's annoying for the child to have an overly stiff bib.  These are incredibly thin and flexible, yet the pouch to catch crumbs stays open nicely.  They just flip inside out for easy hand washing or you can throw them in the washer.  Having the entire bib be washable (i.e. no fabric backing) is a huge plus! Our daughter has had the same one for FOUR years now and it still looks and works perfectly.  That's four years of 3 meals, two snacks a day.  It's a hardworking bib.  And, might I add, her only bib because we love it so much! We just rise it with soap and water each night and throw it in the wash every once in a while.  She now also has the toddler version with little cap sleeves (which easily still fits her) for visiting grandparents and using as an art smock there. We got our son one when he was born and we expect it will last just as long! Adorable prints too.  We give these as gifts to new parents and they all have loved them too!	
1. 	My baby had outgrown our hard plastic tub and was uncomfortable in it.  I got this tub as a replacement.  After reading another customer's review I also purchased a sponge for the bottom and have had no problems with him slipping under water.  It smelled VERY STRONGLY of plastic so I had to wait a couple of days to use it, I recommend airing it out.  But once it's blown up, it's ready to go.  It's a little difficult to fill since it's so puffy, I have trouble getting it under the tub faucet but since I need to test the water temperature anyway, I just cup my hands and let the water run into the tub like that.  If you had a tub hose or something it would be easier.  My son loves this tub.  He lays back and luxuriates in his bath and it's very cute to see him &#34;relaxing&#34;.  (8 months old).  The suction cup on the back is awesome for hanging it up out of the way in the shower when we're done with it.  We keep it blown up and don't use the drain plug, we just tip it up to drain it because I read another review that the drain plug got warped and started to leak.  I'm avoiding that by just tipping it up to pour the water out.  Working perfectly so far!!  :)	
1. 	who knew a toilet seat could be so amazing?!  seriously tho, this has been a lifesaver for potty training.  it folds up (not as small as i'd like but still fits in the diaper bag), comes with it's own bag, is padded for comfort, and seems very sturdy.	
1. 	I got this as a baby gift when my son was born. I absolutely loved using this changing kit! It folds up so easily to fit into the diaper bag and was perfect to take into restrooms when we were on the go. It was comfortable for my baby to lay on to be changed. It also was nice to have on vacation. The kit comes with a container to store wipes in and has a holder for that inside the kit. There is another pocket that can hold around 3 diapers inside it. You have everything in your reach! There is also a zippered pocket on the very front of the kit to hold other things. It folds up nicely and is held together by Velcro and doesn't come apart if you don't want it to. I would so recommend this because it is so handy and saves a lot of room in the diaper bag!!	
1. 	We have this monitor for our 12 mo. old daughter.  At first we had a First Years monitor but the reception was terrible so we exchanged it for this Fisher Price model.  The reception on this one is crystal clear.  I like the light and vibration features- I can see if she's crying if I am in the shower by looking at the lights.  We have never had one problem with it.  We now have another First Years monitor for our 1 mo. old- it has a lot of static just like the previous one (we should have learned our lesson the first time)- we are going to return it for another Fisher Price monitor.Update: We bought this monitor again for our son- like the other, it is crystal clear.  This is the BEST monitor!	
1. 	My son loves this. He stares at the fish for as long as we leave him in it. It has a lot of different sound options as well as lights, moving mobile, etc. so you can mix it up and baby doesn't get bored. Also he seems comfy because he is always sleeping in it.The only thing that worries me is that if you have it on some of the higher speeds, and even the lower ones now that he is bigger the swing has a lot of movement at the legs. It sometimes looks like its going to tip. So I keep a very close watch when he is in it.	
- 1	We loved this seat until today our baby girl was choking on something while we were driving.  Of course, we stopped to help her and found that she had chewed off and swallowed some of the black felt used for padding on the arm straps.  This is completely unacceptable for a car seat!  The item should be recalled immediately.  Even if your child doesn't choke on it, the material cannot be good for them to eat.	
1. 	I purchased this for the smaller of my one year old twin granddaughters, the larger baby uses a high chair I was able to borrow from a friend. So in order for  little peanut to sit with the rest of us at a meal time-I purchased this. Shes fits in it perfectly fine, she is happy as all getup in it and to be part of the family at dinner. She will be getting weighed this week at her one year checkup, but I am estimating she is about 19 lbs and 29 tall. the entire set up cleans easily,  And since I never leave her unattended in anything-I wouldn't have the problems some of the other reviewers seem to have with the white tray pinching the childs fingers. I love the fact that it is height adjustable and the straps are long enough to fit around any chair in my house as well as my daughter & son in laws house. All in all a great booster seat. I would recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	I got this for Christmas 2011 for my almost 3 year old daughter.  She loved it immediately.  I found the stars and moon very peaceful to look at.  It seem perfectly bright to me and was easy to set up.  I highly recommend.	
- 1	I have owned this diaper pail for more than a year now, and I am less than happy with the product.CONS:- Top heavy - It's very hard to change the trash bag in the pail.  You must first lift the lid, then remove a blue rig that holds the trash bag in place, then lift the entire lid off in order to remove the trash bag.  The problem is that the entire pail is top-heavy when the lid is lifted, so the pail tends to fall over as I'm trying to get the trash bag out of the pail.- Arms stick - The concept of this diaper pail is good.  When a dirty diaper is placed in the top compartment and the lid is closed, two arms open up to let the diaper slide into the containment compartment at the bottom.  The arms should then close back up to contain odor.  The problem is that the arms sometimes stick open causing two problems:  first, the smell in the container leaches out, second, the built in fan continues to run to try to eliminate the smell, wearing down the numerous D batteries this thing requires in no time flat.- Odor - After a year of use, this thing smells even when there are no diapers in it!  I had the same problem with my first diaper pail, the Diaper Genie, so perhaps this is an issue with all plastic, porous diaper pails.PROS- Takes regular trash can bags - I do enjoy that this diaper pail accepts regular 13-gallon kitchen trash bags.  No running to the baby store for Diaper Genie refills.Overall, I'm not happy with the diaper pail and will be getting rid of it in favor of using a small regular trash can and grocery bags that will need to be emptied nightly.	
1. 	This was a wonderful teether for our little one.  It was just the right size to easily grip, he was fascinated by all the colors and spinning pieces, and I felt good about letting him chew on it, knowing it wasn't covered in toxic paint or leeching plastic chemicals.  :)	
1. 	I love my co-sleeper, my baby sleeps fine in it, and I don't agree with other viewers about he mattress, which almost prevented me from purchasing this bassinet.  While the mattress is thin, it doesn't seem to be uncomfortable for her.  I love the mesh, the lowering capability and the style.  It's a smart piece of furniture	
- 1	I bought this when I knew I'd be on a business trip and unable to use my plug in pump during the day... I figured I could go to the bathroom and at least make myself more comfortable between meetings. No luck... this pump doesn't suction well at all no matter how much effort I put into it.Disappointed for sure	
1. 	This cover fits nicely, is soft, and washes well.  I have two so I always have a clean one when accidents happen.  Liquids absorb instead of roll off, which is a good thing.	
1. 	This gate was very easy to put up and is very sturdy.  It is also convenient since there are no levers to pull or push with your hand to open.  It's totaly hands free leaving you to carry other things while you walk through the gate.  We thought that the opening might be a little small, but once it's up it doesn't seem so bad.	
1. 	I transitioned my son to the HALO sleep sack when he was 4 months old and he did great! We were swaddling him before and found it to be an easy transition. The sleep sack has a v-neck top so that it is not to close to baby's face. My baby does check on the bottom sometimes when he is rolling around his bed. The material has become a little frayed from washing it a lot but overall it's a great product!	
1. 	Little hands love shaking it.  As it rolls they can see the face and chase.  Would buy as gift for others.	
- 1	Love this diaper bag. Has enough space to fit everything inside. Love the way it looks has a thick strap so that its secure. Love love love love it. I would defiantly advice to buy it and suggest it to friendsMy son was born sep 17 and less then a month later the pin to close the bag broke off and because it was a gift from the registry and because we had a baby shower early because of complications with my pregnancy the return policy expired so upset really loved the material and pattern.	
1. 	I'm impressed by the quality and sturdiness of this product. I love that it has a top and is easy to use. It can be a bit difficult to get the frozen pieces out, but that's nothing that letting it sit at room temperature for a few minutes can't fix!	
1. 	I got this for my 7 month nephew b/c he's getting to a place where he can't walk yet but wants to explore and has strong enough leg motions.  My sister and brother in law already likes this brand, Safety 1st, a lot and owns other things by them.  The price at Amazon was the best.  Sound-making toys can be annoying but I love the music and variety on this walker... reminds me of an ice cream truck... whimsical and pleasant.  The music player piece detaches from the walker for easier cleaning and for tabletop sort-of room when wanted.  Nephew enjoys it; and I can't wait until he fully grasps puttering around all over in it.****Update****So fast forward 3 years and with our own little one, this item has passed back to me from my sister and still great.  The soundmaker is a little faulty now but our baby doesn't care.  He loves the spinning balls more anyways.My only caution is if you are putting it up often and bringing it back out (such as taking it to the in-laws), just make sure everything clicks back in place before each use.	
1. 	We have these on two of our outlets that are used quite often and I wish we had purchased these for most of our outlets instead of those plastic outlet covers that are nearly impossible to remove. We don't have any issues with ours closing and it is easy to slide when I need to plug something in.	
1. 	This is a really cute diaper bag. My husband loves it and there's plenty of compartments for storage. My only complaint is that it's a little small for the price.	
1. 	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a stay open feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.	
- 1	I returned this product because tt only works at night, and I needed something during the day to distract little one as well. Also, at night, my little one was distracted and actually kept awake longer by the lights. Too stimulating for her. Might be different for other babies, but I leave that as a possible warning for anyone out there considering this product. Good luck!	
1. 	I love these little animals, just not as a bath toy. The squirtie hole is the same as the connecting hole making it awkward (impossible) to get the water back out. But, the plastic is soft, great size for little hands, and the little knobs where the animals connect are great for teething babies.	
1. 	These do their job. They are a little difficult to pull out of the socket when you need to use it, but that's the point. :)	
- 1	Great idea but our baby has had no trouble ripping these off of every surface we've put them on.	
- 1	The car seat was difficult to install rear facing.  I took it to the hospital near my home that performs car seat checks and they stated that it is one of the most difficult seats to install rear facing.  I drive an SUV and the seat in front of the car seat needs to be pushed forward to a point that an adult cannot sit there.  I was dissatisfied at this point of using the seat but we were working around the issue.  Today my child threw up in the seat and I need to take the cover off to wash it.  There is apparently an older version of this car seat in which the base is removable, the current seat does not have this feature.  The cover is seriously impossible to remove.  I just spent 15 minutes on hold waiting for a customer care agent to explain what I'm doing wrong...I spent 15 minutes on the phone with her explaining that I'm not doing it wrong, I just need to try harder.  To remove the round plastic pieces holding the cover down where your child's bottom would be you need to stick your hand in between the base and the seat and press the bottom of the piece through the top by pressing a lip that holds it in place toward the outside of the seat (this is an extremely small space, even with the seat fully reclined).  Once there you need to use great force (enough force that they recommend a screw driver or butter knife) to press the lip toward the outside.  Unfortunately to reach this plastic lip I need to bend my fingers around another large plastic piece - I wear a women's small glove and they barely fit - good luck bending a screwdriver around in this manner.  I'm seriously going to have to get a babysitter so I can drive my car (without a car seat and child) to purchase a new seat or deal with vomit smell.  Only buy this car seat if you won't be installing it rear reclining and you plan to never never wash it.	
1. 	This isis breast pump set is great. The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private. Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.	
- 1	I am so disappointed with this cart cover, my friend had a buggy bagg that was amazingly padded, when I ordered this one, I thought I would be getting the same quality, but no!  this cart cover has no sufficient padding!!  The package also didn't look new.For $50 I expected more!Should have bought  the one I saw at Ross for $15!!!  I'm sure it would have been the same quality.update:I just went to the Buggy bagg website - this product is the JR bag, which has no pillows, no padding, just a cover fabric - should cost $15 in my opinion.  In order to get the good one with the real padding as seen IN THE PICTURE BY THE SELLER AND AMAZON - you need to order the Elite one or the original.But, how could I have known this before? I didn't know that there are a few types of covers and the picture is misleading!!!!!THERE IS NO PILLOW OR EXTRA PADDING WITH THE JR COVER!THE COVER IN THE PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU ARE GETTING!	
1. 	I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!	
1. 	This bib is great for any toddler. We used the Bumkins starter bibs and the sleeved ones a bit when our daughter was first starting to eat, but now that she's 2.5 and really needs more lap/chair protection than shoulder and arm protection, this is an amazing product. We've used our bibs at every meal since she started on solids at 4 months old. They've held up super well through lots of wipedowns, hand washes, and even machine washes. The velcro on one is starting to come off, but can easily be sewn back on.I found this to be the best of all the Bumkins bibs we've got. It provides more coverage than the other bibs, as not all food lands conveniently in the pockets (which don't stick out a ton to catch more food).I've no hesitation in recommending it to other parents.	
- 1	This unit was pretty good until the toggle power switch broke. It is fairly intuitive to use, picture was decent (a lot of people have complained about the video, but I thought it was good enough), but the battery life, even when new, wasn't remotely what is advertised. When I purchased it, it promised eight hours on battery but was beeping at us after four.A little more than a year after we bought it, the toggle power switch broke. Motorola offers no support after one year. For a monitor this expensive to break at a year of normal use is ridiculous, and that Motorola clearly doesn't stand behind its products (don't get me started on the Razr...) is pathetic.At this point, we can still use it, as at least it was already on when it broke, but it has to stay plugged in, because when the battery dies and it powers off, we won't be able to turn it on again.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	
- 1	This pillow probably cost less than a dollar to manufacture. It is made from the thinnest polyester material you can imagine, poorly sewn together to house a cheap, lumpy polyester fill, and then covered with a satin polyester pillowcase. The satin pillowcase is the best thing about this item, except for the fact that it is so slick that it slides off the pillow constantly (we found that a regular pillowcase, folded in half, works much better). The polyester fill material began to come out of this pillow within a day or two of first use, not because our child was rough with it but because the stitching was so poor. You, yourself, with no experience, could probably make something very comparable to this with materials from Wal-Mart for under $2. I would definitely recommend something else, or no pillow at all - our now three-year-old still prefers sleeping without a pillow - and at this point he has a luxurious $100+ pillow from Tempurpedic.	
- 1	The Ziploc seal rips away from the sides within a couple uses!! This must not be a problem for all batches of this product (Lots of people love these!) I did my research and thought this product would be the best. I only hand washed them and after the first one broke in less than 1 week, I opened the other 3 as carefully as possible (only to have all the pouches rip the same way). We so wanted these pouches to work, so we could make our own purees and save money on the dozens of pouches we go through each month. Like others with this problem (read the 1 star reviews) the company sent us 4 new pouches, but after 3 of our 4 original pouches broke, I wanted a refund (which they agreed to....after I return the 4 replacement pouches). This product certainly won't hold up over time (which it needs to do to make the $20 cost worth it!) Plus, it's made in China! Come on!	
- 1	My son uses it since he was a month old, when all of a sudden he has decided not to poop in this diaper and could hold it for days.  He was a 2 months premature baby and weighted 5 pounds when he was a month old.  I've compared all potties at Toysrus, this is the one with the smallest seating ring to fit my son's tiny bump.  Immediately, I've noticed although it is made by SafetyFirst, it is not safe at all.  It would slide and shift when my son wiggles and kick while seating on it.  The anti-slip pads at the bottom are just too small to hold it still on wooden flooring.  Also, it doesn't have a backrest or handle that baby can lean on to.  I have to hold my son from the back and at the same time holding the potty still with my feet.Secondly, the cushion seat and the bowl seemed to be designed without testing.  Urine would go around the underside of the cushion, I have to wash both the bowl and the cushion after every use.Then, after 7 months of usage, something horrible happened..... Yesterday when I was washing the potty, I might have been holding the cushion a little too hard, there was water and bubbles coming out from the cushion.  It was until then I've realized that the cushion ABSORBS urine and water!  No wonder the potty stinks no matter how many times I've soaked it in bleach diluted water in trying to get rid of the urine smell.  The bubbles that I've squeezed out is aparently the detergent that I've been using all along.  This really solved the mystery of my son's rash on his thigh last week, and the wet onesie (I thought the bottom flap of the onesie had accidentally fall into the bowl while potty time).  My son has never had any diaper rash or skin problem since birth, the rash on his thigh really scared me.  It is horrible to know that it is the liquid that has built up in 7 months, and is a mixture of urine, detergent, bleach and water that was irritating his skin.Please STAY AWAY from this potty in all cost!!	
1. 	I heard this product from others, haven't use it for my love because it's a bit of bigger, I may use it later.	
- 1	happy with this car seat at all.1. The lock is very hard to open.2. The sun shade is horrible. It has a velcro back part that will not allow you to move it forward if the sun is in the babies face. The sun shade does not have any stiff part for you to be able to un velcro the shade to move it in the back, it will just fall on your babies face.  The red locks that lock the handle in place are very hard to push down and at times they stick, there for when you try to put the handle down while it is in the stroller it needs a lot of force and something&#8217;s you need 2 people to do it. This affects any toys you may want to put on the handle also. If you have anything that will come close to the shade then the shade will not open, therefor you cannot put any toys on the handle. The shade is made so week that it does not stay open if you have the car seat in the stroller and push it.3. My baby seems to get very hot in this car seat, much more than our older Graco car seat.4. You cannot use any of the Greco bases for this car seat, you have to buy all new ones.5. The wheels deflate fast, we have only had this car seat for one week and have had to fill the tires 2 times now.The only good things about this car seat is that it is for bigger baby&#8217;s that can go up to 35 lbs.I wish I never bought this car seat.	
- 1	My baby had terrible gas and colic and i was using the Playtex Ventaire natural shape bottles. someone gave me an avent bottle to try. I was desperate to find something that would releive her but this bottle was not it either. i didnt find that the bottle itself leaked but the milk came out too fast and caused my baby to choke and spit up all over. i was disappointed because the Avent bottles seemed as though they would be easier to clean and assemble than the Vent Aires. after this i reluctantly tried the Dr Browns bottles and i am glad i did because they worked great the first day, no gas or colic and baby slept all nite  :-)i just recently tried the wide neck Dr. Browns and like them even better than the standard dr browns. You Avent users might like the wide neck Dr Browns also b/c they are easy to clean and pour milk into like the Avents, there are more parts but so worth it to releive colic. Too bad the Vent Aires didnt work b/c they are the cutest bottles of the 3 though.	
1. 	Love the scent. And it lasts very long. My baby gets a top to toe massage using this Mustela Massage Oil every morning--and yet my first bottle lasted more than 6 months! How's that for great value for money?	
- 1	many times my girl has hurt yoo hoo when sitting down. its sometimes hard to pop off the bowl you empy which is gross when you splash. my daughter who likes to put the pottys back together can never get this one. for the price there are better potty's out here.	
- 1	Not really worth the little bit I paid for it.  It had a tiny hole in it where the plastic folds met.  My 4-month old HATED tummy time, and I was desperate for anything that would stem the wailing - even for a minute.  She was distracted by the colors enough to be quiet for a moment, but once she realized she was getting wet she would freak out.  On a related note, if you're having this experience, keep at it - she eventually loved tummy time (around 5 months)!	
- 1	i order this because my LO eat her hand often. i decided to give her this but she cried because its so hard. before i gave it to my LO i boiled them for 2 minutes. the mirror broke, the teether with rubber melt. i guess it was my fault. but i used to boil everything i bought before i gave my daughter.	
- 1	While the Constellation turtle is a cute idea, it is poorly made.  The white lights are useless, but the blue and green work great.  This is more of a night light, as the name states, not a learning toy, people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere.  Our turtle came unglued at the neck, around the plastic and the fabric and the stuffing started coming out.  This item is recommended for children age 3 and up, it falls apart and the stuffing falls out it can be a choking hazard!	
1. 	I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it.	
- 1	My baby liked relaxing in this chair (I called it his hammock), however the construction of it left something to be desired. It ended up breaking after about a month's worth of use. Also, not that easy to fold up. Hope they can make a better version of this in the future because it's great having the option of a fold up chair.	
1. 	I bought this for an upcoming vacation.  I tried it out once at home to see how it compares to the Medela PIS and I was pleasantly surprised! This worked just as well, if not better, than the electric! I would recommend this!	
- 1	Very small! Our baby ended up not using this at all. The seams are at weird angles so it fit strange at the shoulder. Made for small babies but the arms are long so it's an awkward fit.	
- 1	I have owned and used the baby bjorn carrier for just over a month now. It is ok for the first thrity minutes to an hour in comfort. Anything beyond that you can expect to have a soar back. This was my second choice for a carrier. I first purchased the moby wrap, and absolutely love it. However, we recently traveled out of the country when my little guy was only two months old and did not want the hastle of the moby wrap going through security. I used this on the first flight to Bogota, Colombia and the first day we were there. After that first day I was absolutely miserable.It was so very uncomfortable. I would hold my son up with my hands to give my shoulders and back a break.The remainder of the trip I used the moby wrap and stuck the baby bjorn in the closet.Pros...ConvinientEasy to UseCons...Shoulder discomfortBack pain and discomfortMy child sits to low even when sized properly according to his heightCarrying any infant facing out is just cruel imo...when they are over stimulated they have no escape...it is much more comfy for babies to have the shelter of their mother or father's chest...I would not reccomend wasting your money. Instead...if you do not mind all the fabric...invest in th moby wrap or if you're looking for somehting a bit easier to get on and off try the Ergo baby carrier.	
- 1	Looks like a toy. We thought it was much bigger than it actually is. The rubber is not the softest and the ratteler inside could get annoying. Not as bendy as we thought. For the price it was not worth it...but at least i can give it to the dog...cheaper than buying a dog toy.	
- 1	baby likes it, however when my son was 3 months old, he didn't have good control over his arms, so he hit his head really hard and it left a mark there. i would recommend it for a baby with better motor skills.	
- 1	I already hadOXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Setfor cleaning milk sippy cups, but wanted more straw brushes for smoothie cups and straws.  These seemed like a bargain.Upon first usage cleaning baby straws, I felt the Munchkin brush dragging when pulled.  Upon closer inspection (you can also see from Amazon's zoomed picture), the tips of all of these Munchkin brushes are merely bent back, not capped with a smooth ball tip like the Oxo brush.  The bent tip's edge cuts up and flakes off anything brushed:  silicon/plastic/metal, you name it.  You'd be better off just running straws under running water than using these brushes.  Or, better yet, just order another set of the Oxo.	
- 1	This cover is an oversized piece of thick plastic that you have to wrap like a present around your mattress with two ends of weak tape. It is hard to get tight and doesn't overlap for a firm fit. It makes me more nervous than it's claims to prevent SIDS and has been very frustrating. It makes it difficult to change the sheets, etc. I would not recommend this cover nor would i purchase one again.	
1. 	My twins LOVE this toy. I credit this with helping them both become excellent sitters because it held their attention for long periods of times and helped build their core strength. I can't say enough good things about this toy.	
1. 	This diaper pail is easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't require any expensive refills-just regular 13 gallon trashbags. It doesn't keep odor in very well, but other diaper pails don't really seem to, either. I mean, it's poop. It smells! We have two of these-one for cloth diapers/laundry, and one for trash. They're a good size, and hold up well after continuous use.	
1. 	I bought this when we had our first child instead of buying a bath bathtub.  This is much cheaper, and much more efficient.  Also, this stores much more easily.	
1. 	The pocket had a stitch sewed in the middle but i found its ok to open up the pocket after the stitch loosed up after around two weeks of use. It's easy to clean. No messy cloth any more. And my kiddo has no problem wearing it :)	
1. 	So there are a lot of reviewers unsatisfied with the price. I agree that it is expensive, and it's sadly a common practice among manufacturers to make accessories that appear exhorbitantly priced. However, we used them like many others to bring the co-sleeper level to our bed to help facilitate night-time feedings. And honestly, it works. Ours is a little wobbly, but I've tried to make it fall (of course without the child in it) and really couldn't do it. Even so, we keep it strapped to the bed and it's as stable as without the extensions.The fit, color and function were all adequate. It was a little costly, but then again, what is a better night's sleep and routine worth? As with most things, it's just a compromise. Also, I think perhaps there are other things more worthy of our scrutiny and criticism.Mom is happy + kid is happy = dad is happy. All for about $20.	
1. 	We have had this for 7 1/2 months and are just now using the last bag in our first refill pack. No issues with odor or use. It's easier than Diaper Genie and you don't have to touch it to throw away a diaper, because there's a foot pedal.	
1. 	I love this tub. The sling makes giving my month old daughter a bath very easy. At first I filled it up full enough to touch her back but found that when she would slide herself down a little it would get to close to her mouth so I drained it a little and it works great. I love that is has the holder at the end as well. I put everything I need in it so I never forget anything.	
1. 	These are new nipples for the playtex standard ventaire bottles, and they are fast flow. Exactly what I wanted and they were brand new when I got them. They worked perfectly.	
- 1	Product is cute, but very low quality.  The foam feels very cheap.  There is a seam that runs along the top and ends at the top hole... this seam tears very easily when the products is pulled against the metal thing that pops up for the shower.  The first thing my child did when I put this on the bath spout, was pull on it... and within minutes the product was torn at the seam.  The tear is about half way through the seam now so I am not sure how much longer it will last.It's probably only worth about a dollar and honestly, if this thing only cost me $3-$5, I would probably just keep replacing it because it's so cute.  At $10, it's not worth replacing and is a total ripoff.I would recommend looking for a different product.	
- 1	I was hoping to reduce spills of snacks in the living room with this thing. It worked, but it also impedes my son from eating! Little fingers can get inside, but then they lose what they're holding on their way out. My son tried a few times and then just gave up on his snack. I also had a really hard time opening it to wash it, thought I would break it.It's useless for now, maybe when my son (who's 2) is stronger, he can use it.	
- 1	I followed the washing instructions to a T and it shrunk. I had tried it on before washing and it was perfect. But after washing the material became softer and stretchier feeling and it is literally pulling up from all sides. I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I hand washed it cold and let it air dry and same thing - it shrunk! Other than that it is the right size for a 18x36 cradle mattress 3 inches thick. I am keeping the 2nd one bc it was cheap and nothing not sure if anything else on the market would be any better.	
- 1	This bottle brush has bristles that are so stiff, it is hard to use. I like the design and the way it stands on the counter, but functionally it isn't very good. I ended up replacing it with theOXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange, which has soft bristles and really cleans well without tiring me out.	
- 1	This was shown in black and came in rainbow. Disappointing, for sure. I suppose next time I should read the fine print.	
1. 	As new parents we bought a lot of gadgets to help entertain our newborn. We purposely didn't buy this type if chair because we had some many other gadgets and thought we had all basis covered. After we visited a friend and my parents who had similar chairs we knew we had to have one. It allows her to sleep, eat, and just look around and watch her surroundings. She is held a lot but occasionally wants her own space and this is her favorite place.  It sits between my husbands and I chair and she very content. Definitely one of the best baby purchases and it is wasn't very expensive.	
1. 	Easy to set up and I was able to shape it to fit great in the space I need it to. Once the girls (I have twins) need more space I can going to open it up and use it as a gate to keep them out of the kitchen (We have an open concept space).	
1. 	My youngest (6 months) and I bedshare and this product worked really well on my queen size bed.  I felt really safe a night knowing he wasn't going to roll out of bed.  Highly recommended!	
- 1	I've been disappointed with every Munchkin sippy cup I've purchased.  This one is no exception.  Liquid collects outside of the valve where the liquid comes out and once tipped over it sprays everywhere.  It's definitely not spill/nor leak proof as stated.  It's fine for using outdoors with water so we'll continue to do that, but in the house I'll have to rely on something better.	
- 1	Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.	
- 1	I have a 15 month old daughter that has started talking in her sleep so my husband and I decided we needed to buy a video monitor to make sure she was awake before we went into her room because we have accidently woken her up going into her room to check on her after we have heard her start stirring. I started researching video monitors and found the Levana brand had 4+ start reviews on Amazon. (Note: I am an Amazon Prime member and a frequent reader of reviews before I decided to buy an item.) I liked the price of this video monitor compared to the prices of the ones made by Motorola and Summer Infant. It seemed very reasonable and the online reviews of this item were very good. The reviews specifically said the day time color picture was very clear and bright and the night vision worked very well. I did not find either of these to be true with my experience.We set this new monitor up on a Friday night so we were not able to test the color picture on the first day of use. The night vision worked, but did not have a great picture (certain items were very bright and others were blurry). On Saturday late morning when we put our daughter down for a nap, we tested the color picture. The colors on the monitor were completely off and the room has to be extremely well lit for the color picture to even work. When we went to bed Saturday night, the night vision was still working, but by Sunday morning, we woke up to a black and blurry screen. It appears that the night vision LEDs had gone out. I called customer service for Levana on Sunday morning, per the instructions in the manual for the monitor, only to find out you could not talk to anyone until business hours Monday-Friday. The customer service line then walks you through a few trouble shooting measures to try and get the monitor to start working again (i.e. turn the monitor on and off, check the light in the room, etc.). I found this to be completely unacceptable. This is a product that sells items for baby safety. How many working parents are able to call about a defective baby monitor from their office? My husband and I returned this monitor to Amazon and ended up buying a much more, expensive but nicer monitor manufacturer by Motorola from another retailer.if I could give this monitor and Levana zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product as well as the lack of service provided by Levana.	
- 1	I've owned four of these and they all have leaked.  I guess they are okay for room temperature water, but if you ever put cold water into it, it will leak like crazy.  I've had problems with the product leaking from the straw and from the joint between the cup and cap.On the positive, my daughter now knows how to use a straw, so it taught her that.They look great, just be prepared for a constantly leaking cup. I find them unless when carrying them in a diaper bag, car, plane, stroller, etc. There okay when being used at the dinner table.	
- 1	This was too big for a bracelet or anklet on my daugher.  It did not work at all.  I had both a necklace & bracelt on her (necklace doubled up) hoping it would help her sleep with teething.  The only thing that worked was teething tablets & Tylenol.  She wore one for over a month and it was on her 24/7.	
1. 	This brush works well at cleaning my baby's bottles, and I like that I haven't really gotten sprayed when pulling it out of the bottle.  It always helps though to angle the brush awaaay from your face/hair/clothing while removing it up though the bottle opening.  I think it would be so much better of a product if the nipple-cleaning end actually had bristles on it too!  As it is, it's just the same plastic material as the handle of the brush.  I don't know how this is supposed to clean nipples.  Maybe if the food or formula or whatever is more of a puree material it would help??  Anyways, you can't go wrong for the price on this thing.  You could even use it to clean normal dishes, your coffee mugs, the shower, etc etc.  Just don't do all that with the SAME brush haha	
1. 	Fantastic little booster seat.  It's the only one we own.  Perfect for our small home where a traditional stand alone sort of high chair just won't fit around our table (I use it on an IKEA Stefan chair).  My little one has been using it for the past couple of months, starting at about 7 months of age.  Easy to adjust straps and simple to snap on to any chair.  We've carried and used it on long trips to grandma's, at various restaurants and it has worked perfectly each time.I've never used the removable tray and lid.  No need to-- the snap-on tray washes easily.  After a few very messy eating sessions I've taken the whole chair into the tub for a wash down... so easy!I highly recommend this seat.  It's made of a sturdy plastic that looks like it's going to hold up for a very long time to come.  It's way more useful AND economical then any stand alone high chair.	
1. 	Our daughter has been using sleep sacks since she was an infant.  Now at 15 months, we still put it on her to cue her that it's bed time and make sure her feet stay warm.  I don't think she has the dexterity to put a blanket on her quite right, though we have introduced one in her crib and she's starting to snuggle with it.  Until I am sure, these things are great for keeping her snug.	
1. 	I needed a toddler bedding set for my two year old and this one was just perfect. It is made out of the same minky dot material as her blankie so she doesn't even need the blankie to fall asleep anymore. She tells me every night that it's so cozy ;) I LOVE that it is secured at the bottom of both the sheets and comforter with elastic so that the sheets don't come out. Can't say enough about this set!! Would highly recommend it!	
1. 	It's soft and easy to wear. My daughter like it. If there's newborn size, that's will be much better. But small size is suitable, too.	
1. 	These have a nice amount of cushioning to protect my 9 month old daughter as she &#34;cruises&#34; around our coffee table.  They come with a good amount of adhesive tape, which is why I purchased this brand over others.  It is difficult to get them to stay adhered without putting adhesive tape on BOTH sides.  Once I put it on both sides, it works much better.  Because this item is also a bit &#34;stretchy&#34; it was tricky to measure it exactly right.  So, we have small gaps between the pieces which aesthetically isn't great, but it still protects my daughter.  If I had the time and money, I might purchase again and install it better knowing what I know now, but it works fine.	
- 1	These bottles came very highly recommended from our pediatrician to help our new born son with is obvious gas problem (he makes a very rapid eh eh eh eh machine gun sound).  Anyway, these bottles leak all over the place and they are a pain to clean unless you just stick them in the dish washer.	
1. 	This item has been a life saver for me!  Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music.  The music is good and there are a lot of different choices.	
1. 	I love this!  I bought it after owning the baby bond which really wasn't as discreet as I wanted in very crowded settings i.e. restaurants. This works very well and you can see your baby which is great.  Although if you're at a restaurant and the waiter is standing over you they can also see your baby along with other things.  It looses a star for me because the material is not very breathable and baby and I both get hot using it at times in Cali weather.	
1. 	Good product. Our old ones were Bumkins, too, so this was an easy choice. We had to replace the bibs after the 1st child, since moldy looking spots formed at the back after 3 years of non use. Its cheap enough, so that's not a problem. Cute designs for baby girls.	
1. 	Yes, these things work. NO baby can get them off.  Thing is, if your outlets aren't 100% sturdy (i.e.. loose sockets), you adults will have a tough time too (because of how tightly they stick).  Your best bet is to alternate: use these in your baby's primary play area and choose a more user-friendly model for the places you plug in most. (The simple ones without the release buttons.)  This works for us.	
1. 	We just recently stopped using it for our 18 mo old just because she can now sit in the regular tub but this little bath tub was great! Very durable and easy to clean.	
1. 	we used these bottle because they are compatible with the medela pump.  the 5oz capacity is much better than the tiny 2oz ones.  my wife was very happy when they came.  I would check to make sure these don't have bisphenol A (BPA), we didn't know about back when we got them.  fast shipping.	
- 1	Worked for the first 10 months and then could only use it when plugged it.  After 18 months, it completely died.  Such a shame because I loved the features but who wants an unreliable video monitor?	
- 1	My son hates this. It has excess fuzz on it, so it feels strange to him. He will chew on a regular washcloth or any cloth for that matter, but these- not so much.  Even after washing they are really fuzzy/	
- 1	This bath toy seemed like a really cool idea.  Water spurts out the top and it self propels around the bath while blinking a blue light.  It seemed great. Unfortunately, it broke within 5 baths and that was before my son was old enough to really be able to play with it.  So it broke after floating itself around the tub after 5 bathtimes.  Way to expensive to be so poorly made.	
- 1	This bag requires me to dig. Dig Dig Dig to find the stuff I'm looking for.It's perhaps too deep.I'm on the hunt for a better bag...	
- 1	I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!	
1. 	I registered for this item but when I didn't receive it, it wasn't one of those MUST items I purchased to prepare for the baby's arrival. I thought of it more as a marketing gimmic and not really a necessity. After my son was born he hated diaper changes (the winter weather didn't help with the coldness of the wipe). I purchased this and now he doesn't scream.By the time you pull the wipe out and use it, the wipe is no longer warm but it does stay at room temperature. I gave it four stars b/c the top wipe is usually dry and the light is more of a feature to locate to warmer, it doesn't give off light like a nightlight. Otherwise, I'd say this is well worth getting, especially for the winter.	
1. 	this is so amazingly soft and warm! i wish they had a blanket like this! baby loves to snuggle in it	
- 1	it has/had great promise. We purchased one for our younger son (2) and he loved it. So we got another for our 5 yr old son. The first one stopped working after 2 months for no reason. It just would not charge and like other reviewers said something inside was rattling  like it had come loose. Luckily Amazon refunded us - I did not even bother contacting the manufacturer. Our second light broke today. It did fall but if it can't handle a fall what type of portable light is that? I won't ask for a refund since my son did drop it but I feel these are poorly designed and need to be improved. My younger son was devastated when it broke and my older son was crying tonight because he liked carrying it to the bathroom at night. We got the Kinderglo moon that is similar and portable and so far it is excellent. We just ordered another for our older son since they both need night lights still. I do NOT recommend this light.	
1. 	What else can I say? It does its job and I appreciate that it doesn't need anything but pressure to keep it in place. No fancy hinges or anything. You really don't need to buy anything more expensive than this!	
1. 	This infant carrier is great. I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time. I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2.) He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot. I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat. It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases. It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to. It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks. Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.	
1. 	For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!	
1. 	I had and hated the VENTAIR!  Stupid leaky valves!  This bottle feels nice in the hand to feed and my husband like them too.  The placement on the babys face with the nipple is perfect too.	
1. 	i can't speak on the ability of this diaper trashcan to contain smells since we are still breastfeeding ... but the design is awesome!  my husband and i love how it is one continuous trashbag and we feel like we don't waste any space since you are essentially making the size of the bag by yourself.  i definitely recommend this trashcan!	
- 1	This worked well for a month or so.  Then it became increasingly difficult to slide, and finally got to where it would just hang, and I had to pop it open to open and close the oven door, even though my hands were full of whatever I was cooking.  Finally it just melted one day after my husband was cooking something because it got caught in the door.  This allowed the oven knob covers to melt, too, sooo... we were really disappointed with it.  We're trying the other brand this time.	
1. 	Turtles are my favorite animal so I got some turtle bibs because babies always need a few gave one to a friend and one to a cousin	
- 1	I have no idea how so many people can like these crappy, cheaply made cuts. The handles and bottom of the cup spin around and around the cup itself, so my daughter can never get a steady grip on it. The plastic itself is thin and seems cheap. I found something better at WalMart, and I loath that place.	
1. 	I registered for this tub to have a lower-priced item on my list and it turned out to be one of the best things I was given.  The sling allows a newborn to feel secure so baths are a pleasant experience and when baby is bigger, the incline side lets him have little more freedom.  We used this from day 1 until my son was about 7 months old.  We'd still use it but he's too active to be bathing on/in the sink.  We used it across the kitchen sink so as not break our backs leaning over the regular bath tub. I did a test on our plug to see if it changed colors and it did slightly but, as was stated before, you shouldn't be relying on the plug to tell you if the water's too hot.	
1. 	My son isn't old enough to play with these and understand them yet, but I like them. When he can actually realize what they are I'm sure he will enjoy them a little more as well.	
1. 	This is a good bottle nipple which of course fits the phillips avent bottles.  Even though this is a slow flow nipple my 3 month old baby did and still at 4 months does struggle with it on occasion for being too fast.  In our case there's also a little bit of nipple preference so I am not sure that it is entirely the nipple's fault (as in not being slow enough).  Perhaps in another month or two we'll revisit this review.	
- 1	Didn't seem to do anything. Smells nice though. However, if your baby has colic I'm sure you are willing to try anything. Colic Calm works better.	
1. 	I wish I had known about this before I bought a vibrating bouncy seat. My son, large at birth, outgrew his first bouncy seat at 3 months. I got this one and it is the only one you need. I have a long boy and at 9 month he still fits in it comfortably, though I removed the overhead toys. The conversion to a rocking chair is super easy. Took no time to put together. These items have limited lifespans, but this particular one has a longer life than others because of the rocking chair option.	
1. 	I tried using a baby nail clipper to clip my son's nail.  They could never really cut his nail short enough and always leave a rough edge, so I ended up spending an hour trying to file it smooth (hard to file since baby nails are so soft).  Using a scissor to cut baby nails sound very dangerous to me, but I'm out of options, so I gave it a try.  It worked better than I thought actually.  Of course I did it when the baby was deep asleep.  I found a comfortable position, have enough lighting, then started cutting away very slowly.  It take a little practice at first, and got easier after 2 to 3 nails.  I found for each nail, cutting the corner, then middle, then the other corner works pretty well.  Since every finger is shaped a little different, this works on some better than others.  The scissor is sharp enough that the edges are not rough after cutting.  I've only used it once, but so far I like it.	
- 1	I don't know if it's because of the size of my baby (over 10 lbs and 22 in long as a newborn), but this sling doesn't hold my baby up during baths.  He slides right down it and ends up in a hunched over position before too long.  The only good thing about this product is that it's cheap so I don't feel like I wasted a lot of money on it.  We used it twice before giving up on it.	
- 1	This is a basic potty with the pot that can be removed for easy cleaning so it's easy to wash and clean but my poor kid stands up from sitting on this for mere minutes and has deep red marks on her legs and bottom, it's uncomfortable!  I'm going to order one with a cushy seat!	
1. 	My baby has always used Evenflo nipples.  At 3 months, he was having a hard time getting the milk to flow through the 0-3 month nipples, so we bought some of the 3-6 month and 6+month nipples.  The 6 month nipples flowed too fast even at 5 months, but now that he's 6 months, they work perfectly for him.	
- 1	Ok, I have so many reasons why I dispise this diaper disposal.  When I first bought this diaper disposal, I was happy that it took regular kitchen sized garbage bags...They should point out that you need to use the kind with the drawstring, otherwise they slide right back into the unit! Second, the way that you push the diapers into the bag is by simply closing the lid...well the lid is so loud, it sounds like a guillotine.  If I have to do a latenight diaper change, I let the diaper sit until morning because the sound wakes my son up everytime! Next, I loaded it with 4 D batteries..the green light blinked a few times, but that was it.  I never heard a fan sound or anything like that.  Also, now that my son is eating solids, his diapees are pretty ripe (TMI, sorry), but his room smells like a dump if a few diapers pile up, and I'm talking about a day's worth!  Wasn't the whole reason why I bought this was to keep the stink out of the room??  Don't waste your money.  I'm thinking of donating to Goodwill, and getting a Diaper Champ!	
- 1	I installed this exactly as instructed.. my 2 year old walked up to it and unlocked it in mins! SOO I then took it off and installed it so that you had to push on the door to unlock it.. she figured that out the next day. I would have sent it back but the charge to return it was about the cost of the lock. This product is useless.	
1. 	BEST GIFT ever, between this and the merlin sleep suit....two favorite items he got for Christmas. The settings are all nice and he giggles at the whale noises but it's the mother's heart beat that my son loves. We co-slept in the beginning and &#34;darth vader&#34; (my nickname for the sheep because the mothers heart beat reminds me of darth vader breathing after a while) came to bed with us every night. now he's switching to his pack and play and I just turn it on when I'm going to set him down and he stays asleep till he needs to eat, then I put him right back with it on and he sleeps right away, without it he wakes up instantly and it's back to getting him sleepy again for hours....I don't know what I'd do without this sheep....oh wait yes I do....I'd be insane from lack of sleep....Age started use: 3 months, currently 4 months and 3 weeksProsSo Soft and fluffyThe timer being able to be set to 45 or 25....most don't allow past 25 and it takes the longer setting for my son to get into his deep sleepthe strap that you can velcro around the crib/pack and play, I like it because he can't grab it and pull it to his face like he does with all his other toys so I can sleep without worry of him suffocating with itCons:picks up lint like crazy, so be sure to keep it in a clean spotWish you could have an hour or more timer optionthe ocean and whale noises practically the same thing....would have been nice to have another option but I really only use the heart beat anywaysBulky for travel and the travel version does not have the heart beat....and we travel a lot....but what I've done is just pop out the sound machine and take that only on the plane or out in the stroller, then put it back in when we reach out destination.Con's not enough to bring it down a star because in the end, it's a miracle worker and I know my son would be having a much harder time transitioning to his pack and play without it right now. I LOVE this sheep	
- 1	This cup is not meant for me, so I rated it on how my daughter respond to it. She almost hates the thing. I have tried multiple times to get her to drink both milk and water from it but after attempting to use it and sometimes just handling it, it is a) give back, b) dropped, c) thrown across the room.I like the designed but since I am not the one drinking from it, what I think does matter. She has the chewy top cups and hard cups like this and drinks from all of them. This thing, she won't even touch now after all my attempts.	
- 1	I thought these would come in handy for my 6 month old twin boys but found that these are not that useful mainly because they are not that solid.  They come apart very very easily so a baby can remove them when they are linked together.  They are able to do it without even trying unlike the sassy ring of links which are sturdier and much more worth it.  They are cheap and you get lots of them but you end up with lots of rings that aren't very useful.	
1. 	Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.	
1. 	It seemed people were commenting about needing slats or issues with the rails once the crib was converted to a bed.  I converted into a full size bed.  But, so the height wouldn't be too much for my 2yro son, I explored options to just use a mattress.  The mattress company have this special board that fits perfectly and does NOT require any additional support.  It's like a box spring, but only a flat version.  It was about $70...it is a fantastic choice to keep the mattress on well and in place.  So, I have had NO issues with the rails.  Now, the instructions and getting the crib changed were a different story.  The crib instructions were a little better than what came with the rails.  And, these do seem a little higher priced than they seem they should.  I'm happy though.	
- 1	This review is for the brown Snugglesaurus blanket. While it is very soft and cute, I have experienced a very annoying problem with this blanket: it is good for 2-3 washes, then it gradually starts to shed onto all your baby's clothes! Lint screen won't do a thing, and neither do fabric softener sheets - it sheds, sheds, SHEDS more than a German Shepard! I had to toss it when baby was 8 months old because there is hardly any blanket left (it thinned out A LOT) and many of her clothes have this stubborn brown lint on them that is so hard to remove I have given up (lint roller doesn't work). This happened with fairly light use: we washed it once or twice a month as we only used it in her infant carrier.If you do decide to get it make sure you wash this separately from everything else, but beware that even out of the washer/dryer it will shed lint onto your baby's stuff. It's ruined quite a few of my baby's lighter pajamas because I can't stand all these little brown lint dots all over them, they look worn and dirty. This is one purchase I completely regret!	
1. 	my son never wanted to be in his stroller. so i purchased this when he was 2 months old... he loved it . i used until he was 6 months old , by then he was just too heavy and would kill my back. so i purchaed the hip hammock . also great product	
1. 	It's super convenient. Everything's light so they are easy to carry around as well. It's even better because the liner is recyclable.	
- 1	I thought this would be great to bring along to restaurants etc. but the suction only really works on completely smooth surfaces (like a mirror) and not any restaurant table I've tried so far. and because it is so top heavy it ends up on the floor in about 30 seconds.	
- 1	The different sound choices are good, but the projector stopped working after only a couple of months, and pushing the projector button resets the sound.	
- 1	It says that X-small will fit a woman size 2 and 4. Not true!!!. I'm barely 2 and the x-smal didn't feel comfortable if you are carrying a baby. I felt like my baby couldn't breath. Also it is very complicated to use, you really need to take a tutorial. In my opinion is expensive, difficult to use and wrong sized.	
1. 	My son had quite a bit of colic and gas when he was first born.  We tried all the other bottles and had settled down with the Avent which were okay.  However, my Mom spoke to a friend who had had similiar problems with her baby and she recommended the Dr. Brown's.  We purchased some and we were impressed.  After two days he was less gassy and actually slept through the night.  I would highly recomeend these bottles.	
1. 	The only toilet lock I could find that works with toilet seats that are not flat however, my 2-year-old has opened it when she pulls hard enough.	
- 1	My less thank one year old boys figured these out right within a couple months. If you yank hard enough it opens up. The adhesive started to fail, and the drawers they were talk enough to see into the learned how hot press the latch on their own to open drawer. Ridiculous how easy it was for them.	
1. 	I bought and installed three of these latches about six years ago. Two of them are still going strong. The third fell off, but it lasted a few years before falling off, and it wouldn't have been difficult to reinstall.They come with screws or adhesive. I chose to mount with adhesive. The main thing to remember about any adhesive mount is to use a clean surface and let it cure for 24 hours, which means do not use it right away.My toddler son was into opening every single drawer and cabinet in the kitchen and he did not open the ones these were on. They do open a little, but the latch catches them. If you have small bottles or things that little hands can reach in and grab and pull out, you'll need a different latch. The latches are easy to unlatch. The secret is to never let the kids see how you open the cabinets.Neither of my kids ever successfully opened the cabinets these were installed on. At this point, they are much older and they have no interest in opening the cabinets, but they have never gotten in; and your guests will intuitively know how to open the drawers, unlike other locks like the Tot-lock.For very high risk drawers (for example, drawers that contain knives), I recommend Tot-lock. For ones you want to keep closed because the kids keep opening them and making a mess, these are perfectly fine._____________________UPDATE:  My kids are grown now, but the locks I installed so many years ago on two of my cabinets are still going strong.  One on a drawer has fallen off.  That one did not have a good surface to adhere to in the first place.  It's been seven years.  I'll say that's a pretty good record.	
- 1	I had the unit before and we loved it. But this one started leaking from the bottom after a few days of use. I might just have gotten a defective product but some of the reviews indicated the same issue as I was having	
1. 	We love Philips Avent bottles and nipples. They are easy to use and easy to clean. It was easy to switch my son from Dr. Browns to this.	
- 1	These stuck to our windows okay (even in winter in Utah), but they hardly provided any shade. We returned them for something else. I wouldn't recommend them.	
1. 	Jersey knit hits the spot with babies, and this goes above and beyond! Not only is it cute and a good quality sheet, it is SO SOFT!I want sheets like this! Even after multiple washings it fits great and is soft to the touch!	
1. 	I read a lot of the other lower reviews about it being over priced, it's just a step stool or the grip is bad or it tips over...........Did you buy the same product?This is a clean looking great stool with good traction and easy to use for little onesIt's a trusted brand which I would highly recommendWhen you pay a little more you get better quality	
1. 	Great child safety product, easy to install, not noticeable behind furniture.  Great price for the great product you get. Would recommend to any one even bought some for family.	
1. 	I am so glad that we decided to get the video monitor! This is convenient to use, and it is wonderful to be able to turn on the monitor when my son makes a noise and see if he is awake or just rolling around. The picture quality is surprisingly good in both light and dark, and the sound quality is good when there is no static. Static is a problem sometimes, but instead of carrying the device around with me, I have located a couple of static-free areas of my home and set it up there, and it works like a charm. The battery life is not particularly good, but the device does plug in as well, and so it hasn't been much of an issue. Overall, very pleased with the purchase.  This item retails for $179, so if you find it cheaper (like here), it's worth the money!	
1. 	I have a number of different sized windows (sash, new plastic type windows) in my baby's room and I installed these on each window - two on the wider/larger window. Easy to install and works well. Even when I open a window and forget they are on the window, they stop me opening the window too far.Just follow the instructions, to make sure the wedge is secure. Can be easily repositioned.	
- 1	Pissed is an understatement.  I purchased these bottles to decrease the amount of air that my daughter was sucking in and these bottles came highly recommended.  The first set I purchased began to leak from the bottom and from around the cap so I thought it was a bad batch and exchanged them for another set.  Last night while I was feeding my daughter I am thinking that she is drinking the milk but it was leaking from the side of the cap and down into her neck and onesie on this new set!  I switched bottles and gave her another one.  This morning I shake the bottle over the sink to make sure that the rice and breastmilk are mixed in good before feeding her and the cap which I just checked just popped off and breastmilk went flying all over the sink.  6 ounces of milk just gone!  These bottles leak from the bottom and after many uses the ring around the cap warps so it doesn't screw on and stay flush with the bottle itself.  I am done at this point and these bottles are going back to BRU and I am going to do what I should have done in the beginning and just go with Dr. Brown's bottles.  I would never recommend these crappy bottles to anyone!	
1. 	Yes, sometimes it overheats the bottle if you don't take it out as soon as it's done, but it gets the job done quickly and easily.  And at this price, I was able to buy a warmer for both grandparents' houses.	
- 1	The socks are not stretchy, hard to put on baby's feet.Rattle's sound is so discreet, I can hardly hear it.	
- 1	This product is terrible- I would not recommend it.We bought this to use on our back windshield, to help my poor 4 month old son not have the sun in his eyes during our 1/2 hour morning drive.1) We have a very small (old style Honda Civic) car.  When this was stretched to its largest size, it only blocked a tiny portion of sun. I can't imagine how ridiculous it would be in a larger vehicle.2) More importantly, in a 20 minute drive we had to pull over 4 times to re-suction this to the window.  We almost ended up with a soaked passenger seat because the thing sounds like a gunshot when it flies off the window.3)  We tried suctioning it without stretching it the whole way, and without stretching it at all, and it didn't make a difference, it still didn't stay put.All of that being said, we got our money back.	
- 1	I thought these would come in handy for my 6 month old twin boys but found that these are not that useful mainly because they are not that solid.  They come apart very very easily so a baby can remove them when they are linked together.  They are able to do it without even trying unlike the sassy ring of links which are sturdier and much more worth it.  They are cheap and you get lots of them but you end up with lots of rings that aren't very useful.	
- 1	This mattress contains Polyurethane, a toxic chemical that can cause asthma and maybe even SIDS! The studies are not completely conclusive, but there is a connection between Polyurethane and SIDS. Better be safe than sorry - don't purchase a foam mattress which contains Polyurethane! This chemical is used in many mattresses and even other furniture - but the last place you want to find this chemical in is a baby crib! What a shame that this chemical is used even for baby mattresses, that makes me sick. As soon as I unpacked this mattress, it smelled like &#34;plastic&#34;, which is never a good sign.	
- 1	I bought these for all purpose baby clean up (burp cloths, general baby facial mishaps, etc.). When I removed them from their package I immediately noticed how flimsy they are. They also shed large amounts of lint.  I was afraid to wash them, so decided to simply return them.  I can't imagine using these for their intended purpose! Linty poopy baby butt!	
1. 	I use this organizer all the time!! It holds my Avent bottles perfectly.  It has a place for everything!!  I do have leaks somethings but thats only when I don't hang it over the side of the sink (duh, right).  It also doesn't take up that much space on my kitchen counter.**update**My baby is now 7.5 months old and I still use this organizer! She is now learning how to use the sippy cup and it fits on here perfectly as well!  I put the valves in the little valve basket!  I still give this bottle organizer 5 stars!!	
- 1	These are not made for toddlers who like to throw stuff on the floor...the day I bought this, my daughter dropped it from her chair and it broke into pieces..not kid friendly...1 star for cute design	
- 1	First off, DO NOT use this seat in booster mode. It does not position the seat belt in the correct way and is actually dangerous to use.Aside from that, this seat is notorious in child safety circles for being very difficult to install securely, and even more difficult to get the correct incline level.It will be a struggle every time you need to move it, and even then you may not get it quite in the right spot.There are many, many different seats out there at this price point that are much easier to use correctly.I am giving it two stars only because *if* you can get it installed correctly, it will contain your child in an accident as long as you are in harnessed mode. Of course, that should be true of any seat, and almost all will be easier to install correctly than this beast!	
- 1	We don't use this brush frequently, we mostly wash our bottles in the dishwasher.  Despite this the brush still broke at the next after 4 mos.  I knew it was coming because around 3 mos, the brush was already bent and wouldn't stay straight when you applied slight pressure.I would recommend a brush that does not have a twisted metal neck.  There are other brands out there that fit this description.	
- 1	The suction cups ripped out of the fabric of this thing within 2 weeks of use.  The over the top section (it comes in two parts) is more or less useless and doesn't offer elbow/forearm support like the picture implies.  That being said, the kneeler itself is great and doesn't slide, but you can buy a less expensive kneeler that does the same!	
- 1	I got this off Ebay brand new in a box for $130, including shipping. I thought it was a steal, since the asking price is around $219. When it arrived, I was quickly disappointed.Cons:1. THE SEAT DOESN'T SIT UP! Not even close. There was no way my 2 year-old would have sat in it. (The B-Agile doesn't sit up all the way either, but this is a lot more reclined than that! We are talking about a good 6-8 inches difference when my son was sitting all the way up to where the seat back was.)2. The tray, while a good size, is very thin, cheap plastic.3. They have the Summer Infant butterfly log on the side of the stroller. Mine was already coming off on one side. They are just stickers.4. The fold is weird. They tried to make it like the City Mini or B-Agile, but instead of a one handed pull in the seat, you twist the handle bar and push with your hand down to the ground. YOU CANNOT HOLD A CHILD A DO THIS. The fold is also not very flat.5. The fabric felt VERY cheap.6. It is a very open stroller. My son could lean all the way over the side.7. I liked the idea of adjustable leg rest, but when it was all the way down, there was barely any room for my kid's feet on the foot rest. Maybe an inch of room.8. The seat width is very narrow. Good for shopping aisles, bad for a growing child. Maybe 11 inches across.9. The recline is supposed to be a strap recline. It's more of a string recline. VERY CHEAP.Pros:1. It does have a flat or almost flat recline.2. There is a cup holder, but it won't hold more than a bottle of water or baby bottle. No coffee cups or fountain drinks. You can switch it to either side of the stroller.3. Canopy is a decent size.4. Can be a travel system.3. I liked the big peekaboo window with magnets, instead of Velcro.4. Adjustable leg rest.5. Comes with a child's tray and 2 parent pockets. (Although you might only fit a cell phone and keys in them. They are small.)6. The handlebar height seemed nice and I didn't kick the bar.7. Basket is a decent size.8. The brakes were nice and flip flop friendly.Bottom line:I sold mine immediately at a kid's resale store for about $60 just to make some of my money back. Skip this stroller. I am still just using my old Combi until I can find a better one. At most, they shouldn't be selling this stroller for anymore than maybe $89.99.	
- 1	Great little night light WHEN it works! Just stopped working after a few months.... very upset. Called Amazon and they replaced it but now how long will the new one last?! What a shame :(	
- 1	the qaulity sounds good but the cover is sillier then ever, its easy to remove and also hard to stick in hand,used it for a cup to drink	
1. 	This is a great idea and I can see how it would be convient to protect your seats but it doesnt work well if your seats in your car do not have a gap to slide the back of this into between the top and bottom part of the cars seat.  Otherwise good, my car seat base doesnt seem as solid with this under it.	
- 1	After 6 months working pretty well the monitor just die. I took it to different stores to try to fix it and nobody could do anything. I wasted almost $200 on this Motorola. I don't recommend this. It is cheaper and so much better to buy a camera system and now I can see my daughter on my cellphone every where I go, I can see her day or night and to listen perfectly clear even her breathing. Don't waste your money, go for something good.	
1. 	It works ok but flat bottom would have been better. Angled bottom doesn't work for my kid as my kid's bottom slides out anyway.	
1. 	We've not used this long, but I like it so far. It's lightweight and easy to attach to a chair. The slick plastic material is easy to clean off, and I love that it doesn't take up much space. Would be good for travel, too, I imagine.	
1. 	What a terrific invention!!  We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.  Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!  Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to snack on the go.My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can.  I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!	
1. 	Love this stroller!  It is a breeze to fold up, as well as it's pretty sturdy for an umbrella stroller.  We use this one when we travel, can gate check it at the airport.  It folds up very compactly, goes through the TSA x-ray machine no problem.  The sun shield is detachable, if you are travelling at the airport, would suggest to put that part in the suitcase, and then just take the stroller and the bag it comes with to the gate check.  The bag itself is durable, I don't think that you need to purchase a separate gate check bag, we have been on at least 6 airplanes now, it has withstood at least that many handlings.  It is lightweight and also has a little area on the the bottom to put some items.  I would suggest buying something that can go between the two handles so that you have more space to put things.  When we anticipate that we are going to go somewhere that is kinda bumpy through, we will take our BOB stroller, as this one doesn't have any suspension, and ride can be bumpy if you are not on a sidewalk/pavement.	
- 1	plastic melts in heat.  These are plastic, if you leave the oven door open for any amount of time the metal pin hinge in the cover conducts the heat from the oven and melts the hinge...	
- 1	Don't spend the extra $ on the light - It doesn't do anything.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product as I was really tired of the Velcro on my diaper bag waking up my baby every time I opened it.  The bad news, it doesn't work.  My bag does not stay closed with the strength of these magnets. Maybe if they were stronger... Bottom line, I'd rather have a bag that stays shut than a bag that is super quiet.	
1. 	I have bought 2 of these swings for my sister. 1 motor died after about 6 months and the other after about 4, (I know now that fisher price as a year warrenty and will replace motors for free up to a year no matter how much it is used) My sister did not know this though. She used her swing constantly her children even slept in them. The glob at the top is very fun and the seats seem comfortable. Her kids loved them. They have the 2 seat positons. My nephews enjoyed the craddle side to side swing the best. If it was not for the motor probs I would rate this 5 stars	
- 1	I bought these JJ Cole bibs a few months ago, loved them.  They were high quality waterproof with canvas backing.  sturdy, machine washable.  These are flimsy plastic, no canvas reinforcement, hand wash only, and sold AT THE SAME PRICE.  Returning both the bibs I purchased.	
1. 	I have Avent bottles, but don't have the Avent pump (so didn't get storage accessories).  Instead of buying a storage kit for $25, this plus the Avent Sealing discs (total cost of $10), gave me the storage bottles I needed.  It works very well and I would definitely recommend.	
1. 	We received a number of swaddles as gifs before the birth of our first child and this was hands down our favorite swaddle. We had a big baby and he thrashed around quite a bit but slept best when swaddled. While the aden and anais swaddles were very soft and had cute patters on them he almost always managed to break free. We also liked the Woombie swaddles in terms of keeping him in the swaddle, but the zipper went up really high and we worried about choking him. The Miracle blanket was the best of all worlds because the inner arm flaps kept his arms in place so that we could wrap the long outer strip really securely. Highly recommend!	
1. 	I got the 2-pack for my infant & 4 year olds' car seats to put in our Toyota Sienna. I LOVE that my cloth seat upholstery hasn't been ruined by messy little boys! The front flap w/pockets is nice for a little extra storage space (gloves & hats go great in here without taking up too much space!) and it protects the seats well from muddy little shoes.I'd agree that the back protector doesn't quite go up high enough, and it does slide around a bit when placed underneath a booster-style seat (that isn't anchored down with a LATCH system) but otherwise I'm happy with what I got for the purchase price.	
1. 	I LOVE this blanket and everytime someone sees it, they ask me about it.  I keep it in the car and we use it all the time.  Washing is fairly easy.  I put it in the machine but then air dry it as I don't think it would stand up to the dryer.  Great item!	
- 1	I was unable to use these as expected because of static.  One had low-level continuous static and the other had loud static.  It unnerved me listening through the static and I simply stopped trying to use them.This was a regrettable purchase, a waste of money.  I don't recommend this product.	
- 1	We purchased this gate to replace the First Years Hands-Free Gate when the foot pedal broke after 1.5 years of heavy use, however, we quickly returned it and got another hands-free gate.1) The weight of the bars on the extra-tall felt flimsy when compared to the hands-free. It just didn't feel sturdy. My son would pull on it in an attempt to enter the kitchen and you can see the bars give a little.2) The self-closing feature sounds like a good idea, but it slams shut making a really loud noise and if you're trying to direct your child out of the room, you have to make sure you hold it open for them and it doesn't slam in their face when they decide to change directions.3) The latch on the gate we got was very sticky. It took two hands and quite some force before it would open. Upon investigation, we think the self-closing mechanism at the bottom of the gate caused this problem because it wouldn't let you lift it high enough to unlatch smoothly. It seemed as if it was in the way and prevented the gate from lifting. This was a problem since we used our gate between the kitchen and the living room so if we needed to rush in between either room, it was very frustrating trying to get the gate open.4) This gate did come with extensions so that is a deal if you need them to fit your doorway.In the end issues #2 and 3 was enough trouble to make us go back and buy the hands-free gate again.	
- 1	Looks a lot better than it is.  It only comes with that little bee and the mirror.  Plus it is small and feels flimsy.  We didn't really use it for long - just wasn't something we liked.	
1. 	These are really great if your kid kicks off the blankets, then wakes up because he's cold. They are roomy enough for them to move around in, and sized generously. My son outgrew the small size by 6 months (29&#34;), and I skipped the medium size entirely and went right to a large, which he will be in for several more months.	
- 1	The only good things I can say about this crib is, it's pretty and it's strudy.  Other then that I'm unhappy with it.  When they say espresso on the website what they need to add is cherry.  It's not on the crib box but it's on the bed rail box.  Espresso CHERRY, I wish I would have looked at the bed rail box first before we put the crib up.  The whole time we put it up I was thinking I must be crazy cause it looks cherry.  I have to return the espresso changing table I bought, it doesn't match the crib and its easier to ship.  The only changing piece they have to match the crib is a dresser and it's too big for our nursery.  So now I have to look around for a changing table that matches since Delta doesn't have one. I realize I should have stopped putting it together.  However we already had all the packing material torn off and bent up in a garage bag.  I will know better next time.  Again, I didn't read the bed rail box to confirm my thoughts until the crib was up.There are also minor dents in the crib.  Hardly noticable but since I cared enough to write a review they need to be mentioned.  Being that the crib is brand new it is discourging to have dents in it already.  So the two stars are for the fact that it is a pretty and strudy crib. The lack of the three stars is for the espresso CHERRY finish, the dents, and the fact that they managed to upset a pregnant woman whom just doesn't get upset.UPDATE... Carters Manchester changing table in dark cherry matches this crib.	
1. 	We received this carrier as a gift off our baby registry. I looked at reviews of other models (including the regular, non-active Baby Bjorn) and inspected those available at Babies R Us, so we sort of knew what to expect.  This baby carrier is awesome!!!  I would definitely give it as a gift.  My daughter is now about 23 lbs, and I recently carried her around in the Baby Bjorn through a museum exhibition (sum total with entry, exit, etc. almost 2 hours), and I felt great, and she really enjoyed herself.  I was a little nervous since we are nearing the weight limit (26 lbs), but it really worked out quite well, and it was easy to move through the exhibit.  Note I am not particularly physcially fit, strong, or tall, and I find this carrier quite comfortable.  We have used this for longs walks; in urban areas and stores where strollers are difficult/impossible to manuver; and we plan to use it on an upcoming flight to board the plane.  My husband also seems to really like it  -- he volunteers to wear it when we go places.It took me a little bit to figure out how to use the carrier.  I read the directions, but you almost need to see it on someone first to see how everything connects (I had only seen the empty store models...). One you get it, you're good to go and you won't have future issues, but just be aware before you use it the first time that you may need to lay it all out to get it figured out and fastened (practice *without* your baby); don't get your tiny baby all ready and expect to figure it out instantly when you pull it out of the box (although if you can, great!).  Also, once you start to carry your baby, the directions advise you to practice with your baby to help build up his/her ride tolerance.  I did this by carrying ours around the house for short spurts of time.  It might help to have someone with you (to help hold the baby while you get the carrier on) the first couple of times you use it, although I did not.Although our daughter now walks, this carrier is **very** convenient for certain settings, and I will be sorry when we outgrow it!Note: Some other reviews have mentioned Ergo baby carriers - I learned about these only after I registered for this one (it was not available at Babies R Us), and cannot say which is better, as I don't know others with one. I do know someone with the regular/non-active Bjorn, and from the get-go (&lt;3 mos) she was wishing that she had the active version with more support.	
- 1	I do not like this product at all.  It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience.  My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in.  I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him.  I do not recommend this product.	
1. 	The first time I purchased these bags off Amazon they were $2.99.  CHEAP.  Recently, I needed more and they were more than twice that price.  But, for 200 of these bags, it's still cheaper than Walmart where you get 50 for $9.99 AND other baggies on the market are so much more flimsy.  So worth it!  I use these bags instead of a Diaper Geenie, and they are wonderful.  No smell.  SO WORTH IT!	
- 1	Would have rated it higher if:1. They were pre-folded smaller...I can fold them up myself but they just get smushed in my bag, when they're already creased from packaging they tend to retain the original shape better.2. The two teenie adhesive stickers on it are awful! Might as well just make one big strip. I couldn't even find them, they're just two small stickers that don't serve much point. I wanted them to replace &#34;PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.)&#34; which are no longer available (THOSE were fabulous).So...it'll do the job, but they're still crummy.	
- 1	They came on time and we're very cute and brightly colored. The only problem I had was that I bought them to teach my daughter where her hands and feet were and the rattles in these were literally non existent. So she had absolutely no interest in having them on and got very bored with them very quick.Note to manufacturer:Make them with louder rattles so babies will actually be interested in them for more than two seconds	
- 1	these items we purchased we needed because the old ones got lost. i remember the old ones where much stronger and well made. i think these are a knock off or bootleg the quality looks bad	
- 1	I bought this because it was water-filled and green-sprouts/i-play's website said their products are designed in the USA. Designed does NOT equal made though. The product was made in China. It's so hard to find teethers not made in China. I might be returning this.	
- 1	I purchased this product while I was pregnant.... But the time my baby grew into it, I tried to put it on her and the rise snap doesn't work. The diaper is completely useless now. Obviously they don't inspect their products before they send them out,	
1. 	I love this and got tons of use out of it.  I am just sorry that my daughter outgrew it so quickly.  I used it to keep her in bed with me when she was first born and I was nursing. I also travelled with it and she slept in it in hotels, or at my friends homes.  It was so much easier than hauling the pack n play.  Once my baby was able to roll around I didn't feel comfortable using it.	
1. 	We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it	
1. 	This is everything it is stated to be.  It is tall but comes in handy as the children grow up and are able to reach higher. The biggest plus is the metal construction.  Have accidentally run into these baby gates in the middle of the night and the all metal construction has saved it more than once.  The wood frame style if torqued will split and break at the bottom.  This is a stylish gate and the few plastic parts blend in well.  Easily fits in our 36&#34; door opening with an extension to spare.  The screw out door anchors have rubber style pads that prevent slipping and damage to the door frame (even if it is knocked down).  Easy to setup and sets firmly in place.  Only a &#34;mindless&#34; adult will be able to knock it over.	
- 1	We have a comparably priced Summer Infant video monitor, but we have had to purchase a second remote device (the hand-held device with the screen) because the remote has been dropped so much. When the opportunity to try this one came up, I jumped on the idea! We have our iPhones and iPads handy almost all the time, so it sounded ideal...Not so much.Summary: Setup was easy. Video is lack-luster, sound is meh and crackly. The internet aspect slows things down from the moment you try to log on. Quality and user experience are severely limited by the Internet involvement.Setup:Software: App install was quick and easy.Camera: Set up was annoying but not terrible. You have to make an account on their server, even if you only want to stream within your own house. And then you have to configure the camera for your network (which involves the camera starting its own default network, you joining that network with your phone, configuring the camera to join your network then switching back to your network with your phone). That went well and the instructions were very clear.Login: I find it takes forever for the app to log me in. It's annoying and unnecessary. It also means that you cannot run it exclusively locally even if you want to. If you lose internet, you probably lose the baby monitor. (I did not test this, personally.)Video: The video quality on this camera is poorer than the Summer Infant one. The night vision works, but it makes the room and crib look hazy, like a dark, smokey bar. (Summer Infant's makes it look like surveillance tape, but it's clearer and easier to discern what's what.) Both cameras use infrared LEDs for night vision.During the day, it's ok, but still not as clear as the Summer Infant camera.The picture looked much better on the phones than the tablets - the resolution isn't there for larger images. The zoom is digital, so it's not actually useful (same pixels, just larger!). Switching between high and low quality made no visible difference.Sound: I could not get rid of the crackly static noise from the camera. I tried different rooms, different angles...Also, I could not get the push-to-talk to work.There is a slight delay - maybe 2 beats - in sound and video.Controls: There's definitely a delay between pressing the button to move the camera and the camera moving.Loss of connection: If the camera loses connection, the device you're monitoring on will beep. Loudly. It's a nice beep - like an industrial elevator beep - but still quite loud. Just what you don't want to hear in the middle of the night, right?We did try connecting from offsite and that was easy if also slow. Video was very clunky at that point.Plus it's expensive.The room temperature display is kind of neat, but not nearly enough to make up for the short-comings.Conclusion: There are more tests we could have done but this small amount of testing turned up enough clunkiness that we decided this wasn't for us.	
1. 	The table itself is great...sturdy and matches all the other furniture we bought.  The changing pad is not the best and has torn thru the screw down mechanism to keep it in place.  There is a lot of storage room for diapers and other essentials which I love.  Now that my son is 8 months old I still use it to change his diapers (his feet hang off the edge though) but the bottom has become a bookshelf which is great.  I also like how my son faces me instead of laying sideways while I change his diaper (however I have been peed on...lol).  If there was a better pad and cover to go with this I would have given it 5 stars.	
1. 	I used these with evenflo and medela bottles for storing and freezing pumped breastmilk.  They worked great!  I recommend for pumping and storage.	
- 1	We have a Britax convertible car seat which is huge but it fit perfectly. It's simply a bag that makes it easy to transport your car seat and keep it clean. The back pack straps are a cool feature and we liked that it had wheels, however; we are returning it. When we first used it, the zipper broke and the teeth pulled a part which added to the stress of flying with an infant for the first time.We're going to try to search for another brand that our car seat may fit in. If we can't find one, we'll just use the big plastic bags the airline can provide to put it in.	
- 1	This was comfortable for about a month, then started getting smashed down. By the end of my pregnancy, it was lumpy and flat, and there is no way it would last through more than one. The size was great but the quality was not.	
- 1	These outlet covers are a complete waste of money. They are perfectly designed for little fingers to pull out.  My daughter has an easier time pulling these out than my husband and the tab sticks out in a way that makes pulling it out tempting for her. Bare outlets would be safer.	
1. 	Better than most. We send these off to daycare as they are cheap and we do not care if they get lost. Solid bib.	
1. 	great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under 2 in. The template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth.overall pretty sturdy	
1. 	I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over.  It was especially great while traveling.  At some point functionality takes over style.  This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else.  It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly.  Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should.	
- 1	As plates, they're just fine. The 4th compartment is miniscule and not really useful. The main reason I gave it two stars is because they don't stack flush in the cupboard. So while they're fine for eating, they're terrible to store. I can only stack them 6 high before running out of space.	
1. 	I've been using this carrier since my daughter was about one week old.  It supports her head just fine, and she usually falls asleep in it, making it possible for me to take the dog for a walk, go to the mailbox, or do a load of laundry, things I could NEVER do with a baby who won't be put down!  It took a few tries to get good at putting her in and taking her out, and I wish the adjustable straps had somewhere to go after tightening, because there is a lot of extra strap just flopping around my legs.  But all in all, this was one of the better purchases we made.	
- 1	My little one didn't like using the sippy cup spout and we ended up using the bottle only twice b/c she was EBF.  Oh well, at least it was a great price.  You might find success if your little one is on a bottle more often and/or likes a harder spout.	
- 1	cheapest made rack in the history of all racks.  It was difficult to even connect it because for some reason the customer has to assemble this tiny rack from 6 pieces it arrives in  (?!) and the parts didn't fit quite well.  A very disappointing product for this brand.	
- 1	My now 2 month old was able to wiggle her arms out of both the bottom and the top of this every night because the material is so stretchy and does not do a good job holding her arms down. One time when she wiggled her arms out of the bottom opening, the small velcro tabs got pushed up to her chin/jaw line since she was bringing her hands to face and she got scratched pretty badly from turning her head side to side and rubbing on rough velcro! I wish I could upload the picture! Not a happy mom when I saw that in the morning!!	
1. 	This is huge, but a really  nice change table to put on your bathroom counter if you don't have any room for more furniture in your house. It's really convenient to change baby right by running water too.	
1. 	These are gorgeous blocks. They are very well made and something I will hang on to that'll be passed to my grandchildren when the time comes. I realize the price isn't what you might pay for some blocks, but these are definitely not the cheapo junk you typically find everywhere nowadays. Even my 30+ year old set of blocks weren't as nice as these. I don't mind paying for this kind of quality and craftsmanship, and I just wish there were more toys for kids on the market that are this well made.	
1. 	I have tried many pads before settling on these. I just ordered 2 packs. They are soft, the lanolin treatment does make a difference and they hold leaking quite well!	
1. 	I really like these furniture anchors, and this is my second time to order this product.The pieces that attach to the wall and the piece of furniture are the same, so you don't have to worry about putting the &#34;right&#34; piece in the right place. They're not too big, so I've never found a problem attaching them to furniture, even the storage cubes from ClosetMaid. The &#34;zip ties&#34; that attach the anchors are strong, but can be released so you can use them again. I also like that you can adjust the distance allowed from the wall. We end up with cords and plugs behind furniture, and it helps a lot to be able to adjust for those things.The only thing I don't like is the screws. The heads seem to strip very easily. But we've moved a lot the past few years, so mine have had a lot of wear and tear. I'll keep using the same brackets, I'll just end up buying a box of screws at the hardware store to replace the ones that came with this set.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product - I've purchased two sets - and the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is the screws.	
1. 	I use every day. More so for the baby to sit than for nursing. The strap is also very useful, something that a Boppy doesn't have.	
- 1	The plastic is thin and flimsy and the zipper at the top constantly keeps getting stuck. It is a large backpack can carry lunch box other things easily.	
1. 	There is not a large selection first of all for this kind of product on Amazon. However, after seeing and trying out other brands I know that this one is the more favorable one.PROS: Easy to install, i.e. did it with my daughter watching me and trying to &#34;help&#34; within three minutes while not reading the directions. Parts do not hang into the toilet..gross. Easy to unlatch even with one hand, does not interfere with the actual use of the toilet. =), My toots can not figure how to open the lid, thus she now leaves it alone!CONS: Does leave a small amount of space, that if your child was very determined, might be able to slid you smart phone or small set of keys in. But this has to be a very determined child. Still kinda gross having this stuck to the toilet bowl, but a better choice compared with the other brand that stick more into the toilet and are hard to use.	
- 1	I just returned this item.Amazon didn't tell you this item is not microwaveable (and I have to say I didn't go through the many user comments). We are going to a daycare, so I don't want to take chances as I have no control who is working on warming up the food and how they are going to do it. Plus, this item is made in China (which we don't trust their quality control). While it is dishwasher safe, it is not microwaveable. It just doesn't make sense to me. It is better to be safe than sorry.	
1. 	First purchased a cheaper clip on chair from Walmart but immediately returned it as it was flimsy and the material was very cheap.  This clip on booster is a nice canvas material that wipes clean very easily and can also be taken off the frame completely and thrown in the washer/dryer.  I have actually just put it in a sink full of warm soapy water several times and then either hung outside to dry or put in the dryer for a quick run.  It dries super quick!!It clips securely to most tables as long as there is no obstructions (such as butterfly style table extensions) and despite other reviews, it does get right up close to the edge of the table.  Food can fall before it makes it to your babies mouth of course, but I cutdown on that by adding a table mat with tray (Tiny Diner Placemat) and bib with pouch (Tommee Tippee Explora Easy Roll Bib).  When my baby was smaller and just starting to eat solids I had to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind her to position her a little more close to the table, not a problem and actually good that it will allow for growth and use for quite a while as she contnues to grow.  I actually don't have a problem with the steaps and sometimes don't even use them, my child does not try to climb out.  Although, I don't put her in the chair unless it's time to eat and we are sitting together anyways.  Children should not be left unattended anyways.I have used this chair at restaurants and as long as it's a sturdy table, it's not a problem.  It folds easily and travels nicely.It is nice to have your child sitting at the table as part of the family and not off to the side like an appendage and takes up no extra room in the eating area.  Just like a chair at the table and promotes family eating together.Would definitely recommend and can't beat the price.  Have never used another highchair for my daughter and glad I didn't get a big bulky regular high chair or on the seat booster.	
- 1	I bought 4 of these bottles for my son I tried a couple of different bottles for my son. I know not all kid's are the smae so your child might like them but I had to get rid of them. My son took 45 min or more to drink 6 ounces out them when he only took about 20 min to drink out of the Avent stage one nipple even. I also tried using these at a day care I worked at and other babies had the same problem the nipple on them is to firm so it takes longer for the baby to suck milk out and by the time they are done their jaw is tired. If you like the nipple shape and design the playtex nurser works like a dream with the Multi Flow nipples. Avent bottles are awsome too.	
- 1	I registered for this item before my son was born because I was a nervous first-time mom who, like many, was terrified of SIDS.  I wanted to make sure that my baby would be safely positioned on his back and would not inadvertently roll over during the night.  What nobody told me was that my baby would not roll over as a young infant (because he simply was not strong enough yet), and that he would also wiggle around in a sleep positioner and end up in a very different place than where I left him.I used the sleep positioner in a bassinet right next to our bed, and I frequently found my baby scrunched up at the bottom of the positioner against the base of the bassinet.  Once, I found him with his head hanging precariously over the top edge.  After that, I took the sleep positioner out of the bassinet.  I used it for a grand total of 6 weeks.  Knowing what I know now, I don't think I will be using it for my next child.  I know now that my young infant will be able to stay on his/her back without artificial aids.  I know now that babies slide down inclined surfaces.  And I know now that the SIDS Alliance recommends NOT using sleep positioners in your child's crib.  So I would recommend passing on the sleep positioners (unless instructed otherwise by your pediatrician), and making sure your child's sleeping environment is as safe as possible.	
- 1	I have no idea how so many people can like these crappy, cheaply made cuts. The handles and bottom of the cup spin around and around the cup itself, so my daughter can never get a steady grip on it. The plastic itself is thin and seems cheap. I found something better at WalMart, and I loath that place.	
- 1	My son is to big for it, wish it came in different sizes to much of a hassle to return it since I'm half way across the world	
- 1	Pissed is an understatement.  I purchased these bottles to decrease the amount of air that my daughter was sucking in and these bottles came highly recommended.  The first set I purchased began to leak from the bottom and from around the cap so I thought it was a bad batch and exchanged them for another set.  Last night while I was feeding my daughter I am thinking that she is drinking the milk but it was leaking from the side of the cap and down into her neck and onesie on this new set!  I switched bottles and gave her another one.  This morning I shake the bottle over the sink to make sure that the rice and breastmilk are mixed in good before feeding her and the cap which I just checked just popped off and breastmilk went flying all over the sink.  6 ounces of milk just gone!  These bottles leak from the bottom and after many uses the ring around the cap warps so it doesn't screw on and stay flush with the bottle itself.  I am done at this point and these bottles are going back to BRU and I am going to do what I should have done in the beginning and just go with Dr. Brown's bottles.  I would never recommend these crappy bottles to anyone!	
- 1	I wish I had researched these a bit more carefully before I bought them. I was sucked in by the cute contrast stitching and organic material. However once I washed them for the first time I realized I had wasted my money. Let's face it, the price isn't cheap for only five cloths. When you first receive them they are super soft and the perfect size but after one wash (on delicate, with baby detergent, and dried on low) they were pilley, paper thin, and had shrunk to a size that is way too small to be effective. Yes, I suppose you could delicately hand wash them and line dry them, but is this really going to get something clean that you are using to absorb baby spit up and drool, I don't think so. I would NOT recommend these!!!	
1. 	My son spits up after he is fed and he is a heavy drooler. I was using terry cloth bibs and they worked, but would soaked after a few minutes and then it would soak into his clothes. I was changing his bib and cloths about every 30 minutes to prevent a rash. I bought these hoping they would help and they do! My son will spit up or drool all over these and his clothes stay dry. I still have to change the bib after about an hour, but that's far better than having to change his clothes too. Plus he stays dry so I don't have to worry about a rash.The velcro is a little rough, and I'll never understand why a manufacturer would make the roughest (hook) side face the skin, but you can always just put the bib on backwards so the loop side is facing the baby's skin. That way if it's not completely covered it will not rub the roughest part on their skin.I do wish the terry cloth part of this was a little thicker, but otherwise I love these and have purchased 2 sets.	
- 1	I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse.  The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first, now she is on all bottles). I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too.  Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher.  I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft, smaller,  more like the breast, they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in, easy to clean and most important, her gas problem was greatly reduced.  The downside is the cost of the liners. I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem	
- 1	We bought this monitor to use in our son's room, we were looking for something good, but also something that wouldn't break the bank.  After reading so many positive reviews I was so excited to get this product home.  Initially I thought it was going to be good, but then we started noticing things about it that we didn't like.1. Cheap and flimsy plastic- so cheap in fact that the camera seems like it will tip over with the lightest touch2. The Camera won't tilt up and down, only side to side, this sucked because we had a hard time getting the right angle3. The electrical cords are very short, very inconvenient because the battery life on the unit is short, so I needed to keep it plugged in all night, which is fine except the closest outlet caused the cord to stretch, and was easy to trip over. The cords couldn't be more than 3-4 feet long.4. Battery life on the monitor is short, you will constantly be charging this thing.5. Lastly, I found the constant on and off of the volume to be so irritatingSo yes, it was easy to set up, and cheap, but it is crap.  We returned it and bought a Motorola one, which is far superior to this one.  We actually got it at BJ's Wholesale Club, and only paid $130 for it, its like $180 on Amazon.	
- 1	I was so excited to find a decorative play mat that would match our home decor.  We put it down and then took it up within a week because it shows dirt and footprints and every little thing too badly for our active family.  They are now sitting in the garage collecting dust.	
1. 	I live in a townhouse that has 3 levels and I can't keep a diaper genie on each floor.  These bags really do the job.  They are scented just fine and lock in smell. They are perfect for traveling especially to someone's home.  By carrying these in your diaper bag, they won't even know you disposed of a diaper in their home. They could be priced a little better and come in a container instead of a box.	
1. 	I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it. Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it. He LOVES it, and calls it his boat. It is really sturdy. it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time. If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!	
- 1	Thought this was going to be the &#34;aweome sippy&#34; i have been looking for, but i am sadly mistaken.The idea is neat... but the actual usage is just not. Its hard to drink out of, even for me... once you do drink out of it, it came out weird, and giving the fact the top is all solid color, you cant see when the fluid is coming or what you are drinking. My husband and I both had a problem with that as did my 2 year old.Going back. I love avent bottles but this cup just didnt cut it.	
1. 	I bought the SnuggleNest because my preemie son seemed overwhelmed by the size of his crib, and would fuss alot when I would put him down.  I didn't want him to get used to sleeping in the bassinet portion of the Pack 'N Play, so I bought this to use in his crib.  My son goes to sleep now with minimal fussing, because he no longer feels like he is sleeping in a big crib.	
- 1	Love the company but this trainer does not fit a round toilet and seat. (We have a Toto with a Bemis seat.) This is not entirely clear in the product description, so I hope this review helps others avoid the hassle of ordering and returning.	
- 1	My 7-month-old received this as a gift and we both love it. It's sturdy enough for her to pull herself up on easily and it's the perfect height for standing and playing. She's not too interested in rolling the balls yet but she loves all of the songs, lights, and buttons. We've had it for two weeks and so far the sounds haven't driven me totally crazy, probably because there's so many of them so it doesn't get too repetitive. The Circle, triangle, diamond, square - they all make a happy pair song does irritate me a bit every time I hear it since four items do not, in fact, make a pair, but other than that most of the songs are pretty tolerable.In any case, this toy is currently the only way I can get anything done while my daughter is awake, so it's a winner in my book. I'd imagine that as she gets older the educational aspects of it will be helpful too. It has pretty much all of your preschool bases covered: colors, shapes, the alphabet, etc. Heck, it even has them in Spanish. I can't recommend this table highly enough!UPDATE 1: I have to remove a star after an incident today. My daughter got the tip of her finger caught between the page of the book and the yellow light-up button as she was using that hand to steady herself while trying to sit down on the floor. Thankfully I was right there and got her unstuck quickly but she still really smushed her finger and was clearly in a lot of pain. I definitely wouldn't let a baby play with this unsupervised!UPDATE 2: After 2.5 months of use, the electronics have gone haywire. It started having occasional audio glitches about a month ago and it's gotten progressively worse until today the thing stopped working altogether. Now when I turn it on it just makes a buzzing sound and none of the buttons do anything. This is a real bummer, my daughter loves the sounds and lights and I thought she would get a lot more use out of it :(	
- 1	This is excellent in regards to a child. The fan is soft so if any little hands grab it (which happened right away) it doesn't hurt. She actually thought it was fun.The down side is that it doesn't clip on a stroller properly. Part of the battery area keeps it from getting a proper hold so it slids around and doesn't stay where we aim it. It is also a glossy plastic so there is no grip. We ended up clipping it onto the canopy as that is the only place it will stay. While we aren't too disappointed, we wish we had gone with a different option and defintely would not recommend this to someone else.	
1. 	Great product.  I love this and haven't had a problem changing my son yet.  The wipes are always nice and warm.  The only problem I have is the sponge thing on the bottem.  You are suppose to get it from drying out but I had a hard time keep it moist.  So I threw mine out and it still works for me.	
- 1	This montior does work well. I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. It works outside, upstairs and down. The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive.	
- 1	I purchased this seat when my baby outgrew his Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat.  I bought this seat because it is rated #1 on Consumer Reports and it has the highest rating in the crash test category.  Early on, I thought it was much harder to tighten and loosen the straps compared to the Chicco Keyfit.  But the real problem (and reason I returned this seat) was that my baby was so uncomfortable in it.  Almost immediately, he cried a lot in this seat, which he never did in the Keyfit.  I exchanged this car seat for a Britax Marathon 70, which tightens and loosens much more easily (and similiarly to the Keyfit).  My baby hasn't cried in the Britax seat since he's been in it.  While the Evenflo Triumph car seat is highly rated and well priced, I would not recommend it because it is hard to adjust and most of all, my baby was so unhappy in it.	
- 1	The concept of this is amazing! I was so excited to give it a try. Try was all I did, however, because it was not as expected. The tray is 4 pieces that snap together and its flimsy at best. The snap together sections leave openings which pinched my daughter's arm. Also, the foam insert felt cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled by the thickness of the Bumbo but this foam part falls out and was very thin. I returned it.	
- 1	I had this carrier and could only use it for maybe 30 min, at that is a stretch, without it killing my back. And that was with a 8lb baby! I have an ergo and wow! What a difference! So much better for baby's hips and the back. I can wear my daughter for hours without any pain and my daughter weighed more and you can use the ergo for up to like 50lbs (can't remember the details). It's worth the extra $30- trust me!	
- 1	This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!! Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully! She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!) she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!! If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!! It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!! Should've gone with this from the beginning.....	
- 1	All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a fluke.  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.	
1. 	I love this mobile. The contrast in colors are fantastic and is just what babies are interested in looking at. My son loves looking at the characters and would often stop him from crying when I turn it on.The song plays long enough, although I sometimes have to crank it a 2nd time before my son falls asleep. And there is also a mechanism to stop the mobile if needed for those nights when the baby falls asleep fast.	
- 1	If I weren't so lazy and hadn't destroyed the packing when opening these toys, I would have returned them.  I got these for a one-year old who loves to push buttons.  The only one of these toys she can &#34;work&#34; is the remote.  The other two toys have flat push buttons which she can not do - but even my three-year old has difficulty with those.  Very disappointed in these.	
1. 	We have purchased it when our son was about 7 months old, using the audio monitor before. I guess the price of it was the main thing that kept me from buying it.Now I'm thinking I should have done it right from the moment my son was born. It is absolutely a great idea to have one, as it saves you a lot of time and effort just to look into monitor versus guess work of what was this sound - just a stir? Or going into the  room to check on baby and waking him up.It works fairly good along our wireless network, and lots of other different-frequency equipment, the only spot I have problems sometimes is in my bedroom which was built out of the crawl space underneath the garage - so it is mostly concrete walls there.But still I get a decent picture.The only tip  - if your baby is always sleeping in the darkened room - you might as well buy a black and white one, as the picture is always going to be in nightshot anyways.The bigger screen is a plus too, considering the fact that you're going to watch the whole crib and the picture is going to be pretty small.	
- 1	i received a slow flow rate bottle, which is too slow for my son. there is no description on the website telling us it is a slow rate bottle. i opt to buy a new nipple, it will cost me another 7 bucks. in total i will spend almost 20 bucks just for a bottle. can you believe it?	
- 1	This item cost me $10.00 I wish I would have been able to try it before buying it. Very disappointed with the product, It actually had some good reviews so I was very excited to buy it and hopefully make bath time more fun (by keeping the water out of my child's face) and unfortunately this product does not do that.	
1. 	My 3 month old likes to be held a lot and this is a life saver! I can walk (not sit, but that's my baby for you) around doing things and she will be happy looking around and/or will fall asleep in the carrier. My back hurts if I carry her in it too long though. I probably should have considered the one with a waist strap even though it's bulkier since I have back issues. Doesn't bug my husband though. The worst part is when I'm out with her in it and I have to take her out to put her in her car seat. It's hard to not wake her up (and she hates her car seat).	
- 1	inconvenient and thus useless -- i used it once (it was irritating to put on) -- i removed after the sun was no longer shining through the window (so that my kid can see better) and it was difficult to store and then got dirty and i never used it again.useless!	
- 1	this nasal aspirator is a waste of money, doesnt work for us.Like another reviewer said, I wish I could give this 0 stars.For me the best nasal aspirator is the most simple, a pigeon manual aspirator.If you want an advice, dont waste your money on this! Is a very weak aspirator...	
- 1	The bottle quality isn't great for the price.  Dr. Brown's bottles (the narrow ones) screw right into the Pump In Style.  So you can pump and use, just as you would with these bottles. If you use regular bottles, the Evenflo set is 1/3 of the price and fits right in. Or you can buy Evenflo bottles without the nipples for $4.99 to pour into other brands of bottles.  I use Dr. Brown's - since those are pricey, when I use up all of those, I just use the Evenflo to store extra milk and pour it into the Dr. Brown's bottles.	
1. 	My LO cut her first tooth at 4 months.  We didn't use the toothpaste at first since she had not had any food yet (not by any doctor's decree, just being cautious).  We just wet the finger brush and wiped all her gums and tooth.  Then she got the second tooth and started some food around 5 months.  The toothpaste (I tried it) is pleasant and is sweet, but nothing too crazy.  We brush her teeth morning and night and it has held up very well (she is 7 months now).  The finger brush allows you to get all those gums and around the teeth pretty well.  We own a baby tooth brush too, but right now, I prefer this-- especially at night when I am in the dark since it is easier to manipulate.	
- 1	I bought this play mat for my daughter a little over a month ago, all was great with it until this week when out of no where the music and light travel player started skipping music, it would play the same section of a song over and over and over again. I was able to exchange it at the store I bought it at and I got a new one (the same exact play mat), brought it home, put it together and found that this new one had the same glitch!!!!! so frustrating!! I brought it back and got a completely different brand!Update:: Its been about 3 months since I called the manufactor and advised them of my issue.  They were awesome and sent me a new music box (even though I already returned the whole baby gym and bought a whole different make and model.) I was using the music box in the car for my little one,  SADLY the new one now also skips like the two others I owned before. Its really annoying because my daughter loves the music and lights so much, but I cant take the skipping over and over and over again.  Even though the company tried to make it up to me, it still doesn't work....  Don't bother with this baby gym at all!!	
1. 	My 4 month old is teething and drools EVERYWHERE so we just put one of these bibs on (comes in almost every color so it always matches what he is wearing) and it saves me from changing his shirt 8 times a day!	
- 1	Let me start with the pros:- Strudy- Seat is soft- easy to clean- great foot stool- My son loves the designWith all those pros you would think that I would give it more then 2 stars. This potty is not for boys. I know it is geared toward boys, but the splash gard doesn't even come close to covering. When my son sits on it NOTHING Is covered. Because nothing is covered there is no point to the potty.I would not suggest anyone buy this seat.	
- 1	We use the GroVia Hybrid diapering system and love it!  I have almost nothing poor to say about Grovia...except maybe about these bags.  They are the only GroVia item I have not been perfectly happy with.  I'm not even sure what it was about them that they just didn't live up to what I was expecting.  They were very small and I wasn't sure I would trust the draw string to dirty diapers.  I have ended up with Plant Wise bags instead.  A couple different small sizes for the diaper bag and two large ones with elastic for the diaper bins.  --  I still love GroVia just not this product.	
1. 	We installed a mobile and the paint scratched off almost immediately. The mobile hardly got any use, In fact, the crib was in our nursery and our baby slept in our room in a pack and play so I was surprised the mobile scratched the paint. Other than that it's a great crib.	
- 1	I do not actually hate this item, but my child does and hasn't once used it despite being quick to potty train. It doesn't feel sturdy in our particular toilet ring (it pops fully into the potty only once my child has sat on the seat), and though that is not the fault of the maker, it's been a total no-go for us. A stepstool and toilet seat reducer have solved our problems!	
- 1	I bought this set a month before my baby was born. One of the smaller bags tore when I filled it with my babies toiletries. The bags are cute, but they are not durable. Once the bottom tears open you cannot use them again. I was very disappointed that they tore before my baby was even born! Ziploc bags are much better, and they're waterproof! Unlike this set of bags.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this cart/high chair cover. I love the Skip Hop brand. The pattern is really cute and it has toy loops, which are great. Unfortunately, the material is SO slippery that it won't stay put on any high chair or cart. I will be returning immediately.	
- 1	We were very excited about a swing that would allow us to move the kiddo straight from the car or stroller (Graco Snugrider Stroller Frame) without taking him out of his Snugride 35.  However, we were sorely mistaken when we thought this swing would function as a, well, swing.  The motor isn't even REMOTELY powerful enough to keep the Snugride 35 moving.  Brand new batteries won't get it moving.  Even if you kick start the swing by giving it a push, it will NEVER continue to swing unless you put it on the highest setting (there is a turtle to rabbit scroll wheel that is pretty worthless).  Once below absolute bunny the swing slows to a stop in a matter of seconds.  Not only that, but the fast setting is pretty jerky... way too fast back-and-forth in my opinion.  The vibration setting works fine, and the nature sounds are OK.  Music is, as always, awful.  When will they let us load up our own MP3's into these things?!  Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone... even my baby enemies.	
1. 	My baby loves her bath time. I have only used the newborn side so far because she is 8 weeks old but the wedge in the base is perfect to hold her little butt in place so she doesn't slide in. And it fits perfectly in my kitchen sink. Well worth the price!	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. These work alright but started tearing in the wash after the second wash. I previously bought OsoCozy wipes and have been using them for over a year (they look exactly the same) and almost none of them have torn up with frequent washing (I use these as diaper wipes). I would never buy this brand again and would pay double for the OsoCozy that won't fall apart immediately. My mistake!	
1. 	I purchased five different infant toothbrushes and this is my favorite.  It's chemical free and has tons of bristles all around and is perfectly squishy.  It's just wide enough that baby can't put the whole thing in his/her mouth so they can't try to swallow it or gag on it.  This gets all the top and bottom teeth.  You may want to buy a few because they are easy to loose but trust me, It's the best!  So, if you just buy this you'll save all the money I spent buying every toothbrush that was inferior.	
1. 	This brush works well at cleaning my baby's bottles, and I like that I haven't really gotten sprayed when pulling it out of the bottle.  It always helps though to angle the brush awaaay from your face/hair/clothing while removing it up though the bottle opening.  I think it would be so much better of a product if the nipple-cleaning end actually had bristles on it too!  As it is, it's just the same plastic material as the handle of the brush.  I don't know how this is supposed to clean nipples.  Maybe if the food or formula or whatever is more of a puree material it would help??  Anyways, you can't go wrong for the price on this thing.  You could even use it to clean normal dishes, your coffee mugs, the shower, etc etc.  Just don't do all that with the SAME brush haha	
1. 	I searched high and low for a shopping cart cover for my daughter. She is just under 6 months old and isn't quite sitting up on her own. I asked a lot of friends and family about their covers and what they liked and didn't like. I read numerous reviews on here and I was hesitant to order this cover because the of the negative reviews regarding its size. I took this to Wal-mart and got a big size cart (in my area they are all large).  I put it in the seating area and my oh my it fit perfectly! It covered everything! I just can't say enough good things about this cover! I have no idea what those negative reviews are talking about. It is very cute, soft and feels like it will easy to clean. I love the toy hooks too. Just so many great things, possibly one of my favorite baby products I've bought so far.	
1. 	It comes with an ice pack but i found that the Medela 4 bottle ice pack works better and fits your cooler perfectly- Then you have cold around both sides and not just on the bottom, like with the ice pack it comes with.Its a good design and clips to almost anything. Its good not just for bottles, but as an upright lunchbox.	
1. 	We absolutely love the Twilight Turtle at our house.  I have a 3 year old and 1 year old.  They share a room that is 10'X10' (small) with standard height ceiling and the stars show up well no matter what level the turtle is placed at (on bed, dresser, etc.).  It's great because it shows actual constellations that you can learn about and then look for the real ones outside sometime.  Here is the reason I gave Twilight Turtle only 4 stars:  We got him January 2010.  The batteries he came with lasted quite awhile.  When I changed them late July/ early August he suddenly didn't work anymore.  I could see through the holes that the amber light was on, but not projecting and the blue and green were not coming on at all.  We were so sad.  I didn't think there was any way to do an exchange, or I just didn't feel like dealing with it because I bought it online and it had been 8 months.  I kept putting off dealing with it, but continued to be sad about not being able to use the turtle.  Last week I finally decided to try to contact the manufacturer, Cloud B.  I contacted them via email.  They responded very promptly and gave me a list of suggestions about what could be causing the issue.  The issue turned out to be that I had put in Energizer batteries.  Apparently Energizer and Kirkland signature brand batteries in particular have a very short neck or connector point.  Cloud B suggested using Rayovac.  I immediately went out and got Rayovac batteries and our Twilight Turtle is back!  I am so glad I decided to contact Cloud B and figure this out.  Otherwise, sad to say, he would have been tossed.  I feel that Cloud B should have made it known about the battery issue from the beginning, but they really did have great customer service.	
1. 	This model is such a space saver for my small changing table. It's very strong and easy to hook on the sides of the table (make sure that the edge of your changing table is not too wide though and be aware when you want to put  any wipe warmer on the top tray. Most of them don't fit inside the tray. It just fits regular wipe boxes.  And the side containers also don't fit very large bottle of baby powder or lotion). I still highly recommend it though.	
1. 	I purchased the FP Motion Glider tp prevent co-sleeping and easy access to baby for breastfeedings at night. It is a good baby product investment.A+Easy assemblyWide & spacious for sleeping! I am pleased it is huge!! I will use until baby crawlsSafety buckle clipsSo soft and cozy washable fabric (mink material) but infant insert is cottonThe music day or night button plays a variety of lullaby classic snippetsLong lasting battery useSwivels in any direction for you and your baby comfortNO chemical/factory smells to the fabric coverC-Fabric is off white but muslin or flannel blanket can be used as a layer to catch throw-ups or leaky diapers to prevent daily detachment of cover to wash.Motion Glide can be loud and quite annoying if you are a light sleeperThe low sound music button feaure is still loudSlightly heavy to move from room to room but not deal breakerOverall: A.....Loveable and functional product!!!!My infant likes it to sleep in but not to relaxHope this helps: )~Mimi	
1. 	I have tried ergo baby and the moby and the baby bjorn and i like the the bjorn the best.the moby wrap is to hot with all that fabric wrapped around you 3 times.its also over priced since its just a ling peice of fabric. you can get the same thing if you cut a bed sheet in half. the baby will eventually sag and slope in it as the fabric stretches so you have to keep fussing and adjusting it. it is also a pain to take on and off or take baby in and out of. hate itthe ergo baby carrier puts the baby to tight against you so its to hot especially with the infant insert. its nearly impossible to breast feed in so every time you want to nurse; you need to take the baby out. otherwise you could loosen the carrier and feed with the babys body contorted. it does have great back support so i will keep it and use it when my baby gets bigger.The babybjorn is so perfect. it keeps you and baby cool on hot days. its cozy.  its its simple to put on and get baby in and out of. its east to breast feed in. you just need to add a little blanket or cover when you do. its life saving to be able to breast feed or carry baby comfortably with your hands free to do what you need. the only con is the babybjorn lacks the back support the ergo baby has.	
1. 	I found this crib on Amazon but thought the price was too high (it has since come down a little). After some Googling I discovered that the manufacturer makes several versions of the same crib for different retailers, under different names. I can't confirm that every detail is exactly the same, but they look identical in the pictures. So I went ahead and bought the less expensive version (called BabyMod Lily) from a big box store. This crib was fairly easy to assemble (with two people). The wood IS soft and WILL scratch and dent, but that is to be expected with inexpensive pine wood. I certainly wasn't going to pay more than twice as much for a hardwood crib. I just lowered the mattress height today and in doing so I noticed that almost every single screw on the exterior of the crib was loose, so I went around and tightened them all. I assume that all the wiggling and kicking of my (very active) 8-month-old loosened them. So if you've had this crib for awhile, go check those screws!! Doing this and lowering the mattress was a simple 20-minute chore. I would have liked a crib with a drawer underneath, but the style of this crib's feet echoed the curves of an antique dresser I bought (unlike other cribs I saw, these feet are actually rounded at the bottom, not flat). I sewed a simple crib skirt to hide the gap under the mattress.	
1. 	If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow!!! they are awesome and easy. you can wash them, they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere.Love it!!! ++++	
- 1	I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	This gate was easy to install in our banister posts, the gate itself seems very solidly built, and it operates pretty smoothly, so I'm happy with it.My only complaint is that the little plastic &#34;catch&#34; that locks the gate shut is very shallow, so if you pull up fairly strongly, it will pop open. I'm not sure if a toddler could generate the force needed, but it may be possible. It's only a slight concern for me, though. I think it will work fine, and tweaking the screws might provide a little more hold.Side note: I noticed other reviewers saying that the included screws were junky, so I used my own &#34;gold finish&#34; screws, and have had no problems.Recommended, just test the &#34;catch&#34; and make sure it's holding to your satisfaction.	
1. 	Our oldest is 3, and this diaper pail has been doing its job, right next to my bed that entire time (now containing the stinky diapers from our younger son for the past 19 months).In light of the 600 other reviews for this product, I'll boil it down to these four points:(1) It really does contain smell, despite its simplicity. I have a very sensitive nose, and the only time I catch the odor from within is if I purposely hold the two flap doors open and take a whiff, or when I'm changing the bag and compacting the full one with my knee to squeeze all the air out (definitely an outside task -- stinky!).(2) Price the bags before hand, because as others have pointed out, they're the real expense over time.(3) Our secondary flapper door was hanging open the past few weeks, probably the result of a loose spring affected by corrosion (the air stays moist inside this pail). I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.  Problem solved.(4) It's pretty durable. Our oldest regularly climbs and sits on this -- says it's his rocket. He hasn't managed to break anything, despite it being very conventional construction (i.e. lightweight, not overbuilt, though I hesitate to call it flimsy).	
1. 	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.	
- 1	We had this item on our baby gift registry and just received it. The packaging clearly states that the backing is made of vinyl, not polyester. Only the batting is polyester. This is an essential difference if you are avoiding toxic materials in your baby gear.	
1. 	It is very soft, and I like the color.It is large for my 7 month baby. Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality.	
1. 	I bought 2 of these when we got new seats for our girls.  I love them!  They keep our seats from being completely dirty.  They also help the seat grip better when being installed.  We've used them on cloth interior and leather.  Both work like a champ.  My only minor irritation is that the part that stuffs into the fold of the seat is hard to get in...of course, part of that is my car.  Overall, it is a very good buy!	
1. 	I wanted a mirror that rotated in so that I could easily see my baby. I have a GMC Terrain, so the mirrors that attach to the window wouldn't work. This mirror attached easily to the headrest (even though mine don't adjust). It give a clear image with NO distortion! I would recommend this item to other parents!	
- 1	CONS: It takes tremendous force to generate any flow.  Trying to get my 10 month infant to use it is impossible since she cannot suck hard enough to get anything out.  Only way for her to use it is to either remove the leak proof valve (but no longer leak proof).PROS: Looks nice, material seems sturdy, it is stainless steel on the bottom (plastic cover, valve, mouthpiece.	
1. 	I brought this in 2007 for my son. Now my daughter is using it now (2009). She is pretty big for a 3 month old and this chair is perfect. She's safe and she loves it. She had an accident once and I was able to remove the covering with ease, wash it, dry it, and put it back on with no problems at all. I don't use the vibrating option, but that's because it's not necessary for my child. This chair is durable and safe. I hope they will always make this chair.	
1. 	I love the feel of these wipes. They are soft on my baby's skin. They did shrink in size considerably when I washed them, but they are still a good size for wiping bottoms.	
- 1	We bought this monitor to use in our son's room, we were looking for something good, but also something that wouldn't break the bank.  After reading so many positive reviews I was so excited to get this product home.  Initially I thought it was going to be good, but then we started noticing things about it that we didn't like.1. Cheap and flimsy plastic- so cheap in fact that the camera seems like it will tip over with the lightest touch2. The Camera won't tilt up and down, only side to side, this sucked because we had a hard time getting the right angle3. The electrical cords are very short, very inconvenient because the battery life on the unit is short, so I needed to keep it plugged in all night, which is fine except the closest outlet caused the cord to stretch, and was easy to trip over. The cords couldn't be more than 3-4 feet long.4. Battery life on the monitor is short, you will constantly be charging this thing.5. Lastly, I found the constant on and off of the volume to be so irritatingSo yes, it was easy to set up, and cheap, but it is crap.  We returned it and bought a Motorola one, which is far superior to this one.  We actually got it at BJ's Wholesale Club, and only paid $130 for it, its like $180 on Amazon.	
1. 	I give our 10 month old son his baby buddy toothbrush every night during story time and he chews on it happily. It really helps with teething too. Great product.	
- 1	This product worked okay a few times, but when I tried a different brand, I noticed a huge difference. This item was not nearly as sharp and precise, so I just threw this one away.	
1. 	Only drawback is that these plugs can be a little hard to pry out once they are in. Not too bad, but you could break a nail. Great value for the money, though.	
- 1	I ordered this because of the good reviews, but it doesn't work for us. First it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, which has nothing to do with the product but was especially frustrating since I'm now returning it. It doesn't fit our island or dining room table. The arms are really long, requiring a pretty deep space. It's also much more cumbersome than expected. I thought we'd just fold it up and take it out to dinner with us, but it doesn't collapse very small. We didn't use it to actually feed the baby since it didn't work in our kitchen, but I could tell the space between the counter and the baby was too wide and we would end up with more food on the floor than anywhere else.It does seem like a solid design, so if it works in your kitchen then it's probably a good purchase.	
1. 	this is a great item!  much better than the Babies R Us brand and others.  very secure, solves one particular baby-proofing challenge in spectacular fashion.  highly recommended.	
1. 	These are by far my favorite dishes for my Twins to eat out of and we have a lot of different bowls.My girls are able to grab more food out of these than any of their other dishes, this is due to the sloped & smooth insides.This does not slide all over their high chair tray, it stays right where I put it.It does not tip as many of their other bowls do.These are easy to clean & I hand wash them. I just un-snap the 2 pieces wash them and snap them back together when they are dry. This is VERY easy but a child would not be able to do it.These also fit together so they take up less space!!These are a little pricy but I figured since it was something we would be using EVERYDAY, several times a day, it was worth getting something that worked great and would not wear out.Several people have complained that their child is able to pick these up & throw them and are dissapointed. Ummmmm, DUH!! If your child is able to pick things up and throw them since this is not glued down, held by some magnetic force, etc. then yes, they will be able to pick it up. That is just common sense. These are just harder to pick up. Try teaching your child some manners, yes, even at 1 year old children can be taught not to do something. If you are having trouble with your child throwing their plate then perhaps you should be looking for a book on teaching your child some manners instead of trying to fix the problem with a bowl!	
- 1	When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security.  The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath.  Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down.We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper.The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us.	
1. 	Prior to purchasing these toys, we had a tough time getting my 8 month old son to enjoy bath time. It would take two of us to get the job done and he'd whine the whole time. At my wits end, I decided to look into getting him some safe toys for bath time.Here's what I like about these toys.BRIGHT AND MODERN. They are simple, bright, and modern shapes that definitely attract my sons attention. He especially loves the silicone balls.SIMPLE AND COMPACT. These toys are a great alternative to classic bath toys that tend to take up a great deal of space. When I was searching for toys, all I could really find were large boats and rubber duckies. Those would of all taken up a large amount of space in our already too crowded bathroom. The flat shapes just stay stuck to our walls in between bath time and the balls go in a little basket in the shower.SAFE AND BPA FREE. These little guys don't absorb water so they are less likely to get mold and mildew (we have yet to spot any on the toys). They are BPA, PVC, and phthalate-free.SCRUBBIES. The scrubbies that are included with the toys are the perfect size for little bodies. It fits in the palm of my hand and I just squirt a little bit of soap into it and I get the job done.I'm glad I found these toys because my son now loves bath time. They fit in his little hands nicely and the keep him entertained. When he gets older, I am certain he will still love them because he will be able to learn colors as well as paste them onto the shower walls himself.	
1. 	We have two of these things (one in F150 and one in Mitsubishi Galant). We never take them out and just swap the baby car seat into the base of whichever car we're driving (with baby). My only concern is it does &#34;press&#34; quite hard into the seats with the plastic corners and ultimately could lead to depressions in the seat long term. However, it is quite well designed and once you figure out how to adjust it (no red should show!!!) then you set it and forget it. The carseat pops down really easily and you can audibly hear the &#34;click&#34; of the lock/latch. It's quite forgiving and easy for my (5' 7&#34; tall) to get even into the tall truck. I usually just swing the car seat close and wiggle until it's in place. Would purchase again in a heartbeat...I'd recommend one for every vehicle, although we have swapped them into other vehicles (Toyota Venza) on the fly (less than 2 minutes) when I got a flat tire and grandparents picked us up on interstate...thank God these change out quickly as not a safe location for swapping. I do feel they're very secure, but at first it's supprising how the front end appears it could &#34;bounce&#34; up and down quickly with know restraint in the front.	
- 1	My son is 50th percentile for weight and height, so pretty average sized for a 2 year old.  As lots of reviewers have mentioned, the height of this potty is great, the handholds on the side are a help, the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there, and the back WOULD be nice except...There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat, so that when my son sits on it, the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back.  The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this.  Even when he does not get pinched, he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs, and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all.  Therefore I cannot comment whether the pee goes into the bowl, because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting, I thought it would be really easy--just pull the bowl out, dump it out, wipe, disinfect with clorox on occasion...BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl, necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well, which is just a pain.Finally, the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son's legs and he stands up.I cannot say, however, if there is anything better out there--we haven't found the perfect potty yet, but if this is the best of the portable potties, I guess we're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet, because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us.	
- 1	I expected great things from this blanket since Baby Bargains raved about it.  Save your money and buy an Amazing Miracle Blanket instead.  The velcro is annoying, and my daughter could wiggle out of this way too easily.  She never got out of the Amazing Miracle Blanket, even at 6 months (I swaddled her when we were traveling and she had a hard time sleeping).  Skip the swaddleme and get an Amazing Miracle Blanket.  I swear I don't work for them--it's just that the blanket design is amazing and miraculous!	
1. 	Excellent blanket, I used it to change my baby daughter's contact lens, so I if it fell off I would  see it, not the usual use I know, but now that she is older I will start using it for picnics and it is still in great shape.	
1. 	i love that you can use this product for a few years, rather than a few months. it has toys that hang for the younger infants, along with vibration. but then you can take the hanging toys off and use it for the toddlers.	
- 1	This was my favorite bag until the zipper broke off!! We had it about 6 months before it happened and I really don't want to pay another 20bucks for it to happen again. It was the perfect size and masked all odor. I am very disappointed to say goodbye to this one!	
- 1	My son doesn't care for this toy at all. It doesn't do too much and is a it bulky. I had actually bought this for the plane ride, but it was too big to take.	
1. 	After reading dozens of reviews of different outlet cover, got a few different kinds.  This worked the best.  Was very easy (I didn't even need my husband's help installing) and laid perfectly flat and tight.	
1. 	It makes so much more sense to just use regular kitchen trash bags, more cost effective. It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers. Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so diaper genieized they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable. I highly recommend it to anyone!	
1. 	I love the stroller frame. We have a great Jeep 3-wheel stroller that the carseat will attach to but it is a bit big and bulky for everyday use. Plus it doesn't fit in the trunk of my car. This stroller frame pops right in the trunk and is super lightweight. The carseat snaps securely onto it and the basket underneath can even be used for shopping if you're just picking up a couple things. It is also very easy to turn and maneuver even in tight spaces. It's a must-have.	
1. 	I like this but my baby is not to fond of the vibration. Cute chair, lets him lay or sit and it rocks.	
1. 	The material is not too soft but I would say safe for a toddler to bite or bump his head on. Its sturdy. Its big but I think choosing an 8 panel yard serve its purpose. More space for the toddler to play on. The parent can stay inside as well and play with the toddler. I think its a great play yard. Good buy!	
- 1	I thought this was really cute, and I thought this was going to help my toddler get more comfortable with the shower - NOT.It takes some work to pump (no way a toddler could do it) and then the amount of water that comes out is negligible.My toddler did not like it and did not want it in the bath at all.I do not think there is a problem with this particular product, I think they probably all work like this.The idea is much better than what the product actually is.Don't waste your money.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating.	
1. 	I just ordered 2 more of these for my 8 month old.  I use them all the time.  I keep one in the diaper bag to use at restaurants and many more places.  She loves using them.  She gets excited every time she sees these.  I put fruit and vegetables in them and they are a big hit.  I would definitely recommend these to others.	
1. 	We got this gate because we recently got 2 puppies, and have gated off all areas of our house so that they don't run all around the house causing havoc. However regular gates are such a pain, having to step over them, is a hassle. Especially while trying to carry a new baby. So this is great. Only complaints: I wish the opening was larger, it isn't huge- but to be fair, the description does give dimensions. The only other thing that is taking a while to get used to, is there is a bar at the bottom of the gate- even in the opening, so you still have to watch your step, but it is less of a hassle than having to take down gates or step over them. overall, I would recommend.	
1. 	One of the items that was highly recommended to me by other mom's before my baby was born was the Snap N Go stroller frame.  Boy, were they right!  I have a Graco Snugride car seat which snaps right on this thing!  As a matter of fact the first time I used it, I set the car seat on the frame and was preparing to bend over to look to see how it attached and I heard, Snap.  It just snapped right onto the frame without me having to do anything!  It folds up so easily and doesn't take up much space in the trunk of the car.  It unfolds easily, too.  I love the basket in the bottom for holding purse, diaper bag, etc. and the cup holders and the little storage compartment on the handlebard are very nice!  I hear this frame works with lots of different car seats.  I say buy this easy, peasy item for a lot less than the fancy travel systems that are sold with the brand of car seat you buy, which are more expensive.  Heck, you're only going to use these infant car seats for a while anyway.The name suits this item perfectly...it truly is Snap and Go!	
1. 	This has been a godsend for us. We've been worried about our toddler opening up the front door. Once we installed this, it's been no worries. It was super easy to install and easy to figure out how to work.	
- 1	I ordered these before I noticed they were NOT actually BPA free! and I can't return them :-( But I will say that the nipple does work with the Avent bottles, so it wasn't a total loss. I wouldn't recommend these bottles, but I would recommend these nipples, which are way less expensive than the Avent nipples. the Gerber nipples are available on amazon and eBay.	
- 1	Sure it's a cute little sheep - but it only makes white noise for a set period (max 45 mins if I recall correctly). When the noise stops, the baby would wake up.  Thus we spent 99 cents on a white noise track from itunes and run it in a continuous loop.  Much cheaper and effective.	
- 1	This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers. Not true, I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit	
- 1	Very thin and they have no trim around the edge so they tend to just ball up and not spread out. I found similar ones at Babies R Us that are far superior in quality. The colors are cute though.	
- 1	I have had this pillow for only a few months now. I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester, and now I'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester.  Within that time, the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out, making my legs too close together.  I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips don't hurt when I sleep.  Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying, if you haven't experienced it already, you just might if you are using this pillow.  In addition to this, the head part of the pillow is too flat.  I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts.  Overall I do not recommend this product.  I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows, and this one was the cheapest with the best review.  Don't fall for the same trap I did!!! Shell out the extra bucks and get a better quality, better stuffed pillow.... you'll be happier sleeping if you do.	
- 1	I don't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are. It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device. I've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once. I prefer to just hand wash our bottles, pacifiers, accessories, and breast pump parts. It's a good idea but ehh, not a hit.	
- 1	I recently ordered three diaper bags, hoping one would work. Unfortunately (fortunately?) this bag was knocked out after only the briefest look.** PROS **1. It's cute.2. I like the strap options.** CONS **1. It's too deep, and the side zippers don't open all the way so it's hard to reach the stuff inside the bag once you stuff it in.2. It has very few pockets. The pockets it does have are decent, but I need WAY more organization on the inside of the bag.3. The four bottle pockets are laughable--they are opposite each other on the sides/end so that if you put a bottle in one (say in the outside pocket) there's NO WAY you're getting a bottle on the inside pocket. You might be able to slip a phone in there or a packet of Kleenex but that's it. I even had to struggle to get a sippy cup in the pocket--no thank you.When I figured out CON #3, I knew this bag was going back. Especially when combined with how deep it is and the cost.	
1. 	These are great bibs! I saw one review comment that it was flimsy and they didn't see how it could ever hold up..... I definitely beg to differ! While these bibs are thin, they are strong! It's annoying for the child to have an overly stiff bib.  These are incredibly thin and flexible, yet the pouch to catch crumbs stays open nicely.  They just flip inside out for easy hand washing or you can throw them in the washer.  Having the entire bib be washable (i.e. no fabric backing) is a huge plus! Our daughter has had the same one for FOUR years now and it still looks and works perfectly.  That's four years of 3 meals, two snacks a day.  It's a hardworking bib.  And, might I add, her only bib because we love it so much! We just rise it with soap and water each night and throw it in the wash every once in a while.  She now also has the toddler version with little cap sleeves (which easily still fits her) for visiting grandparents and using as an art smock there. We got our son one when he was born and we expect it will last just as long! Adorable prints too.  We give these as gifts to new parents and they all have loved them too!	
- 1	This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off. It is very easy to open and I wonder about my son getting in it as he gets older. If this is all you can afford, it's not that bad.	
1. 	This item is huge and we use it as a hamper in my daughters room.  It fits so well with the decor and it's very durable.  It's also really pretty.	
- 1	Perhaps I should have read the description better. These blankets are very small. My newborn was 9lbs 7oz and these barely wrapped around him. Also, they are not symmetrical. I feel like this company just used scraps of material to make these blankets.	
1. 	This thing is GREAT. Better than the Snugli or other items similar to that. In the sling, the baby's entire body, not just the trunk, is cradled against you, sort of like in the womb. It actually looks uncomfortable for the baby, but mine sleeps quite soundly in it.Not only is it comfortable for both you and baby, there's enough material to provide a covering for nursing, unlike the snugli types.It also provides mom with hands-free mobility.And it's SO SO SO much better than lugging around a two-ton car seat! The baby is quite secure without additional support of any kind. It does take some getting used to. It took a while to figure out the right position for both carrying and nursing. So if you buy one, don't be discouraged if you can't figure it out right away. You'll love this thing!	
- 1	I had this carrier and could only use it for maybe 30 min, at that is a stretch, without it killing my back. And that was with a 8lb baby! I have an ergo and wow! What a difference! So much better for baby's hips and the back. I can wear my daughter for hours without any pain and my daughter weighed more and you can use the ergo for up to like 50lbs (can't remember the details). It's worth the extra $30- trust me!	
- 1	I should have read the reviews before I purchased them.  I neglected to do so because I liked the pattern & have an appreciation for the Kushies brand.  I am searching for a mat to go under my high chairs that can be moved with the high chairs without scratching my floors.  This type of mat will not serve my purpose.  I am returning them.	
- 1	I was unable to use these as expected because of static.  One had low-level continuous static and the other had loud static.  It unnerved me listening through the static and I simply stopped trying to use them.This was a regrettable purchase, a waste of money.  I don't recommend this product.	
- 1	The toy is nice, but the tunes are tinny and not good quality. I would not recommend this to a friend.	
- 1	This did not get our bottles clean.  (We use Medelas, our baby is exclusively breastfed.).  You could see the smears of attempted cleaning on the sides.  Buy the other Munchkin one instead- we go through about one every 6 weeks, but its well worth it. http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Deluxe-Bottle-Brush-Colors/dp/B000E89BNU/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER	
1. 	Bought this for my girls (turtle for my son).  it is adorable even off.  The lights are great (although after 3 months of nightly use the green doesn't seem to work as well) and project onto the ceiling & walls.This does say not suitable for children under 3, but we put it in the middle of the room while the children are in cribs at night so age isn't an issue for us.The turtle by cloud b is also fantastic, my son loves it.i only wish they could stay on longer (after 45 minutes my son is still awake and we have to go and turn the turtle back on).This is a great gift and I look forward to buying more cloud b products for my family.	
- 1	I have to send this stroller back, because of major problems I had with it.Firsts of all my 7 month old son fills the sit and he is 28 inches tall and 19 lb.Secondly sun shade is a joke! Doesn't give much protection and when I adjust it to the front it falls down but itself. I also purchased the additional shade, but here it goes third flow- it is ok for me to push stroller, I am 5'6. My husband is 5'11 and he hits the back wheels with every step he takes, because they not spaced far enough apart (seriously- only 8 3/4 space between the back wheels).Overall stroller seems durable, but I better spend more money and go something we both can use.	
1. 	My son has GERD and has done very well with these bottles and Enfamil A.R.. They do reduce spit up. We tried the cheap Gerber bottles for a month while we were traveling, and he spit up volumes. Once we were settled and switched back to Dr Brown, the spit up stopped.	
- 1	After doing a ton of searching and reading reviews I finally decided to purchase this mattress. For one it had good reviews and the price was great. But I really don't see how this mattress could have such good reviews. My son had only slept on this mattress for 4 months when it started caving in in the middle, which I know all of you moms out there know this is NOT SAFE! When the mattress first arrived I was a little leery of it because it just felt flimsy but I thought I would go ahead and try it since it had such good reviews, big mistake! I should have just returned it from the git go. so now, yesterday in fact we purchased a much better mattress. we purchased an all foam, organic, dual sided (infant and toddler side) Simmons brand, from Costco for $99.99. So if you do a little research you'll find that anything comparable to this mattress would typically run about $200.00 so this was an excellent deal. My best advice is to just spend a little more from the git go and know that you have a good quality mattress for your little one. After all they will get a lot of use out it so might as well make sure it is going to last. luckily I was able to return this mattress for free and get my money back with out any hassle, and for that I love amazon!	
1. 	Needed to transition our twins from swaddles in bassinets to their cribs. These are working wonderfully, as I'm one of those nervous moms who doesn't want to put blankets in the crib w/ baby.  I do wish they zipped a little differently, but I understand why the zipper starts at the top instead of the bottom.	
- 1	Although this is snuggly, soft, and adorable, when we took our car seat to our local California Highway Patrol station to have it professionally installed, he saw that I had put this in it (it was cold and rainy at the time) and warned me that car seats are not crash tested with these in them, that they can compress during an accident and cause the infant to slip, and are overall dangerous for use in car seats.  It would be perfectly fine for use in a stroller, but NOT WISE for use in a car seat.  Instead, use blankets or something that can fit completely over the baby and carseat rather than inside of it.  Bummer.  I returned it and use blankets instead.	
- 1	My son actually loves this cup and wanted to carry it around with him everywhere. Unfortunately he also loved chewing on the straw which ripped open at the top after just a few days of use. I'll admit that my son is a chewer but I think if the quality of the straw material had been made more durable, it would have taken him much longer to wear it down. Aside from the straw issue, the logo on the cup began rubbing off after just one hand washing. One other thing that bugged me was that the hourglass shape of the cup actually interferes with how the weighted straw works. When the weighted part of the straw slides backward as the cup is tipped, it can actually get hung up in the middle of the cup where that indentation is, making it difficult for the straw bottom to reach the pool of liquid. So, I'm pretty disappointed and will be trying the Zoli cup.	
1. 	My little 2 1/2 month grandson was delighted with this! The blinking lights, different sounds kept him amused. I would recommend this to anyone.  Price & Quality were exceptional through Amazon!	
1. 	My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive. Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious. But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)	
1. 	These wall hanging are well made and are so light weight you can put them up with a tack. Very cute!	
1. 	These sacks are everything the reviews promised they would be. I bought them for the baby I am expecting in a few months but broke into them to clean up after my dog's puppy pads (when his diaper genie 2 ran out of bags). We already knew we didn't want to use a diaper genie for our baby since it has been so ineffective for our dog's pads- and we only put one in a day (he's indoor and outdoor trained) but we continued to use it for him because it was better than smelling it in the garbage. Using the sassy sacks for 2 days has made a huge difference. We can throw away the pad in a sassy sack into a regular trash can and there is no smell. I can also take these with me on dog walks to pick up poops along the way.I am so pleased using these for my dog, I can't wait to use them for the baby! I have ordered several more boxes because I know I am going to be getting a lot of use out of this simple, but effective product.	
- 1	very lightweight and cheaply made. granted the video isn't so bad,however the audio is so low it defeats the point of having a monitor. I've since returned this. I bought the Graco True Focus Digital Video Monitor  instead. it's not perfect but definitely better.	
1. 	I LOVE Sassy products! They are amazing value and always do their job perfectly. My baby is now 3 mths old and loves grasping and mouthing toys. This is a really great slection, colourful, imaginative and fun. He especially likes the fish and holds him on every journey we make. I wasn't expecting this pack to have so many different styles and to be so well made, but it really is lovely. Buy it!	
- 1	These wipes are soft, absorbent, and perfectly sized BUT...the beautiful rainbow colored threading began to unravel with the very first wash. So if you're getting them for the lovely color, think twice. Without the threads, you can probably get a cheaper flannel wipe that is just as good.Too bad.  I would have bought more.	
1. 	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.	
- 1	This item is a great IDEA. Key word, 'IDEA'.PROS:- It's a 4-in-1: elbow rest, knee rest, storage pocket for wash/shampoos, and then later can be used as a stepping stool.- Cute little ice animal theme, polar bears, penguins, whales, etc.- The elbow rest has suction cups that attach to the tubside.- The little storage pockets that hang on the side are helpful for all those crazy bath toys and products babies come with.CONS:- What I did not consider before purchasing this item was the placement of my bathtub's faucet and the toilet. We have two bathrooms, and both bathtubs, on the side where the faucet is the toilet is directly next to it. Generally, if one were to be giving their child a bath, they would be right by the faucet so that they could control the water flow/temperature.... With toilets directly next to my bathtubs, I can't exactly kneel with 3 inches between the two porcelain objects. Hah. I sit uncomfortably on the closed toilet instead and lean over the whole time, which SUCKS.- The stool does not raise up to be any higher than what the picture shows. It is a very VERY short stepping stool, and will be useless for quite a while.- The suction cups for the elbow rest POP OFF almost every time you lean on it, which defeats the purpose. They were very hard to get to stay put in the first place before anyone ever leaned on it.- Also, the top of the elbow rest CRACKED after maybe the 2nd time we used it.Conclusion:I LOOOVED the idea of this product. Still haven't seen a similar product, but I was very disappointed with the quality and exact features of this, and I was frustrated with myself for not considering that I couldn't even use this feature because of my bathroom set-ups. This will be up for sale at my next garage sale.	
1. 	It fits perfectly with my mini crib mattress. I havent had a practice run yet. Im still waiting for my baby to arrive.	
- 1	I have had back pain since the third month of my pregnancy and finally gave in to buying an expensive pregnancy pillow at month 6.  I thought this would be my godsend.  I used it for less than one night before I tossed it on the ground and slept without it.  Since I couldn't sleep, I actually got up out of bed to print out my return label because I couldn't wait to get rid of this thing and pop it off at UPS and get it out of our house.  I am absolutely baffled by all of the rave reviews.Pros:One star for being made in the USA (with foreign parts, so take that for what it's worth).Cons:Cheap fabric case.Inside filling feels flimsy and like it won't hold up.Completely UNCOMFORTABLE!!!You can't use your own pillow unless you want your head lifted up super high.It's not easy to switch from left side to right side.  You have to hoist the dumb thing back and forth (try doing that with sheets/duvet on top), and in doing so, it's completely disruptive to one's sleeping partner.  Also, even simple things like turning over in bed are difficult/painful whilst pregnant, and this pillow makes it even harder.I will either invest in a U-shaped pillow or non-pregnancy specific long tubular body pillow (so I can use my own pillow for my head and turn sides with ease) or just stick to having a regular pillow between my legs.  The Leacho Snoogle was a total bust and a complete waste of money.	
1. 	As a lot of other reviews have stated...this bassinet has everything!  I live in an apartment so space saving is crucial.  The only feature that I haven't used on this is the bedside sleeper.  The first week or so my baby slept in our room...I really didn't want or need something so big in my way of getting out of bed every morning.  I got tired of pulling the big thing from my room to the living room...I just didn't like my baby practically sleeping on the floor all day when you use it as a portable bassinet, so I just moved the whole thing into my living room.  I only use it during the day now, but it was still worth buying.  (Plus it gave me a chance for me to get baby used to her crib at night.)  She loves to nap in it & the vibration & the song Fur Elise helps soothe her.  (She actually now perfers that song than the one her mobile plays...not a good thing at night!)  I do use the changing table a lot...it is a little hassle to lift of the top since it is a little bulky...but no biggie for me.  I also use it as a portable bassinet sometimes when she is awake & just wants attention.There are a few minor complaints about this bassinet. One of the most important pieces of material on it (the material on the changing table) isn't removable...so I use the Huggies changing pads on it...they are big enough to cover most of the surface area.  Also the sheet isn't a normal bassinet sheet so its not like you can use any store bought one without cutting out slits to pull the straps through, which isn't a good idea because you will get loose strings.  Oh & the part that goes between the legs that the straps plug in to...sometimes that needs to be washed too..but no, that too is permanently attached.	
1. 	Love this dispenser.  I had a hand-me-down one that was absolutely horrible but this one is very easy to use.  Easy to open and close to add formula, I like that it converts to a snack container later, it turns easily between compartments, and the handle to the top for dispensing formula is made so that it will stay standing up or flip all the way back when open.  Not sure why having to shake the container when dispensing the formula is a problem, this isn't a big deal for me.	
- 1	This product sucks. It literally leaked everywhere and is a mess to try to even do in the car, which is where I wanted to use it. Please, SAVE YOUR MONEY and do not buy this terrible product.	
- 1	This potty is so cute my son just feels like playing with it, it has too many parts, and the deflector is not good at all everytime he seats on it gets off or get nocked down hurting him, he just use it now as step stool, gave two stars cause of that and the cuteness factor, otherwise no so good. I just got a toilet seat reducer and a great step stool that surrounds his toilet so he es learning to go straigh to the toilet wich is WAY more hygenic!	
- 1	Edit: 6/7/2012Changing my review from 3 to 1 stars. We've only had this unit for 6+ months and after 1 fall on a CARPETED FLOOR it stopped working. I am stuck buying a new system (parent unit + camera), since the parent unit can't be ordered separately. All in all, this was not a good purchase: no support for multiple cameras in web cam mode, no calibration for the thermostat and no durability. Stay away.***We put this monitor through the paces this weekend.  Since we are having twins, we bought an additional camera.  Using the main screen, the images are bright and after some adjustment everything seems to work fine.  I have STRONG words of caution if you are buying this because of the Skype features or are planning to plug it into your Windows computer.*You need a CD drive to install the drivers.  There was no place to download the drivers.  You cannot find the product under the main Samsung.com website, you have to go to Samsungsv.com.  Something not smell right? Yeah...  But SamsungSV.com is no help either - no driver download, nothing.*There is no software that comes with this camera.  They don't mention any software and in fact there is nothing, only a driver that allows the camera to be used like a web-cam.  So officially you can't complain about this... but I do find it very odd.  I was expecting at least a lame viewing interface for your computer.*The image when viewing through the main monitor LCD screen is way larger than what appears when you view it as a web-cam.  So if you are aiming that camera at your baby and it looks great on the screen you are carrying around, odds are that most of your baby will be off screen if you try viewing it as a webcam.  This is aweful - in 2011 isn't digital information being carried through a USB cable still digital information?  Shouldn't the image information like image size and format stay the same??  But no.*When viewing as a web-cam, you can only see one camera.  This is very annoying. When using the main viewer, the cameras can be set to auto-rotate.  Works great.  When in USB web-cam mode, this is disabled for some unkown reason.  You CAN change cameras, manually, if you sit and hit the button on the viewer that is hooked into your computer, but that makes no sense if you are trying to use this device over Skype.  And the reason has to be just poorly written software.  Why sell a unit that can support 4 cameras but then not support all 4 cameras for internet viewing?  Sad, for an otherwise great looking product, especially if you have multiple kids/cameras.*Skype - well it works with Skype - sorta.  I was able to create a Skype account for the monitor that is hooked up to a dedicated computer.  It can be set to automatically connect to video calls, BUT for whatever reason the camera does not automatically come on, I just get an icon without video.  If I'm with the Samsung unit and the computer, during the call I can hit the video button and vwalla! it works.  But again, that doesn't work if you are trying to use it over Skype.  So I am very dispointed with the internet functionality of this unit.  I think the description is misleading in selling the Skype functionality.  Otherwise, I am happy with the portable monitor unit and the cameras.	
1. 	this is an amazing waterproof porta-crib pad, makes it more kushy and nice!American Baby Company Waterproof Fitted Quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad Coveramazing fit for dream on me 3'' mattress! Very happy for grandma's house!Dream On Me 3 Portable Crib Mattress	
- 1	I needed a lunch bag for my wife. This one turned out to be a kid's lunch bag or just a similar size... No compartments, no nothing. Returned this bag and got something that suits her better.	
1. 	We have this chair in another pattern but we love it!  We started putting our son in it when he was about 3 mos. old - I tilted the seat all the way back and could roll him from room to room with me.  Even now, at 10 mos., when he's not feeling great, I put him in the chair and recline it so he can relax while I clean up. It was very easy to put together and I love that it folds up out of the way.  Now that our son is eating cereal, etc., we just roll it right up to the table so he can join the family dinner.  There are a lot of cracks and crevasses that stuff gets stuck in but it cleans up easily enough.	
- 1	Thought they would be bigger. They were really small and would not stay on the furniture. I was quite disappointed.	
- 1	This is essentially a few basic links on a nicer black and white link. Just buy the 24 pack of links from Bright Starts. Cheaper and more links for your money.	
1. 	This is the best sippy cup I've found, and I've gone through quite a few.  What a waste of money with all the other cups I've been through; for the same amount of $$ I could've gotten these plus change left over!  My baby wasn't able to suck out of all the leak proof sippy cups (and I've bought at least 3-4 others) but these he'll happily use.  Plus, it's a two for one because you can use it as a regular cup afterwards.  And there are only two parts to wash!One thing you have to beware of though --  DO NOT BOIL these per the instructions!  I did, and it warped the lids so badly there was no way it would fit back onto the cups; so minus one star.  Since they were cheap I just got more.	
- 1	I purchased this since my baby is moving around more in her crib. This is thinner than what I thought it would be, compared to the thick crib bumper that came with the crib set.  It is easy to install with strong velcro on the ends. However, I am wishing that I bought the other brand breathable crib bumper... this thin mesh that the BreathableBaby bumper is made of slides easily down the crib slats. I have found my baby with an arm or a leg between the crib slats, pushing the mesh bumper down, even with the bumper tied and velcroed as tight as possible. The thin material also does not protect her from bumping her head against the sides of the crib... which is mainly what a crib bumper is for. She still rolls over and hits her head on the sides of the crib, waking herself up and crying! I am buying the other Summer Infant breathable bumper. This one was a waste of money. I can't return it because I tossed the packaging... Im going to try to convert it into something that can baby proof something in my house.	
1. 	Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together. He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through! The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily. We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!! It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it. It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too! The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me. It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.	
1. 	This is a fine product and I am happy with it.  I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad.  My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag.  My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.	
1. 	We got this product for our baby shower and used it from our baby's birth till he was 5 months old and started trying to get out of it.I was at first concerned that it is so primitive, just gliding back and forth and it does not have vibration, but our baby never liked vibration and he would fall asleep in the glider and stay there for long-long time.We absolutely love it!  The batteries it came with lasted all 5 months and sometimes our baby was in the glider for several hours a day.  It is a great advantage that it does not need to be plugged in the wall so you can move it to whatever room you want.I only give it 4 stars because the safety belt got small for our son very soon and we stopped using it.  Not a problem for us, but some people may want to know about it.	
1. 	I gave this five stars as this is the third one I've purchased.  I purchased one for myself, one for each of my grandchildren who's parents have counter height tables and the grandchildren are too big for their high chairs.  I originally purchased this one for our granddaughter (since we too have a counter height kitchen table) who was 9 months and it was perfect for her!  Now that our grandchildren are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 it is perfect for them still.  I HIGHLY recommend this for grandparents, people who do not have children as it is so handy to pull out and use for company that has little one/toddlers.  The seat conveniently folds up and has a strap for throwing it over your shoulder if you're going to someone's home that doesn't have a high chair/booster seat.  Fisher-Price has done it again!	
1. 	My 4 month old loves gnawing on cold apple slices in this feeder to relieve her teething pains.  Other mommy friends of mine use these for milk popsicles too!	
- 1	This item cost me $10.00 I wish I would have been able to try it before buying it. Very disappointed with the product, It actually had some good reviews so I was very excited to buy it and hopefully make bath time more fun (by keeping the water out of my child's face) and unfortunately this product does not do that.	
1. 	you get two of these bad boys in a pack.  they work so well i thought about doing the whole car. because at least its temporary.  i looked in those roll up kind for baby and i didnt want to spend that kind of money so i went to thrift stores and yard sales and everyone i saw was cracked and had a weird pissy plastic smell. not something i want trapped in a hot car or near my baby.  these are a life saver!	
- 1	I recieved boxes of these bottles as gifts, every one of them leaks. I tried everything to stop the leaks, but nothing worked. Avent makes a great manual breast pump, but they need to put a better bottle on the market.	
1. 	I love these bibs!  The colors are cute, they are waterproof without having harsh chemicals or that plastic-y sound (that drives both of us nuts) and the velcro closure is strong enough to prevent a determined toddler from removing them mid-meal :-)  I would buy this product again or refer to a friend.	
1. 	We've had our Chicco Capri stroller for 6 years and I love it just as much today as I did in the past!  We also purchased it as a travel stroller when our first son was born, and it has been our go-to stroller ever since. It's been all over the country, and our 2 year-old now uses it!  Some of its best features are the travel bag (was great when we rented bikes in Key West-- I strapped it across my back and away I went), its light weight, 5 point harness, and fabric durability.  We have a red Capri and it's just as bright today as it was 6 years ago!  The only thing I added was a stroller organizer to the back (cup holder, key pocket, mesh bag) and now it's perfect!  You won't be disappointed!!!	
1. 	It was probably a great idea overall, but I did not find any use for it.When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine. At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster.The product is good, if you need it.	
1. 	I used this carrier from the time my baby was 3 weeks and still use it now that she is seven months.	
1. 	I think these membranes are supposed to be replaced every 3 months, but I didn't replace mine until they tore (at I think 6 months).  I bought this pack and these worked until I stopped pumping after 12 months.  These are pretty much the same thing you get with your pump originally.	
1. 	If you follow the instructions, these are pretty much trouble free.  The baby loves them and that's what really matters.  As with most products there are minor issues if you try to take short-cuts in assembly or preparation.  In the long term, a great product.	
1. 	Fits perfectly on the crib, helps with having the right items needed for changing time at hand. Like the material also, can be easily cleaned and sterilized.	
- 1	The item you get is NOT what is pictured.  The two sides are actually sewn togethere so you really can't stand the mirror up on its own...you have to prop it on something.  It is made out of cheap material, like ugly nylon.  The mirror is hideous and not worth the $10.	
1. 	We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.	
1. 	My daughter loves to do everything she can to make her sippy cups leak and make a huge mess.  After I opened these to test them out, the first thing she did was turn it over and start shaking it....and NO LEAKS.  Hallelujah!	
1. 	Very practical because we shop a lot - groceries, etc.  Baby (9 months+) likes to sit up and watch around her.  With this, she stays clean.  I keep it in the car.	
1. 	This booster is pretty handy to have! My 7-month-old uses it instead of a highchair. The only problem is that the moment I place her in it, she removes the white tray. Not sure why the manufacturer didn't place the fastener elsewhere. I just don't use the white tray or green cover. The blue tray fits securely on and easily washes in the dishwasher, so it's really no big deal. I've seen people bring it to playgroups, restaurants, etc. It fits perfectly on our chairs and I can push her right up to the table and counter without the tray.	
1. 	A second set of everything is a must for any mom who has to pump at her full-time job. I borrowed a friend's pump, bought this set of funnels/bottles/filters, and I no longer had to haul my pump back and forth every day. Huge timesaver.	
1. 	This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this.	
1. 	This bib is awesome. We bought two; one for home and one for the diaper bag. They're so easy to clean, and they're still machine washable (hang dry!). They're nice and big: they cover lots and lots of the front of our messy baby. I'm not sure how much the pocket helps, but I'm certainly not complaining.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor at the Apple store.  It was really easy to set up and the picture quality is great.  It's nice to be able to easily launch an app and view the baby from anywhere, not just on the home network.  BUT - the sound doesn't work.  All you hear is a staticy white noise.  Not only that, but the volume on the white noise is inconsistent.  It would get super loud suddenly, then cut down to nothing.  At one point in the night, the sound turned off altogether.  Thankfully the baby's room is close to our bedroom otherwise I wouldn't have heard her crying.  I contacted customer support about the sound issue and they had said an update to the app would be released near the end of the month (March 2014).  I was skeptical since the issue had been reported before and was even in their FAQs.  I asked if they were positive an update would be sent since I had only 2 weeks to return the monitor to Apple.  They advised me to return it and get a replacement.  I returned it, but I purchased the Medisala Monitor instead and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	My favorite toy.  My granddaughter, 10 months, and I play with it everyday.  It is the most creative toy she has.	
- 1	These bottles are extremely frustrating. Sometimes they leak, other times they don't. And after trying all the suggestions to prevent and stop leaking to no avail, I'm giving up. Do not buy! I have used Born-Free bottles while working as a nanny and never once had to deal with a leak. I reccomend those instead.	
1. 	My 9 month old loves this toy.  It feels good on his gums when he is teething and it keeps his attention as he bends and moves it.  I like that I can wash it in the sink too to disinfect it.	
1. 	so far so good. the hippo we purchased has been effective at preventing the child's head to hit the water spout. it has not come off yet either, which was a key consideration point, as other devices were too flimsy and easily taken off.	
1. 	This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!	
1. 	This product has been wonders for my 1st grand child.  She loves all the activities she can hear and do.  Very stimulating.	
1. 	It works amazingly to calm and sooth our 8 week old. I used to have trouble getting her to nap during the day and it is so calming for her to relax to fall asleep. A great product!	
1. 	While my first son almost never spit up, my second spits up ALL the time. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still a good bit. We've only been using these a few weeks, but he hasn't spit up near as much. It may be because he's getting older and eating more baby food and all, but I'll gladly give credit to the bottles!I'm going to point out a few things about these bottles that we've observed and you can decide whether that part is positive or negative.-After using straight bottles, these do take a bit of getting used to. Since the top is curved, it's easier to spill the formula if you don't turn it with the lower side towards you when pouring it in.-The small bottle is 6 ounces as opposed to 5 ounces on all the other bottles we've used. At first, I was really excited about this, but you still can't make a 6 ounce bottle using powdered formula. There's not enuogh room to mix it up. So, you can still only use it as a 4 ounce bottle IF using powdered formula. There's plenty of room if you're using liquid or breast milk for 6 ounces. (This set only has the 9 ounce bottles, though).-There's 6 pieces to put together for each bottle. Two pieces go together at the bottom, and 3 at the top. I'll admit sometimes it gets to be a pain with so many peices, but most bottles these days have a lot of pieces.-There's different colors, so there's a variety. I like that the colors are gender neutral. When you're putting the bottles together it does take a little more time trying to match up the tops and bottoms according to color, but that part isn't absolutely necessary. I like them to match, though.-The slow nipple is VERY slow! The fast nipple is VERY fast. I would prefer and in between. If you're using breast milk, the slow nipple is perfect. If you put cereal in the bottle, the fast nipple is perfect for that. It's fast enough that you don't have to widen the hole or anything. (I think this set only comes with fast nipples).Overall, we are VERY pleased with them! Even my husband is happy with them. :)	
1. 	I decided to try these even after reading some negative reviews that discussed the fact that these were not leak proof. However, this is one of the features I appreciate about these liners. Thye do not absorb anything and cannot become stained. They merely serve the purpose of making the transfer of dirty cloth diapers from the Mio bucket to the wash cleaner and easier. Of course your bucket will need to be washed because the bags are mesh and will allow drainage into the bucket, but I would rather have the dirty water that drains off my rinsed diapers to dump in the toilet than rolling around in the wash with the diapers I am trying to clean.	
1. 	very easy to clean, dries quickly. the keith haring print looks good on both boys and girls. I'm buying 3 more sets as gifts. I also have a Cutie Pie set, they are also great, only a little smaller.	
- 1	This is the only stroller I've ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to.  That being said...I bought this in Miro to go with the Chicco Keyfit 30 Carseat.  I did a lot of research before picking this stroller, and now I wish I had done more.CONS:-Wheels have a mind of their own.  Very hard to steer, even with both hands.  Forget using just one hand.  The wheels, even when you're trying to push forward, don't always face that way.  I run into EVERYTHING in stores, and I'm constantly running over my husband's feet.-Sunshade doesn't cover well unless the back is in the most forward position.  Also doesn't attach well, as it's constantly falling out of position.  If you pull it down too hard, it causes the backrest of the stroller to lurch upright, pulling the baby with it.- Basket is way too high.  Can't use the basket unless the back is completely upright.- Awkward handles make it feel like I can't get a good grip on the stroller.- The backrest is flimsy.  It's easy enough to adjust it one handed.  However, just slightly bumping it from behind causes it to lurch upright (again) pulling the baby with it.PROS:-The Chicco Keyfit carseat snaps into it.- Unfortunately, that's about it!	
1. 	What can i say, they loved playing with them. Until my dogs chewed them to pieces. But they're great for some water fun for the kids.	
1. 	Let me start off by saying there is probably no way that I would install this inside my house.  It is definitely not the most stylish or fancy looking safety net.  But for the purpose of an outdoor guard it is perfect.  My condo is on the second floor and while I wasn't concerned about my daughter falling through I didn't want to worry about her throwing her toys onto the deck below.  I didn't use the hooks and string that came with it because it looked sloppy and was frankly a bit of a pain to install.  So I used simple tack nails to tack down the bottom trim to the side of the deck beam and along the top to the rail.  The nails are nice and small and won't leave any longterm damage.  If you are looking for something a little less 'attached' then the twine they supply would work.  All in all a nice cheap solution for a deck toy barrier!  Just make sure you get more than one if you have a long deck.... one wasn't enough for me and I need to get another one.	
- 1	my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).  The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.  Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.  I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.  Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.  I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?  Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.	
- 1	The picture is correct - there are no stems in these diaphragms.  Now I'm at a loss as to where to find the replacement parts.	
- 1	It constantly slides down. She generally can't stick her arms or legs through near the bottom but, she will stick them above the bumper and pull it down. Now that she's pulling up on the sides of the crib, she frequently pulls them down and we can't get it to stay up.	
1. 	I breastfed my son so I didn't use these for his bottles, but I did use them to clean his straw cups.  Thanks to these brushes, I've been able to keep my favorites in great condition and not worry about what might be growing in the straw.  I recommend these to everyone I know with kids.  They've also made an inexpensive and useful gift!	
1. 	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).	
1. 	Baby has feeding issues so we have to feed him in an upright position (the NICU feed position)  Other bottles were hard to use in this position, but the angle of the ventaire makes it so easy.  The bottles have 5 pieces (body, nipple, collar, base and silicone vent) They are easy to clean and assemble, however if you do not dry the pieces well water will drip from around the bottom, or the collar.These are all white so great for boy or girl.  I did however prefer the brighter colors that the old ventaire bottles came in.(deep blues, purples, etc)	
- 1	This work ok... I didn't like how it fits and it should be included in the gate. Overall this gate wasn't a good one for me.. I was much happier with the Summer Extra Tall Gate	
1. 	I would have been okay with just the table corners. I have a glass table and I was worried about my 1-year-old niece visiting.The corners helped a lot as did putting a tablecloth over my table. There was no way the table guard was going to work around my glass table even with the tape included though. It's for a much thicker table and my glass table was too thin.Also, my niece is still crawling so the guard wasn't necessary. Even when she stood up, she couldn't reach the table and she was safe as houses in her booster seat and high chair.	
1. 	These are perfect for cleaning sippy cup straws, especially the yucky milk residue that builds up in them.  Whatever the dishwasher misses I get out with this.  And when I'm done I just pop these into the dishwasher to disinfect.We have mostly Playtex insulator sippys, but I've noticed that they will work with pretty much any straw.  They seemed flimsy at first, but they hold up and get the job done!	
- 1	The site I bought this of left off the description that it was the travel size so I was miffed from the start. However, since this thing is made in China, it should have been me first clue that it was a piece of junk.No matter how many times I replace the batteries with new, fresh ones...the thing either doesn't turn on at all or cuts off after a few seconds. Can you imagine how irritating this is with a crying baby or one you are trying to get to sleep?I would really love to love this thing, but it sucks. The idea is great but I don't know if I got a lemon also (like someone else mentioned) but this product is so unreliable and it's not worth the higher price tag. I'm so disappointed. I've written Cloud B and hope I get a response. A new product would be welcomed. I'd also second what someone said about how it sucks that it goes off after 23/45 minutes however, it would for sure run out of batteries in an instant if it was on continuously.	
1. 	We love these bibs, not only because of their graphic and interesting designs, but because they are easy to use and clean! We usually rinse them well and hang them to dry, and then throw them in the laundry once a week. We bought another three pack after we fell in love with the first pack. And we get people who stop us because they think it's so cool that we have Keith Haring bibs for our baby.	
- 1	I thought the fabric on this felt cheap and the black &#34;leather&#34; parts were very obvious that they were plastic (and cheap thin plastic at that).  All in all, I was very disappointed with this product and returned it.	
- 1	I bought this because it was recommended on another site for the Mountain Buggy Urban Jungle. Although it can strap onto the stroller, putting any drinks in the cup-holders would clearly result in a mess on whomever is pushing the stroller. The Organizer itself is fine, just not with this particular stroller	
- 1	After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!	
- 1	The suction cup doesn't stick at all. The other suction toys work just fine. Seems to be cheap plastic/not stretchy enough	
1. 	Your membranes will get worn out after some time. I usually replace mine about once a month...I pump twice a day at work during the week.	
1. 	Please, please take this to the hospital with you- you'll thank me later. We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &#34;out of it&#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns. Can't recommend enough!	
1. 	I used to have one of these small baby tubs with a hammock for newborn.the Hammock thing was great when she was a newborn but as soon as I stopped using it and put her straight into the baby tub she would just slipped, flipped and I always need to hold her which made it very hard to clean her....this tub just solved all of these issues.she is hold into place and can freely splash and move without me holding her and in exchange I have my 2 hands free to clean her.PROS:the design is such that:Baby can lie down and splash and play while being hold well.Baby can sit and play while being hold well.This is a two stage tub-it looks big but fits well in my bathtub which is very standard.CONS:Nothing yet.UPDATE:Baby is now 10 months and she still fits in the tub (and she is very tall- size of an 18 month old baby)- I will keep using it as long as I can as it way better than dealing with the regular bathtub. I like it so much that when we go on vacation I always try to find a baby equipment company renting that kind of tub.	
- 1	I got one based on the review last year for about $20. Baby used it while teething, but not like everyday. like other people say, it is a squeaking toy similar to dog toys. Nothing special and i do not think it is worth $20.Update: it was left outside for a couple of weeks. the whole thing became sticky and something was peeled off in some places. the colors disappeared (maybe peeled?) in some places. Does that mean the baby was eating paint/material slowly? not sure. I trashed it.	
1. 	We found this diaper stacker to get the job done. It is made of a very white square patterned fabric, not your typical pique so we were a bit disappointed by that. Also, the base and top are lined with cardboard, which isn't great to put in the washing machine, but we took the base out and washed the rest and it held up in the wash fine--and we hung to dry. It holds 3 rows of diapers if you tightly pack, otherwise two rows, essentially one giant box! We were very happy and surprised with that! We tied ours (two ties at the top) to a fabric-covered hanger, and it has worked beautifully. This is extremely basic, not luxe in any way, but classic and we have been pleased with it!	
- 1	The only thing this thing needs to do is keep wipes moist and available for on-the-go use: it doesn't.  It doesn't shut or seal completely and my wipes dry-out within a day.  If it didn't cost me $4 to return it, I would.  It's horrible, don't buy it.  Your better off buying the travel packs of wipes with the plastic lid on them for when you are out.  Such a bummer because the large wipes dispenser from OXO that matches this is great.	
1. 	I purchased this before my son was born, and he started sitting in it around 6 months of age, when we started feeding him.  It was easy to clean, although the nylon straps sometimes got food on them.  I spot-treated them as necessary and they appeared to clean up okay.  Fast forward 2 years... I attached this seat to one of my patio chairs on our porch this summer so that we could have family meals outside.  Within 1 month in the summer heat, visible mildew grew on all of the straps...I suppose it was living off of 2 years of food residue.  I cut the straps that went around my son's waist so that he wouldn't be exposed to them, and continued to use it strapless.My brother had the same seat and put his in a storage locker for a period of time.  They had the same issue - black mildew grew on the straps, and they tossed theirs as a result.I suppose any highchair with nylon straps would have the same issue if exposed to heat.  Fisher price is now using a high tech rubber on some of their chair straps, but they cost upward of $100, and you could buy 4 of these for that price.  This chair is a cheap alternative.  Just don't store it in warm places, or use outside in the heat.	
1. 	This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.	
- 1	So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.	
- 1	I bought it for the crib, and it simply won't even BEGIN to fit around it. Please note our crib is a slim type and not ornate or thick like the one pictured here, so if it didn't fit ours, it probably won't fit yours, either. If we had tried any harder to pull the elastic around the edges of the crib, the netting and elastic would have ripped apart. We will, however, use it for the mini-Co Sleeper (Arms' Reach). You may also be able to use it on a bassinet.	
- 1	I bought these tubes a while ago as a back up and waited to use them.  They are not the same as the Medela tubing - the plastic is thicker so they don't fit onto the pump as well and the manilla colored pieces are different so they don't fit into the connector pieces as well.  They'll work in a pinch, but because they didn't fit just right they reduced suction so that my pump was far less effective.  I don't think you can find them on Amazon and they're more expensive, but it's worth it to buy the official Medela tubing.  The membranes on the other hand fit and worked perfectly.	
- 1	I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born. However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher, they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic. No other bottle kept that smell, it permeated my home for days!!! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong, they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back. I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30. It was offensive and disgraceful. Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info. Disgraceful company. Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick. The smell in the air was awful enough!!	
- 1	The site I bought this of left off the description that it was the travel size so I was miffed from the start. However, since this thing is made in China, it should have been me first clue that it was a piece of junk.No matter how many times I replace the batteries with new, fresh ones...the thing either doesn't turn on at all or cuts off after a few seconds.

- 1	My toddler is really loves to pull plugs out of the wall and put them back into the outlets.  This seemed like the perfect fix.  Not exactly.It's flimsy.  The backplate and the door come apart easily.  My toddler just has to shake the door hard and it comes off.  One day, he somehow turned the entire unit upside down (it was empty)!  Plus, only thinner plugs will fit into the case, not one with a stiffer cord like my vacuum cleaner or a computer cord.	
1. 	Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't use them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the talking potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.	
1. 	My son loves this gym! The lights and music keep his attention and the mat is super soft. He seems to really like the colors and the toys. It folds in half so I can store it when he isn't using it!	
1. 	This is one of the essential products for every mom. I used it only for 1 month though, during the time my nipples were sore.It was a sanity saver.	
1. 	I hated switching from a standard bottle to the avent bottle and now I can just pop an avent bottle on my original pump. I am going to clear out all of my normal bottles and only have the avent bottles in the house. This is going to clear up so much space.	
1. 	We love this stroller for our twins!  It is lightweight and easy to put in and take out of the car.  We have had no problems with it and it is so easy to push.  So much better than the front and back which look so obnoxious to me.  The only negatives are the weak basket (drags a bit) and the cup holder is worthless.  Otherwise, you can't find a better stroller- only weighs 14 lbs.!	
1. 	&#34;Take and toss&#34; sums it up perfectly -- these are perfect for toddlers who are more interested in tool use than actually eating, and more to the point, toddlers who count &#34;spear throwing&#34; as &#34;tool use&#34;!PROS* Bumpy, squeezy handles make for easy gripping* Fun, mix-and-match colors* Good valueCONS* For actually coming into contact with food, the softish plastic concerns me somewhat. I will NOT be giving these to my toddler to use with warm foods or even for regular meals. Instead, I'm reserving them for picnics/outings and this specific stage at which she's just playing with her food (not much eating it).	
1. 	These are the only sheets I have ever used in my son's crib. I bought one regular sheet to cover the mattress, and I've never taken it off. I just use my Ultimate Crib Sheets. I have three; I would recommend that number. I can't imagine how much of a pain it would be to have to lift the crib mattress up to change sheets...this is just SO EASY snap, snap, snap and you're done!I never dry mine in the dryer. I hang it on a drying rack and it's usually dry after a few hours. I want mine to last, and using the dryer tends to wear them out. I've never not had one on hand, with 3 total.	
- 1	I would not recommend this. It's awkward, doesn't distribute weight properly, and doesn't support baby. I purchased a lillebaby carrier after and love it. The lillebaby is pricey, but in this case, for me, I got what I paid for.	
- 1	I have 4 children ages range from 24 to 1 and over the years Safety First has become a joke!! The cabinet/Drawer locks are great for keeping ADULTS out of the cabinets!! The Door nob covers, my toddlers (1 & 2) walk right trough them! And the Outlet covers, my 1 year old daughter pulls them right off and they are small enough that she can choke on them!!!! How Safe is that?????? Safety First??? Safety Joke!!!!!	
- 1	other packs have 12 washcloths which is great!!! this one has 10.  i gave two stars because the material is folding, and it's thin.  i wish it wouldn't fold when dry.	
- 1	The previous reviewer is correct. For $15 you get ONE box of bags. They also don't fit right. I made them work because I had too, but I won't buy these again.	
1. 	My 9 month old daughter hates being in the pack and play, but needs to be kept safe from the 2 and 4 year olds.  This yard is PERFECT!!!  It is big enough that babies don't feel trapped, but they are safe while you get things done.  I wish I had bought it with my first child!	
1. 	I couldn't wait to put my daughter in her papasan chair. Unfortunately, she didn't fit into it well until she was about two months old (about 9 lbs.) I wish it had different reclining positions, it just sat too upright for a small baby. But now, she loves it. She can sit and watch her videos or take a nap. It also has the perfect setting of vibration and the music it plays is just beautiful, not like cheesy, cartoony lullaby music.	
1. 	We grabbed this tub @BrUs when our little guy started arching past the guard in his infant tub. It's been a great investment! When he first started to sit up he could lounge against the tail and I actually think the fact that it's inflatable helped strengthen his core enough to sit up successfully. If he topples over he lands on cushy air! Now that he's crawling, he flops all around, but the tub still prevents him from crawling out since he can't seem to get his balance on the wobbly surface. Well worth the money!	
- 1	I don't know why so many people like this thing. It is nice that it takes so little space, but it comes apart very easily. I have cleaned goldfish crackers up off the floor and out of my purse because it has come apart. Disappointing.	
1. 	I like to hang it on the side of my sons changing table and at the end of the day I just take it out. It smells so fresh and keeps odors at a minimum. Sooo much cheaper than those pails and you can bring a few for when you are out in public with no trash bin around.	
- 1	I wanted to love this projector but it just wasn't as great as the reviews I'd read described it.  It looks and feels pretty cheap.  The projector is just a stationary image that switches between 2 slides.  There are a lot of controls/switches that just made it more complicated than I wanted.  Returning it.	
- 1	This just kept tipping over and/or falling off, so we returned it. The fastener just isn't very strong. When you would fold up the stroller, this would get tweaked. Not a good product.	
- 1	Our daughter did not like being in the harness. She would just fight it so we just bought her theHape Wonder Walkerand feel this was more of a developmental tool to aid in her learning how to walk. Plus the walker is really a work of art in our eyes. It is simple and beautifully crafted at the same time. It is very stable and my daughter enjoys pushing it around along with all of her toys.	
- 1	One of the main reasons I didn't like this product was that it didn't work inside the bath tub. It only worked if you hung it on the flat shower wall. Because we don't have a shower wall where my kids bathe, I would have liked it if we could hang it on the bath tub wall inside where it can drip cleanly. The problem is that the bath tub walls are curved unlike a flat shower wall.	
1. 	I spent more time cleaning my 8 months old highchair after he would eat. I saw this bib come through and Amazon email and read the reviews and decided to buy ASAP!!! We used it already and yay....for catching all the food that would undoubtedly fall on my LO lap and get stuck between his highchair and clothes...etc. He didn't like me putting it on him... since its a bit stiff and he wants to chew on it... but once we started eating he forgot all about that... It washes so easy too! Hope to buy another one soon!	
1. 	I use these with my Medela pump in style advanced with no issues whatsoever. I love them better then the bags, they are easier to store in my opinion, they don't leak, easy to thaw, easy to heat in a bottle warmer. They are the perfect 2 oz size for my newborn baby who takes between 2-4 oz per feeding. I have bought 2 boxes to keep me going for a while.	
1. 	I am renting a Medela Symphony, and I also have the Freestyle. I love the latter because it's a closed system, so milk doesn't get in the tubes. My one gripe with the Symphony (before purchasing these) was that I had to constantly clean and dry the tubing because milk seemed to back up into the tubes nearly every time. I have two close friends who use the Pump In Style Advanced, and they had the same complaint. No more!The design of the one-piece breastshields is slightly different from the two-piece solution. The tubing connects higher up and behind a ridge of plastic, so the air still gets through, but the milk flows straight down, and well below the connector. The result is that, while I still get a bit of condensation, I do not get milk backing up into the tubing like it did with the two-piece kit. I'm so pleased! They do take slightly more effort to clean than the two-piece kit, but that is made up for in SPADES by not having to clean the tubing. I can just run the pump for a few minutes to dry out the tubing between pumping sessions and clean it less often. Definitely worth the trade! It's a shame they don't come in more sizes (yet).I am using the Simple Wishes hands-free bra, and it works fine with these. I know some models have small openings meant for the two-piece kits, but the Simple Wishes bra has one panel with a horizontal slit and another with a vertical slit, so you can get pretty much any size breastshield through it with a bit of effort, and it still holds really well once it's on. Do check your local BRU before purchasing these online, as they had a better price at the time of this review.	
1. 	Bought as a back up cover, it's plush, not very thick, but does the job and is soft. My son has never complained.	
1. 	It is true that these bottles have quite a few parts to clean, but I consider it totally worth it.  My son has had less gas since we've been using these bottles.  I've never had a problem with them leaking.  There's a line on them that you're not supposed to fill past, as long as the milk isn't filled past that line you shouldn't have a leaking problem. My son loves the nipple, as a previously breastfed baby it was easy for him to transfer to this bottle.  As another reviewer mentioned, don't even bother buying the 4 ounce bottles.  At two months my son is already at 5 ounces, so we barely got any use out of them.  The 8 ounce bottles are all you need.	
- 1	These little guys seem cool until you get them. They do not squeek or crinkle as good as they should. The string that they hang by seems like it might come apart in babies mouth. Overall they seem kind of flimsy. Would not recommend.	
- 1	We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby's carseat. Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad (putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly), the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way (knee in seat, tugging hard), and the carseat didn't budge a bit.Our car has fabric, not leather seats, but the seats are contoured. I think because of the thickness of the pad, it doesn't conform to the shape of the seat, but becomes an additional surface, which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else, much cheaper, for the back of the seat, rather than something underneath the carseat, and that worked great. I think using a towel could work fine, underneath the carseat, for some protection, without sliding issues.	
- 1	The shape of the pads is very awkward. The pad (inside portion) is slightly larger than the outer, so that the pad actually curves away from you instead of cupping. If there were some darts sewn into the circle it could conform to the natural shape of a woman. Even in a sports bra you can see the raised edges of the pad. On top of the shape, the lining sticks to my skin and borders on pain when peeling it away from my skin. The idea of this pad is great, the execution not so much.	
1. 	we love this baby wash- we still use it on our 2 year old in fact.  It smells great and is very mild.  I recommend to all my expecting friends.	
- 1	We ony got this nipple and bottle because it's compatible with the professional grade Ameda breast pump machines. All of the other nipples we are aware of are medium to fast flow. We mistakenly thought that this was a slow flow nipple.[Good]The sturdiness of the nipple itself: Which competing products, the nipple bends and our baby just ends up playing with it leading to bad breast feeding and twisting while feeding. With this nipple, it's so sturdy that it keeps our baby still instead of constantly twisting and moving his head and body.Cool Looking: Pretty high tech in terms of initial impressions.No drip: The nipple requires suction before liquid starts flowing.[Bad]Fast flow: Yes the initial flow is slow. The baby needs to build suction. However once flow starts, it ends up flowing way too fast. It's so fast that our baby ends up choking multiple times during a feeding. This is anything but natural. About 30 minutes later, our baby has thrown up his milk. This hasn't happened with the cheaper nipples.Air Intake Prevention: This is no different from a cheaper nipple.Bottle Doesn't Dry: I'm not sure why, but this bottle takes a lot longer to dry than a normal bottle. I'm guessing it's probably due to the upper lip. I don't know why purpose that serves other than for aesthetics. Someone didn't test this product very well.Price: Given its big flaws, it doesn't deserve the price premium. It is way too expensive.[Verdict]This is not a breast milk feeding bottle. Real breasts do not drown babies in milk. Do not buy this garbage.	
- 1	It's just made very cheaply and wasn't worth the hassle. It also never seemed to block out the sun, which always seemed to be coming from another direction than the two back windows.	
1. 	I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.	
1. 	I love this nursing cover and feel very comfortable nursing in public with it.  I chose the Papillon because I thought it's harder to see when it gets dirty and won't have to worry about the cloth being translucent while I BF in the sunlight.  It works really well for me and I don't go out without it, but the baby gets really hot and uncomfortable towards the end of the feeding.  I also need to wear clothes that opens in the front because it has no back and if I had to pull my top up, people can see my bare side and back.  I'm fine with that since the baby gets hot enough without the back, I would it would be even hotter if the baby is covered all around.	
1. 	This is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  It does the job well.	
- 1	I'm not sure how this received a high rating because it is a very cheap mattress. We purchased it because of its overall high rating, and we wanted a mattress that would work with the Angelcare movement monitor. When we received it, we immediately noticed that the material and the feel of the foam were of a lower quality than we anticipated. When we put the fitted sheet on it, the mattress compressed so much that it became a couple of inches shorter than it was without the sheet, leaving a large and unsafe space between it and the crib. Because of this, we imagine that, like other customers have pointed out, the mattress itself will lose support over time and be unsafe for the baby.We already had the Simmons dual-sided mattress for our baby's crib, and although it doesn't seem compatible with a movement sensor, the quality is very good.	
- 1	Since there were great reviews and this thermometer was so pricey I figured it'd be great. Unfortunately I haven't liked this at all. I could do four readings in a row and get vastly different temperatures each time. Getting an accurate reading is really important so I stopped using this and will probably have to get a new thermometer.	
1. 	I purchased one of these back in 2003 (for our dog).  Now I wanted another pressure-mounted, hands-free gate for our toddler and this is the product I immediately thought of purchasing.I was extremely disappointed when I received the gate and realized that there is no longer a ramp to help prevent tripping over the lower bar.  I thought that feature was one of the main advantages of the older gate version.  Why would the manufacturer discontinue that?  Surely it would not cost a lot more to include that piece, and I think parents would be willing to pay a few extra dollars for added safety.Fortunately I was able to find another product that solved the problem for me:Tee-Zed Dreambaby No-Trip Gate Ramp, WhiteIt's not as perfect a fit as the original ramp, but it still works very well.  Kudos to Dreambaby for thinking of selling such a product.  I wish The First Years product manager would reconsider including the ramp with this gate.	
- 1	Ordered &#34;colors may vary&#34; hoping they'd be blue or green. They are pink which render them useless for my little boy. Waste of money.	
1. 	These definitely hold in the odor. We just have a small open trash can in our nursery, and we put dirty diapers in these. We've never had any issues with smell. We are on our third box now, and we've used them since the baby was born. He's turning one next week. Highly recommend these. Don't bother with the expensive diaper pails that require a specific bag... seriously. Just use a small trash can and these bags, and you're set. We also use these for dog duty sometimes and put wet clothes in them on occasion.	
- 1	(sigh) I've been using this pump for 4 months.  Correction: I've been using the product for 4 months.  The first wasn't sucking well and I was drying out (my daughter won't latch so I pump exclusively).  Ameda said it was warrantied and sent another.  It didn't work at all.  They sent a third.  It lasted all of 3 weeks.  Ameda offered me the Ultra or a full-refund.  I opted for the Ultra.  So far the Ultra is fine (it's only been 2 weeks, though), but I've been nickeled and dimed to death on parts.  The tubing didn't last a week (after a couple of sets I put Medela tubing on it and it works just fine).  The diaphragms have been replaced twice, the little white pieces at the bottoms of the flanges have been replaced at least 3 times each, the adapter that connects the tubing to the machine has been replaced 3 times (once after 2 days).  I'm about to spend another $12 on new flanges (one never worked right).  Of course until this week I didn't know the parts were warrantied for 3 months so I've been fighting with garbage parts and then replacing them out of my own pocket.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because Ameda is very good about replacing the parts.  Everything was here within one day... other than the adapter.  I called at 9 am, but the order wasn't placed until 4pm so I had to wait 2 days.  Doesn't sound like much, but when you must pump a day is the difference between nursing and formula feeding.*Update: Pump number 4 (the Ultra) stopped working.  I called and requested my full refund.Firstly, let me back track a little.  When I called about the adapter piece it was 9 am.  They were supposed to overnight it.  When I didn't receive it the next day I called.  Apparently the agent did not place my order until 4 pm, thus making the order take TWO days.  When your child refuses to latch and this is your only source of feeding the child a day is very critical.Fast forward to pump number 4 not working (chugging, whistling, grinding, and barely sucking).... I called to request the refund around 3 pm.  The call was answered by the agent who neglected to put my adapter order in for a full business day.  She told me there was no such note in my account stating I could have a refund and I would have to produce a receipt.  I informed her, yet again, that this was a gift and the receipt was long gone by the giver.  She stated they would not refund my money.  She then stated she could have her supervisor pull the call logs to see if the agent did, in fact, offer me a refund without the receipt.  She then told me she would return my call.  At 6 pm when I did not hear back I tried to call.  The center was closed (Keep in mind that if you know who placed a call, what day, and what time, pulling a call in a call center should not take more than a few minutes so making me wait for hours was unacceptable).  The next morning she called back right when they opened and told me they'd refund the money, but I'd have to return not only the pump unit, but also all of the parts (keep in mind I paid for these parts out of pocket as stated in my first review, and I was NOT giving them these to resell even if I couldn't use them on another pump).  She then stated that I would have to return the unit and within TEN days after receiving the unit their accounting department would send me a check.  I told her this is unacceptable and I needed to talk to her supervisor.I was transferred to a very combative woman.  She stated that there was nothing she could or would do to make this process faster.  I stated HP takes credit card information and if you don't return the product then they charge you.  She got very nasty and said most people have the money to go out and buy another and use the check issued by Evenflo to reimbures themselves.  Okay, I don't know where this woman got off talking to me like I'm some kind of trash, but I assured her if I were trying to scam their company I would not have replaced the unit repeatedly.  Furthermore, my husband makes excellent money, not that I owe her an explanation of why I want the money faster.  I asked to talk to her supervisor, who was not in the office, but returned my call.I received a call back from the director of some department promptly.  She was outraged that I was treated like this.  While this is their policy, she said to call her when I send the package (FedEx would bring me a paid label so they'd have the tracking number to verify shipment) and she'd have accounting cut me a check so I'd have it this week.Bottom line, their products are garbage.  In the end it didn't matter that 8 of 10 customer service agents were wonderful because those 2 left a disgusting taste in my mouth.  My problem is solved (I borrowed a friend's Medela to pump-and-dump and keep milk flowing until my parts come for my Medela hospital-grade rental), but I will shout from the rooftops, STAY AWAY FROM AMEDA AND EVENFLO FOR BREASTPUMPS!!  They claim these products are near-hospital-grade.  I beg to differ.Do yourself a favor if you are like me and have to pump full-time: Call your local hospital or medical supply stores and find a rental.  I called around and found a unit for $45 a month... which is about what I was spending on Fenugreek and Mother's Milk Tea to try to keep my milk flowing during the  Great Ameda Disaster of 2012.  Your sanity alone is worth a little more than $10 a week!	
1. 	I recommend the large quilted multi-use pad in addition.  I have about 4 of them and they are essential.  I use John Lennon receiving blankets (6 is a good number) with an quilted absorbing pad underneath to be prepared for spills and smudges on my contoured changing pad. I do the same on his crib to save me the headache of changing crib sheets which are very tedious to get off and on. It's nearly impossible to do when you've had a c-section, and not a good idea to strain yourself.	
1. 	helped with aches and sleep trouble for 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  will definitely use in future pregnancies and recommend to anyone who has trouble getting comfortable.  slipcover is easy to remove and wash, but pretty hard to put back on.  worth the trouble though.	
1. 	I love these cups!  The size is great (slightly smaller than the normal sippy cups) - the size is especially nice for taking on a trip or just throwing in the diaper bag so water is available.  Plus, they do not leak, which is a must for us!  We definitely like them.	
1. 	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.	
1. 	I originally used the Avent hand pump, but I realized after 2 months that I had to get an electric pump because my hand hurt and it took too long to pump.  I absolutely love this pump.  I accidentally sat on one of the tubes and it caused a piece to break off of the plug, but it still keeps suction and I haven't had to replace it.  I will with the next baby though.  It's relatively quiet for an electric pump too.  The bag is cute and discreet so I never feel awkward carrying it.  I would recommend buying the steam cleaning bags too -- they'll save you a lot of time.  I really think that this pump made it possible for me to return to work and continue to nurse.  Well worth the money, especially if you plan to have another baby in the future.  Don't forget to buy the car adapter as well!	
- 1	I've had then wet bags for about 2 years now and they are just okay.  The drawstring gets stuck, so bad that I replaced the string with something slicker to try and alleviate the issue.  It's better, but still frustrating.  It's only one lays and pretty much equivalent to any plastic bag (ie shopping bag) but you can wash and reuse.I keep them in my diaper bag for dirty/wet cloth diapers and they only hold 2 diapers so they aren't really large, but a good size for this use.Online now to order another brand, because I'm tired of fighting the drawstring.	
- 1	I've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them. I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer. Not handy or helpful.	
1. 	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!	
1. 	We were looking for something that keeps our 10 month old twins clothes clean during solid feeds. We tried every bib out there, but finally found this. This product is great because it keeps their sleeves clean, as well as the rest of the clothes. It's definitely more expensive than bibs, but you get your money back by not needing to use stain remover!	
- 1	This is likely a very good car seat if you have unlimited space but it couldn't come close to fitting in either of our cars (Subaru Outback and Mazda 5).  We returned ours.  It really is gargantuan, good for protection bad for fitting in a vehicle.	
1. 	These are great but the aware that they have fast flow nipples. My son is four months old and only used to the slow flow nipples &#8211; these come with fast flow so I had to purchase a set of slow flow nipples &#8211; and they do make a huge difference&#8230; My son will not drink out of the fast ones &#8211; he leaks everywhere and does not get anything down&#8230;	
1. 	These are my baby's all-time favorite spoons. They are wide enough to pick up quite a bit of food and get it in his mouth without (too much) mess, and soft enough on his cheeks and gums. The low, wide base of the bowl makes it very difficult to tip over. Totally worth it the price.	
- 1	poor rating because my baby sucked half air half milki liked it because i thought it was going to come in handyi would probably not recommend it	
1. 	Works great. I keep it under the regular 'waterproof' mattress cover for when there is (rarely happens) a full bladder whoops from my recently potty-trained daughter.	
- 1	I ordered this for my 2 year old but she cannot fit in the harness. I am sending it back today. too small - it says it is for up to 40lbs.. there is no way a child that big could use this. plus it is flimsy....	
- 1	These would have been great if the nipples were the same as the other Dr. Brown's bottles. Unfortunately, they are slightly bigger and not interchangeable. At this time, my 3 month old son is unable to use these bottles due to the different nipple size. I am currently using the long Dr. Brown 8oz bottles that are not wide in the bottle neck area.	
- 1	I have a Graco travel system and a City Mini stroller. This arch didn't fit on any of those items. It was too short to stretch and attach to the carseat or strollers and when I tried to attach it, the toys were right in my daughter's face. I was able to attach it to the bouncy seat on the floor but that already came with a toy bar so this was pointless for us.	
1. 	My 3-yr old loves his new alligator travel pillow! Can't wait to put it to the real test this upcoming 4-day weekend!	
1. 	I loved this. I don't covering up while nursing but if you have to this is the Cover to get. At least you can see the baby and don't have to worry about cloth covering them completely. The wire rim is awesome it however isn't very pliable. I do wish it had some sort of strap to tie it around that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I would recommend this to anyone who is breastfeeding.  It is the best one on the market as far as I am concerned.	
1. 	This is a pretty good sheet. It looks good, but it is a tad loose for my taste. The looseness is unattractive and makes the pattern kind of sag. It does not seem to be loose enough to cause any difficulties for baby to me though.	
- 1	I have a standard Greco pack n play and I found that this sheet was too small. It scrunched the play yard matt and was not comfortable for my baby so I had to return it.Do yourself a favor and just buy the standard crib sheet of Carter's Velor sheet and use it in the pack n play and crib. That's what I did and yes it's a tad too big and you have to pull the extra sheet under the pack n play mattress but it fits WAY better.	
1. 	I have used Avent nipples for all 3 of my kids.  They are a great product at a great price on Amazon especially if you can get the free shipping!	
1. 	I have a 4 year old, and didn't think I would be needing a double stroller when I was pregnant with my now 6 month old. I quickly realized that shopping with 2 kids was quite the challenge! I saw this stroller one day when I was out running errands, and knew it would be perfect for my family. I didn't want a huge bulky tandem stroller, so this seemed ideal for my 4 year old to have a place to sit or stand when she was too tired to walk. It is a bit heavy to get in and out of the car, but it's manageable. The infant seat adapter works well with our Chicco Keyfit infant seat. I did order the parent organizer, which I highly recommend doing since there is not a built-in place for small things like your keys and phone. Overall, I would recommend this for anybody who is looking for a double stroller to use with their older child.	
1. 	I bought this crib mattress after seeing it recommended in the book Baby Bargains.  I have now used it for 2 of my children, and my sister is using 2 of them for her twin girls.  We LOVE these matresses.  They are super lightweight, which means that changing sheets is super easy.  That is really nice for the middle of the night accidents!  I would recommend these crib mattresses to everyone!	
1. 	This is a great playpen pad.  Lots of cushion and easy to put on.  I bought 2 of them.	
- 1	We returned this product.  I didn't like the fact that you could never really get all the water out of it which led me to believe that over time, mold would grow inside.  Also, the plate part and suction base are not one piece so my child was able to easily pull on it to remove it from the highchair tray and spill all the contents all over herself and the floor.  Not good in my book :-(	
1. 	I registered for this item but when I didn't receive it, it wasn't one of those MUST items I purchased to prepare for the baby's arrival. I thought of it more as a marketing gimmic and not really a necessity. After my son was born he hated diaper changes (the winter weather didn't help with the coldness of the wipe). I purchased this and now he doesn't scream.By the time you pull the wipe out and use it, the wipe is no longer warm but it does stay at room temperature. I gave it four stars b/c the top wipe is usually dry and the light is more of a feature to locate to warmer, it doesn't give off light like a nightlight. Otherwise, I'd say this is well worth getting, especially for the winter.	
- 1	I didn't like them.... They are too small and very thick, they show thru your clothes. I use instead the evenflow, they are very thin and larger than this.	
1. 	I have to pump milk for my daughter at my office, and getting my pump parts clean was challenging.  Our sink doesn't put out enough got water for me to feel that my parts were really clean and safe.  Now, I wash the parts and then put them through a steam sterilization in the office microwave, and I pump with the confidence that I'm not adding harmful bacteria to my breastmilk.  It also serves as a nice place to store my pump parts at the office, where I know they will remain clean and untouched.	
- 1	If I could give it zero stars, I would!  It is poorly made and cheap...I guess you get what you pay for!  The wood and joints squeak no matter what and it's VERY annoying when rocking a baby!  What a waste of money--you will regret this if you purchase it!!	
1. 	We have been using these for a few months and they are on our must have baby gift giving list.  They are easy to use, almost always easy to clean (except bananas) and a great way to introduce foods.  Love this product.	
- 1	I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.	
1. 	These are great and inexpensive covers! The quality of material is great! I bought two for myself and am giving as baby gifts bc I love them so much!	
- 1	The suction cups are too cheaply made to adhere to any tile or tub surface I've tried. I'm going to return it.	
1. 	We wanted a new booster for our toddler as we started using her Fisher Price Booster seat for our younger son.  The Prince Lionheart booster is great.  Nice and comfortable for our little girl and really easy to clean!	
1. 	These bibs were a great solution for our son who drools A LOT.  The fabric is absorbent, but better yet, there is a lining between the two layers of fabric to keep the other side, and anything underneath it, dry.However, the way the velcro closure is designed, the hard side of the velcro was always irritating the back of my son's neck.  This wasn't the worst thing, because it is simple enough to put the bib on backwards, or upside down, with the larger tag in the front, as opposed to underneath, which prevented the neck irritation.This product does not get more than 4 stars because it just seems poorly designed to not just have the two pieces of velcro swapped to be in opposite positions.Plus, the velcro wears out really quickly, and they begin to no longer stay on very quickly.Overall, I would recommend this product, with the warning to put them on backwards, or upside down, or however you want to call it.  I have had no other bibs that absorb as well as these and that keep clothes as dry as these do.	
1. 	This is a good, sturdy and well finished product. The reduced size implies that it can fit easily into smaller rooms prevalent in typical apartments. That said, I do not see any reason why this crib should not be used in a larger house as well. Under no circumstances is it small for a baby.Some reviewers have mentioned that it is so light that it can easily be moved around; I do not really agree on that. It is quite heavy and an average adult will have a tough time trying to move it.Pros and cons follow:Pros:1) Well finished product. It's heavy & sturdy with a premium finish.2) Adjustable height for the mattress positioning.3) Available in multiple color options.4) Decently priced. Its build and quality easily compares with much more expensive products in the market.5) Additional accessories for converting it to a twin size bed are available.Cons:1) The assembly: If you are used to Ikea style instructions then you may be in for a disappointment. The instructions, though sufficient are by no means fool proof. Take special care regarding the small and the larger screws. (The sizes are not very different and for some reason the small slots can easily accommodate the larger screws, its only later when I reached the larger slots, I realized that the screws were falling short). Ikea usually marks the instructions with an explicit cross on when not to use a similar looking but different sized screw.The other thing is that there are more holes in the legs than required, which makes it difficult to figure out how to assemble things. I think it maybe due to the fact that the same set of legs maybe used for both the mini and full crib sets. The tough instructions apart, after spending some time on it, it shouldn't be too hard to get this thing setup. It did take me a full 2 hours or so to get it setup. (But then I've never been really good at these DIY jobs).2) Lack of accessories in standard retailers: Given the non-uniform size, it is sometimes harder to get a choice of accessories for this crib at regular retailers. Amazon however is a good source of all accessories. I have listed down a few of those which go well with this crib below:A full set can be made up with the following purchases:a) Mattress :CRESCENT MINI CRIB 50 COIL MATTRESSb) Fitted crib sheet:Fitted Portable Crib Sheetc) Mattress pad cover:American Baby Company Waterproof Fitted Quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad Cover	
1. 	This is a fast and convenient way to heat bottles.  I have twins and can't wait the recommended 10minutes between bottles for it to cool down so I don't.  I don't have any problems with it.  I use first years gum drop bottles	
- 1	I got this because I got a boppy with my first dd and was disappointed in it. I am overweight but not huge and the boppy just didn't fit. I figured since this had the belt type adaptation it would maybe suit me better so I was really looking forward to using this for bf this time around. Well I have tried several times and it just isn't comfortable. I'm 5'4 and 200 pounds it's snug but it just doesn't seem that supportive and I'm still having to lift the baby to me too much. I have just found using several pillows (some are throw pillows and others are regular ones) are just more supportive and work better for baby and I. Unfortunately I ordered this when I was around 6 months pregnant and so I can't return it bc with a newborn coming I washed the outside shell so now I'm out that money. If you can with any of these I would try to use someone else's for one or two bf sessions first before ordering one just to make sure it fits and that you find it comfortable so you're not out the money. It seems like good quality, and does fit better than the boppy so thus the 2 stars but sense I still can't use it as intended no more than that.	
1. 	with my first born we used one of those baby baths, I hated it uncomfortable it was hard to keep him warm i love this product, so much easier to use and just wring it our when yo are done.	
1. 	Our 9 month old baby boy has many of the little toys, and this is one of his favorites.  He likes to hold it and shake it back and forth.  Haba toys are the best!	
1. 	I love this diaper bag! Its so cute and hold just the right ammount of stuff for my 1 month old son!  I have a few other diaper bags too and i use this one because of the great storage! I like how the sides have zippered pockets as opposed to others that only have open pockets.  And this fits under my stroller just fine!AFTER USING THIS BAG ONLY A FEW TIMES THE LINER CAME UNDONE FROM THE TOP AROUND THE ZIPPER SO THE FOAM PADDING IN IT WAS COMING OUT.  GOOD FOR LIGHT USE BUT DONT PACK IT FULL OF STUFF AS I DID, THE STITCHING WONT HOLD UP.	
1. 	I bought 2 superyards and 1 extension kit. THey are easy to use and you can break them down into sections of 2 to block items of furniture if you want. I bend mine in an l shape and block things like chairs and end tables.	
- 1	The spoon itself is a bit big for my 18 month. He puts it in his mouth and most of the food slides to the back of the spoon then falls off.	
1. 	NOTE: Item is backordered. Had to purchase thru another online retailer, and it was difficult to find anohter company who had one... BOB is working to fix this backorder problem (I called them) but it'll take months.I flew my BOB in this with us and packed many items in the bag with it like diapers, baby food, extra baby supplies, shoes... it held a lot.Bag is a well thought out peice of sturdy luggage. Photos do not do it justice. The instructions were easy to follow.BOB stroller and bag held up great to Southwest Airlines baggage handlers!Well worth the price to protect your stroller. I will post photos I took later of the bag.I was hesitant about buying this due to the price but am glad I did. Really glad.	
1. 	We bought this because my toddler is very curious and the locks on our sliding glass door couldn't keep her in. We installed this on the top track of the door and when it's locked she cannot get out which provides me with peace of mind. The only issue I've had is when you unlock it you have to turn it to keep it from locking itself again. My husband has locked himself out of the house several times by doing this.  Other than that this is great for the money spent.	
1. 	This swaddle helps our daughter sleep like a baby.  (Oh, wait...)  She outgrew her newborn size knit swaddle by Halo, and we bought the next size up in fleece because it is now winter time and we thought she could use the extra warmth.  The only problem is that she likes it too much.  We've created a swaddle monster that can't sleep without being swaddled, but now she is getting too old to be swaddled (starting to roll over) so we're going through the painful process of breaking her of the swaddle.  However, the product itself is great.  I didn't give 5 stars because it quickly lost its fleecy softness after a few (~5) washes.  It is still soft, but is starting to pill and the cream color doesn't look particularly clean.  The velcro is super strong and the fabric is warm.  I love how it zips from the top down - makes middle of the night diaper changes MUCH easier!  This style is also useful because once we break our baby from the swaddle, we can still use it as a sleep sack!	
- 1	We ordered these when we had my daughter and they were great for maybe the first couple of uses. After that, the pull ties no longer worked so we could not tighten them and close them up. We basically had to twist the bag and fold it over hoping that the smell stayed in and nothing leaked out. We have made them work for the sake of not wanting to order more, but have recently ordered a couple others through Amazon now that we have 2 kids. Unfortunately, we'd never order these again.	
1. 	This isn't a necessary baby item, and we did without it for 14 months. At about 14 months my son started hating diaper changes, so I thought maybe he'd enjoy it better if he had a warm wipe instead of a cold one, well, it didn't matter, he still throws a fit (for anyone thinking that it'll solve the same problem) as it comes with the age. But it is nice to have a warm wipe. I usually wet the pillow (or I rinse it out before adding new wipes) and put 2 drops tea tree oil onto the pillow directly to hopefully keep mold out (no mold yet, and I'm not sure if that's the reason or something else). We also use cloth wipes (he's allergic to something in every disposable wipes we've tried) and I put tea tree oil into the solution I make up so that should help with mold too. It works great for cloth wipes, they stay moist, and if folded in there right they pop up out of the top too, which makes it nice. Is it worth buying if you're on the fence? Not really, you can warm a wipe up by holding it in your hand a few seconds. It won't be WARM, but it won't be freezing either that way. But if you want to use warm wipes, this is definitely a good product.	
1. 	I really love this bouncer!! It is perfect!! I love that my baby can sleep away in it.  No problems here at all!! Love the music and massage with vibration.  I wish they had one in my size,  LOL!	
1. 	My 10 month old is in the 95th percentile for weight.  Shopping cart safety belts rarely fit him properly, if at all. The Leachco Safety Strap has made shopping with the baby so much easier, safer, and more comfortable for my baby.  I have tried using the safety strap on a regular chair, as suggested, and find that it does work, but I feel compelled to keep one hand on my child at all times, because it would be easy for him to wriggle off the side of the chair and slip out of the strap.	
- 1	I purchased this because it was suggested to go with the play yard but it does not fit.  You can only purchase the 2ft extensions  to go with the play yard.	
1. 	These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this bottle. Customer service was great they emailed me twice or more about how to use the bottle which is why I put an extra star but no matter how many time I follow the instruction the bottle leaked. I love the idea of how they want the bottle to be used but it leak. Leaking my breastmilk is a no no in my book, and the bottom piece I have no idea why it's even there it just falls off.  I think maybe they need a liner like the plastic circle things blenders have at the bottom so they won't leak, or something. My problem with it is that it leaks A lot.	
1. 	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the what does the world look like story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  I highly recommend this to every parent! It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!	
1. 	Sleep sacks are perfect if your child is prone to getting their legs stuck in between the slats of the crib. With a sleepsack wearable blanket, their legs can't get stuck, and you don't need to use bumper pads, which are full of contriversy with SIDS. Also, you don't need to put your child in the crib with a loose blanket, which also contributes to SIDS.	
- 1	This toy is a food idea but it is lightweight and is easily toppled over by the baby. Any light push sends it over and then the sections come apart.	
1. 	I love this Cot. My son feels like he has his own special bed when we have to stay in a hotel or at grandmas. It is REAL easy to set up and put away without having to explain it to anyone. I would recommend it to anyone with a toddler that may be going on a trip or having sleep overs.	
- 1	We tried this on two different textured fireplaces because that was what it was advertised for....yeah, we had to buy a boatload of extra tape and it still didn't stick all that well. It did hold up for the weekend which was its purpose, but not for the long haul!	
- 1	although the description says it has a secure press release, it really doesn't you dont need to press anything to remove these and my 10 month old daughter has proven that time after time. Her little fingers are smell enough to pull these right out the outlet. I just think that the design of the plugs make you think that they would be a better option, but to save yourself some money you would be better off just getting the well known kind with the flat surface.	
- 1	I bought this hoping I wouldn't get a lemon with squeaky wheels.  I wanted teh bassinet and forward facing options so much i risked it.  The strolller is absolutely awful just awful.  Others said it has easy maneuvering?  easy what?!!  This stroller is constantly being run into walls it's sooo difficult to maneuver.  My friends who have pushed my stroller confirmed that it is exceptionally hard to use.  When i called customer service for 1st years they said all they could do is replace the wheels!!!  What? replace the wheels that already don't work?  We routinely oil the wheels and have also bought graphite powder which the customer service agents recommended.please don't buy this stroller.  Don't waste the money and just buy a nicer stroller.  We bought this from Target because we recieved so many gift cerficiates.  Too bad we didn't use amazon their 1 year baby warranty is excellent.This looks white online but it's actually grey.  it has awful maneuverabilty.  Just buy a snap and go while your baby's 4months and younger and you're using a car seat all the time.  Then once you figure out your stroller needs (since you really don't know how you'll use a stroller until you have a baby) buy the stroller that fits your lifestyle.  We ended up buying a nice jogging stroller with an infant car seat adapter.  I thought that it would be better going for the 1st years since it seemed less bulky.  Not true.I'd give this 1 star but it is useful as an over priced snap'n go.1. this stroller shade is USELESS.2. The color is grey not white as it is n the photo.3. the wheels are so squeaky (within 3 weeks of use)4. The stroller constantly runs into walls.  it's very hard to push.	
1. 	This cooler holds three 8 oz Dr. Brown's Polyproplene bottles (very snug fit toward the top - seam must lay flat for zipper to close).	
- 1	Another waste of my money. Easier to wash by hand and dry. Wish I could return this item too. Never used and don't plan on it. Sorry I bought it.	
- 1	We received this carrier as a gift, so we didn't have much input on the selection.  We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier, however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies.  Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack.  The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure, so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free!  We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this!!!	
1. 	We weren't sure what to expect with these but were pleasantly surprised. They are a bit bulky and take a big of getting used to, but our daughter won't be turning on the gas knobs on anytime soon!If you have a gas stove, buy these.	
1. 	the traditional swaddle blanket it time consuming and my son can break out with ease. He now sleeps through the night. He's now 4 months. We will continue to use it until he can break out of it also.	
1. 	These are the best bibs in on the market!  We've been using and laundering my sons set of Dr. Seuss Bumkims for two years now, and they still look brand new.You can machine wash and dry, which is what I usually do, but you can also hand wash them very easily and they dry in no time at all.  They come in so many cute designs and I love how small they fold up for travel.I have a newborn daughter and purchased her a set while I was still pregnant, as I knew it was all I would ever use later on down the line when she is able to eat solids.Don't bother wasting your money on anything else, just get these.  They're so reasonably priced on Amazon for how good they are and the use you'll get out of them!	
- 1	This is one of my favorite baby purchases.  It keeps the wipes nice and warm and it's easy to maintain.  I rinse the pillow when I get to the bottom of my wipe supply.  Depending on the brand of wipes I use, some of them don't pop-up through the opening, but it's easily fixed.  The Huggies brand wipes seem to work best, as they are connected to each other with perforations and not just stacked together.  This is a great gift idea for someone that is expecting or for yourself!!!1/17/14 Update- Well after using this product for 14 months, it has brought on a concern.  A week ago, I noticed the light on the front was not working.  When I investigated the cord, I discovered that the metal piece that attaches to the warmer, was corroded.  I immediately unplugged the cord from the wall, and also found that the inside of the warmer was cold.  This scares me because it could have caused a fire.  I am not in the market for a new warmer, as it's winter and cold wipes are not enjoyable for my son.  I have contacted Prince Lionheart and hope to have an answer from them soon.	
- 1	I really wanted to love this bottle. I like the feel of it in my hand and I like that you don't have to shake the formula to get it to mix. But - and this is a huge one - it broke after less than a week's worth of use. My husband struggled to close the cap and when he passed it to me, there it went. I like the bottle so much that I went on a scavenger hunt for another but couldn't find one. I took that as a sign.	
1. 	My 18 month old discovered how to unlock and open the slidding glass door and make her way to the backyard.  This product works like a charm.  You just place on the stationary part of the door and the slidding door is stopped when attemted to be opened.  Even with my adult force I can't get the door open!  We remove it a couple of times a day to let the dogs in/out and it still works.  It is a bit expensive but the alternatives aren't much better and you will have to drill into the door frame.	
- 1	This is soft, but the smell that comes off it is so overpowering and the smell stays on your body or babies body and irritates the eye. We will not use this and will be very hesitant to use this company again.	
1. 	I bought this for my wife when she first complained of back and hip pain during her pregnancy. In her case it was around 15 weeks.She was sure that putting a pillow between her knees would be sufficient, but after two nights it was clear that would not work, as she was waking up complaining of a sore back and hip. I ordered this as a surprise and had it sent next day shipping with Amazon Prime.First Impression:The pillow is big. Like, really big. It came in a box that was easily four feet long by two feet wide and a foot and a half thick. The pillowcase was soft and the stuffing seemed soft yet supportive. It was a bit intimidating to look at out of the context of bed.Using the pillow:We put it in the bed (queen size) and she tried it out before actually going to bed. Her first impression was that it was quite comfortable to lay with. It took up a decent amount of the bed but didn't encroach my side too badly and I knew it would be worth it for her to be comfortable.She was sold on the first night. The loop that goes between the legs kept her hip in alignment and she woke up the next morning pain free. She said it did not sleep warm so she didn't get hot snuggled up against it. It helped her to stay laying on her left side for most of the night, as it made it tough to roll over with the loop between her legs. Now that she is more advanced into her pregnancy (28 weeks), the part that goes under her belly is providing good support to keep her back from getting torqued over night.She isn't experiencing any issues with the seams causing chafing as some reviewers have had.The only notable flaw is that the pillow case is getting some tiny pill balls, which is a little disappointing. However, they are very minor and would not stop me from buying the pillow again.Bonus: My dog and I also find the pillow to be extremely comfortable.	
1. 	My daughter is just starting out potty training and she like the step ladder, and it is easy to fold up. I was worried about this at first but am really happy with my purchase. The seat fits my toilet which is an old American Standard and there is no issue what so ever.	
- 1	I thought this would be bigger when I spent $10! But it's very very small! Fits my 7 month olds hand.  I thought it would be a large carrot rattle but it's very small.  I didn't check the size specs but still, for $10 I expected something more.	
- 1	Save your money, do not buy this!  Washed or not washed, turns out this is so small it buckles the mattress.  Weird since it's made by Graco and I have a Graco pack n' play?	
- 1	It is a great concept but the design still needs some help. We have it hanging on a wall to save some space, but the pockets can't take much weight without them leaning at an angle and bowing inwards (especially the side pockets). They need something to rigidize the shelving and back of the soft goods area.	
- 1	I thought these sounded like a good a good idea but it turned out to be completely weird.  You put food in the little net and then the baby is supposed to chew on it and suck the food out.  However my kids all found it strange to have the net in their mouth and nothing we put in these made the kids want to use them.  We threw them away shortly after purchasing them.	
1. 	I cannot tell you how easy this makes pumping when you're on the go!  I use these at work so i don't have to bring everything into the bathroom to clean afterwards and love this...	
- 1	The bottles are super leaky and my baby swallowed so much air that I had to stop using them. Waste of money!	
1. 	Bought this as a second base for our Evenflo Travel System.  My son is only 7 days old so we haven't been using it long but we obviously can't see anything wrong with it or we wouldn't have used it!  :)Very easy to install, very easy to clip into...great product.	
- 1	I tried using this several times on my newborn for little boogies,  and it never worked.  The one it did get snot out was when I pulled one to the edge with a Q-tip and just sucked it out from there.  $14 for this dinky thing?  Better spent on anything else.	
1. 	These little boats have turned out to be a good purchase with our grandchildren for both bath time and pool time. They are colorful and cute, and the variety makes for good play time.	
- 1	I ordered this potty because after weeks of research, this was the only potty I could find that's BPA free. When it came my daughter was excited to try it. Unfotunately she pinched her finger on the pull out center. She also voiced that her bottom hurt because it was too hard. She's only 25 lbs and is a small girl but there isn't enough seat so it's uncomfortable. She now refuses to sit on it. It's going back.	
1. 	Easy to use, Easy to clean, Easy to store. Best one I have seen or used. I have bought a few for friends in the last couple of years. The padding on the sides helps wondeful for tired little ones or learning to sit up little ones.	
1. 	My husband found our newborn's face covered in his blanket one morning and gave us quite a scare. I purchased two Halo sleepsacks, one in cotton and one in fleece after that incident. I bought it a size bigger so that my baby can have extra leg room. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made for my baby. Highly recommended!	
- 1	I'm kinda lazy. These looked like they would be easy to install (they were) and the other prettier type looked more worky. These looked ugly in the picture, but since I'm willing to admit I'm lazy, I decided I shouldn't be judgmental.They look even worse in real life, though.I have had no problem with the adhesive coming off, an issue that other reviews raised. I did let them cure for a full 24 hours before using as well as applied as much pressure as I could when first installing and again whenever I thought of it or walked by. They are stuck for certain.Our problems with them are they are not really intuitive and take practice when activating one handed, a common need when trying to access cabinets. Once you get the hang of it it's not overly complex and like anything else, it becomes easier when muscle memory kicks in. Visiting relatives are very annoyed by them though, and while their mild irritation always amuses me, you may not consider guests being frustrated a plus. Especially if they are helping you put away dishes or throwing out trash.Bigger than these minor issues are that 2 of the 8 installed have broken latches for a whopping 25% failure rate--not accounting for several of them almost never being used. One of the failed is the all-important under the sink cabinet that gets both the most use and has the messiest treasure for the baby to get into.I reluctantly ordered what I imagined would be the tiny-screw-that-just-won't-cooperate-and-ends-up-bouncing-accross-the-floor-and-rolling-under-the-dishwasher-causing-me-to-scream-in-fury-toward-the-clouds-type here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADY35GO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_5To my lazy delight they were super easy to install, use and they don't look like a hot mess. I wish I got those ones first and skipped these straps entirely.	
1. 	I almost put this on my Amazon baby registry but didn't because a friend was going to let me borrow her regular Pack 'N Play when my twins were born.  I never got around to getting it from her, and my husband and I brought our twins home with nowhere to put them on our main level (their room is upstairs).  The idea of dragging them up and down the stairs all day sounded horrible, so we literally ordered this the day we came home from the hospital and paid for rush delivery.  It was completely worth the price!  The twins are 6 weeks old now, and I can't imagine not having this.  It's really sturdy and the twins sleep just fine in it between meals.  We haven't had to pack it up to take anywhere yet, but I'm sure we'll be using it for a really long time.	
- 1	I tried this product instead of the more expensive options out there. I realized that comfort is worth the extra money. I tried it on for only a few minutes with my 28 pound son and my shoulders felt like they were going to fall off. Not enough shoulder support. I was so glad this happened in the first few moments and not after a hike. I immediately made plans to return this item (which is wonderfully easy with Amazon). Everything seemed to fit fine other than that, I am 5'5 tall, medium built woman in relatively good shape. Thank goodness for EBAY, I was able to get a used, better supporting pack for cheap. Maybe a lighter child would fare better in this pack.	
1. 	These are great you can just throw them in the wash,  however if you leak heavily you might want to add a disposable behind them when you are out and about and can't change the pad because they are not leak proof always.	
- 1	It is true the bathtub does NOT leak IF properly snapped in three places and rested on a flat surface. If you put it on top of the sink and have to move it a little bit to align it with the sink to empty it, or if you have to lift it up with water to take it somewhere else to empty it, it WILL LEAK. In any case, the benefit you get from the minimal compacting does not outweigh the pain it is to keep this clean (water dwells in the cracks and becomes moldy) and the fact you don't have a flat bottom surface to have your baby sit on. It is just not a good/necessary product. Get a normal bathtub and a separate sling from walmart and you are good to go.	
- 1	I will use these for extra bowls but they do not stay put on the highchair as described. Bottoms are sticky tacky rubber but the baby just picks us the bowl! Lol	
- 1	My daughter never took to these. I think maybe they were too big for her mouth? Everytime I gave her one she would take it out of her mouth and chew on the green part and then drop it.	
- 1	BabyHaven fulfilled this order, and instead of sending the one pictured, they sent the crappier, new Deluxe version, which everyone says does not contain odors.  Unfortunately for me, I ordered this before my baby came and had the box put away in the nursery.  I only discovered the mistake outside the 30 day return period.  Both Amazon and BabyHaven told me tough luck, even though they clearly sent the wrong item and had advertised the older model (which is what I wanted) falsely.  Very disappointed.If anyone wants to know about the version pictured, the older version, it's GREAT.  I ended up having to re-buy that one on Ebay.  Worth every penny, that one.  Baby Trend needs to get its act together and change the design back to the original.	
1. 	Classic toy that my daughter plays with all the time.  When she was younger she loved to knock down the stacks of cups we would build for her.  Now that she is older (15 months) she loves to nest the cups inside one another.  They are great in her water table as well and I'm sure will be just as fun in sand.  The 2 smallest cups are pretty small and will most likely get lost under furniture, but such is life with a toddler.	
1. 	A favorite in our house!	
- 1	If you are looking for cloth diapers, educate yourself somewhere like on the Green Mountain Diapers website. The prefolds they sell do work well, and absorb more than disposables do. These prefolds, on the other hand, hardly absorb anything, when it comes to baby pee. They do a really good job, though, with spit up.	
- 1	Not only was the color wrong, it wasn't even the right BRAND of gate. I oredered a KidCo gate that could be used with a KidCo extension, as I have an opening that is 63&#34; wide, and what I got was one made by North States. The gate itself is a &#34;matte bronze&#34; which honestly pretty much looks black, but the extension is NOT matte, which makes the two pieces not match. The extension won't even work with the gate I got. You would expect that ordering from KidCo you would get the KidCo gate, but don't count on it!	
1. 	This blanket works wonders. My son gets extremely fussy from time to time and we put him in this blanket and within minutes he stops fighting sleep and sleeps better than he ever has. Forget those other blankets. This is THE blanket to buy if your child likes to be swaddled.	
- 1	I purchased this potty seat for my 2 1/2 year old son.  While the quality is excellent, it simply doesn't function as a potty seat for my little boy.  Considering there is no shield for urine, and given the size of the opening, the pee would just go all over the floor and not in the potty at all.  Will have to send this one back and purchase another seat with a shield for little boys.	
- 1	I like how this diaper wicks moisture away, and I started using it more for my daughter when she began sleeping through the night.  The problem is that the tag, which is sewn into the back center seam of the diaper, hangs outside the diaper.  So by the end of the night, when her diaper is pretty much soaked, the tag has become soaked, too, and the moisture wicks onto her clothes.  I end up having to change her whole outfit, sometimes in the middle of the night if the wetness has woken her up.  I'm going to see if there's a way I can pick out the stitches to get rid of the tag, but it's sewn in pretty firmly.  Other than this fault, I like the fit of the diaper OK, though it tends to get bunched up under her belly like low-rider jeans.  And stuffing the liner into the pocket can be really annoying because sometimes it doesn't want to lie flat since the rise is still snapped at medium height.  Anyway, I only have one of this kind of diaper, and I'm glad I didn't buy more.UPDATE: It's been a few weeks since I removed the tag, but the diaper still wicks moisture along the back elastic, so I'm no longer using it as a nighttime diaper.  I still don't like the way it bunches in front and looks like an abdominal pannus, so she only wears it at home.UPDATE #2 (downgraded from 3 to 2 stars): This diaper started to retain stink badly, and half the time the inner soaker didn't agitate out in the wash. After 14 months of use, I threw it out. I'm only buying all-cotton diapers now, since I've had very little stink issue with them.	
1. 	I purchased this toy for Christmas for my daughter who was 10 months old at the time and she loved it right away. She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it. Now at almost 16 months old, she has figured out how to play with it more, understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking. I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy. The instruments sound lovely, the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do, and most of all, this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many, many years to come!	
- 1	Not what we were looking for at all. The product is sturdy but did not keep my infants head in place.	
1. 	This is a great product and works well for grandma's house. We did not have any issues with it. When it arrived, we washed it and put it on the bed. Our son sleeps well with it at grandma's as it mimics the feeling of his crib at home.	
1. 	Our son loves this bath tub! I love that it is his own inflatable tub within our tub. Makes me feel like he is a lot safer bathing.The duck is super cute and fun for him to play in.
