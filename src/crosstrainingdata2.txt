- 1	There's no way to secure it to the seat and it's not molded at all, so it just slides around and down. There have been no accidents so I can't speak to the integrity of the seat protection ability but it's uncomfortable for my little when it bunches up, and I'm sure that will impede it's function should we encounter an accident.	
- 1	My sister was paranoid about good breastfeeding after a difficult start and wanted her son to use these bottles at grandma's house when she began working, but he cried and screamed and made bottle feedings impossible for grandma.  I tried giving him this bottle also, and watched the outer nipple buckle in, so he was literally not able to latch on to it.  Grandma switched to a basic regular nippled bottle and he did much better.	
1. 	I really like these furniture anchors, and this is my second time to order this product.The pieces that attach to the wall and the piece of furniture are the same, so you don't have to worry about putting the &#34;right&#34; piece in the right place. They're not too big, so I've never found a problem attaching them to furniture, even the storage cubes from ClosetMaid. The &#34;zip ties&#34; that attach the anchors are strong, but can be released so you can use them again. I also like that you can adjust the distance allowed from the wall. We end up with cords and plugs behind furniture, and it helps a lot to be able to adjust for those things.The only thing I don't like is the screws. The heads seem to strip very easily. But we've moved a lot the past few years, so mine have had a lot of wear and tear. I'll keep using the same brackets, I'll just end up buying a box of screws at the hardware store to replace the ones that came with this set.Overall, I'm very pleased with this product - I've purchased two sets - and the only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is the screws.	
- 1	First of all, car seat is pretty bad. No adjusting system means I have to use towels to get it right. It also feels kind of cheap. I went out and bought a new car seat two weeks after receiving this one.The stroller is better, it runs smoothly and feels allright. The lower basket is great and overall it is a good product. Downfall is that it almost doesn't fold and takes up all my trunk! Overall, I would not recommend this combo.	
- 1	I really liked this bottle at first, but after a few runs through the dishwasher and the sterilizing bag some serious problems have emerged. I think the low-quality materials warped a bit in the heat, because the parts have become very leaky. The fact that assembling the bottle requires pulling the nipple into the bottle rim *just* right doesn't help with that, especially considering the fact that it sometimes takes a few tries.Pros:- the formula wand is a unique feature, though I don't know how much it really helps- formula storage caps availableCons:- the large, clunky, oddly-shaped parts are a bit more of a hassle than the more straight-forward Avent brand.-leaky- poor quality plastic that warps easily (I once accidently sterilized one in a bag with no water and it completely melted and smoldered. No other brand I've used was harmed after making that mistake with them).-Ounce markings that twist diagonally around the bottle make measuring needlessly difficult- nipple sits atop a flat surface rather than a rounded dome like other bottles. Rounded shapes simulate how the baby latches on to a breast, so the bottle may be difficult for a breastfed baby to use-larger than other bottles so it's harder to bring as many in a diaper bag	
1. 	I purchased these for my 11 months old grand daughter to use in our water table outside, pool and bath. She loved them. They are so colorful and she loved squesing the water out at her cousins. Her older cousins ages 7 to 15 had just as much fun with them as her. They all float and seem to call for you to play with them. They also have a tecture that seemed to please my grand baby as well. I would recommend this to my friends.	
- 1	I am 14 weeks pregnant, still nursing my 15 month old and my milk supply has pretty much dried up. I still try a few times a day though. I am almost to the end of my freezer supply and I just wanted to share a few things about my experiences in using up my freezer supply.1. You can never have enough frozen. There is no &#34;too much&#34;.2. All of the frozen milk I have fed her over the last month has been 13 to 15 months old. In a deep freeze. She drank every drop, not a bad bag. So I question the 12 month rule.3. Double check your bag is sealed before you freeze, keep the seal dry. Many popped open while thawing.4. I used 3 kinds of bags and lots of empty bottles. I will NEVER buy Medela bags again. They are the only ones that the sealed opened on and 4 bags so far either broke or the seal on the bottom of the bag leaked while thawing in hot water. No problems with Lansinoh bags. Not sure if Gerber still makes bags but I used some that were 7 years from my first baby and NO PROBLEM with Gerber bags.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
- 1	Newborns need mittens most but these are huge.  They're sized more for 2 or 3 month olds!  We had to use socks on her hands at the hospital.  I'd recommend the onesies that fold over the hands if weather permits long sleeves.	
1. 	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.	
1. 	i bought the Safari Open Top Take Along Swing when my baby was born because the price was cheaper. i didn't take into consideration about the entertainment. so, my baby didn't like sitting in that swing. so now i bought this aquarium swing and my 12 weeks old baby loves to be in there. it's very expensive so i thought about it many times before i actually bought it.  she looks and coos to the toys, lights and music. she stays so calm in the swing for more than half an hour. the only draw back is the music doesn't last long. i have to reset it every few minutes.	
- 1	I got this one because of the price.  Yes, it is cheap.  But I find that at our house (in the city and near other houses) there is just constant interference.  It pops, hisses and goes snowy.  And the interference is loud enough to wake you up...repeatedly...all night.  We tried the other channel, removing electronics from near it and nothing makes it better.After about 6 months we have turned it off for the most part and use our audio monitor for sound. if we need to look we turn it on, but otherwise we don't use it that much due to the interference.We can see the baby though the way we mounted the camera we can't see the whole crib from about 3-4 feet above the crib.I would not recommend this to a friend.  For the money you spend you could just spend a bit more and get a better one.	
- 1	Like most other parents, I was happy at finding a warmer at a reasonable price, and this worked well for the first year but then it quit.The organizer caddy was handy.  It attaches to the side of your diaper table or crib with brackets that are included.  Also included are some rubber things that help you adjust the brackets for a smaller widths; for instance, if you are attaching to a table instead of a crib.  The front of the caddy is a zip-up net and inside you can fit about 15-20 diapers.  There are two pockets on each side that I use to keep small bottles of lotion, diaper cream, etc.  The warmer snaps onto the caddy so that it won't fall off the top easily.It also has a tendency to cook the bottom wipes and turn them dark yellow to brown.  It seems this is a problem with most warmers that warm from the bottom.The wipes have a tendency to dry out, but I think that is the case with most warmers.  I usually just add a bit of water every now and them to keep them from doing so (although this particular brand recommends against it, but my current one recommends TO DO it).I was disappointed to find out that there was no warranty when it quit working. I spent the same amount of money on one at Wal-Mart and it has a 5 year warranty - long enough to at least get me through the diaper stage!Specifics:  It is plug-in and not battery operated.  I think most units this size are plug-in.  It fits all size wipes, but does not have the feature for pop up wipes.  And it holds an entire refill size of wipes.  It warms from the bottom, not the top.  It is very easy to open and there is no lock for the lid.  You cannot adjust the temperature.  I think that is the same for most though.	
- 1	Cheap plastic handle.  Zero pressure generated.  Appears to be a cheap knock off of a similar looking sprayer made by the Flo company.  Spent the extra money for the Flo.  Worth it.	
1. 	We bought this crib to replace our old drop side crib and it is made really well and super sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  My favorite part is that it is low enough to the ground that I can sit on the floor and pat my daughters back with my arm through the slats.  This was an excellent purchase.	
1. 	This cover fits perfectly on Costco shopping carts, covering all surfaces, as well as all supermarket carts. I keep getting stopped by people asking me about it because my baby looks so comfy - it's like a mini sofa! It has tons of features:* Very padded and comfortable, especially for long grocery runs. My baby can nap in it, supported by the pillow, while still buckled in.* Has a wide removable pillow 18 x 6 x 4 that you can insert behind baby to prop them up if they can't sit up well. It's attached by a tether so it stays in the cart.* Secures to the cart with just one hand - you just unzip, plop it into the cart, flip one part over and under the handle, flip the other part over the back, turn the fitted edges over onto the sides of the cart, and attach it with a buckled strap.* Buckled waist belt for baby* Can also be used as a diaper pad. I don't use it for this purpose because the fabric is too nice!* Doubles as a backup diaper bag. Has a large 19x 11 zippered pocket to put diapers, formula packets, ointment, etc.* Has two smaller 9 1/2 x 4 zippered compartments, for coupons, makeup, wallet, etc.* Two elastic loops to hold formula bottles.* Folded into itself, it zips up all contents neatly to the size of a small duffel bag, (24 x 9 in diameter).* Machine washable cold, machine dry warm. With the exterior's heavy black canvas and all the padding, it doesn't look like something I'd like to wash too frequently. Will have to see how easy this is.* Also comes in pink, at BRU.I've tried the Clean Shopper (almost no padding, smaller, a simple strap goes through the back to secure the baby to the cart) and the Safe N' Easy (cheap quality, looks like a big rain coat/ shower cap, difficult to get baby into, doesn't stay on). They can't compare to this one.	
1. 	I wanted a mirror that rotated in so that I could easily see my baby. I have a GMC Terrain, so the mirrors that attach to the window wouldn't work. This mirror attached easily to the headrest (even though mine don't adjust). It give a clear image with NO distortion! I would recommend this item to other parents!	
1. 	I would recommend these for even adults! They are easy to apply and work well. My only issue is I wish there were more of the sticky tape.	
- 1	Difficult if not impossible to fit on spout, has no hole for shower pull. The paint was also already wearing off ontop the hippos head, like it might have already been used?	
- 1	We got these based on a friend's recommendation, but they just didn't fit on baby well. Our baby was 7 lbs when she was born, so she was well within the 5-10 pound range described on the product. And it was snuggly tight on her when she was newborn. But just a little bit of squirming on her part had the zipper on her side instead of on her front. The zipper would also sometimes bunch up under her neck and get in the way of her mouth during feedings. Plus, she quickly outgrew them by the time she was 9 lbs even though she's very petite. They were just too tight and constricting. She ended up screaming every time we put her in one. So what started off being a soothing thing ended up being restricting and uncomfortable. Even at 3 months and still only 10 lbs (very petite), I couldn't imagine putting her in them now. They were great for the month we got to use them, but after that it just ended up being a waste of money.	
- 1	Just like all the other reviews have said, this bath may does not stick to the tub.  It floats.  I tried everything to make it stick to no avail.  This product is crap!	
- 1	These bibs have a very strong chemical odor.  I do not feel comfortable putting this on my baby.  Babies put everything in their mouths and with this strong of a chemical odor, I can only imagine what these are made of.	
1. 	These are the only bottles I can get my son to take.  He hates the silicone nipples, so these are great alternative.	
1. 	What I like:* Easy to wash/clean* Small enough to have them on the purse, on the go.(but still can hold 10oz) =)* Material and design* Even though they're not completely spill proof, my 18m old son can handle them without making a mess.* Stackable for storage.* SON LOVES THEM (He wouldn't drink from a sippy cup until I introduce these because liquids come out fluently)**Please consider this*** Even though the cup itself isn't 100% spill proof, the spout does the job very well when you're on the go. My baby always had a hard time drinking from cups with internal plastic valvs or spout, and when I tried to drink from those cups, even for me was hard. I'll rather have some drops here and there (because this is only what you have, tiny drops)  than giving my baby a hard time with those hard to drink from cups.	
- 1	This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the seat or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest.	
1. 	The idea of travelling solo with an infant/toddler is no fun. It scares me. Especially if I'm going overseas where access to a target/babies r us is not as easyThis made life easy. It's toss/go so I don't feel badly if we forget it on the plane/restaurant/taxi. I can reuse it! The lids are interchangeable so i can make short sippy cups (great when my son was an infant) and use the tall ones to hold snacks and formula. Now that he's a toddler we'll be using the large sippy cups.I'm travelling abroad again with him and ordered 2 sets of these to take with us. The idea of loosing his woody sippy would be earth shattering so not taking any risks! The pieces are great to throw into my diaper bag and use it at restaurants. The spons/forks will be useless for my 27mon old so that's the only downer to the kit now. They were great when he was an infant.I don't know about you - but some restaurants don't have child proof utensils/cups/plates/bowls so this will allow my kiddo to eat w/o us having to fork over extra money for broken dishes!For the price of this set - it's a bargain! Great deal, great product.	
- 1	We had the smaller, two handle version of this cup so I picked up these thinking they would be great.  These leak like no ones business!  My kids can toss the two handle ones all over and besides the little spray from the straw sometimes, they don't leak.  These left a good 8 puddle on the floor after less than 5 minutes.  I much prefer the Playtex Click n Lock straw cups.	
1. 	I love this swing.  We have the aquarium cradle swing also(and love it), but this swing is so portable.  I actually leave it in my car all the time so we have it wherever we go.  My daughter loves it.  She's been using it since she was 6 weeks old.  She loves the lights.	
1. 	I purchased (from another online store) the Fossfill Comfort U Total Body Pillow roughly 4.5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.  I was hesitant to pay THAT much for a pillow, but I took a chance.  I primarily purchased it because I was having trouble staying on my side while sleeping.  I would constantly wake up and be on my back (which wasn't good).  Anyway, it worked great in keeping me laying on my side, providing back support/relief and supporting my growing belly.  I used it during the hot Texas summer and I was not at all too hot (granted, the A/C was running).  The only complaint came from my husband, who said that it took up alot of space on the bed.  It does provide excellent protection if you sleep with someone who moves/kicks around alot while sleeping. :)  Seriously, if you are sleeping with someone in smaller than a king-size bed, this pillow does take up extra space (imagine a king size pillow in front of you, as well as behind you).The REAL benefit of the pillow, however, came when my son turned 2 years old and moved to a full-size double bed.  This pillow is the PERFECT size to make an L shape on the bed along the headboard and agaist the wall to provide comfort and additional support to a small child.  It works much better than regular pillows (since it is more compact and firmer) and is much safer to use on the bed.  The pillow also washes and dries up great.  I've washed and dried it numerous times, and it still looks great.  I highly recommend this pillow, especially for use on a full-size bed for a toddler.  I have definitely gotten my money's worth on this pillow.	
1. 	I installed this gate at the top of our deck stairs to keep my little one from wandering off the deck. It's easy to install, sturdy, the perfect width, and it holds up great outdoors. It can be a little hard to slide open and shut, but I was not expecting it to be smooth so I'm not disappointed.	
- 1	I don't have anything to add...it's very uncomfortable and didn't ease any of my discomfort. I used it for one night.	
- 1	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.	
1. 	I had been using those common baby bottle type brushes with the foam/sponge on the ends.  I tried one of these and am happily replacing those old spongy ones.  The bristles on the bottom and along the curve make it so it actually cleans the bottom of the bottles and other kid cups.	
1. 	Being a first time Mommy, I was having minor heart palpatations every time my little daughter made a squeak in the back seat and I could not see her.  I won't confess how many times I actually pulled over on the side of the road to check everything out....oh dear!I bought this, my husband had to prop it up a bit with a little burp cloth tucked underneath to position it correctly, but other than that it works great.  I love it, I can see her very clearly (the mirror is bigger than most) and the music is not too annoying.Great purchase!	
1. 	The item arrived in Manufacturer's packaging, each piece was adequately wrapped, but one piece still arrived damaged. I was able to repair it, so i am still happy with the product. I put it together in about an hour, the instructions were terrible, but I was able to figure them out. Overall the product seems sturdy enough, and for the included changing pad that people have complained about not being able to find a cover for, I used a king sized pillow sham and it fit perfectly!	
1. 	My husband is tall and can easily keep this on for longer activities. I did better in 20-30 min increments of time, especially as our son got older. We are now planning to use this with our second baby and excited to bring it out again.  Super easy to use and works well for the first six to eight months (depending on size and weight of baby).  This is definitely a purchase that should be added to any baby shopping list.  And there are lots of things you never know if you will use, but this was one we got our money's worth!  One note, we had a small to average size baby.  My sister's baby is twice his size and I can see how a larger / above average baby would get less use of this.	
- 1	These don't really need to be purchased to go with the 6x6 mat.  If you do order, be sure to get enough pieces to go around the whole mat.  Also, our 11 month old found a corner part today and began to chew on it.  It comes off easily and can be swallowed.  If the playard is over the mat she did not notice the mat can come apart yet.  I probably would not purchase the edges and corners for the playmat.  The playmat looks great without them.	
- 1	It's ok not great. It's a slightly darker than the photo and the inside black circles fade quickly. Ive only had it a month. I was not impressed. I already bought another bag.	
1. 	My 6mon loves these balls now.....he started to throw and crawl after them.  Loves the challenge of trying to hold on to them.	
1. 	Needed something that tied in the back instead of velcro closures as my daughter always pulls those off. Love the long sleeves as well. Truly keeps her clothes mess free during meals.	
1. 	There is a new version of it, but this was a great product for us with both of our kids.  It's still in use within our family.	
1. 	Jersey knit hits the spot with babies, and this goes above and beyond! Not only is it cute and a good quality sheet, it is SO SOFT!I want sheets like this! Even after multiple washings it fits great and is soft to the touch!	
1. 	I bought this tub, but rarely used it.  As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water.  By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better.	
1. 	This is one of the best baby gadgets I have ever seen. Give it to the baby with a piece of fruit or cookie inside, and you can have a peaceful dinner or conversation. The only problem is that the baby will end up in a mess (especially with fruit) no matter how many bibs you use, but it is a small price to pay for the convenience and security! We also use it with ice to sooth her teething gums. I highly recommend it, plus everyone who has seen it at work loves it!	
- 1	Our baby is breastfed, but we supplement with bottles once or twice a day.  She's currently 3 months old and we introduced bottles when she was about a week old. When I saw this bottle, I thought, &#34;Wow, what a great idea, a bottle that actually mimics the breast!&#34;  It was a great idea, but our baby refuses to drink out of it!  She takes a few sucks and then stops. So for us, this bottle was just a waste of $12.99.  The bottle that works best for her is the Lansinoh  mOmma bottle, which also happen to be less than half the cost of the Mimijumi bottles.	
- 1	I was really excited to get this, although the reviews were mixed - I had recently bought the Prince Lionheart plastic one and returned it because it scratched up my changing table wood (plastic is sharp), so I thought this one being soft would be better. Well, the velcro sharp side wraps around the changing table wood and ALSO scratched the wood. It does not look very nice hanging on the changing table - the place to put the wipes holder is much bigger than my OXO wipes case so it looked funny, and it just looked overall bulky hanging off the side. I'll be returning this item also and probably just figuring out organizing one of the drawers for diaper changing instead! I'm disappointed because I was hoping for a nice organizer to be handy. This one does not work for me.	
1. 	I bought one of these after my daughter was born to replace the My Brest Friend (which was terrible).  I love it and so does my baby.  We are still using it 9 months later.  So when my sister in law had her baby shower I knew she had to have one.  The Velcro safety strap is a great bonus.  Except this one doesn't have a removable cover for washing and the one I purchased for myself did, so I left out a star for that.	
- 1	I first heard of the boppy pillow when a friend of mine had a baby.  She allowed me to use it to hold her baby without straining my arms.  I thought it was the greatest thing.  I had never had a baby before and never held one and I thought there would be no way I could breastfeed without it.  Little did I know at the time I was pregnant.  I registered for a pillow and didn't get one, so I paid the outragous price and shipping because I thought I wouldn't be able to live without it.  Pre-pregnancy I was a size 1-5 or extra small.  I gained probably 60 lbs.  When I brought my baby home, the pillow would not even fit around the fat left over from pregnancy.  Once my uteros (sp?) did go down quite a bit, it fit a little better (it still doesn't fit quite right) and I could try to use it.  I have large breasts (about DD) and I still had to prop a blanket under my baby's head to reach my breast.  She would fall into the gap left in the stomach area all the time because it didn't fit right.  I eventually just set the pillow aside and do not use it.  She is now a little over a month old and it is really easy to set her in my lap and she reaches the breast on her own.  Do not be fooled that you will get your money's worth out of it.  I'm really dissapointed a read so many good reviews and turned out I wasted money that I could really use for other things like DIAPERS!  I would have given zero stars if there was the option.	
1. 	Adorable and has held up well over the past 10 months. The liner for the inside is easy to remove and replace so I just pull the whole bag out when full and carry it to the laundry room. Perfect for a baby/small child's room!	
- 1	I purchased this after reading the other reviews. However, upon receipt, I quickly realized that this is much wider than the picture makes it look. If you have a LOT of room, this is not an issue, but the width of this, once assembled, is bigger than our outdoor swingset. Also, you need to be aware that you cannot just slide baby in and out of this seat like most bouncers. You actually have to unclip the seat from the frame every single time, unsnap the fabric, unvelcro it, lay it out, place baby on, like you are changing a nappy, and then do it all back up again. Then, with baby in your arms, you have to reattach the seat to the bar one handed. If none of this deters you, then this is probably a great bouncer.	
- 1	This wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be sadly.  I don't understand how Amazon can offer 2 day shipping, then I find out something comes from China.  If I would have known it was coming from China I wouldn't have purchased it.  The toy arrived and it has a strange smell to it.  I need to air it out and febreeze it before I give it to my child.	
- 1	These I thought would be a great idea since they dont leak...and they really dont.  However, My son is 6 months old and could not suck through the nipples. They look nice but if he cant eat out of them, they are no use....I would NOT recommend these at all.	
1. 	Our son didn't care much for this when he was under the age of two, but now that he's older and knows the animals and colours, he has a lot of fun with this book. He also enjoys reading it to his baby sister. He likes to poke the bee in the flower, and other places in the book. It's a well made book.	
1. 	It did exactly what I wanted. It lines the nursers perfectly. Liners are nice because all I have to wash are the bottle nipples!	
1. 	I especially love this warmer for the middle of the night changes.  Cold wipes are shocking to the baby's skin and cause a lot of upset.  These warm wipes are soothing and not shocking.Follow the instructions and add 1/2 cup of water over the wipes each time you fill the warmer.  This keeps the wipes from drying out.  The nightlight does not show much light, but does the job.	
1. 	It's kind of big and clunky, but our baby likes to watch and listen to it.  It has a good volume range -- some toys are just too loud.  The bubbling water is a nice effect.  The toy was fairly simple to install on the crib and a plus is that it can be used beyond sitting-on-own age.	
- 1	We have this in the girly edition. I hate it. The padded ring has issues and flops around making it a total LEAKER! And if sat on for too long the darn thing comes off on your childs bottom (it gets stuck to the child). Again making a huge mess. The lid falls off constantly. Its rather short in stature and not made for taller toddlers learning to use the potty. We found the Fisher Price $12 potty to be a HUGE hit and so much easier to use!!	
1. 	I had been using those common baby bottle type brushes with the foam/sponge on the ends.  I tried one of these and am happily replacing those old spongy ones.  The bristles on the bottom and along the curve make it so it actually cleans the bottom of the bottles and other kid cups.	
- 1	I am hoping I will use this in the future. However I have yet to use this item for my twins	
1. 	I bought mine at another store when trying convertible car seats. I had an Eddie Bauer mirror that was a nightmare, so I decided to try this one and wasn't disappointed at all!It couldn't been easier to install, very easy to position in the right angle (I keep bumping into everything while trying to get the baby to sit, so that's a big plus), keeps baby entertained sometimes and lets me keep an eye on him while out and about.I make a point of only checking on the baby while stopped in traffic, at traffic lights or at stops because I have to take my eyes off the rearview and off the road to be able to see the mirror, so that's something to keep in mind.I'm planning on buying a second car and this mirror will be the first thing I'll get then.Also, the price is great.	
- 1	Bebe Dubon Bottle and Nipple Brush with Sponge Tip, Colors May Vary. It's really bad quality. Head and tail breaks after a few times using. Not recommend.	
1. 	This product does exactly as expected, but there are a few issues.  One issue is that it is a little tricky to install, although not really that bad. Once in place, it does exactly as expected and gives us peace of mind that or son will not fall off the bed while sleeping.  On the other hand, a big concern is that, as many children do, our son loves to walk and jump around on the bed.  When the child is doing that, they could easily fall over this device, causing them to fall from a much higher height then if they just fell off the bed itself.  This is a concern that I had not thought of, and while it has not happened to us yet, I can imagine that it must have happened to other children, and it is something that concerns us and is something that you might want to think about.	
1. 	I have been looking for inexpensive sippy cups that are BPA free to send to daycare with my daughter, now that we are transitioning from bottles of breastmilk to other milk.  The main problem that I was having is that many of the sippy cups that I loved did not have a travel lid.  These sippy cups are perfect.  They are inexpensive enough so I don't care if they end up lost.  As for traveling, they do come with one travel cap which is nice, but instead, I also purchased theThe First Years 6 Pack Take & Toss Snack Cups, 4.5 Ounce, Colors May Varywhich have lids that fit perfectly on the sippy cups.Most importantly, my baby drinks out of these with no problems!	
1. 	I bought these to take on our 6 hour car ride so that I could pump in the car and not have to worry about clean up or taking extra parts.  They worked great.	
1. 	These are helpful when you have a high bed. It worked well to increase the height. It makes the co-sleeper more wobbly and when you pick up the co-sleeper, the extensions can fall off so you cannot place it down without it being re-built. Would still recommend if you needed to increase the height.	
1. 	It has the oddest flat little spoon. We never use it. But the rest of this is PERFECT and we use it for on the go meals (when we don't think that we will be eating somewhere healthy enough for our 11 month old) or when they go to grandma's house and stay overnight. Perfect. It fits right inside our LLBean lunchbag and stays nice and cool. The separate containers allow me to heat up what needs to be heated and keep things like fruit cold. Great product. I have NO PROBLEMS with the lids staying on or getting them on and off. I also have no leaking issues. These work great and I get tons of compliments!	
1. 	This tub is great, not sure why people had to give it bad reviews. Tub doesn't float with the baby in it and my son loved it! Not once did it slide and he loved hitting the tub and hearing the sound of the beads inside. Very roomy tub and I even use it as a play pad after it is done drying. It helps sit him up and even if he slides the bumper sides are awesome. You can have baby on their tummy to wash their back comfortably.	
1. 	I just received this booster seat the other day and I like it very much. My 2 year old great grandson was here the other day and it worked great for him as a highchair (strapped to one of our kitchen chairs). Today I was babysitting my 16 month old grandson, and in addition to it being a nice highchair/booster seat, it was also a big hit as a safe little seat to set on my living room floor wherein he could just sit (whenever he chose to do so) and watch Veggie Tales (his favorite). Since there are many young children and babies in our family (who are frequently here) it is nice to have this as a backup in addition to our full-sized high chair.  Very sturdy yet easy to fold up to be very compact when not in use.	
1. 	this is great to put in a second vehicle like grandmas, so you can just pop the infant car seat in and out, and the car seat is already securely installed.	
- 1	My 10 month old soaks through every diaper.  Thought I would try thick cloth diapers, but to no avail.  Must have some sort of vinyl cover to go over.  I can't stand the vinyl covers since they don't breathe.  That is just a perfect environment for a rash.

- 1	We have 4 of these cups plus a stainless one and loved them. They are easy to drink from, leak proof when the top is snapped shut and fairly easy to wash. These were the only straw cups I used with my toddler for the past 1+ yr. However, I recently learned some disturbing news about the plastic material they use for these cups, called Tritan. It's made by the Eastman company and is touted as being BPA-free and ultra-safe. However, there is some question about their safety testing methods and some suggest that Tritan may leach substances that are worse for you than BPA. There have been some comparisons between what Eastman is doing and what big tobacco did. That's scary, especially when the health of your baby is concerned.I'm very disappointed to learn such disturbing news about a cup we trusted and loved so much and am especially disturbed that these companies would play their &#34;games&#34; with things that affect our babies health (thought I'm not entirely surprised). I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 bc they are very well designed. However, we, sadly, won't be using these cups anymore. Shame on you Eastman.	
1. 	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a stay open feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.	
- 1	I really like that this is a BPA-free sippy cup. Everyone seems to have different experiences with these things, but we just couldn't get it to stop leaking. It is one of my least favorite sippy cups.	
1. 	I only found this useful for about the first month. But when you're a new mother, the thought of something tragic happening because he wasn't on his back was enough for me to buy it. It also gave some extra cushion too. It looked a bit cozier than the flat bassinet bottom.  However, looking back I think he would have been ok without it. Newborns don't move very much anyway when they're all bundled up.	
1. 	The balls have a hole in them and are like &#34;squirties&#34;.  I've refrained from buying anything like this anymore because it gets mold inside.  That said, my 2 y.o. daughter would much rather fill the balls and squirt the water everywhere than throw it into the basket!  Still a fun bath time activity.	
- 1	These are way to big for a 1 to 6 month babies wrists.  They fit my 14 and 17 year olds wrists, and almost mine!  They just fall off of babies wrist.	
- 1	I got this swing as a gift.  I actually wanted the Fischer Price one, but I got this instead, and it was an expensive gift so I decided to keep it.  The noise the swing makes while swinging a newborn baby (who is not heavy) is extremely loud and annoying.  It literally sounds like a yapping puppy.  Fortunately my baby is not bothered by white noise, so she is able to sleep in it.  I find it irritates me more than her (as I like to enjoy some quiet time when baby is actually asleep).  The design is pretty.  It is good for both boy and girl.  The music selections are great and very beautiful.  Sounds like it's in stereo.  However it's hard to enjoy when the yapping puppy sound is interfering with it.  Sometimes I will just put baby in the swing, turn on music, and let her sit in place without moving.	
1. 	For a Training pad these are super easy to use, wash and make acceptable with your kid. Have 5 of them now as we braved no diapers at night early on.	
1. 	MUCH easier to use than the plastic shields that you plug into the outlet.  Those are always a huge pain to pry out so you can use the outlet.  With this you simply slide the spring-loaded cover over and plug in your appliance.  When the cord is removed, it springs back into place to cover the outlet.  Simple, easy, effective.  Just wish they were a less expensive as spending $24 on a half dozen of these is awefully rich.	
1. 	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.	
- 1	does not fit properly	
1. 	Okay, we are two guys and we don't have any experience with babies.  So when we had our daughter (by surrogacy) we got a lot of help.  This product line was one of the things we recieved and we use it all the time.  It smells fantastic, and people say it smells &#34;like a baby&#34;.  It works well, she likes having it put on her, and it cleans her up super good.  They also have a baby skin lotion that also smells the same, and works fantastically.  This is one of those secrets that you mom got from your grandmother, and they decided to let you in on it.  The product is golden!!!	
- 1	My baby loves eating different kinds of snacks so I thought this snack dispenser was a great idea.  I was wrong and here's why:(1) lid is difficult to open; and (2) dispenser bottle is kind of deep and each compartment very narrow making it hard to grab snacks once compartment is half full.  Also, it's worth mentioning that the small opening in lid is useless.  It's just too much trouble using this dispenser so instead, I use small zip lock bags.  I'm thinking about using regular containers as well.	
1. 	Love this item and really love the price. It works great to corral all the little ones diapering items as well as a few of mommy's essentials as I keep it on my nightstand. My 16 week old just transitioned to size 2 diapers and 20 fit perfectly in the organizer. Love that it pairs perfectly with the wipes warmer too!	
1. 	These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands). I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack. I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns. My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with MONKEY BOY or POWER DROOLER all over them. They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials. To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars. You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby. Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin. Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin. Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.Edit on 3/27/2013:  I am now using the very same bibs on my 18 month old daughter.  So these bibs have been in constant use since November of 2009, well over 3 years, and still look great...colors are still bright, terrycloth hasn't pilled, waterproof layer between the terry layers is still fully intact, and they come out of the dryer essentially flat (not curled from the low heat).  Velcro still super sticky.  I haven't had to throw a SINGLE ONE out...really amazing.  I'm pleasantly shocked at how well they've held up!	
1. 	We ordered this changing table for our granddaughter and have no regrets! High quality and perfect for our needs! The only negative was that we wished it would have come with baskets to fit in the openings. I got the dimensions for the openings off of the product information and ordered some on another website because I didn't see anywhere on the Amazon site where they stocked them.	
1. 	I love this sling when I need a quick and easy option for carry my baby when I'm out and about.  It fits her better now that she's older (4.5 months) than when she was tiny (I preferred my moby-style wrap then) and it's comfortable for me as well.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the amount of threads that are left at the end of every row of stitching--a higher-quality product would have gone back to trim these, but instead there are little 1/8-1/4 left overs all over it.  It doesn't detract from the appearance unless you're up close and picky like me, and it's not unraveling or affecting the functionality--but I keep meaning to go back to it and trim all over.  Lovely color though, and overall I enjoy this product =)	
- 1	I loved the look of this cup and my 8mo has no trouble sucking water out of it, but only if the conditions are right. The valve is a neat design and mostly keeps the liquids in, but is awkward to clean and does spill a little with every knock of the cup on the table. The biggest disappointment are the handles, which are very loose and will spin around the base when he tries to lift the cup. He finds it so frustrating that, although in the right position the handles would be very comfortable for him to hold, he'd rather I hold it for him. It's also because as soon as the liquid level is below about 3/4 full, the cup has to be horizontal or tilted backwards for the liquid to go into the valve, and he doesn't like tilting his head that far back. He has more success and finds it more comfortable drinking out of a regular Target sports bottle (with a straw), which is surprisingly also far more leak-proof.Pros:- looks great- nice shape handles for a baby to hold (if they stayed in place)Cons:- handles are loose- valve difficult to clean inside- does spill a little when shaken- only works at a very limited angle (a little too low or too high, or slightly to the side, and you won't get anything out)Overall, really wanted to like this product, but using it has been a sore disappointment.	
- 1	We bought this hoping to carry our 7 month old son.  Everyone had raved about Ergo carriers, so we decided to give it a try.  Upon receiving it, I noted that the instruction manual recommends that you only use it as a front carrier up to 6 months old.  Turns out that's for a really good reason.  Our 19 pound baby was WAY to heavy for me to front carry in this carrier.  We were both uncomfortable.So, I tried adjusting for a hip carry.  It's a horrible hip carrier.  The straps aren't straight, they're angled.  They dug into my neck, and put all the weight there.I wasn't interested in carrying a baby so young on my back, so I had to return it.As a side note - I had picked the Performance carrier because I wanted to carry him during the summer, and it's quite hot here.  Well, when I opened it up, I realized that wasn't going to happen.  The material is really thick, and the lining is black.  There's also no lining between you and the baby, so I knew we'd be sweating all over each other (just like with another carrier we'd tried).	
1. 	I really like these bowls for home-made baby food. I've bought them several times, and they last an acceptable amount of time, even going through the microwave and dishwasher. In fact, the reason we have to keep buying more is that with our two kids, we get ditzy and forget them places!!!I also use these for toddler snack food in the diaper bag or car, holding pre-measured formula for bottles, and for playing with playdough.As you can see, there are many kid-friendly uses for them...But wait, there's more:This is a great size container for multiple uses in the kitchen as well. I can make a small batch of cinnamon sugar and store it covered in my cupboard. Leftover vegetables or fruit salad fit perfectly in here and the lids are airtight to keep them fresh! I use it to mix cornstarch and water to thicken. And so much more. These are great containers!!	
1. 	When my grandson eats with his long sleeve shirts on it can be a challenge to keep them clean.  I usually take the shirt off but now with this bib I don't have too.  It is soft and easy to clean.  I have even washed it in the washing machine.  The pocket catches what he drops.  Love the quality and it will last a few years.	
1. 	This item was recommended to me by multiple friends with kids and they were right. What would I do without it? My baby is four months old and able to use it with a little assistance from a blanket in front of her. She will be able to use it without help by the time she is five months easily. It is great now that she has better use of her arms and hands and would rather sit than lay down. The extra support on the back gives her the ability to see the world from a sitting view and allows me to play with her face to face instead of looking at her from above. I purchased mine before the recall so I received the belt portion as an add on directly from the company. I have not installed it yet because we only use the item when on the floor and I don't see the need for it quite yet. I am sure when she becomes more mobile I will need to install it, but until then we are just loving this piece. I even had my mother purchase one so we can use it when we fly up for Christmas.	
1. 	My husband and I tried several types of bottles before finding these. We loved that the vent was at the bottom of the bottle. We had trouble with other bottles with the vent at the top of the bottle. The vent always seemed to get blocked on other styles of bottles. We also like the bend in the VentAire bottles. It allows more of the milk to settle in the nipple. I've never had them leak on me and I used them for months on end (my daughter self weaned at 10 months) and never had the numbers come off.Aside from that, the only problem as far as this is concerned: When you fill the water up to the 6 or 9 ounce mark (the highest ounce per bottle) and try to add the necessary scoops of formula it can be a bit difficult to fit it all in and shake it up. I avoided that problem by mixing it in another container of course and pouring it into the vent-air bottles. Other then that Great bottles to use.	
1. 	These bibs were the sturdiest I have found so far.  They caught a lot of food.. and when my son got sick, they caught the other stuff too.  They kept him from making huge messes all over the place.	
- 1	The pressure mount at 34 inches felt to insecure. We added 1&#34; wood on either side to make it sturdier. Also used longer screws for the mounting rings. Retraining self to be conscious of the white bar at the bottom, not to stub toe or trip over it. Especially as ours is at the top of a stair.	
1. 	These are hollow blocks, so they will get squished/crushed very easily.  You can pull them back to their original square shape, but they aren't really blocks in my opinion.  They are squishy cubes.  That being said, I still think they are a good purchase (again, so long as you aren't under the impression that you can stack these blocks).  They are very colorful, with many different animals, patterns, textures, and lots of tags for your baby to explore.	
- 1	I did a lot of research on baby gates before settling on this one. I wanted a top of stair gate that I would not have to drill into our wood banisters with. We've only had the box open a few hours and I have several issues.1) Poor quality -  My husband installed it tonight and the velcro broke when he was trying to tighten it around the banister. Does not make me feel good about the safety of the product.2) Annoying to close - When I purchased I did not realize how the door mechanism works. You basically have to lift the door and lower some pegs into holes. I was hoping for something a little less labor intensive for closing. Because the banisters are not perfectly vertical (because they have round parts and square parts) you end up having to pull the top part back over (I assumed you'd be locking the width once it was set and not having to deal with it sliding back and forth when open). This spacing issue is illustrated slightly in their example photo - you can see when the gate is latched the vertical bar in the middle overlaps more on the bottom and there is a slightly larger gap at the top. Ours has an even more pronounced difference.3) Doesn't fit our setup - The leg on the bottom is pretty much useless for us. We have two wooden banisters which are mounted on top of a small wooden base. If you try to lengthen the foot by using the adjustments, it comes unscrewed before it contacts the floor.4) Door opens both ways - I thought doors for the top of stairs should not swing out over the stairs. This gate swings both ways!UPDATE: After several months of using the gate still drives us nuts. People that come in our home have a hard time closing it proper since you have to put the bottom part in and then pull the top part over. I've seen people close it with just the top pegs in (bottom parts not in) and also seen people close it without the top part fully latched. This really worries me as toddlers LOVE to shake gates. We've tried to no avail to make it an off-limits activity. I think that's a bit like putting candy in front of a child and telling them not to eat it. That said we haven't had any disasters. Our regular babysitter has told me on several occasions the gate drives her crazy too.I called the company about the broken velcro and they were very good about sending replacement pieces at no charge.	
1. 	soft and durable!! i can only recommend it if you got the summer changing pad :) i wash it 2-3 times a week (changing accidents all the time, lol) and it is holding up.	
1. 	We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails!  I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her!  It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only downfall I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static.  Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room...None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews.  I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product.  However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy!  It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!	
1. 	I don't know what it is about these cups, but they are my son's favorites.  He is happy and content to just crawl around on the floor holding the cups.  As he gets older, I think he will be able to start stacking and building with them as well.  A great investment and a happy baby/momma!	
1. 	So it's not an Eddie Bauer high chair.  It's not fancy, but it is easy to clean and it buts snugly on most chairs.	
1. 	Got it for my wife who is a side sleeper and was having a hard time sleeping due to pregnant tummy. She is very happy with this pillow and says it provides plenty of support.	
- 1	Purchased hoping the strap was long enough to wrsp around the leg of the table but apparently isnt made for tables where the legs are flush with the edge of the table. Hook also broke as I was taking the item out of the package...	
1. 	My youngest (6 months) and I bedshare and this product worked really well on my queen size bed.  I felt really safe a night knowing he wasn't going to roll out of bed.  Highly recommended!	
- 1	I wanted to like this despite the other reviews about the short ties. We have a Babyletto Mercer 3-in-1 Convertible Crib.  The corners are too wide and the ties are SUPER SHORT!  I love the soft minky dot fabric but the form doesn't seem like it would hold up. I couldn't even get it tied on to try it but it seems like you would have to take the whole thing off to change the sheet. No thank you	
- 1	My little one was potty trained except for night time.  This was too small.  She is only 30 lbs and the weight limit is 51.  We could barely get it over her hips.  There also isn't much room for an insert and a 2.5 year old has quite a bladder, it would have been better if we left her in underpants (urine everywhere.)  I do not recommend this for overnight training.Pros:cutelooks nicewashabledurableCons:too smalldoes not look or feel like underweartakes too long to dryelastic is not very stretchy	
- 1	The car seat was difficult to install rear facing.  I took it to the hospital near my home that performs car seat checks and they stated that it is one of the most difficult seats to install rear facing.  I drive an SUV and the seat in front of the car seat needs to be pushed forward to a point that an adult cannot sit there.  I was dissatisfied at this point of using the seat but we were working around the issue.  Today my child threw up in the seat and I need to take the cover off to wash it.  There is apparently an older version of this car seat in which the base is removable, the current seat does not have this feature.  The cover is seriously impossible to remove.  I just spent 15 minutes on hold waiting for a customer care agent to explain what I'm doing wrong...I spent 15 minutes on the phone with her explaining that I'm not doing it wrong, I just need to try harder.  To remove the round plastic pieces holding the cover down where your child's bottom would be you need to stick your hand in between the base and the seat and press the bottom of the piece through the top by pressing a lip that holds it in place toward the outside of the seat (this is an extremely small space, even with the seat fully reclined).  Once there you need to use great force (enough force that they recommend a screw driver or butter knife) to press the lip toward the outside.  Unfortunately to reach this plastic lip I need to bend my fingers around another large plastic piece - I wear a women's small glove and they barely fit - good luck bending a screwdriver around in this manner.  I'm seriously going to have to get a babysitter so I can drive my car (without a car seat and child) to purchase a new seat or deal with vomit smell.  Only buy this car seat if you won't be installing it rear reclining and you plan to never never wash it.	
1. 	THIS THERMOMETER IS QUICK AND ACCURATE.  IT IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY.	
- 1	I bought the Discovery 5 because it looked bigger than what we had... It is bigger, and even lighter, but it is too hard to snap into the base to start. You have to push the front in first before the back locks (the other one I had just snapped right on top of the base), so it's quite hard to line up when you're carrying a heavy baby. Also, the straps on my other one adjusted from the front with a simple latch and pull. This one supposedly you can adjust from behind, but no matter what I do.. pull hard, pull light, pull with the buttons pushed, etc.. I can NOT get the straps to budge.I've had the seat get stuck in the base in the front part that you have to snap before locking the whole thing down. It is such a headache, and I hate this seat. I'm considering it $60 wasted, because I've had it 2 weeks and I just can't stand it anymore and I'm going to have to find a new seat.	
1. 	My son loves this teether. He loves moving things and this is great for that since it twists and turns. My husband and I actually play with it too sometimes! Great teether and also great toy, it keeps my son entertained for a long time. (He is 6 months old)	
1. 	This bottle warmer has been a big timesaver.  I can put a bottle in, change my baby's diaper, and come back to a warm bottle.  This less crying my hungry baby does, the better.  The only thing about this warmer is the trial and error needed to get going.  At first, you have to figure out what amount of water will get your bottle to a good temperature.  Once that is figured out, the warmer is so easy to use.  I also find that cleaning it out every few weeks and letting vinegar sit in it for a little while, will keep it consistant.  As it gets dirty, it tends to become inconsistant.I definately give this Bottle Warmer 2 thumbs up.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the trial and error needed to figure out how much water for the bottle and amount of formula.(I use Avent bottles and they fit great)	
1. 	We had a Sesame Street potty seat from when I potty trained our daughter 3 years ago, but it didn't seem like it would block any spray from my son.  He just turned two and has expressed a lot of interest in using the potty (he's gone a number of times in the last week!).  He loves this seat and says Go peepee on the Winnie the Pooh potty! (or Go peepee on the McQueen potty, since we have a different one in our bathroom downstairs).  No spray/splashing problems, easy to clean/wipe up.  This mommy is happy!	
1. 	I liked the fact that this toothpaste had xylitol (sp?) in it for tooth protection.  The finger brush works great until they get sharp little teeth. I've switched to a regular baby toothbrush because she started chomping down on my finger around 10.5 months (babies can bite hard!), but the finger brush is a nice wy to start.  She always enjoys brushing her teeth and I like knowing that it's safe for her to swallow.	
- 1	I use this for baby food. I thought silicone would make it easy to pop the cubes out, but because the cubes are right next to each other the whole tray is like a rock. You can't get the food out unless you thaw it a little first. I tried peeling back the silicone and actually put a little hole in it. It would work better with a little space between each cube like a normal ice cube tray.	
1. 	We got these plugs for the rooms where our baby does not hang out as much. They work very well, even when she sees them she does not mess with them as they do not stand out much. A great value with 36 plugs too, cant beat that!	
1. 	We purchased this item because our 3 week old was spitting up every time he laid on his back. The item came in two pieces with a zipper case. It wasn't difficult to manipulate the second piece so that the two angles matched. If you're having issues, make sure you put in the second piece right-side up! The zipper does go down the middle but is not noticeable once you place the wedge under the mattress or sheet protector. Would absolutely recommend to anyone having spit-up issues!	
- 1	This spray smells like rotten bananas.  I purchased it for the diaper bag but don't want to use it in public because the smell is so strong and it fills the room you're in.  It works well enough but I think plain water would work the same. I have found a diaper area wash of another brand that works better, smells much nicer, and can be diluted for economy.	
1. 	This Baby Bjorn is great for summer babies - much cooler than the traditional black or navy carrier.  The breathable mesh keeps baby secure and you from sweating.

1. 	We purchased this carrier for our trip to Ft Davis, Texas where a lot of hiking is involved. My husband, who is 6ft 2in. had no problem with it at all. It fit him perfectly and he said it was very comfortable. Also our 1 year old daughter who weighs 21 lbs. loved riding up high and being able to see everything. The only down side to it is there is little storage space but that really wasn't a problem for us seeing as I had a back pack with me that carried all of our 5 kids things in it. So all in all a good product at a good price. I would recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	We put the changing table in our bedroom because baby is still sleeping in bassinet - SHE loves this mobile. We put it on the side of the changing table and at 5 weeks was staring and smiling looking at it. I wish I got it earlier (e.g. before baby so she could have it day one). Since she needed to be stimulated this worked as I didn't want to put decals on my bedroom walls, the changing table is moving once she's in her own room. HIGHLY recommend.	
1. 	First off - don't leave your baby alone sitting in it. ELIMINATES the safety issue! I have seen and heard many complaints of babies toppling over who don't yet sit up without support. But really, this is more of a place to support your baby to sit while you sit with them and interact.We were gifted one by our PTs office for our then 9 month old daughter with Downs who did not yet sit up on her own but really wanted to interact with us. Considering her reduced muscle strength it was PERFECT. We could sit with her for a good half an hour while she worked to maintain her balance (like on a yoga ball...) and we used toys and games to keep her entertained. She was sitting up in it on her own in no time, and then without the seat shortly after.We love the seat. Will get a new one for the new baby when she is beginning to try to sit up! Easy to clean, easy to store, and endless possibilities for play.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product as I was really tired of the Velcro on my diaper bag waking up my baby every time I opened it.  The bad news, it doesn't work.  My bag does not stay closed with the strength of these magnets. Maybe if they were stronger... Bottom line, I'd rather have a bag that stays shut than a bag that is super quiet.	
- 1	The other reviews talk about ease of assembly. Well, mine must have been defective.Nothing fit together easily, and once together did not line up to attach. After this, realized one tower piece was missing. Took apart, placed back in box and returned. I don't have time for this nonsense. I assemble everything I buy myself, from furniture to toys. You usually can tell if something is well made and worth it, this was not. Waste of time and energy!	
- 1	The term 'blanket' is not an accurate description here.It's far too small to be used as a blanket - I use it as a burp cloth (just covers my shoulder).  It looks like a rushed-job from the creative department of someone's kitchen table. Neither plush or elegant. Missed opportunity!!	
1. 	I have tried to get my breastfed boy to take a bottle for quite a long time. After several attempts with other nipples, such as tommee tippee, and nuk, I have found this is the only one he will actually take! Such a relief! He takes it without any issues or spitting it out (which he did with every other nipple). And he still breastfeeds just fine and takes the bottle when I need him to! Best of both worlds!	
- 1	Too bad I was so busy as a first time mom that I couldn't get my act together to use this and then return it within the time allowed when I discovered how disappointed I was with the performance of this product. The biggest problem is the suction cups do not work. I have tried different table surfaces. I have tried moistening the suction cups. One or two might work at a time, but only temporarily. The mat surface worked well for eating, and the trough did a pretty good job catching dropped food. If the mat would stay flat on hard surfaces, or have an alternative grip method for more table surfaces, I would like this better. Basically, I found this product a waste of money. I do not recommend it.	
- 1	At first, I was so happy with this product.  It's great to have a way to keep milk cold so that you don't have to rush to the fridge all the time.BUT . . . the straw disintegrated under my son's teeth, and Thermos has terrible customer service.  The rep said that they don't warrant the straw and that I should throw it away and buy a new one.  When I asked for her name, she refused to give it but instead transferred me into a voicemail.	
- 1	We had 3 of those in total and all 3 of them broke after a short time.One of them, the hook broke off, 2 of them did not roll back in and the part that is supposed to stick to the window also kept on falling off. I can not recommend this window shade.	
1. 	They seem a little flimsy and loose. But the looseness turns out to be a benefit, because my toddler can't accidentally turn anything on. Easy to open for adults, hopefully will take my toddler a while to get past these. Great investment!	
1. 	This mat is great, but the only problem we had was that the mats smelled really BAD (chemical smell) initially.  We aired them out for about a week, and then the smell was much less toxic.	
1. 	I have almost 30 different bibs from different brands and this one is by far my favorite. Although my son outgrew them by 9 months, I still use them as face wipes while he's eating. It's super soft, even after weekly washes. I love the idea of having a thicker neck line to keep food from getting into his shirt which his other bibs aren't able to control.If you'd like more tips about must have baby registry items, what to expect in your first year of motherhood, and even what recovery after delivery might look like, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com.	
- 1	I don't understand what the big deal is about these bottles. I found them to be nothing but annoying. First of all, I found absolutely no difference in the amount of air bubbles in these Dr. Brown's vs. other brands (BreastFlow, Medela), and the other drawbacks made this a poor option overall. These require more time to clean them, given the extra parts, which is extremely cumbersome when you're having to wash bottles for feeds every 2-3 hours around the clock. Another huge problem with these is that you need to order them in two different sizes, as the bottle is only designed to be about 2/3 of the way full to accommodate the venting system. Thus, unless you want to use a really big bottle for your newborn, you're going to end up ordering the smaller sizes and the larger sizes for later on. After investing a lot of money in 4 sets of Dr. Browns (two sets of both sizes for our twin girls), we ended up scrapping these and going with BreastFlow. The flow was perfect (nice and slow) and helped to minimize gas just as well and they were a bit easier to clean (despite also having a lot of parts), as the inner piece was larger and could accommodate a standard bottle brush (i.e. we didn't have to also use the special nipple brush that comes with Dr. Brown's). The drawback with the BreastFlow is that they don't fit onto a breastpump. Alas, we grew tired of washing all of these parts as well, and then discovered the Medela bottles. Hallelujah! They consisted of three simple parts, were quick and easy to clean, and they fit onto my breastpump. They flow out of the Medela bottles is nice and slow, and minimizes gas just as well, even without a special air vent system.	
1. 	Like this.  I don't use it as much as I thought I would, but the couple times I have used it, it's been handy and useful.	
1. 	We often placed our baby in this rocker when we wanted to feed her or to have her in comfort while we sat down for a break. By the time baby was 6 months, she out grew it. Were we not helicopter parents she should have easily gotten hurt from a fall and the straps.	
- 1	This unit was pretty good until the toggle power switch broke. It is fairly intuitive to use, picture was decent (a lot of people have complained about the video, but I thought it was good enough), but the battery life, even when new, wasn't remotely what is advertised. When I purchased it, it promised eight hours on battery but was beeping at us after four.A little more than a year after we bought it, the toggle power switch broke. Motorola offers no support after one year. For a monitor this expensive to break at a year of normal use is ridiculous, and that Motorola clearly doesn't stand behind its products (don't get me started on the Razr...) is pathetic.At this point, we can still use it, as at least it was already on when it broke, but it has to stay plugged in, because when the battery dies and it powers off, we won't be able to turn it on again.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	
1. 	The seat is cute and easy to attach to just about any chair.  I wanted a booster seat to take to friends' houses or when we travel.  It folds easily/quickly, making it easy to transport.  When we're home, I use the seat when we're sitting at the table coloring or doing other crafts.  It has worked for me exactly how I need it.	
- 1	This is a flimsy seat and the back falls off if you move it. There is almost no side-impact protection. I would not buy this seat.  We wanted a good, high-back booster for a 9-year-old and went with the Recaro brand. WHAT a difference for not much more money!Also, this seat does not latch so you have to buckle in the empty seat every single time your child is not in it, or it could be a projectile in a crash.And it's very hard to put the back on! If you do use this, please do so for ages 6 and up only (maybe 5 if the child is mature and sits properly). Preschoolers are not safe in boosters!	
1. 	Love our Bundleme. We are currently using it with the Baby Jogger, City Mini Stroller and it's been a lifesaver during cold and windy days. It does not fit perfectly, but it's a 'universal' item and the best thing that I have found after thoroughly researching online. I have washed it a couple of times and it washes up well. The 'sprout' (limegreen) is a fun color. Too bad Baby Jogger does not have an accessory like the Bundleme designed for their strollers.	
1. 	I used this product on our fireplace to cover up the sharp edges but it doesn't stick very well to natural stone.  So occasionally I have to re-stick it once it comes loose. Other than that it looks great and helps protect my baby from injury.	
1. 	I somehow lost the cover for my snoogle after my first pregnancy, and ordered this is a replacement. It is PERFECT! I couldn't believe the difference in the snoogle with the case on - it is firmer and provides much more support. So happy that I could get a new cover!	
1. 	These produce a strong, pleasant, citrus smell that gets rid of the nasty cloth diaper smell in my nursery.  I love them and would recommend them to anyone!	
- 1	I thought it would give you ideas of how to paint or what to paint but it is just the paint itself and a sponge, which is a little overpriced for what it is. Great concept and it turned out really well, just wonder if i could have bought some non toxic paint at the local store for 10% of the cost.	
1. 	great changing pad cover, washes clean after accidents and it's nice and soft.  I have this in blue and sage, the blue is very pretty, the sage isn't quite what i expected and isn't that pretty of a color, but I'm more concerned with function anyway so it doesn't bother me much.	
1. 	I got this for my son and it works just like it say it will. I had to get another one for the other toilet.	
1. 	Used these for all my baby food purees, easy to remove, easy to clean.  Now that we are done with baby food I use these to store excess broth, wine, etc for recipes.	
1. 	wow what an awesome product!!  really helped since my son would not go on a public potty while potty training, he was so scared.  this made potty training so easy while out shopping!  and it fits in my purse/ diaper bag!  so glad to have it for my next child!	
1. 	This is the greatest toy.  My 5 month old son will bounce for hours in it and I feel safe because it has a metal frame and it's not attached to the doorway.I only have one complaint...why can't it be portable?????  Nobody makes a portable one, so I have to take it apart and bring it with me when we go out.  If I know that we'll be at someone's house for a few hours, I will make the effort to take it with me.Kelly	
1. 	This pump helped me in breastfeeding a lot. At first i thought I would use it once in a while but a couple of weeks into it I used it every day to store extra breastmilk and this way my husband or mother can enjoy feeding the baby too. My son would still get precious breastmilk, and I would be able to rest. Also, Dr. Brown's Bottles screw on right onto the pump!	
1. 	Great photo book. I'll be ordering more of these as a  new mom taking WAY too many pictures of my little girl! Love the windows on the outside and the personalization options. Doesn't look cheap and well made.	
- 1	Not good in comparison with indian prefold diapers from places like Green Mountain, Little Lions, etc.  These will barely hold a few ounces of liquid without leaking.  I bought two packs and lost the reciept, so I guess I'll just use them as rags, or extra wipes when I run low.  I won't be using them as diapers, though.	
1. 	Just bought this for my 9.month-old and we love it. it is super comfortable and since she is only 9 months old the side cushions are very good for her to feel more protected.	
- 1	While my son is drinking from the cup, the part where the plastic spout meets with the lid comes apart and leaks all over the place.	
- 1	Filling them is hard. To shut it a lot spills out you must put not that much to be able to shut it. I so wasted my money.	
1. 	Love these things.  I would give a 5 star, but they are hard to keep clean.  As some reviews noted, bananas are hardest to clean out of these things...but I find if you soak it in a cup of water as soon as you are done with it, they rinse out well and then I clean in the dishwasher.  My 6 month old can hold it, and chews/sucks on apple and pear slices.  He is a little young to give a whole apple slice to chew on...but this way he gets the same benefit with minimal supervision.  Would also work well if you put in the freezer when they are teething.	
1. 	I would actually rate this about 3.5 stars.Pros:  The white portion of the product is soft and flexible, so if your child falls into it, it's going to hurt LESS than hitting the hard metal faucet.  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt at all, just less chance of a more serious cut or injury.The water fans out in a waterfall, so your child can sit further back from the faucet and still be able to play with the water as the tub fills.Cons:  The resevoir for the bubble bath sometimes leaks, from the outlet where it's supposed to come out, but occasionally around the sides too.  Not enough leakage to make a big mess while the Boon Flo is on your faucet.  If you want to remove it for your own bathtime, however, the flip-top where you pour in the liquid has a VERY loose seal, so you have to be careful where you store the Boon Flo when not in use, as it will leak.Also, I usually only get two or 3 bubble baths out of how much liquid the resevoir holds before I have to refill it.  Maybe my brand of bubble bath doesn't suds as much as others.Overall, not bad.  My daughter loves the waterfall, but the bubble bath dispenser could be better designed.	
1. 	Not all kits include scissor, digital thermometer, tweezer etc. This is one does. The compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling. Great value!	
1. 	We use this for all night sleep with our 4 month old. We used to have a sleep sheep but we needed to turn it on every time our baby stirred to help ease her back to sleep. We looked for an all night sleeping machine but all were so expensive. This one is great and inexpensive! For those reviews that say its not loud enough- I have a trick! When you first turn it on, it does not go to the volume level you left it at. It always goes to a mid level volume. So every night I turn it on and press the volume up button a few times to make it louder. Hope this helps people.	
1. 	I heard this product from others, haven't use it for my love because it's a bit of bigger, I may use it later.	
- 1	I bought this for when my grandchildren come to visit.  It does not adhere to the high chair nor the table.  The grandchildren can readily pull them up without exerting even the slightest pressure.  This was a very disappointing product and should not be advertised as a 'suction plate'  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SUCTION TO KEEP IT ADHERED TO THE HIGH CHAIR OR TABLE.  We've tried putting some moisture on the ring, but that didn't help either.  Another drawback is that the suction ring must be removed from the plat and hand-washed.	
1. 	I don't use Dr. Brown's bottle but these fit other brands well. Some of the bottles I bought only came with rings and nipples and no storage caps so I was looking for some to go on those bottles when being stored. One issue I have had is that these are a little deeper than some of the other caps and depending on the shape of the bottle you use these won't fit. They fit tight on the 5oz Medela bottles that came with my pump and the 2.5 oz Medela storage bottles I have. They also fit on some 5oz Evenflo storage bottles (don't like having to clean the two piece lid that came with those). They do not fit tight on the 5oz Gerber First Essentials I have but would work as long as the bottle doesn't get tipped over.	
- 1	I just can't find a good set of knob covers. The lock access for these is so small you only want to use them if you have a push button lock system on the door, or just a deadbolt. They didn't work for us at all.	
- 1	I was really excited when I heard about the product and ordered it straight away, but the result was disappointing. The nipplette just simply does not stay on even with the support of wearing a bra on top of it to prevent contact with cloth while moving around. The effect, of course, wasn't as described either.	
- 1	This is a nice swing but I have 1 huge problem with it.  The music shuts off automatically every 20 minutes.  This Is the most frustrating and pointless feature I have ever seen.  My daughter naps beautifully in it UNTIL the music shuts off.  Then she wakes up almost immediately, so therefore someone must be listening (and awake which equals no nap for me) to restart the stupid thing every time.  The swing continues to rock and can be plugged in so saving battery life is not the reason for this feature.  Extremely frustrating to say the least!!!	
1. 	This organizer was just what I was looking for.  I have a dresser/changing table combo and this organizer is a perfect fit! I am able to fit everything I need for a diaper change, with room to spare!  I love that the diapers are at my fingertips.  My one complaint is that my Huggies wipes container is just a tiny smidge too long for the space.  It isn't really noticeable when you look at it, but I just like everything to be perfect.  I don't use a diaper warmer, so I can't comment on that.  The price is definitely right and so far I am very happy with this purchase!	
1. 	Not the size I ended up needing, but nothing was wrong with the product itself. Not going to give a lower rating just because they weren't my size, there really is no way to tell unless you try them.	
1. 	This bib has a soft pleasant feel, but seems to be durable as well.  Easy to wipe off, or wash.  The design is even prettier close up than in the online pics.  I am planning on getting a couple more.	
- 1	I wanted to like these, but they were a total disappointment.  They fell of my daughter's hands immediately, the wrist bands didn't really seem to have any elastic properties.  I thought maybe when she got a little bigger they'd work, but she's 2 months old (and not small) and they are still useless.  We found the gerber ones with the elastic to be the best so far.	
1. 	I was sick of pushing my original Chicco Mamma High Chair around the kitchen and out of the way, so I bought this. So far, I am not disappointed.I have a hefty 6 month old (22lbs) that is comfortable in the chair. I have already used it many times at home and taken it out twice to restaurants. It seems to fit all kinds and styles of chairs. It fits snugly onto the chair, so I am not worried about it falling off or tipping over.I like that I can remove the tray insert and still have a usable surface. I also appreciate how easy it is to clean, with no nooks and crevices to get food permanently stuck in.It is easy to use and priced well. My only concern is that my son has already figured out how to snap off the tray insert by reaching his hand over and pulling up on the lip of the insert. I also wonder if the system it uses to attach to the side of the chair is a wee bit too flimsy. I am nervous that after months of taking it off and putting it back on that it will become loose and not stay on as well.Only time will tell, I suppose. For the time being, I am pretty happy with it.	
- 1	I bought this for my 7 month old and it is a terrible, potentially harmful toy. She is teething and was immediately drawn to the colorful books, grabbing them, opening them, and, of course, putting them in her mouth. I was shocked to find that the colors ran. The product says paint free, but there is definitely some kind of paint on the books, and it dissolves in your baby's mouth. I do not know what they are made of, but I don't take risks with my baby's health and immediately took the toy away from her.In addition to this hazard, the toy is not very good for introducing sounds. It has Ma-Ma, Da-Da, and Ba-Ba listed as the M, D, and B sounds. Then a picture of a monkey, a dog, and a sheep. Overall, it is a poorly designed, potentially dangerous baby toy.	
- 1	I love the bright colors of these mats and the easy of portability as you can just roll them up and stick them in your diaper bag, but I was so disappointed to find that they slide on my table. We have a wood (pine) dining table that is stained with wood stain and the mats slide all over the place. We're hoping we can use these later when our kids our older and understand not to pull on the placemats, but for now, we have to put them aside as the second they go on the table, the bright color attracts their attention and off they go, taking all of the food with them. Oh well.	
- 1	Plain and simple...it just doesn't work.The apparently simple design of just 2 buttons on the front is misleading because you just can't get the thing to work right.  On top of that it insists on being cleaned, even immediately after a thorough cleaning.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly, my little one hated having it placed inside of her ear.Another BUST form Safety 1st.	
- 1	After reading so many great reviews this was THE one thing I really wanted off my registry. However, I don't see what everyone is so enthralled about. When we brought him home, I felt like he was too tiny for this thing. He ended up sleeping in my arms for the first month because he wouldn't really sleep in it, which I truthfully didn't mind. I wanted him in the same room as us. Once he kind of started sleeping in it, he started breathing really funny in his deep sleep stage. Then one night he literally was gasping for air the way he was positioned (properly I mind you). That was when I decided to start the crib and he has NO breathing issues. Now I know why the doctors recommend sleeping FLAT on their backs.	
- 1	We loved this spoon set when it was new, but after a few uses and contact with hot food, it's melted and deformed a little.I think it'll be great for salad, fruit and ice cream, definitely not for hot food.	
1. 	Recently, while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my Medela Pump In Style Breastpump, which are vital for operation. The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4 oz, 9 oz or disposable. I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be plugged in and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed.	
- 1	I bought this bottle because my daughter has terrible gas.  It LEAKED everywhere!  I was hoping that I just had a defective bottle but all three were like this.  We finally ended up throwing them out after a few uses.  We had also purchased the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them.  My daughter's gas and spitting has decreased dramatically with Dr. Brown's.  Do not waste your money on this product!	
- 1	Elastic already came appart from the sheet. Have been using it for less than 2 months. I liked this sheet at first, now not so much. I thought it would last longer.	
1. 	The only feature I really don't like about this bib is that it's an awkward fit on our daughter with the particular high-chair we use (Safety First space-saver high chair).  It just so happens that the pocket of the bib falls right in between my daughter and the tray of the highchair so it's hard to push the tray right in close where it needs to be.  This is not the fault of the bib however, just an incompatability issue.It's definitely not an issue with other high-chairs - we've used it in those short little wooden chairs you see in most restaurants, and in a normal full-size highchair and the bib works quite well.  I would say 98% of the food my daughter drops lands in the pocket in front, and than she'll scoop it out and eat it or put it back on her plate (or fling in onto the floor which she'll do when she's had enough).I liked the soft rubber feel of this bib compared to some others, and the strap that goes around the back is very gentle on skin and easy to fasten - it's practially impossible to pinch the skin on the back of their neck like what happened with another brand of cheaper pocket bib that we tried.Overall I would recommend the bib - even though it's over-priced you'll only need to buy one (or maybe two) for your child and you can just keep washing and re-using them.  If it helps save some clean-up of food than it's well worth it.	
1. 	Bought this as a gift because we love the one we own! By far the least annoying music making baby toy. We received a used one as gift when my daughter was 9 months and it has held up great over the years. Both of my kids love it too.	
- 1	Love Boon products but this one missed the mark. My toddler was never able to use it for snacks. Opening is too small and slightly rough. We use it as a bath toy instead.	
- 1	For my second baby gate, I decided to try out a custom solution.  I bought a 2&#34;x3&#34; at Home Depot for $1.79 and cut to length.  I secured the beam to the bannister with velcro straps ($6).  I then mounted the gate to the 2x3 and voila!  Same thing for a fraction of the cost.  You could probably also use inexpensive cable ties instead of the more expense velcro straps and do the whole thing for under $5.	
1. 	These have stood up very well in our dishwasher and hold all of our baby's bottles and parts. A must have!!	
1. 	Let me start by saying I'm not normally a comparison shopper.  This situation just presented itself to me in a strange internet-glitch type way.  When I do make a purchase, I do like to mildly compare before a purchase.  So when I was shopping for an outdoor blanket, after looking through various outdoor blankets, I was convinced that the Skip Hop blanket was the one for me.  However, according to Amazon, it would take several months for me to receive it because they were backordered.  I ended up making an order with Babies R Us.....which was later backordered.  It was close to soccer season and I needed one right away so I ordered the JJ Cole blanket because it could be delivered within a week.  I've been using the JJ Cole blanket for over a month now and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's very easy to roll out and when it's time to go, roll back up.  The quality is excellent.  Well, Monday afternoon, the Skip Hop outdoor blanket showed up on my doorstep and I took it to soccer practice to try it out.  Not too impressed.  The cooler bag that goes with it is teeny-tiny and you can't fit much in it.  The zipper makes it more difficult to lay out and fold back up and if you have a baby in your arms, it makes it that much more difficult.  The JJ Cole blanket is cheaper in price and better in quality and it's much easier to use.  I highly recommend it and I get tons of compliments on it.	
- 1	Although these pads get the job done technically speaking I prefer other disposable changing pad products. The PeeWee pads are pretty small so unless your child is a small mess maker these don't cover the needed area. I have a baby boy that waits until you take off his diaper to poop...so I need a sturdier pad. These also wrinkle/ bunch up easy because they are so thin and they are only good for multi uses if you get absolutely nothing on them. However, now that my son is a little older and not peeing at me every time I change his diaper these are handy for the diaper bag. But again they are only big enough for his butt, not his whole body so I still lay down a blanket first when in public changing areas. My favorite disposable pads, although a little more pricy are theMunchkin A&H; Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack.	
1. 	I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more real foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!	
- 1	There is an small hole in this spout ..  it's almost impossible suck water o any light beverage from it .. our boy wasn't doing anything more than playing with it and we wonder why.  then we try and was hard for us to extract something.  I contact NUK to get more info about this issue with no answer yet.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
1. 	I purchased one of each, and I prefer the Bumkins. The major difference for me is that the Bumkins has elastic at the wrists, which prevents the sleeves of whatever baby is wearing underneath from getting dirty, especially if the bib is a little on the large side. The Kushies bib doesn't have the elastic, so the cuffs of his sleeves poke through and get dirty unless I roll them up underneath. Also, the Bumkins bib ties at the neck, while the Kushies bib has velcro. My little guy can pull the velcro bib right off, but the Bumkins one stays securely tied. One other note: If you choose a design that has white or light-colored trim, the trim will stain. Not that big a deal, but if this sort of thing bugs you, I would choose a pattern with darker trim.	
- 1	Battery case must be removed with tiny screwdrviver, lots of patience, and the aide of gravity. hold the toy right side up and undo the screws using the screwdriver upsidedown. Add 3 AAA batteries! It looks like you only need two batteries.  Very akward toy. The batteries won't fall out as it might seem they would. 6 has a fountain children adore. More money yes but so worth it, especially in comparison.	
- 1	I ordered this thinking I was going to love it. It ended up just being ok. I usually love all of OXO tots products but this was a flop. It is a great idea and would have been so much better than ziploc or the eco-fabric baggies. Everything in them always got smashed in my bag. But the lid fips open barely trying. I liked that my daughter could open it by herself, but if it was closed and she tripped it would pop open and the snack would go all over the floor, which defeats the whole purpose of putting the snack in something at all. If they could just redesign the lid just a bit I am sure I would give this another try.	
- 1	To go straight to my points:1) It leaks (I'll upload pictures)2) After 30 minutes of steaming 1 1/2 cup of carrots they were still tough (very!) So I decided to put more water in the chamber and steam it for another 20!... Then &#34;puree it&#34;. When I was done, the carrots (maybe because it leaked all the water) was more looking like grounded coffee than anything else, so I added water and puree it again and it kept the same texture.I didn't want to burn the machine by &#34;pureeing&#34; too much (as it started to make a weird noise after 40 seconds of chopping) so I just got the carrots out (I'll post pictures of this too).I thought carrots might have been the problem, so I steamed apples and it happen again!3) I don't even know if the bottle warmer works, but I have to say, a Tommee Tippee bottle fits comfortably, so it is a good size.4) It is big (specialty for the counter of a 700sq2 feet condo) (10in height x 10in depth x 7in width) and the power cable is kind of short (31 inches)Arghhh I was going to write more, but the Bruins just lost the Stanley Cup... So... I guess this info might be enough.Don't buy this thing, an oven or a microwave and a regular blender will do a better job!	
- 1	I soooooo wanted to love this booster seat.  Yes, it looks very nice.  But I have two main issues:1. The quality of the foam seat is not good. I ordered one seat and saw that there were defects in the foam - little holes on the back of the seat, other defects in the foam.  So I ordered a replacement...same thing.  There were a few tiny tiny raised pieces of foam on the seat, which I could see were going to snag and peel off after wiping it down a few times.  (and the white foam would show through underneath).2.  It is very weird to have a gap between the foam seat the base.  You can't take it off completely, but can only lift it a few inches.Not impressed.	
1. 	I knew I wanted a well-rated, good looking car seat when I was doing research for ours, and wanted something different from the standard Graco and Fisher Prices out there.  Britax consistently had great reviews and many awards so we decided to get the Roundabout.  This model is more portable for travel since we travel a lot.  We haven't traveled overseas with it yet, but we really love it so far. I also have great peace of mind that I have a car seat that exceeds U.S. safety standards.	
1. 	This basket is made well enough - not exceptional, but fine.  Bedding is kind of thin.	
1. 	These are great for babies and tummy time! I like the concept but the quality could have been better. Maybe it's just the one I got.	
1. 	NOthing special going on here with this teether. Its just your normal teether that you can buy anywhere. Its a little bulky.. But it does hold onto a freeze quite well. I wish I knew if I could sterilize it. So if anyone knows..... Please tell me	
1. 	This is super soft and comfy for baby!  My daughter loves to lay on it!  I love the color too.  It can work in a neutral room.	
- 1	See my update below:The functionality of this cup was great at first. No leaks, easy to use. 5 months in? I notice black chips floating in my baby's water and can see the plastic film from the top of the nozzle was peeling off. I got it off manually, and didn't see anymore flakes. Then, the straw part started to discolor and I noticed it filling with mold. Now the straw is a dark gray color and I can't even pass this on for another child to use. Straight in the trash. Unacceptable.UPDATE:I went to a store that sells this cup to ask why there was so much mold.  The store owner explained that ALL sippy cups get moldy (it's the nature of water) and in fact this was one of the only brands that sell extra straws and straw cleaners.  Some brands make you buy a whole new cup! So I went from thinking this cup is awful, to actually being happy about it.  I bought replacement straws and was on my way.	
1. 	Generally I am a back sleeper and so had to adjust to sleeping on my side.  Early in my pregnancy I had a hard time sleeping because my lower hip would hurt so much it would wake me up.  So I got this pillow.  It helped me prop myself so I felt like I was on my back and helped support my lower hip so it didn't hurt.  Now, later in my pregnancy it helps support not just my back and hips but also supports my enormous belly!  I havn't had an uncomfortable night since.  I will say that all of the reviews suggesting that your partner will have very little room on the bed are correct. My partner has been very patient these last 9 months.	
- 1	I purchased this product thinking it would help with the diaper pale smell and even freshen up my babies room a bit.  They don't work, they smell great but only if you stick them up by your nose and take a deep breath.  I put one in the diaper pale, one on the changing table and on in her small walk in closet.  They have done nothing for the dirty diaper smell and you certainly can't smell any lavender scent in her room (they are lavender scented but only if your nose it to the plastic).  I paid $5 for 5 of them, a waste of $5 but at least now I know not to buy them again.	
1. 	I'm very pleased with this cover. It's large enough to cover me and my baby from any angle. I love that it has a wire on top that lets me see my baby while nursing. The fabric design is very cute as well.	
1. 	This pad cover is nice and soft, pleasant color, looks nice and it works. It was well packed and it arrived on time.	
- 1	Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!	
1. 	if you use avent bottles, this is soooo convenient :) I highly recommend this product, I can pump directly to my PES bottles.	
- 1	I'd be okay with the fact that my child ripped these off the wall, but I didn't expect that at 6 months old she would be able to also rip the paint and chunks of the drywall off too!  I knew there was the risk of this happening, but didn't realize so much paint and drywall would come off.  While the cushions are great, the adhesive ruins them.  My advice?  If you need to soften your corners, use these cushions, but secure to the wall using small nails that your child can't pull out.  Repairing a few small holes would be much easier than what we need to do!	
- 1	save your money and buy the medela pump in style. the motor works fine and i can get a lot of milk pumped out with this pump. but beware of jagged edges on the breast flanges or loose pieces of plastic. the last thing you want is for plastic to get into your breastmilk. since i couldn't return the item, i asked lansinoh directly for new materials for the breast pump. they had good and responsive customer service and overnighted the parts right away. but still didn't like the new parts and ended buying the medela pump in style advance which is great.

- 1	I decided to purchase these stickers for my son's nursery. When my husband and I received them, we thought they were adorable, but we had two problems: 1) they STUNK, and even though we aired them out, they still smelled toxic, and 2) they were NOT fabric like we had read in the description. I thought it would have been cute and clever to have fabric wall decorations for the nursery, but they were just plastic like every other sticker. When we contacted the company, they were very curt with us, too, which did not help out our experience. We ended up returning them (paying for shipping back and losing the shipping we spent for them to get to us) and going elsewhere. Two stars simply because the stickers are quite cute.	
1. 	We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!	
- 1	I washed it once when I initailly recieved it and it was fine. I washed it again after the first use, and it came out from the dryer shredded into pieces! Not worth the money, buy something else.	
- 1	Baby would not take this bottle, and husband had a difficult home putting the pieces of the nipple together.  And when I took the nipple off there was still milk trapped between the two layers and leaked out all, over.  I have tried many bottles that are supposed to 'mimic the breast' and have found just a regular nipple with broad base and short nipple is best.  The ones hat come with my pump work great.	
- 1	there is no drain!!! the dirty water just piles up. the pockets are cool though. wasn't enough for me to keep it. I purchaed one with a drain and no pockets. Worth the trade!!	
1. 	This makes it very convenient to use the car seat in two cars without having to mess with the seat belt.  Snap in and snap out quickly and easily.	
- 1	I really like the material of these bibs.  It makes them so easy to wipe clean.  However, these do not work for us because of the pocket.  The pocket sticks out so much that it won't fit between my daughter and her high chair.  She is one now so maybe when she gets taller  the pocket will be above the tray enough so she can wear it.  But for now they are useless for us.	
- 1	I'm pretty sure it is real baltic amber, HOWEVER, even after all the friends I had who swore by these darn things, I say it was a waste of $20. If anything, my son's attitude has gotten 10x worse about everything since I put it on. He's been wearing it for a few days, and has gone from mildly crabby and sleeping through the night, to screaming every waking second, and waking up twice a night again, after being a thru-sleeper for about 3 months. Overall, not impressed. Wouldn't purchase again, wouldn't recommend.	
- 1	When this originally arrived I was very pleased.  The size and functions (two insulated cup-holders, a pouch for keys/snacks/wallet, and an outside pouch for phone) were exactly what I was looking for.  But after several months of use on my Bugaboo, the velcro no longer keeps it in place and the whole console falls down towards the stroller.  Not very useful, especially with drinks!  So although I wanted to love it, I can't say that I do.	
1. 	This is a great product--sturdy and portable.  It saves me having a big highchair in my small kitchen.  It's easy to clean (most boosters have lots of cracks which collect food), and it has a removable dishwasher safe tray cover.  Don't waste your money on something more expensive.  It folds easily for transport or storage, and it comes with a nice cover to keep the tray clean during transport.  My only complaint is that my toddler found it too small as he grew and wanted a bigger seat.  Would be perfect if they made it a little roomier and got rid of the leg divider.  Does not tilt, so not for babies.	
- 1	I cannot believe all the great reviews.  I never even got to use these sheets because they shrank to 50% of the original size when I washed/dryed them for the first time (and our dryer doesn't even get hot).  I was a stupid first time mom who registered for 4 sets and washed all of them together.  Had to purchase another sheet set (2) which we've used for 2 1/2 years.  This is at the very top of my stupid baby purchases.	
1. 	When we first brought our son home from the hospital, he hated the swing we had bought and refused to nap at all during the day no matter how much rocking/singing/nursing we could give him. I think the regular swings made him sit too far up and he didn't have the head control to stay comfortable. A friend bought this swing for us since it was the one the hospital had in their nursery. He absolutely loved it and had his early morning nap in it from about 2 months til now, when he almost outgrown it. It held him more at an incline to support his little head and the side to side motion seemed to be more soothing than front to back rocking. It will be sad to pack this swing away.	
1. 	We received a sleepsack as a gift at a baby shower and ended up ordering another one in a larger size once our son outgrew the newborn size.  We spent a lot of money before our baby was born on swaddling products and in the end, found that we preferred the sleep sack to all of the other products and wish we would have gotten more of these.  The sleepsack is great for our son because he likes to sleep with his arms free.  We can just put him in the sleep sack and not have to worry about tucking a blanket around him (which can often wake him up if we move him once he's already sleeping). We use this product almost every night and during the day for naps (so I would suggest getting a couple if you can!) The sleepsack is easy to put on/take off and the zipper allows for easy access for diaper changes. The fabric is particularly nice because it's not as hot as the fleece version of this product.This product is a total lifesaver...we highly recommend this product!	
- 1	It's not that great and does not hold a lot of food.  Perfect for a newborn but not for 13 month old and up.  The scoop for the spoon is not deep enough.	
1. 	My kid hates brushing his teeth but at least this product has a good taste to it that helped the whole nightly process go smoother.	
1. 	Most bottle brushes are too fat to get all the way into bottles. This brush is the most perfect thing ever. No more trying to pull the brush out and getting water everywhere.	
1. 	Our baby loves the feel of this.  It keeps her warm and the material feels really soft and doesnt irritate the baby.  We dont usually swaddle her with it but we use it for keeping her warm. We got the slightly larger size (size small) so we hope the baby will grow into it :)	
1. 	This highchair works great for my 20 month old.  It straps right to any chair and she is happy as pie to sit and eat in it.  Without the tray, it even pulls under the table enough to allow her to eat right &#34;at the table&#34; sometimes which thrills her to no end.  Perfectly priced too.	
1. 	My daughter has twins.  She was warming their bottles using tap water.  It was taking too long to get hot and she felt like she was wasting a lot of water (we are in a drought).  I looked at all the warmers and their reviews and decided to get this one.  There is one that warms 2 bottles, but I wasn't impressed with the reviews.  My daughter said this one is pretty fast.  Her only complaint was the directions say to let it cool off for 10 minutes before using it again.  Baby #2 doesn't always want to wait another 10 minutes.  My solution was to send her a second one, even though I know her hubby will complain about having more stuff.  At least they aren't a huge investment.	
1. 	I love these and the Sleepsacks. Every parent should have them. They make swaddling you child so much easier than using a blanket and the material is super soft. I highly recommend these and Sleepsacks for when they are older.	
- 1	These are not absorbent at all. My baby regularly pees on the changing table and I have used puppy pads in the past for easy clean-up. They were a little pricey so I thought I would try these. I used maybe two and the rest are sitting in a drawer. After trying these I went back to using puppy pads. Also, I know it is a little strange to comment on, but the pattern on these pads includes different colors of baby hands. One of the colors is red which looks like bloody little hand prints. Gross.	
1. 	My toddler loves this seat. She's tried others--cushier foam ones, fancier moulded plastic ones--and this is the one she prefers. It's simple and lightweight, comfortable but firm enough for her. She actually puts it on the potty herself (it's easy to carry and easy to fit) and gets on and off unaided (she's 3). She likes the duckies too.	
- 1	I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle.  She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick.  NO SUCH LUCK.  The product review says it's stylish but who cares?  What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither.  It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated, the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding.  The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby.  I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help.  I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove.	
1. 	I'm very happy with this product and have had no issues. I use Huggies wipes and have and no issue with using them with this warmer. This is the first one I've owned, but def the most affordable one I've found and it works great.  It has a little spongy pad you soak with water and place in the bottom. The wipes go on top. Yes, the pad will dry out if you don't soak it again.  I actually wet it twice a week, whenever my wipes run out (I use at least 3 every change). Just put it in the sink and run some water over it, if you forget it will get hard and start to turn brown but just wet it again. The little nite light on the front is cute too. No issues with dry wipes or browning wipes. The ones closer to the pad do seem to be warmer than the ones at the very top of the stack, but that would make sense.	
1. 	We tried Avent first and my son never could drink from that big nipple very well.  I breastfed too he was good on both the bottle and breast.  When we used bottles Dr. Brown seem to cause less gas and he enjoyed them better.	
- 1	The suction valve is so tight my daughter inverts the silicone top while drinking because she sucks so hard, and then the top is all folded over and she can't drink at all! I am always undoing the lid to release the suction. We have another Nuby cup that has the same problem. You can fix the problem by opening up the valve a little with a sharp knife or blade, but then it leaks more. My daughter's favorite use of her sippy cup is painting with water on the bedsheets using her sippy cup. Much to our dismay! We've tried two Nuby cups and won't ever buy NUBY again. What a mess! Better luck to pay a few dollars extra for a cup that works!	
- 1	I bought this gate to use at my mom's house for my 14-month old daughter. It was simple to assemble, but completely insecure when installed. I installed it according to the directions, tightening the pieces that suspend it against the wall until they were tight. The gate wouldn't open. I unscrewed them until the gate would just open. Unfortunately, when it was just loose enough to open the gate, I could easily pull the gate off the wall. If you are buying this gate to use as a suspension only gate, buy something else! The product information says it can be used as a suspension or a screw-mounted gate; this is definitely not the case. The gate is also really flimsy feeling. I'm now willing to pay more for a higher quality gate.	
1. 	I bought this for our 6 yr. old when she was an infant and loved it and repurchased now for our 6 mo. old. This was one of our favorites and had to make sure my 6 mo. old had the same toy. So glad they still make the toy, and it's exactly the same, well built and very entertaining for her. It's a toy I used for motivating both my kids to start crawling.	
- 1	Seems to be good quality, but wouldn't stick to our wood dining table - I tried wetting the suction and still no luck. It's been sitting in a drawer since we got it.	
- 1	My baby never liked this teether.  Maybe it was because he never used a pacifier, but he never liked putting this in his mouth, which was too bad because he started teething early and I thought this would be helpful.  Maybe it would work better for babies who use pacifiers, but he just never seemed to understand how to use it.	
1. 	Great for inexperienced mothers, lets you have both hands to bathe your baby. Babies get really slippery when wet ( and soaped). I found the insert to be really helpful.	
- 1	I bought this bag from Buy Buy Baby. While I loved the look of it, it had several issues. First was the size- when filled with all my things (I have two baby boys) it was SO big and heavy. The bag itself is heavy even before anything is in it, so it really was a lot to lug around. But I was hoping for a more stylish bag, so I stuck it out a few more days. It didn't have may pockets and there are no pockets on the outside, something which I quickly realized was also very inconvenient. And when I hung it on my stroller, there was no way that the stroller straps (or even the bag straps) were going to hold out very long lugging all my stuff. I could see the strain on the straps immediately- the stitching was showing. After 4 days, I decided it wasn't going to work despite how much I loved the look of it. I went back to my trusted Skip Hop Versa which is the best diaper bag in my opinion. This bag just is not worth the money and is not convenient for a bag load of stuff for multiple babies.	
- 1	Because the stink is inside of the bag, and these go in the pail but outside of the bag, they really don't help with the smells that arise when changing out the liner. They're also very very small.	
- 1	Too small for the car seat and I have a jj cole car seat it wasn't what I was expecting I thought the front would open up easily but it's not like that the material was cheaply made it ripped at the seams	
1. 	THEY ARE I WAS I SPECTED, GOOD QUALITY, GOOD PRESENTATION, PERFEECT PRICE, GOOD FOR CHILD AND GOOD FOR BABIES FROM 9 MONTHS	
- 1	My nipples are difficult to be latched for my baby.  And I feel very pain when I feed her everytime.  I really hope this one can solve my problem but it disappoint me.  It is hard to stick tightly on the breast, when my baby latched rubber nipples, it will become warped up on both sides, then it sticked on my baby's cheeks, it's so funny.  The other important thing is it smells not good after I sterilize it even thought the ads said it odorless. I only  tried once and will  not use it again.	
1. 	Great toddler booster seat.  It works its easy to clean off. It sticks good enough to even our cloth based chairs.We use it at home for our 3yr old now. She likes it better then a high chair.Better then the lock on table thing we bought before also.	
- 1	I was excited to receive this mobile.  My ds wouldn't sleep in his crib, and after reading the reviews I thought- this is it, lull him to sleep with this entrancing mobile.  I took it out of the package and quickly ran upstairs to attach it to the crib.  Unfortunately, it only fits in one direction, and because our crib is curvy and thick- and wasn't going to work.  But, I was desperate- &#34;this was it&#34; I needed my ds to sleep!  So... we crafted up a stand with 4x4's and up went the mobile (slightly tacky but for a good cause).  At first ds didn't care for it, the light was too bright for nigh time.  However, I worked it into the routine before bed.  Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.  Until the next night, yup- frozen again.  I guess the leaves are just to heavy to play peek-a-boo every night.  I purchased this mobile when my son was 3 months, he was 6 months when the mobile started freezing on us.	
1. 	I think they work great to mask some of the smell of the nasty diapers.  My husband doesn't like the scent... but he never likes any scents. Fits well in our Safety First simple diaper pail.	
1. 	Happy to have found this changing pad!  Holds up much better than other pads I've seen on the market.  Definitely better quality and price than the one I saw at Pottery Barn Kids.  It doesnt look & feel cheap.  The 4 side walls and safety strap definitely are pluses.	
1. 	I like many things about this high chair/booster seat. This is very easy to clean which is one of the biggest advantages. It is a very inexpensive and functional seat which takes up little space. Also it adjusts in many ways which accommodates a growing baby. Very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	It's really comfortable for that extra support during pregnancy. Some people use regular pillow also but I think this particular shape makes it real comfi for a good night sleep. Price is good too.	
1. 	good thing i only bought one package because one pack had enough to cover all the outlets in my house.	
- 1	We had the Citi Mini jogger single stroller for my son, so when we had our daughter close in age and needed a double stroller we looked into upgrading with the same brand.  Unfortunately due to price, we decided to go with with the Baby Trend Sit & Stand since it fit our infant carseat and was 1/2 the price of the other stroller we wanted.  Big mistake - we should have just spent the money and got a decent stroller - the Sit & Stand is hard to maneuvre and is like driving a bus.  It also doesn't fold very compact, so even fitting it in the back of our SUV was tight.  Now we're having a 3rd baby and will be getting rid of this Baby Trend stroller to buy a quality jogger.	
1. 	great for establising a bedtime routine and really peaceful/fun to look at	
1. 	This is the third Cloud night light I purchased for a gift; the other two were for my grandchildren.  The lights are so soft and soothing no matter which color you choose red, blue or green.  It shines stars all over the room (ceiling & walls) depending here you put the  stuffed animal (we usually place it on the floor).  Wish I had this when my children were babies as it's really neat!  Made well and the batteries are securely placed where the children will not access them.HIGHLY recommend this for your children, grandchildren or for a gift.  An excellent gift that will be loved for years to come!  Being that this is the third one I bought, it's obvious I like the product, that's why I gave it 5 stars.	
- 1	I was disappointed in this masher and bowl.  The masher is plastic - don't expect to mash anything with skin (beans) or meats either.  It works fine for bananas, avocado, etc., but I'd rather just use a fork and my own bowl (that has a lid - this one doesn't).  The holes in the masher are very small and far apart, so the food just gets kind of pushed around rather than broken up.  It would be much more useful if it was metal.The non-slip bottom on the bowl is nice, but the side grip is small and further impedes your ability to really mash things up.  The design is cute too.  Overall, though, it just didn't work for me.	
1. 	i was not fully awake (caring for a newborn and all) when i ordered these and thought i was ordering extra breast cushions for my pump (which would be nice) so clearly i did not read carefully and was surprised by what i got. However, i am thrilled because i also was looking for something like this (a different name was recommended) and these work great. when i pump or nurse i leak on the other side. When nursing i would soak myself and my daughter and pumping was not much better, at least my little girl wouldn't be soaked. :-) using these i typically catch an ounce in them which is worth so much to me. my daughter doesn't seem to notice that she isn't getting soaked, she didn't seem to care before but i sure did.i'm so happy with them that i came back to order an extra set for my emergency pump kit for the car.i do enjoy saying its my best accidental purchase so far :-)-Traci (using shared hubbys account)	
1. 	The Frog Pod is a great solution to the number of bath toys that seem to live in the tub. The scoop makes picking up and rinsing the toys a breeze and the frog has a shelf that can hold shampoo and bubble bath. Our son loves to play with the scoop during his bath and enjoys putting all his toys away at the end. It's only been hung for a few days, but we haven't had any issues with the adhesive not sticking (we have a seamless vinyl surround in the tub, no tiles).	
1. 	For the first few days of my son's birth, we had the wide-neck Avent bottles which leaked, the nipples gave him suction blisters on the lips, he needed extensive burping and he would find it difficult to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in those bottle.  Dr Brown's bottles solved all these issues.I have six bottles and it takes me less than 20 minutes to wash them by hand.  It takes some getting used to washing the small parts, but it's worth the extra effort.  The small brush which comes with the starter kit is essential to clean the small parts.  A regular bottle brush is fine for the bottles themselves.  Save yourself the money and go straight for the 8oz bottles.  The starter kit comes with Level-1 nipples.  You will likely need to graduate your baby to Level-2 niplles at 3-months of age and Level-3 nipples at 6-months of age.  Y-cut nipples are also available for thicker liquids (cereal mixed in milk).If you leave expressed breast-milk in these bottles in the refigerator, the fat tends to stick to the vent (just as a FYI).  Use the travel-discs when transporting milk and there will be no leaks.  My baby hardly needs burping with these bottles, they are that great (he doesn't have reflux by the way).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of.I highly recommend these bottles. I've suggested these bottles to two of my friends whose babies have refulx and they have seen an improvement.  Try some other websites, which have better prices and offer the 9-pack variety.  If you're paying shipping, might as well get some extra small brushes, you'll need them.  One lasts for about 6-8 weeks.	
1. 	This is a very comfortable sleep aid, especially for the third trimester. The fact that you can use it in several positions, including for sitting up in bed is the best.The only negative issue is the cover, which is very cheap. I recommend buying a replacement cover.	
1. 	We love this bedding for our son's room. The colors are wonderful and its just the right mixture of colors to make it cozy for a baby yet not too over the top for a boy.	
1. 	works great. it isn't too heavy, it folds up small enough to fit into diaper bag. would recommend to friends	
1. 	We received this as a gift when our baby was only three months old, and she was too little for it at the time, so we placed it in storage.  However, now that she is old enough (and big enough) this is just the best toy, ever!  She spins around in the seat and plays with all the items, and they keep her busy for a long time!  She loves smacking the Big Tent, which plays all kind of tunes, and she chews on all the soft chewy toys now that she is teething.The one thing that REALLY bothers me about this toy, though, is that it is MADE IN CHINA. I am *SICK SICK SICK* to death of everything being MADE IN CHINA these days.  I would not have bought this item PERSONALLY because it IS made in China, but as a gift, it's ok.  I thoroughly washed everything down, and so far, I have not seen any product recalls on this, but it is a concern.This is supposed to be a bouncer, but I don't see much bounce to it.  What it does, and does well, is give a baby an opportunity to practice sitting down, getting up, sitting down, and turning around and around.  Come to think of it, that is actually a GOOD THING.  Babies need to exert themselves to challenge their development.  The baby creates her OWN bounce!  My baby loves this toy, and I'm glad we have it, I just wish it were MADE IN AMERICA.One note:  The battery is NOT replaceable in the Big Tent. Once it's done, it's done. Fortunately, for now, mine is still playing, but that is one negative that I see.  Also, even though this toy is supposed to be a spacesaver (it's foldable) - it's a hassle and too time-consuming to quickly fold up.  I just keep moving it to the corner of the room when it's not needed. When the exer-saucer is folded up, it doesn't really save that much space anyway.	
1. 	I was looking for a bouncing ball that's a little bigger than this one for my 1 year old daughter, but this one caught my attention. I had not noticed the size in the description but after reading the reviews, realized that it was much smaller than what I was looking for. I loved the idea of the little head popping in and out with gravity so I got it for her. It is small but I don't think it's too small. It fits perfectly in a little one's hand who just learned to walk. My daughter loves to walk around holding it in her hand. She's only had it for a week (early Christmas present) and it's one of her favorite toys. She's fascinated with the little heads and just loves to hold it. It's very well made, cute and unique. I highly recommend it!	
1. 	This bouncer is wonderful, my daughter loves to stare at the starfish and bubbles.  The colors are vivid and the setting that turns the water bubbles and starfish on by movement is great for saving battery life especially during naps.  The vibration is another good thing, I never knew babies liked anything that vibrates but she loves it	
1. 	My boyfriend saw it for the first time and said it was a bib for mentally challenged babies.  I said you watch and see.  Now 15 months later it is the bib we cannot live without.  It works perfectly and my daughter can't tear it off like all her other bibs.  It catches everything from baby food to rice and beans to soup and cereal.  It is the ideal bib and I even travel with it.  I love this bib.	
1. 	I ((like many of the reviewers)) have twins, and finding something that I could use after infant baths, so I could bathe them at the same time was challenging!I was searching for regular bath rings ((that just sit on the tub floor)) but found these instead and am VERY pleased! My boys will be 8 months old shortly, and we started using these about 2 weeks ago. They are a bit big and abnoxious to store, and at first we stored them in the bathtub, but quickly realized that a damnp enviornment is NOT a good place to store wet things if you would like to keep them clean! Now we store them in the boys bedroom, and I think that will keep them from growing mold or mildew ((I do wash them off after each bath with the shower head, and then place them on a towel on the floor of the nursery to dry)). The seats swivel, and this is VERY neat, so I dont have to try and reach around the tub like a maniac to clean them. My husband was a bit worried at first, but is surprisingly impressed with the sturdy design, and also was happy to see that there were no sharp edges that could hurt the boys. The seats are big enough that its easy to get a dry baby INSIDE, and easy to pull and wet baby OUT of them ((just, I NEVER lift two babies out of them at the same time, and NEVER leave them unattended!)) The arm rests are a bit cruddy, but I place small towels over them, and don't have a problem.The only two things I dislike about these seats are the fact that they require a LOT of water in the tub to use, and running a bath cann take a few minutes. I also have trouble cleaning the boys bottoms, and wind up actually lifting them out of the seats at the end of the bath ((individually)) and support them standing to clean them, I must say that is the hardest part of bath time!All in all a good product, a bit bulky, but we'd be lost without them!	
- 1	I originally gave a 4 star to this baby food maker but after using it for a couple months everything broke, first the plastic locking piece to chop the food and then a few weeks later, it wouldn't steam anymore. I have to say I used this baby food maker every day or every two day but I was really hoping it would last much longer. It worked perfectly fine in the beginning but I ended up buying a less expensive one and it does the job so my advice is don't waste your money, you're better off steaming your baby's food in an old fashion pan and buy a baby blender.	
1. 	My 22 month old can open doors but still can't open this gate!  Gives great piece of mind.  I love that you don't need to use your hands to open and close it.  Installed without any problems, adjusts to fit any door way in our house (old house, nothing is even...).  Grandparents love it too, ended up buying them one as well.	
1. 	This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)	
- 1	I registered for this swing for my son as it was one of the few non-feminine swings I could find.  I thought it was very cute & gender neutral.  I have been extremely disappointed.  The motor on it is a joke and what's worse, we exchanged it & had the same problems so I know it isn't just one bad swing.  The motor is loud enough that we thought it was broken when we first tried it out, but what's worse is it barely has the power to swing my 12 pound son.  Literally, if I leave it to swing on its own, it swings ONE INCH either way with my son in it & he is only half the recommended weight capacity.  Even when he was newly born (8 lb's), it barely swung him.  So I sit by the swing & push it manually.  Also, the recline is not flat enough for a newborn because my son's head rolls forward & he slumps in the chair no matter what I do.  Not only would I not buy this swing again, but after all the product recalls I've seen in the news, I'd be reluctant to purchase anything Fisher-Price in the future.	
- 1	My baby is due in five months.  But I am on a roll getting all the things ready for the nursery. Wanted to have extra time to select the most efficient, quality and reasonably-priced things. So, I did a bit of digging (I am a public interest lawyer, so digging is second nature to me) and discovered that about 85% of all baby and children's stuff is treated with carcinogenic and neuro-toxic chemicals, flame retardants PBDE and Chlorinated Tris to name just a few of the poisons they put into our baby stuff.  This Rock n Play is treated with flame retardants.  So, this thing would be perfect for someone who chain-smokes as they rock their baby to sleep.  I am not planning on bringing poison into my home and keeping my baby on it.  Pretty upsetting if you think about what they are doing to the people: poisoning us right in the crib... literally! The least I would expect the retailers to do is to put a warning label up front on all products treated with this stuff apprising the public of the carcinogenic, neuro-toxic and endocrine disruptive properties of what they sell. The information about the flame-retarding treatment is only found on the label of this Rock n Play.	
- 1	Have an older bathroom with tile. Hoped it would stick, but after several attempts (And reading the instructions a few times) it didn't hold its own weight let alone the weight of the frog.	
1. 	I use this for quick trips with my infant. If I were to be carrying my baby for a long period of time, I might use a different carrier that's supported by both shoulders, but they take forever to get done up. This one just slips over your head and baby fits in easily. I use it to go outside with her and I even walked around the farmers market the other day quite comfortably. I still keep at least one hand on baby for stability. If you're going to be taking your baby in and out of the carrier, ie when visiting friends or a restaurant, this carrier is great. And...the price was reasonable. I'm glad I got one and recommend it to others.	
1. 	I am renting a Medela Symphony, and I also have the Freestyle. I love the latter because it's a closed system, so milk doesn't get in the tubes. My one gripe with the Symphony (before purchasing these) was that I had to constantly clean and dry the tubing because milk seemed to back up into the tubes nearly every time. I have two close friends who use the Pump In Style Advanced, and they had the same complaint. No more!The design of the one-piece breastshields is slightly different from the two-piece solution. The tubing connects higher up and behind a ridge of plastic, so the air still gets through, but the milk flows straight down, and well below the connector. The result is that, while I still get a bit of condensation, I do not get milk backing up into the tubing like it did with the two-piece kit. I'm so pleased! They do take slightly more effort to clean than the two-piece kit, but that is made up for in SPADES by not having to clean the tubing. I can just run the pump for a few minutes to dry out the tubing between pumping sessions and clean it less often. Definitely worth the trade! It's a shame they don't come in more sizes (yet).I am using the Simple Wishes hands-free bra, and it works fine with these. I know some models have small openings meant for the two-piece kits, but the Simple Wishes bra has one panel with a horizontal slit and another with a vertical slit, so you can get pretty much any size breastshield through it with a bit of effort, and it still holds really well once it's on. Do check your local BRU before purchasing these online, as they had a better price at the time of this review.	
1. 	This is a great toothbrush for babies, however my baby uses it as a teether, which is fine.....is it a must? Not for me but its nice to have.	
- 1	I tried it twice be gave up. I have sensitive skin and get rashes easily from plastic. End up getting the Lansinoh ultra soft pads.	
1. 	My 8 month old is a messy eater!  He loves feeding himself mashed up bananas, so you can imagine!  This bib saves me from changing his whole outfit everytime he needs to eat.  And it's big enough, it should fit him for quite awhile.  Waiting for another color to go on sale so I can buy him a second one!	
1. 	Exactly as advertised, the Medela PersonalFit Small 21 mm Breastshields were a much better fit for me than what came with the breast pump. I was able to get a better fit and therefore able to pump more milk.	
1. 	We have really enjoyed having this since my son was born.  We do not use the heartbeat or music setting, but he seems to like the other two settings which are more 'nature oriented.'  I love the automatic shut-off and the voice-activated modes.We have gone through one set of batteries already, but it took seven weeks to do so.  (That includes a few nights/naps that I forgot to press the automatic shut-off)  Overall this is a great product and very useful.	
1. 	I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy.  This makes my snap n go indispensable.  It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light.  One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller.  If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat.  I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint.  It handles pretty well.  It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated.	
- 1	These work for storing milk in the fridge and as a travel case for formula powder but do not work well for freezing breast milk.  The base of the container cracked and broke each time we took it out of freezer to defrost.  They say that it can be frozen but didnt work for us.  Search for &#34;snappies&#34; these are awesome containers!	
- 1	I bought this bag after our last cooler was outgrown by our baby. I searched for a cooler that was sturdy and had enough space for at least two bottles and food jars. The only reason I am not giving it 1 star was because I was able to pack the above and then store the spoons in the front zippered pocket. After  a month and half of use the inside stitching came apart and the foam underneath became visible. Very poorly constructed. I have to say that my final decision fir purchase of this product was based on brand as Dr. Brown is known for quality products. I was very disappointed.As a side note, I did not buy this product through Amazon but through a large baby retail store.	
1. 	I have to admit that when I turn on the star, my baby smiles and coos at it, but other than that, it's nothing special.  i was a little disappointed that only one of the hanging toys is a rattle... the other two are squeakers (it's not easy to make something spueak when the baby is just batting at it).  It was a gift... otherwise I would never have bought it.  I think you can probably find something just as nice for cheaper.	
- 1	I'm really sad because I normally LOVE Sassy products but this one is not the high quality that I have come to expect from the brand.  The ring shapes are cute, but the plastic is really lightweight, which means it's difficult for a younger child to hold the pieces and get them on the ring because everything is always falling over with just the slightest touch.  At the very least, the bottom should  be weighted so it doesn't get knocked over so easily.  The other really annoying thing is that the middle bar is not tall enough.  It is not even tall enough for the rings to fit - it falls inside the top ring, whereas it should be slightly taller because this makes it really hard to get the top ring on. Remember, we're talking about babies and toddlers - they don't have the greatest dexterity in the world, so this makes it really difficult to play with the toy.  Overall, I regret buying this toy and would not recommend it.  I am now going to have to get a better and more sturdy ring stacker for my baby.	
- 1	I was quite disappointed. It doesn't teach a baby to hold a smooth ball or to roll a ball. The hard plastic part that goes around the ball to hold the two sides together is really bumpy and thick. It keeps the ball from rolling straight, hard for teaching the baby to roll it back to you. It's more like a rattle that a baby can shake and throw. My 9 month old isn't too interested in it, though. And I was surprised to be able to see little screws on the hard plastic part. It doesn't look safe.	
- 1	This seat has lasted until 7 months, and would go a little longer.  My son is about 20 pounds, but is growing out of the height range.  I have been very happy with this car seat!  The pads wash very well, even after spit-ups and diaper blow-outs.  You would never know to look at the pads.  It clicks into the base easily and is very simple to install. A t the hospital they preferred this one because it lays newborns back a little more.  remember to take the newborn insert out when your child reaches the appropriate size, and adjust the strap heights.  This is VERY easy to do.  This car seat is heavy and I almost never carry him in it.  I don't know how it compares to other seats, but add a 10-20 pound baby and it's too much for me.I hate this stroller and am trying to sell it.  It is too bulky to shop with.  There is no need for it with the infant seat, and I want a better stroller now that he's out of the infant seat, so it was never useful.  I used a Maclaren Easy Traveller (much recommended over the coordinating Chicco travel system strollers) to get him everywhere.  I wanted the Cortina so that I could lay him flat and not have him trapped in the car seat all the time.  Even for an obsessive mom like me, it just wasn't worth it.  The storage is minimal and impossible to get to if the seat is down, it turns poorly, it is wide, and it takes up my whole trunk!I would buy this seat again, but would leave out the Cortina stroller.	
1. 	This is a sturdy gate which does not damage the walls. It can be moved to another location if desired. A great purchase and can withstand being manhandled by a toddler, yet can only be opened by an adult.	
1. 	This bag is great!  I can carry it out in public and no one gives me that EEEEWWW - a parent! look.  Also, the changing mat is perfect (now that baby is bigger only her diaper fits on it, but also not too big to carry in bag).  It also has plenty of pockets for me to carry my stuff in it without a purse. Although the cell phone holder is way too big for my phone, I do use it to carry other items (formula packets, diaper ointment, favorite baby toys).  I love that there is a pocket built in for those clothes you had to change baby out of while out, and the interior mesh pockets are the perfect size for a small box of wipes and about 7 diapers.This is the best diaper bag!  The only thing it lacks to make it absolutely perfect is a smaller bag that is easily removable to carry when you pop in somewhere for a minute.	
- 1	These spoons suck. The cheap walmart spoons are even better..food doesn't stay on the spoon. They aren't soft like I thought..hate them.	
- 1	We have not been able to use this. it is imposible to drink from it. What a waste of money...	
- 1	My son hated this cup from the word go!  He has never drunk from it.  Screams when he sees it.  And if I try to force it in his mouth, he will spit it out and turn his head.  He is 22 months and prefers the old fashioned hard plastic cups.	
- 1	There is technically nothing terrible about this product but it sticks as poorly as any other product.  Get a regular $2 bowl at target and call it a day	
1. 	I love the idea of these. And I have used them successfully. But, I've gotten pretty tired of washing all my pump parts by hand nightly, that these have just added a bit more work to the nightly washing routine. Also, I end up pumping more than the 5 ounces that my Avent bottles hold, so I end up having to transfer the milk and pouring into another container anyway, so it kind of defeated the purpose for me. I'd rather just pump into my medela collection bottles and pour the correct amount into my Avent bottles. But they are handy to have and I'm sure I'll use them again. I give five stars because they could save other people a lot of time and washing - just not me.	
- 1	Although the monitor  is a bit bulky (if you have plans of clipping it to your clothes where you are out and about in your own house), it worked well the first six months. Then, all of a sudden, no more picture, just static. I have never been able to figure out what the heck happened and why. I certainly would not purchase any of their electonic products again.	
- 1	I bought these because of the price, but it doesnt worth it, the product dont stick to the corner of the desk very well, keeps falling apart, and my baby is only 10 months old but strong enough to pull it down, I had to tape it to the desk and doesnt look neat.	
- 1	These pads are too small and too thick. They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. They also look very unflattering under clothing. I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. Don't waste your money on Avent pads!	
- 1	Buying this item was a bad idea as was buying the bottles. Bottles aside; to have a brush that is only good for one type of bottle is stupid in my opinion because you'll need various brushes then and that results in having a counter full of extra brushes.To buy any one baby product that is only functional within the same brand is foolish in my opinion.The Lansinoh bottles require this brush and this brush is no good for other bottles&#8230;. enough said?	
1. 	I bought another tub initially - a friend told me about this one.  I will stick with this until my daughter outgrows it.  A must have.	
1. 	This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!	
- 1	We loved the idea of this toy but it just kept falling off the wall of the bathroom with a  big bang. Had to send it back.	
1. 	I don't know why but i felt compelled to write another review about these bottles. I cannot say enough... except what are you people complaining about ??? These bottles are not expensive when compared to buying stupid refill liners and trying a bunch of different bottles, and can you really put a price on a happy baby ? They are not hard to clean unless possibly you are letting the used bottles sit around to dry up and get yucky. They do not leak if you use them right and follow the instructions included. I rotate 6 bottles, keeping them washed and filled with formula (in the fridge of course), when baby is hungry i simply take one out and remove all parts and warm it up, which is not hard to do, then replace parts, feed baby, and rinse the  bottle out and fill sink with hot soapy water, drop all parts in.. let soak, then rinse and put to dry on drying rack. What is so hard about that ? (do boil the parts prior to first use and then about every 2 weeks or so) I don't even know where the little brush is that came with my bottles, don't need it. And I have inspected them afterwards, they are clean. and I should say that i usually use the ready to feed formula, I hate having to mix the powder. But the times that I do use the powder i just mix in separate container and pour into the Dr. Brown's.  So what you can't shake the bottle, you can swish it, you really shouldn't shake any bottle anyway, that's where the bubbles come from. I have used these bottles for 4 months, Katie is 4 1/2 mos. old. She had terrible colic for the first 2 weeks of her life, she would scream and ball up in pain from 11 pm to 5 am every nite  until I tried Dr. Browns. (I had used Avent and VentAire first, what junk.. also everyone kept telling me to try Soy or one of those special colic formulas, which are expensive, but I still use Similac Advance b/c the Dr. Browns bottles work) The FIRST day I used Dr. Brown's she slept all nite, I still didn't sleep though but that is just because I stared at her all nite in amazement !  I have NEVER had one of these bottles leak at all. I just don't get what all the complaining is about, I would do whatever it took to make my baby happy. If your baby doesn't have colic or get gas then maybe you don't need these. However, I am such a fan that with my next baby I will use these, I will not wait to see if the baby has colic or not. Another plus is that these bottles are designed to help with ear problems too. I really cannot say enough good about them, i have used both the standard, and the wide-neck, both are great in doing what they are designed to do but i (and baby) prefer the wide neck ones. I suggest skipping the purchase of the 4 oz bottle and go straight to the 8 oz, baby grows out of 4 oz size quickly, you can put 4 oz in an 8 oz bottle but cannot put 8oz in a 4 oz bottle, you know what i mean ?  PLEASE take it from someone who knows.. try these bottles, you won't be sorry.. baby's tummy will thank you.

- 1	We were using Tommy Tippee bottles when my daughter was first born and almost immediately she was throwing up entire bottles. My doctor actually suggested us moving over to the Dr. Brown's bottles and wouldn't ya know it! The throwing up stopped instantly.Washing them are a problem because there are 2 other mechanicals besides the bottles that you have to wash and in order to get them adequately clean, you should really do this by hand. No big deal, but I spend 20 extra minutes a day washing all the components of these bottles by hand (even though they are dish washer safe).Now for the Biggest problem of all with these bottles - they leak and sometimes for no reason at all.  This morning I put the bottle on the nightstand and it was about half full, had not been tipped over and not bothered at all, the next time I picked it up to give it to my 11 month old she got doused with milk. This happens on an almost daily basis and every day it infuriates me and I yell I HATE THESE BOTTLES!!!.I really have tried different bottles with her like Avent to keep the colic and throwing up down, but for some reason these leaky, messy, pain in the ^@(#&)@)# bottles seem to be the only ones that keep her from throwing up. So with that, I am willing to put up with this long enough that her little tummy doesn't hurt and move into sippy cups as soon as she gets the hang of them.I HATE THESE BOTTLES!! ARRRRGGGGGG!	
1. 	I've always loved Bumkins bibs but as my daughter got older, the bibs got smaller and her messes got bigger.  This Bumkins bib saved many clothes from being stained and covered in food.Even my daughter loves this bib.  We hang all our bibs up and she goes straight for this Supersized bib whenever she's hungry and hands it to us to place around her neck.  Even she doesn't like spilling her mess on her shirt and pants.Details:The single food pocket on this bib is slightly larger than theBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-PackThe bottom half is generously wide and can cover a lot and works great in restaurant high chairs.  The only difficulty you might experience is if you're still using a high chair with a snap-on tray.  Since this bib is so large it will make a tight squeeze.  However with a little tug here and a pull there it will still work.This bib has saved me soooo much time cleaning up after soup spills and spaghetti spills.	
1. 	My kids love this little turtle. I love that it does not change color by itself or spin, like others, that was a little dizzying. This one is nice, and the kids like it a lot. They use it as a nightlight and something to look at while falling asleep. Great buy.	
1. 	We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.  The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.  They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.  They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.	
1. 	It works ok but flat bottom would have been better. Angled bottom doesn't work for my kid as my kid's bottom slides out anyway.	
1. 	This is such a nice seat to have when you go out.  It's wonderful for keeping your kiddos from touching or chewing on seats, carts, etc!-  Fully covers / lines the booster seat or grocery cart and the elastic around the edge wraps around the whole seat-  The seat is nicely padded and all they really touch is the fabric-  Has a strap that can be used to attach the floppy seat to the back of a cart or booster seat-  Folds inside itself to make its own carry bag (which has nice handles that could actually be linked onto your diaper bag etc)-  Has pockets for stuff for baby and piping that you can link toys onto so they can't be thrown on the floor-  Cute colors and fabric - I have the red one with animals on the inside printIt is an extra thing to bring and carry around, but it's completely worth it to know that my daughter isn't touching booster chairs and carts that don't get cleaned!!!	
- 1	My son loves his soft taggie blankets and was getting cold at night since he's too young for blankets in the crib.  I was looking for something warm and soft for him to sleep on it.  This is not it.  Feels like cheap cotton, not at all soft and warm like I was expecting.  Doesn't even feel like flannel at all.  I returned and ordered fleece sheets.  Price seemed to good to be true, but reviews were mostly positive so I bought it.  Right back in the box for a refund.	
1. 	I use it's as a room spray for my kids' rooms after cleaning. I use couple sprays per room and the bottle lasts for a long time. It smells very fresh and clean.	
1. 	I really like these mesh feeders.  The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.  The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.  The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.	
- 1	I bought this for my baby daughter's arrival in late 2011.  Less than one year into using this, 2 of the three drawers were broken, dangerous and unusable. Today (April 2013) I took the third and final broken drawer out to the curb.  Unfortunately, I need a changing table for my toddler daughter, so I must have the unsightly drawer less piece of furniture in her adorable nursery - but I have to walk back and forth to the equally crappy accompanying chest of drawers that matches the changing table that I also bought.  At least 3 drawers are still functional on that.  Do not buy either piece of furniture:  they are a rip off.	
- 1	These gates work, but they aren't great.  They are sort of flimsy and I find that the opening is way too small, especially if you are trying to carry something with you.  Installation is straight forward.  The gate comes with two additional pieces depending on how wide your opening is.  The gate is not infinitely adjustable to width.  The gates also come with cups that screw into the wall for added support for tops of stairs.  Although they do the job, I wouldn't recommend them.  I am sure there are better products on the market.	
- 1	I loved these towels when I got them. I bought the bear and the cat. There are fuzzies everywhere!  I really do not think that these towels are worth the price.  They are really cute though.	
1. 	I love that this is a simple visual mobile, no noise, no nothing. I hung it using an eye hook in the ceiling above the crib - had to add a chain to make it hang low enough.	
- 1	This booster chair never made its way out of the box.  Its chemical smell was too noxious to warrant even a peekaboo.  Even the best designed chair fails miserably when you can't stand to get near it for the fumes.  My search continues....	
- 1	lets see, it takes way too long to put on, it takes way too long to put baby in and my baby hates it and when she is finally inside it she wiggles and hates it even more and it is way too bulky for me to feel like i can get anything done. dunno what the hype about this product is, it is pretty bad.	
1. 	I nurse my baby exclusively and am a stay at home mom, but this is really handy for when we go out and can't schedule around his feeding times. I didn't have any problems with let down. It does make noise, but it's not noisy. I only pump at home so it doesn't bother me. I only used this after my baby was 6 weeks and had no problems whatsoever.	
1. 	People told us that this was a heavy car seat.. in truth.. they all are around the same weight --- it is the child who gets heavier... This has been a great item... Would use it again.	
- 1	I have been cloth diapering my son for three months now. I bought these cloth diapers to add to my stash and I thought that they were the same prefolds I already had. They are not. I boiled them for 30 minutes, washed them with a cloth diaper safe laundry soap, did not use fabric softener and then dried them. After all of this I could still see through them and after my son was only in one for an hour the whole thing was soaked and his diaper cover was wet and so were his clothes! I sent them back to amazon today for a refund. These would work just fine as burp clothes or for cleanups around the house.	
1. 	Great Product!!!!We ordered two 2 bar extensions and one autoclose gate.We love it! We have a 48-inch hallway and it fits perfectly.	
1. 	This is better now that my daughter is a little taller. She is not quite ready for using this by herself, but we have higher toilets so this helps.  I wish it were a little bit more stable but for the price, a good product.	
1. 	My baby loved a tight swaddle - something I could never do with a blanket.  This made it so easy, especially after middle of the night diaper changes.  It's very soft and easy to wash.  Makes so much sense!	
1. 	Easy solution to cracking... Don't wash the bristles!! If you really think about it, do you wash the bristles of the plastic comb and brush set that comes in your babies med kit??  Sugarbooger really needs to take that out of the direction label.	
- 1	This bag requires me to dig. Dig Dig Dig to find the stuff I'm looking for.It's perhaps too deep.I'm on the hunt for a better bag...	
- 1	Using any cellphone with 15 feet of either the monitor or the receiver creates a horrible interference noise.  So if you ever plan on using your cellphone while your baby is sleeping, this isn't the monitor for you.	
1. 	I got this sterilizer after the birth of my daughter and trying to wash all my avent bottles and nipples.  I don't know about everyone else, but I only run my dishwasher at most every other day, and I didn't have enough bottles to last that long when she was eating every couple of hours.  Plus, I find that in the dishwasher little bits of food and guck get stuck in them, especially the nipples.  The sterilizer works great, simply, and fast! You, obviously need to at least rinse the bottles and nipples before putting them in.  I washed all my bottles with soap before putting them in the sterilizer just in case.Also, now that my daughter has moved on to sippy cups, I use the sterilizer to clean those annoying spill proof valves that are impossible to get clean and aren't supposed to go in the dishwasher.I did use it occaisionally for my breast pump parts as well and it worked great for them, I just didn't get to breast feed for very long :(It saves time, energy and water! A great product!!	
- 1	Love the cute designs on these washcloths and they are the perfect size but the quality is poor. The stitching on the edges began unraveling after only one or two uses and I am now always dealing with dangling strings or frayed edges. I have never purchased any other washcloths that fell apart so quickly.	
1. 	This tub has been so practical. Yes, I leave it in the tub when NOT in use, I wash it before and after, the mesh for newborns are EASY to clean, dry and it has been such a useful tub.. I am glad that I had this apart of my baby shower registry.. Very good for babies, Mommy!	
1. 	But of course, there will come a time when you spot your baby open the lid and spill the contents all over the floor.  :)	
- 1	I have this monitor and it has really bad interference. It makes loud popping/cracking static noises at night that would take me up for nothing. I even hear some strange man talking for 5 seconds once.Tried several channels, simply can not find a channel that is interference free. This product will go back to SONY tomorrow. I totally would not recommend this.	
- 1	This potty is so cute my son just feels like playing with it, it has too many parts, and the deflector is not good at all everytime he seats on it gets off or get nocked down hurting him, he just use it now as step stool, gave two stars cause of that and the cuteness factor, otherwise no so good. I just got a toilet seat reducer and a great step stool that surrounds his toilet so he es learning to go straigh to the toilet wich is WAY more hygenic!	
1. 	I use these with my cloth diapers in a wipes warmer. They're a good size, though a little on the thin side. I agree with the other reviewers that they can stick together in the warmer making them difficult to remove but I found a solution for that: fold them alternating (like a Kleenex, so they pull the next one up as you remove one) but only overlap them by an inch, instead of a full half.If they were just a little thicker I'd give them 5 stars.	
- 1	this product SUCKS! sound barely you can hear it. I wish i can return in . I regret that i didnt read the reviews! just dont buy it. my baby doesnt even attracted to this at all	
1. 	Our son is 9 months and has grown out of using a mobile now, but for the period from about three to six months he loved lying and staring up at it.  We'd change one of the disks every few days to keep him interested, and he clearly noticed the change.We can't give it five stars for the following reasons:1) the mounting mechanism is bulky and awkward.  It fit on our cosleeper but will not fit on our crib.2) The back of the mounting mechanism is an exposed plastic screw which rubbed a hole in our wall's plaster (the cosleeper and therefore the mobile were against the wall) and we didn't realize this till we took it down.3) The disks are extremely hard to change around without breaking them.  I ended up clipping a small amount of plastic off of each end of the connecting &#34;T&#34;s with a nail clipper.  It didn't affect their stability and made it MUCH easier to change them around.Our son still enjoys the disks sometimes.  We've put the mobile part away but left the disks out as toys, and he likes to chew on them.  The plastic is think and sturdy enough that they are not taking any damage from the attention.	
1. 	Works great with my Maclaren stroller, brown color matches nicely, and it is a nice size, so it keeps sun out and baby happy, easy to put on, but i do have to take it off to take baby out or fold the stroller. Overall amazing product with great function, glad I bough full size, it covers my baby completely as of right now	
1. 	I like this travel holder of utensils for my little one. Since your not able to choose colors, I was hoping for green and blue and I received just that. I like that it came with the variety of forks and spoons (green). The cover easily snaps it close (no fuss),washable, BPA-free, slim and portable. What more can I want from this product? Nuby makes great products so I would buy this item again with my next baby!	
1. 	My son is 3 months old and from birth has been extremely gassy. He also has reflux so we are constantly dealing with spitting up, burping issues, and excess gas. I originally used the Dr. Browns bottles because I had heard SO many good things about them. Well, Dr. Brown's bottles did not work for us. I recently decided to try the VentAire bottle, based on a friend who was happy with them. As soon as I switched I noticed a major reduction in my sons gas. I also immediately noticed that he was burping better, both during and after a feeding. I highly recommend these bottles, especially if you are dealing with spitting up and gas issues. Putting the bottles together is an extra step, but a lot less time consuming than putting together the Dr. Browns bottles, and it's well worth the effort.	
- 1	This &#34;100% leak free&#34; cup leaks all over the place. Whether you close it or not. The picture of Dora is cute, I gave it a star for that. Other than that, it is completely useless, especially if your toddler likes to shake his cups or throw them around. But even just lying in the stroller this cup lost half of the milk in it. It does not even keep the milk especially cold. We are not using it and will probably simply throw it away.	
1. 	We use these for wrapping up blowout diapers at this point - our baby is still in the 'not bad poo smell' phase. Much prefer using these to individually wrap offending diapers than a whole diaper genie system (though we do have an Ubbi). Keep a stash in the diaper bag and you are covered. At first the smell of these bags bothered me (too close to baby powder smell) but now I'm accustomed to them.	
- 1	I guess I didn't check into these carefully enough. They are not liners but extra liners for Kushies AIO.	
1. 	Great seat cover for when you have multiple seats or people in the back seat. It doesn't cover more of the seat than necessary.  It fits perfectly under the Diono seats without sticking out much at all. Durable and looks nice.  The little pockets in the front don't really get used but when my sons is a bit older and can sit forward and reach them, we may utilize them more. For now it serves the purpose of keeping my sons dirty shoes from touching the seat.	
- 1	I bought this to go with the set of Dr Brown's Bottle set I bought my daughter for her baby shower. She didn't like how complicated the system was to clean the bottles and ended up using another brand of bottles.	
- 1	My child is 2 years old and the pillow is too small. It fits her head but there's no room. When she tries to turn, her head goes off the pillow. In retrospect, I should have bought a hypoallergenic adult size pillow. I don't see any difference between this pillow and a high-quality adult size pillow, other than the size obviously.	
- 1	...I expected far better.  This is a great space-saving, travel pack n play, but all that these 'sheets' are is an EXTREMELY thin pillowcase with the back ripped off.  No, I'm not kidding... I opened the package and stared in disbelief.  Honestly, after doing more research, it's better to just use a standard/queen sized pillowcase and tuck the ends under.  Oh and don't even remotely expect these 'sheets' to contain a blowout or pee... it goes right through to the pad.	
- 1	Apparently my LO is very picky with her binkys.... She would only take the NUKs, and I've tried every brand under the sun..  I thought these were a great choice because the were attached to the wubbanub and the hospital issued them... So I bought these too...My LO didn't like the green ones, and didn't like these!My niece on the other hand, absolutely love her green soothers...Now at 10 months, you would have thought she graduated, to at least these...so since my LO didn't want em, I gave em to her...Nope... Still loves the green ones, but for some reason, refuses these!	
1. 	Debated purchasing these based on some of the reviews, so just to clarify some of the negative comments -1.  Yes, it's a piece of terry cloth.  If you can design it yourself you should, otherwise it fits perfect and does exactly what is needed2.  It has slots on each side, so it goes in between the clips when you put the bjorn on.  Obviously, when you unlatch it, it might fall off, but the point is that it's removable and easy to just put on, so this is not that big of an inconvenience.3.  Easy to wash and baby still likes to suck on this part of the bjorn.  Bibs did not work, as it didn't settle at the same height and she didn't like the fabric as much.Highly recommend, wish I would have purchased sooner to prevent the initial damage to the carrier.	
- 1	These are way too expensive and difficult to use if you want to use them for cloth diapering with covers!!  My much easier solution for the cloth diaper covers (have mostly pockets) is to use the extra pocket inserts that I have.  You can purchase inserts separate from pocket diapers, and they're much cheapers than prefolds.  You don't have to deal with folding a prefold and maneuvering it to get the diaper cover on!  The prefolds are super bulky when folded for diapering.These were pretty useless as burp rags too, because we ended up using blankets for more coverage.  My hubby and I are both more comfortable holding baby on our chest instead of shoulder, so we needed move coverage for baby moving around!We ended up using these on our changing table.  It seemed every time I would bother to put an elastic cover on the changing pad, he would soil it!  Then how do you get the cover off with baby still naked on the table!  These prefolds are easy to keep under baby butts and then pull out if they get soiled.  It's easy to slip another one under (or not) so baby's not touching a cold, rough changing pad and so that you can finish diapering!	
- 1	Depending on accurate info online in my quest for the perfect lightweight stroller for Disneyworld - in the product info it lists 30 pounds as the maximum weight yet the manufacturers product description claims it can hold up to 40.  If big details like this are contradictory how can I rely on this product?	
1. 	Easy to install and holds it's position on the head rest alright. Needs to be adjusted about once a week or the weight of it will keep moving the mirror down.	
1. 	This is cute.  The foot stamp is difficult to use but at least the baby stays clean.  Overall nice amount of pages.	
1. 	No surprises here. They are screw rings. They screw, they work, I just needed more to go with my bottle system.	
1. 	Here is my comparison of the Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Cover to Safety 1st Swivel Outlet Cover.  We have two of each and all have been installed for between 2 weeks and 2 months.For Mommys Helper Safe Plate:Pros:Doesn't feel flimsyEasy to plug in/ unplug itemsEasy to installLooks niceIncluded screws fit and match the color of the outlet plateCons:Slightly more expensive than Safety 1st Swivel Outlet coverOnly replaces single screw outlet coversMight be slightly easier for toddlers to figure out than swivel coversI've never heard of Mommys Helper before	
- 1	I registered for and received this bag as a baby shower gift. I get compliments on the appearance of this bag almost every day but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I've used this for six months and within the first month the pockets on the inside loss all their elasticity. And I don't overstuff this thing because I'm an on the go person and don't like to carry a lot of things. All I have in there is the changing pad it came with, the white Huggies travel wipes container, like 5 diapers, a nursing cover, two burp rags and a blanket. Then the stitch that separates the pockets came undone to the halfway point making those pockets useless. Now the straps are showing age with white strands hanging and the loop with the metal ring is starting to peel. Now I'm in the market for a new bag.The only good thing about this bag is the multitude of pockets on the outside, 8. I keep my wallet, phone and all that jazz on the outside so I don't have to dig through the bag for my stuff. If I had paid for it myself I'd be pissed. There are better options out there for the price. It's such a shame because I adore the look of the bag and it passes as my purse easily.	
1. 	We have both this and the ones with the straw for my kid.  She seems to like this more so we keep getting this one.  It does drip a little but doesn't flip you in the eye like the straw ones.  Note that when you put cold fluids in this they will leak out due to expansion of the air as they warm up if your kid isn't using it.  FYI	
1. 	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.	
1. 	I am so happy to have finally received these. I have had such painful problems while pumping and after reading the Medela site and looking at the breast shield diagrams I knew the ones that came with the pump were too big. I am pumping right now and OMG what a difference! I am so happy I could cry...probably due to hormones! No pain!I dreaded pumping due to the pain it caused and the soreness afterwards. Everything feels better and it isn't rubbing or taking too much in. This is the perfect size!I wish Medela gave you options with the breast shields when you buy the pump. I mean for $300 bucks I shouldn't have to pay an additional $15 to get the right size! They should really give options when getting these pumps so you don't have problems with pain and discomfort.	
- 1	I wanted to love these. I wanted my baby to love these. They are lovely to look at, they feel lovely (I love the material they're made of, they feel like extra soft rubber), I love that they're natural.But my son hated them. More than any other pacifier and he really wasn't too picky about pacifiers. They have a tiny little nipple and I guess he just didn't like that. He would suck on them occasionally because he was a pretty easy going baby when it came to pacifiers but once he hit two months old he stopped willingly taking them. He just loved his soothie pacifiers.He currently loves to play with them as a toy. He'll hold them and gnaw on the sides or even the back looped part! He still doesn't like sucking on the nipple part though! haha	
1. 	Hard to not give something that is so specializedCuz this is for a specific product and commercializedThese membranes are easy to loseSo might as well buy a fewThese things are really small and easy to lose so my recommendation is to get the until, stick it in a bowl of water to soak, and then pull out each individual item to clean that way it's harder to lose.  I also dry these on a baby bottle rack thingy that has a horizontal tray grid to dry.  Very helpful.	
- 1	I ordered this, cancelled it before it was shipped but I guess they shipped it anyway :)I didnt like the Duke design in person. The tan cloth was a bit camping material style. The sholder black straps seemed like it would bother lo. Also, all these layers, I didn't know where to put lo. I didn't like it. I am suprized how much everyone likes this one. They must have not tried the GIMINI! GIMINI is by far better. My lo is 8 months old and lasts for 2 hours in it, facing out only. He will only last 15 min facing me. I guess he get's bored facing me. He loves to face out on the gimini.	
1. 	Was going to NYC for a weekend, with two kids and really needed a bunch of toilet toppers for the less than pristine toilets of the city.  These did the job, at at a fairly reasonable price.  They have enough cover, and are waterproof which is a must.	
1. 	I received this for a baby shower and I love it. It works fast so my baby doesn't get upset. I even went back and bought another one to keep in the diaper bag.	
1. 	Our little one loved being swaddled, however outgrew or was able to get his hands out of other blankets. Not this one! After first we thought it was too big, but tucking his arms in and wrapping him up, he loved it. Washes up great and just gets softer. If you are looking for help with getting your baby to sleep, this is worth a try.	
1. 	Add me to the huge list of fans! We bought one about a year ago, wanting to use it for... I don't even remember. But since then, we've used it for naps, for &#34;campouts&#34; in the living room, for time out spots since we have two toddlers and putting both in one room is just.. not wise, and it's been fantastic.It has survived a potty training toddler, two toddlers sleeping on it (not sure how...) and many many spills.It did not, however, survive daddy sitting on it. It got awfully bent. Still usable, but not pretty.I love that it's so lightweight, and easily folds away. It's also easy to put out in the yard and spray down with a hose after a potty training accident.I do not love that it doesn't support more weight, but mostly because I'm jealous.	
1. 	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.	
1. 	This powered formula dispenser is soooo convenient. It is compact and fits perfectly in my diaper bag...I do carry two though because I have 3 month old twins that LOVE to eat!!!! Also, the colors are very cute :) I don't leave home without this product in my diaper bag.	
1. 	I bought this for my toddler after many months of having his clothes come home from daycare all stained.  I know he's a very messy eater and I decided to try a bib with more coverage, so I bought this one.  It's wonderful - full coverage, lightweight and breathable, and easy to clean - no more stained clothes!!!	
1. 	We use this mobile in the car seat and also attach it to the middle of our Tiny Love play gym on occasion (have never used the clip, just the velcro - works great).Baby loves to watch it, keeps him entertained (nice that it has two sides for something different).4 stars because motor is a bit loud, but hardly noticeable with other background noise.	
1. 	A lot of parts to clean each time, but I found that my baby does have less gas after using Dr. Brown's than after using other brands.  One question for the manufacturer--is any woman's nipple shaped like the way manufacturers shape bottle nipples???	
1. 	I bought this for my son when he was learning to sit up. He could sit up for the most part, but would fall forward sometimes...this was the perfect solution. Anyway, after he got to where he didn't need any protection while sitting up I deflated it, shoved it in the closet, and figured i would bring it out for baby number two.Well, one day while my hubby was at work my son was driving me absolutely nuts. He was about 11 months old, not quite walking yet, and was not interested in ANY of the toys he had for some reason. I went upstairs into his closet thinking I may find something newer and novel for him, and I grabbed the playnest. BEST IDEA EVER!!! He LOVES this thing and is 11 months old- he loves diving in and out of it, pushing up on it, throwing things into it, reading in it, watching tv in it...he just loves it. I cant say that enough!I also babysit my friend's daughter three days a week. She is two months older than him and walking. She loves it too, and she is 13 months old. I really can not say enough good things about this product.We have had it out for about three weeks now and both my son and my friends daughter still love playing in it.	
- 1	Initially I thought this was a wonderful idea, until I realized this spare parts set is only three dollars less than the full set with bottles included. Medela really needs to sell the collars alone for a lower price - the wide-necked ones are the first thing to break when baby drops his bottle. I don't want to have to pay $13 or $16 dollars every time I need more collars, it's ridiculous. Other brands use standard collars which are very inexpensive by comparison.	
1. 	As new parents we bought a lot of gadgets to help entertain our newborn. We purposely didn't buy this type if chair because we had some many other gadgets and thought we had all basis covered. After we visited a friend and my parents who had similar chairs we knew we had to have one. It allows her to sleep, eat, and just look around and watch her surroundings. She is held a lot but occasionally wants her own space and this is her favorite place.  It sits between my husbands and I chair and she very content. Definitely one of the best baby purchases and it is wasn't very expensive.	
- 1	The pros: It will keep the poop off your baby's butt and diaper.The cons:1)There is no way I would put that next to my child's skin. Go to your laundry supplies and pull out a fabric softer sheet. That's what if feels like. Can you imagine wearing that all day?2) It does NOT keep the wetness away from the skin. Not even a little bit.I think I'm going to soak my purchase in liquid fabric softner and use them in the dryer.I don't know if all liners are like this as this is the first one I tried. I've decided to use the fleece liners instead as they will keep the wetness away from the skin.	
1. 	This is the second diaper dude bag I have purchased. The first bag, in red, I bought for my husband a couple of years ago when we had our first child. Unfortunately for him, I liked it so much that I have appropriated it, necessitating in the purchase of a second bag for his use. I prefer to use this bag over my Kate Spade Stevie bag, which although stylish is not as efficient. This bag is hard wearing, has excellent use of space and you can get things out of it while wearing it. I even use it as my go to flight bag. And my husband is extremely happy to have his own bag again.	
- 1	I hate this seat.  I cannot get the shoulder straps long enough to get my daughter's arms through the straps comfortably.  She is not yet 2 years old and weighs about 25 lbs.  I can't imagine using this seat until she's 70 lbs, as the manfacturer states.  In order to get her arms through the straps, I have to bend her arms awkwardly which frequently makes her cry.  I have not yet removed the HUGS chest pads and stitching, but I'm going to try that.  It seems odd that I have to remove the additionaly safety features in order to get her into the seat without making her cry.  I also bought th Peg Perego Convertible Premium seat and I am much happier with that seat.	
1. 	I previously got the 25-pack (which all the wipes were in one container). I loved how easy to use they were. So I decided to get the 40-pack. It wasn't until they arrived that I realized they were individually wrapped which made me so much happier! I had a hard time getting the 25-pack set to stay closed so now that I don't have to worry about that I am totally thrilled!	
- 1	I wanted to try a wooden teether for my son. In my opinion, this particular teether is too rough and I will not be giving it to my son again. He played with it once after I wiped it down with mild soap and water. I did not immerse the teether in water because I believe the packaging instructs not to (although I don't have it anymore to double check.) It is a good size for little hands and the circles give it some interest as opposed to other wood teethers that I've seen. I really wanted my son to like this and I'm disappointed with how rough it feels.	
1. 	These are the typical rubber replacement valves. It's good to have a few extras on hand. I appreciate that I don't have to replace an entire cup.	
1. 	affordable basic plugs. have no problems with the fit - not that easy to take out for the baby, not too hard for me.	
- 1	The music quality on this toy is horrible. It is poor quality and there is a big lopsided lump on the head where the speaker is. My daughter never cared for it. However I do know someone who said their child loved it. My dog wants it more than my baby.	
- 1	I like the idea of having a car seat that my son can grow with it. Unfortunately, not this one.First, it's difficult to clean it with the material they used for this car seat.Second, it's not reclining enough when we placed this car seat facing forward for my son in our Ford Escape and Ford Explorer. My son basically leans forward. especially when he is sleeping, he basically hanging there by the seat belt. No support for his head what so ever. Those 2 pillows even make the situation worse. We removed one of them to make the situation better. we also put a cushion underneath the car seat with an intent to make it reclined to a certain degree. but via time, the cushion shifts, we need to constantly adjust it. Now just by looking at the picture now, I should have known it wouldn't be reclining enough, especially with pillows.	
- 1	I guess probably all wipes cases have this problem so I just use the wipes as they come sealed in their bag.  When I tried to use this case in the car and diaper bag the wipes dried out in 1 day so it is only good if you use the wipes that day and replace with new ones the next.  Especially in the summer when it is hot if you leave them in the car they are wasted in a day!  Maybe this would work in the winter but not where I live!  I don't see the point just bring the whole wipes bag (I use 7th generation or Honest wipes which are less toxic).  So I think this is a waste of money.	
1. 	I am so glad we invested in this product....at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver!!!	
1. 	Can't recommend this enough.I had a horrible case of thrush. This was the only thing that helped me honestly.	
- 1	I recently started using these on my 6 month old.  The mouth piece is a little hard to get in place.  The cups do leak when he shakes the cup and they have from day one.  The wash easily and they are holding up nicely to his dropping/banging them. Quick update...These cups leak non-stop I will no longer use them.  The cup leaks with normal drinking not just from when my son wants to bang or drop his cup	
- 1	I have 9 children and really wanted to get away from the average uncomfortable pillow when feeding. I decided to try this pillow because of all the great ratings it had and really wanted to love love love this pillow. I finally had it delivered and was so so excited to have this work, however, once I opened it from the plastic cover, I immediately smelled a strong chemical smell. I tried to ignore it but it eventually gave me one nasty headache and made my baby very irritable! I returned it thinking that maybe mine was defective and bought another, same thing. I think it has to do with the flame retardant spray they use, (according to the company when I called) so I said, wow then why are you thinking of another alternative since babies are resting their pure little heads on this? She could not give me an answer. So I am back to my regular pillows and boppys! Please do your research! This pillow is a major hazard, the idea of it was amazing and the fit was great but I would not lay my baby in tide detergent and let him nap, nor would I lay my baby on sprayed chemicals that will hurt his lungs and respiratory system. If anyone has any ideas on a good eco breastfeeding cover that is safe for human lungs, please please respond to me:) Thank you!	
1. 	The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.	
1. 	We love this. Although it is a bit slow (about 15 minutes), it is very valuable when traveling.We bought this when on a roadtrip and have had no regrets.	
- 1	We have not been able to use this. it is imposible to drink from it. What a waste of money...	
- 1	I had heard so many happy endorsements for this diaper.  The patterns are ADORABLE and I was super excited for these diapers to arrive. I have been trying out a few different brands before I make an investment into our supply. We have tried FuzziBuns, Happy Heinys and now these.  The Happy Heinys were small and leaked up the front.  The Thirsties are not going to make it to 40 pounds.The first time we used them they leaked out the side.  My child is in the 95th percentile @ 7 months old, so these may work just fine for a slimmer child. The leg gussets were way too tight and we are on the very last set of snaps. The diaper was also very tight around his belly.  Our baby is 29 inches tall and 24lbs.  The Fuzzibuns, although larger for a cloth diaper have never leaked and I believe will make it through potty training. The other thing is the inserts that were provided with the Thirsties diaper took forever to dry when I washed them.  They were washed with the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium inserts and it definitely took a lot longer to dry the Thirsties inserts than the others.Unfortunately, these and Happy Heinys will not.  Amazon was very gracious about providing a refund.  I would not recommend these diapers if your child is 'thicker'.  Also, the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium inserts are the best that I have found. They are pricey, but they definitely do the job.  The FuzziBuns inserts are great as well if you are looking for a less expensive alternative to the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium.  Also, some good advice that I've found is that if your diapers start to repel after a while of use, use the Blue Dawn dish soap (Dawn Ultra) in with the load and it will strip them down and normal absorbency will take place again.Good Luck!  This whole cloth diapering thing is so confusing, but I think I'm starting to get it down.  Please feel free to post questions or message me through my profile and I will help if I can. I decided to cloth diaper because I was tired of applying A&D; ointment daily to my son's bottom due to redness.  When we use the cloth diapers, it clears up.  And it's really not that bad to wash, etc.  I'm a simple and efficient mama with a lot going on and I don't have a lot of time to invest into much. I figured out how to make this work for us. Also, for storage while we are waiting to build up a whole load, we just throw them into a pillow case to keep them separate.  Run them in a cold soak load.  Then HOT wash load using a Tide Free (White bottle with light blue lid).	
- 1	Yes, the other reviews are true--Our daughter slept in this from day one, and slept in it beautifully. She started sleeping through the night at a very early age, and we were amazed at how this sleeper allowed her to sleep for long periods at night (she ate frequently during the day, and rarely woke up at night). Our daughter was gaining weight perfectly and was happy, healthy, and meeting or exceeding all of her developmental milestones; however, when our daughter was 8 weeks old, I noticed what I thought to be a flat spot developing on the back of her head, and our pediatrician told me she couldn't see it. At 16 weeks, I felt the flat spot had gotten worse--This time, we went to see a neurosurgeon, who diagnosed our daughter with deformational brachycephaly--or flathead syndrome. She now must wear a helmet to correct her head shape. Although this sleeper is probably a miracle product for children with acid reflux, GERD, colic, etc...it without a doubt allowed my daughter to sleep TOO well--and caused a flat spot to develop. The back of her head is completely flat. Once we moved her to a crib at 16 weeks, she now wakes up every single night to eat--and I'm thrilled. I strongly believe that Fisher Price needs to market this device NOT as an all-night sleep device, but as something that your infant might sit in while you spend 10 minutes folding laundry or emptying the dishwasher. It can't be used as something to sleep in at night, every night. The bottom line: If you do decide to purchase this, if your infant starts to sleep for very long stretches at night, pay particular attention to the back of his/her head. If you notice a flat spot, which I did at 8 weeks, I'd get rid of this product ASAP.	
- 1	I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco.	
1. 	Got this for my 9 month old and she play's with it in her crib at night we love it!!	
1. 	Love these bottles! I'm primarily breast feeding but, when I have to use bottles, these work great. Very little (if any) air gets to baby & baby seems to have no trouble transitioning between these bottles & natural nipples.  They do have a few pieces but, are easy to disassemble, clean up easily in the dishwasher & reassemble very quickly. Very durable & no leaks while drinking (although I have noticed that they will leak sometimes if they're in the diaper bag & it gets turned upside down).  Highly recommend!	
- 1	I have had my Snoogle for a couple months now and I just can't get comfortable with it.  I feel like I am in a cage when I try sleeping with it and it hurts my neck when I sleep on it.  I was hoping that maybe as my belly started to grow and I started getting more uncomfortable, I could make it work for me but I wake up in the morning and my neck will just be killing me.  So it lives on top of the cedar chest that I have in my bedroom in hopes that maybe later on I can still get some comfort from it.	
1. 	What will they think of next?  I absolutely love this product.  The lightweight, soft, 100% cotton material is a great alternative to the heavier fleece for the warmer months.  The neutral green color is wonderful for both boys and girls.  It is easy to use and baby stays snuggly wrapped much better than the traditional recieving blanket.  Mom and Dad can rest assured that your precious little one will feel safe and secure in the swaddle me.	
- 1	I bought this for our 3 month old, and the concept is obviously great-- lots of stimulating patterns and contrasting colors.  However... once I had it out and assembled, the pieces are so flimsy and there are flimsy 'small' parts.  I just did not feel comfortable leaving her alone in her crib for even 30 seconds, while that was over it.  Yes, she couldn't reach it yet, but still-- It made me nervous.  I think I'll return it and get something soft with less small parts.  It's a shame, it is a great idea.	
1. 	Was able to secure a 6 foot bookcase without any issues. Screws were not a problem. Always possible for a long screw to break, just drill a pilot hole. Straps seemed sturdy. If you want them flush to the wall, you need to install the wall piece well below the piece attached to the unit (several inches.)	
- 1	We bought this video monitor as our back up while I was having our Summer Infant Touch Video Monitor replaced (don't buy that one either).  This is a good back up monitor for traveling in my opinion.  But as your main monitor, it stinks.  It is impossible to get the camera angled correctly.  The picture is grainy.  The sound goes in and out.  And, when you turn on the monitor it beeps really loudly.  So, if you are trying to make sure the camera is angled correctly by turning on the monitor (while you are in the nursery), it beeps really loudly and can wake up your kid.  It also beeps when it loses signal.  Then ironically, when the battery is dying on the monitor, it makes no noise, but the power light starts to blink.  90% of the time I don't notice this and then I look over at the monitor and it's turned off b/c the battery is dead.  Now, I was probably spoiled with the Summer Infant Touch which has a great camera that you can control remotely (but that monitor is awful b/c it doesn't work for very long), but I still think this is not a good monitor as your primary monitor.	
1. 	This ExerSaucer came in the product box without a shipping package to protect it.  I suppose that could cause damage to the product.  In this case it did not.  Unfortunately, it was missing two Lower Leg Backs.  I had to call Amazon and have a new product shipped to me.  There is no return cost when returning a defective item, however you do have to go out of your way to have it shipped back.  I suppose it's worth it.Other than that, the Saucer went together pretty easily.  The directions are easy to understand; the process is broken up into small steps with accurately labeled drawings.	
- 1	One specific music clip irritates her. Bouncing doesn't work as well as swinging for my baby. A safer bet is to buy a swinging set cuz most babies like swinging motions better. I got it from a baby shower. Should have put a swinging set on baby registry as well so that people may has more choices. Eventually you can return items you don't like.	
1. 	I really wasn't sure about this when I bought it, but my 9 month old has six teeth so dental hygiene needs to be incorporated. Other items I've offered him to chew have been touch and go, which is why I was hesitant about this product: just because it is designed for a baby to chew doesn't mean he's going to chew it. In fact, while I was opening the package he was already chewing on something else he seemed to find wildly satisfying. Yet when I handed him this toothbrush he became immediately intrigued, set down the other object and went to town on the toothbrush! I could hear his little teeth squeaking against the nubby bristles, and it seemed that the shape was able to get good coverage on both front and back.Rad item. Totally glad I bought it.	
1. 	Still not using it but looks great.if u have big b.., don't use it for breastfeeding. I think it's made for women who have small boobs.	
- 1	The stupid light comes on and off! And this thing cut my babies thumb! So hard to use  and I threw the stupid thing away.	
1. 	I read many reviews and decided that this was the best tub for my baby.  I have been quite pleased with it.  It comes with a hammock that securely clips onto four corners of the tub.  The hammock has a padded headrest and some mesh material for drainage and it is perfect for a newborn.  It washes up very nicely in the washing machine too.  When your newborn gets bigger and moves from hammock to tub, there are two different sides.  One has an incline and a pad for the back and the other side is vertical for when your baby sits up.  We are still using the inclince for our six-month old.  There is a spot for you to keep soap, shampoo and washcloths at the edge of the tub.  The tub is made to rest securely on the kitchen sink (it won't work with ours because we have three sinks with angled separations) and it has a drain plug at the bottom which will change from green to white if the water is too hot.There are only two minor problems I have with this tub.  Tub water goes down into two of the legs because they are hollow.  It is difficult to dry the bottom of these, and soap or dirt can build up.  I clean them out by putting a paper towel on the handle of a wooden spoon and wiping them.  The other problem is that the mat for our baby's back on the incline has slipped.Our baby is getting too big for the tub now (he's 30 inches) and he is starting to sit up well, so we will move him the regular bathtub soon.	
- 1	This worked pretty well for us.  The only problem is that the baby and the person carrying her would be covered in sweat pretty quickly.  We live in Germany and it was very cold and snowing during Christmas, and we still had to take breaks and let the baby cool off - and usually change her into dry clothes.	
1. 	The service by target is very good. Item arrived in good condition and quite fast. The walker although is not as colorful as it seems from the picture but is good enuff to keep my son engaged. It is safe and at the same time glides both on carpet and vinyl floor.	
1. 	My son loved it right away. He felt like a boy sitting in. The tray was great while he was younger but we don't use it any more since he sits at the table. The height adjustments are great for growing toddlers. Very easy to clean and store. I am very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	This cup broke within 2 weeks of ownership. Thats all I needed to know to not buy another. I did like the attached cap it has to cover the straw , but its simply wasnt spil proff and it broke so I'll pass.	
1. 	My little one is so squirmy when I try to clean her face and nose, and she absolutely HATES the bulb. I had to find a better solution for cleaning out her nose, especially since she doesn't stay still. After reading the reviews I decided to purchase these tweezers and after the first use I fell in love! They make cleaning out her nose relatively quick, definitely easy, and she no longer fights me when I'm doing it!	
- 1	I followed the instructions for making the written names &#34;permanent&#34; but they didn't stay. I didn't even wash them after the first time! I still use the bands on their cups, and rewrite their names periodically. Disappointed!	
1. 	At very beginning, the baby may fussy a bit. It will be ok if you continue serving them food.And no more mess, no more changing clothes.Must have them!	
1. 	We recently bought a pack of these and they are the best cups out there. When dropped, the rubber valves stay in place. They are very easy to drink from and have a small spout which is easier for little mouths. The cars designs are so cute. They almost look 3-D with cute race track back grounds. Lightening McQueen is pictured on both cups. Can't go wrong with these cups. Highly recommended. Easy to clean too.	
- 1	I got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it. Two weeks after we got it, it quit working. I have tried to email the company and have gotten no response. I'm kinda irritated that I shelled out $30 for something that didn't even hold up.	
- 1	The bib is fine until your baby insists on feeding him/herself or spits food back out. Then it slides all the way down past the pocket and onto his/her diaper bulge and lap or pants or the highchair seat because the pocket doesn't stay open. The pocket only catches about 10% of whatever falls its way which still leaves me with a baby who needs a complete bath after EVERY meal, and a full change of clothes because the food has soaked through the pants and the bottom of her onesie down to her diaper!	
- 1	This car seat does everything it's suppose to do, it secures the infant tightly, has the sun-canopy and stylish looking BUT it's heavier than a ton of bricks.  The car seat alone is almost 30 lbs and then you put a kid in there, no weakling is picking this baby up. The knobs to push in are hard to push and it's difficult to secure without the base. Overall I wouldn't recommend just because it's so heavy and most likely a single mom isn't going to be able to lift it out of a back seat.	
- 1	My husband and I purchased this product in order to confine our small puppy when we need to leave her alone/unsupervised in the house.  Unfortunately, once we unpacked the gate, it was very quickly apparent that this was not at all suitable for us.The product is flimsy and feels cheaply made and unlikely to withstand any sort of harsh treatment (such as, in our case, a puppy jumping against it).  When at its widest extension, the gate is flimsy and looks unstable.  Yes, I know this product is cheap and you get what you pay for --- but after attempting to secure it into the doorway, the wood has already become frayed and chipped due to the fastenings.  Even with the low cost, I still expected better than this.The main reason why I will be returning this product back to Amazon is because it simply will not fit our standard sized doorway.  The fastenings go up in 1/2 inch intervals, and simply do not lock tight enough to secure the gate in place.  We need something that can withstand an energetic puppy and also not fall over when our cat jumps onto it. This product failed to fulfil either of these functions - it falls over at the slightest touch and would never withstand the efforts of a puppy.Not recommended.	
1. 	Finally relief for my poor boobs! As a mom who breastfeeds it can be tough when your nipples are sore or cracked. These provide relief from your bra or breast pad rubbing and allows air to get to your nipple to allow it to heal. I put nipple cream on my sore nipples and then wear these breast shields to get a break! Definitely a must if you are breastfeeding!	
- 1	I really want to love these bottles. I've used them for both my children. I like the caps and inserts. They work great for me. Except they don't screw on very tight. I suppose that's all part of the less gas in babies tummies because they vent. However, if you don't put the nipple in just right and make sure all the parts are completely dry (difficult for me since I wash and fill mine every night) they don't get a good seal and the lid pretty much comes right off. I've lost so many bottles of my precious breast milk. I'd love to give a recommendation on a better brand, but I never tried another since I had so much invested in these. The best I can say is my breast fed babies took them.	
- 1	zipper breaks after a few uses	
1. 	This mobile is very well designed, my son really loves the pictures, they are reversable so I can switch them as he gets older, the pictures face the baby unlike most mobiles.	
- 1	Ok, I have so many reasons why I dispise this diaper disposal.  When I first bought this diaper disposal, I was happy that it took regular kitchen sized garbage bags...They should point out that you need to use the kind with the drawstring, otherwise they slide right back into the unit! Second, the way that you push the diapers into the bag is by simply closing the lid...well the lid is so loud, it sounds like a guillotine.  If I have to do a latenight diaper change, I let the diaper sit until morning because the sound wakes my son up everytime! Next, I loaded it with 4 D batteries..the green light blinked a few times, but that was it.  I never heard a fan sound or anything like that.  Also, now that my son is eating solids, his diapees are pretty ripe (TMI, sorry), but his room smells like a dump if a few diapers pile up, and I'm talking about a day's worth!  Wasn't the whole reason why I bought this was to keep the stink out of the room??  Don't waste your money.  I'm thinking of donating to Goodwill, and getting a Diaper Champ!	
- 1	For all intents and purposes, this bag does its job. It's just too big for my needs at home. I do diaper laundry every other day and this bag is kind of a pain to wash. I use it as a hanging bag and it's OK - but again, not my favorite. I like Kanga Care's other wet bags, the round ones with the zippers.	
1. 	Super soft, fits great.  Matches car seat perfect.  Good little things so my baby girls neck isn't scratched!  Quality bad cute.	
1. 	I've been using these for a few months now and I think they are great.  The lid lets me stack easily in my drawer freezer.  I wash them in the dishwasher (including high heat dry and sanitize setting) and haven't had any issues with the lids fitting or warping.  In fact, I just got two more as a hand-me-down from a friend who used them for her children (several years) and they still look great, so they hold up well.	
- 1	Pros:InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons:Didn't last.  Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now.UPDATE:If I could, I'd probably raise this to 3, maybe even 4, stars.Why? As I state in the title, it's cute and does the job.  It's also inexpensive.  When ours died, I looked around for something different.  Something that fit the spout well (like this one does), that stays clean inside (like this one), that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does)... I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit.  In the end, I bought another one of these.  At the price, I can buy another if this one pops too.  In the meantime, it has everything I am looking for.	
1. 	PROS:Colors are bright and eye catching! Extremely cute!Keeps EVERYTHING off of my daughters clothes!!!Does not seep through!Easy to rinse! In the sink and hang dry!Drys quickly!Less mess in your kitchen and to have to clean up!CONS :Cant think of Anything YET! Will keep you updated!	
1. 	I had been told that a wipe warmer was a must have.  That babies are going to hate diaper changes just cause they get all cold and wet.  So taking that advice I bought a prince lionheart wipe warmer.  When I was reading the reviews on that I notice that lots of people complained that the warmer had messed up thier furniture.  I bought brand new stuff for my baby and didnt want to have this happen.  I was reading that some people had used cooking racks and other off the wall things to keep it from touching the wood.  I was hoping there was an easier way.  Then I found this.  The wipe warmer is no where near the wood now.  I love it too because it is great for small spaces and it keeps things organized.  I love that the side pieces come off.  If you arent using them or dont need them why have them taking up space.  It looks nice too it doesnt look really cheap and it matches everything being clear.  I really love this product... I am an OCD mother and this just helps me to keep things together.	
- 1	We used these in a pool that required we buy them before my daughter could enter (what a scam!). She's 2 and I bought a 2-T because she fit in the weight range, but they were way too big. If she had pooped/peed, it would have run right out the side. So I put her normal swim diaper on first, which fits perfectly and we've never had an accident with it, then I put this suit over it. This setup worked fine, but certainly defeats the purpose of the My Pool Pal suit. The biggest issue was the pink color ran terribly! I put her wet suit in a bag with mine, and my blue suit was pink when I pulled it out. This is after swimming and rinsing. I put it in the sink to soak when we got home, and the water turned pink instantly. Scares me to think what this would do to her skin!	
1. 	this is the best product.I bought it after redaing several reviews and am very happy that i got this tub for my little one. she loves it.	
- 1	I expected from other's reviews that the material would be thin, rough, and almost dingy. I was willing to accept that given how expensive other boppy covers are, and I haven't had time to create my own.What I didn't expect was for the zipper stitching to fall apart the first time putting this cover on the boppy. What shoddy construction. I would rather continue to toss a blanket over the boppy than use one of these covers.	
- 1	My daughter loves to sip from a straw so I thought this was a perfect inexpensive cup to try.  The problem is that it is not spill proof so it defeats the purpose of being a sippy cup.The second problem is that when washing I pulled the straw out so I could soak it and it was almost impossible to put back in.  I feel like it is cheaply made and really not worth buying.	
- 1	Not compatable with all convertible cribs, anchor clamps were too narrow, and was unable to attach the frame of the bed. The customer service for the company is not as good as most. They had me send pictures of the anchor clamps and my child's bed, and then did not reply for months. When they did, after we had already figured out a way to get it to somewhat work, they stated that it is not guarenteed to fit all convertable beds, although the box did say it did. We had to make adjustments ourselves to get it to work. I am not sure if it would ever work as described. It is at an angle, and my kid just saw it as a fun barrier to jump. Somewhat flimsy. Not a good deal.	
- 1	Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on.	
- 1	I am sure there was some way of knowing this beforehand, but these covers don't work on my outlets.  I have a track home built in 2006 and have standard outlets I guess.  I unscrewed my covers and screwed these ones on.  Unfortunately, there is a gap between the wall and the cover.  It does not sit flush against the wall.  That seems more unsafe to me, actually.  I felt like my baby could twist these covers as they did not have a secure mounting.  I did like that there is no plastic plug to remove and put somewhere close by yet out of reach but these don't work for me.  Also, the color of these covers is different than my standard ones.  These are more of a gray white.  I would have dealt with the minor color difference had they fit securely but I can't use them.  Unfortunately, I ordered a 12 pack.  :(  Not worth returning but not worth using.	
1. 	Great product that hold up well over time and keeps the kiddo from getting into things and even prevents pinched fingers.	
- 1	I agree with this previous reviewer, these are not for all moms. My complaints:1) I still had to lean forward. For some reason, the angle did not help me at all.2) I lost suction with these flanges, resulting in reduced pumping output. Since I exclusively pump, this was a MAJOR problem!3) I sometimes like to move the flanges around mid-pump to better attach to the nipple. Sometimes these flanges would disconnect entirely from the connector when I did this. This never happened with Medela flanges.	
- 1	Bought it for a trip with our 6 mo to England during winter. Ended not using it because it is just a termo, a very heavy one and does not keep water very hot... Boiled water would stay warm for about 4 h inside the diaper bag. And that's mainly indoors. Better off buying a regular termo or coffee mug that is lighter.	
1. 	I have two faves and I alternate between the two for various reasons.  I am pumping 100% because my daughter will not latch on (another story - issues with losing >10% and having to supliment with a bottle with expressed milk - nipple confusion) so finding the right pad to put on always sensitive nipples is critical.  Writing the same review for both.FavesPhilips AVENT Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Softer than Lansinoh- works really well when nipples are very tender and drying out makes it worse- regardless of what cream/balm I used, sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds do not stick (only occasionally)CONS:- they are a little bulkier than Lansinoh so they may show through some bras- when I was in the leaking stage (or when I go a little too long between my night and morning pumping session) I have occasionally leaked through the padLansinoh Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Thinner and larger in diameter than Avent- keeps nipples drier- I don't think that I have ever leaked throughCONS:- not as soft as Advent- sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds stick to pad and sometimes tear off scabs (sorry this sounds so gross, but it happens)I usually use Avent when my nipples are in bad shape (seems to go in cycles) because they are softer and my wounds don't stick and then switch to Lansinoh when they are healing and need to dry out.	
1. 	Hi. Love this sling. Tip: when facing baby out, you can put a bib through the arm holes and have it drape over the top. Easy to change out and give baby a fresh place to drool. We put my son in after he eats. He usually burps and it helps with the acid reflux to have him upright. He enjoys going out for walks in it as he can touch and feel the flowers and objects I bring close to him. Good idea to have an umbrella handy for walks as there is not the shade that strollers provide. It can also turn into a baby OVEN fairly quickly, so I use the stroller when it's warm out. Another tip, when baby is in the sling, I eat or do things in front of a large mirror. It keeps him entertained.	
- 1	I had very high hopes for this blanket, despite the negative reviews about the awful toxic odor, because there were still so many other positive reviews here on Amazon and on other merchants' sites, and I also really like the other JJ Cole Collections products.  I thought perhaps I would have better luck, or that the odor would not be as bad as some of the reviewers made it out to be.  But it was WORSE!  After opening the package, I immediately smelled the horrible toxic-plastic smell.  It was completely overwhelming to the point that after I put the blanket back in its packaging and shipment box to return it, I still had the smell in my nose and throat! Terrible! I wish there were a way to give it just a half of a star for this so you could see that it's been reviewed, but it does not even rate a full star. 0.5/5 = 10% = very low F.	
- 1	I just saw the reviews and got really excited. My son needed fresh sippy cups for daycare and I figured for the price this one was a win. 4 1/2 stars, I didn't even bother to read. Took them out of the package and tried to open; no go. I'm thinking maybe I'm getting carpal tunnel, so I passed to my husband to open. After 4 minutes his pride got the best of him. I opened another type of munchkin sippy that I just bought with no problem, same click lock technology, no problem.I tried again and failed, so I walked away.Thinking that maybe I'm lacking nutrition, I tried once more after dinner and no luck. Re-evaluating leftie loosie, righty tighty, still nothing. Started writing this review since I seem to be the only one with this problem so far and gave this sippy one elbow tremor last squeeze and it opened. I got excited and closed to open again and guess what, it's locked again. $%#k this!	
- 1	I was so excited when I bought this but that excitement quickly fizzled away the first time I used this.  For newborns this is awful.  I could't keep her head and body up AND bathe her and getting her out of the bucket wasn't easily at all.  It's just too awkward.  Then when she was older I couldn't properly wash her because of the tub shape.  Getting my hands in there and washing was ridiculous.  It's a good soaker tub to let them soak and enjoy the warmth of the water surrounding them.  My daughter did enjoy that part.  As a bath tub, I give it two thumbs down.  I ended up going with the First Years infant/toddler tub.  It's so much easier to use than this bucket style and my daughter was just as happy in the traditional tub.	
1. 	When I first got this item, I was really frustrated with it, because the static was terrible!  It was keeping me up at night just to hear the terrible static.  Then I started hearing other voices on it, so I think my neighbor has one and it was picking up their conversations.  So I switched it to the other channel, and now it works perfectly!  The sound is crystal clear (only gets a little staticy if you turn it up REALLY loud).  It picks up my baby's every grunt and cry.  Sometimes it works too well, because she grunts a lot in her sleep, and I hear every one!I also really like the lights feature, because I can see how intense my baby's cry is.  When I wake up out of a dead sleep at 2:00 a.m., sometimes it's hard to judge if my baby is really crying for me, or if she's just kind of whimpering in her sleep.  When those 4 bars of lights light up, I know I better get myself in there!  The lights are also nice, because if my baby's napping and I just want some quiet time to read a book, I can turn the sound all the way down, and the lights catch my attention right away when she really starts crying.This is a great monitor for the price!  I was a little weary about buying an electronic gadget made by Fisher-Price, but it's turned out to be a great investment.	
1. 	I'm not exaggerating when I say that we tried every single bottle on the market with our DD (due to reflux). As first-time parents, we wanted nothing but the best for her. After trying all the crazy, expensive, gimmicky bottles, we continued to go back to Playtex Nursers.  These bottles are just about perfect. I don't love that they create more trash, BUT they save so much time by not having to wash bottles every day. I buy store-brand liners, which work fine. I haven't experienced a single leak, and we've been using these particular bottles about 5 months.	
1. 	My daughter really liked to use this product. She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more. I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it.	
- 1	I washed this sheet on delicate cycle in a separate lingerie sack.  The plush top came in contact with velcro during folding and snagged!  Will not buy this again.	
1. 	We LOVE this exersaucer!  At first I wasn't sure if this one could be any better than the others and is priced a little higher but it's worth every penny.  It has so many toys and different activities that it keeps him entertained.  I can actually see my son's progress from not being able to move around in it to now being able to swivel the chair around to pull and reach the higher toys (which he loves to do).  Whenever he's a little fussy we put him in here and he quiets down and starts to play.  We also have a some of the other entertainment toys (the car) all of the others we could have done without but this one is well worth every penny!	
1. 	it is very useful, i took it outside when my girl and me went outside, i put the diasper inside and throw away, very feasible and clean.	
- 1	I really want to try these since the Dino Dudes print (no longer an option) is the same as my twins' nursery so I bought 2. At 11 and 12.5 pounds the covers are still too big. I am pairing them with a Best Bottom insert and maybe they are just too trim. I'll keep trying them..	
- 1	Just disregard the product photo, because the actual product looks nothing like it. The product photo shows a thick material that looks sturdy and has a sheen to it; I envisioned it would be made of a pool float type material. In reality, it is very thin, and appears to be made out of packing peanuts. It does not grip my faucet, and any slight contact with it spins it around and causes it to come off. If you have a diverter on your spout, that might help keep it from coming off, but it still looks like it will tear easily. Serious disappointment. This thing might be worth 50 cents, and even then, it's not at all functional, just cute to look at.	
- 1	These bottles are extremely frustrating. Sometimes they leak, other times they don't. And after trying all the suggestions to prevent and stop leaking to no avail, I'm giving up. Do not buy! I have used Born-Free bottles while working as a nanny and never once had to deal with a leak. I reccomend those instead.	
- 1	Oh, I was so disappointed.  This toy looks like so much fun, but our grandson was able to grasp the objects and actually pull the toy down on top of himself, so we had to send it back.  I wish the company would tell you how high the item sits about the carrier AND what the reach-length limit is for babies.  I'm thinking this is one of those toys that will be outgrown too soon to make the cost worth it.	
1. 	These locks just cannot be beat.  They were featured on HGTV to baby-proof your house which is how I found out about them in the first place.  They cannot be opened at ALL by the child, unlike many of the other items out there.  You have to not only have the key to open the door, you have to know how to manipulate it to open.  If you have chemicals that you have store within a child's reach, there is no other better way than this lock to make SURE that child is safe.  I feel very blessed that I found out these locks exist because my little one is extremely curious and figures out EVERYTHING! Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  Regarding the installation, my husband is not a handyman - he's a musician and if he can figure it out, so can just about anyone else.  Buy them!	
1. 	My three month old is the master swaddle Houdini. This one is much harder for him to break free from. Love the soft cloth and fact there is no Velcro.  We'll be ordering another for when this one is in the wash.	
- 1	These are great. My child seems frustrated when her toys don't fly across the room, but that's point. I like the colors too.	
- 1	My toddler loves this set but after several months the paint began to chip off the bowl and the enamel cracked on the plate. I had to throw it out.	
- 1	The plastic is a little flimsy and few of the lids broke a little not allowing them to seal properly.  I liked the idea...but unless you are making baby food every few days you would need like 5 of these...and then would have no space in your freezer.  I make baby food and freeze in ice cube trays...then transfer them into ziploc bags.  I only use these if I run out of ice cube trays.  For their purpose they are okay, but are really an unnecessary product.	
1. 	Still not using it but looks great.if u have big b.., don't use it for breastfeeding. I think it's made for women who have small boobs.	
- 1	A hands free bustier is a must for any bfing mom who wants to pump but I could never get a good fit from this one.  For a much better fit try theSimple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS/S/M.  It's very adjustable and should allow for a good fit for any woman.	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	
- 1	I received this swing as a gift and it is the cutest little swing, but for some reason it will NOT swing when my son is in the swing. If I take him out it swings perfectly for a while until it becomes lazy and starts to slow down. The battery life isnt good at all either it seems to drain my batteries and give me horrible swings. I would not recommend this swing to no one unless you was a manual swing for inside the house.	
1. 	I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!	
- 1	it is a sad thing when you are a first time parent and don't really know how or what you need to do to help your little one.i bought these spoons with the intention of helping my son learn to self feed, it will soon be a year since they have been sitting in the drawer!! the other day my husband saw them and remarked what a waste of money these were.the first issue i had with these that caused me not to use them is that they are not deep enough to hold much of anything- and my son gets frustrated if he isn't getting enough food to make a proper mouth full.and the more i think of these the more i realize how silly they are- indeed the holes can make for a tough clean up routine when food gets in...i really don't know what else to say to parents looking at these except move along...	
- 1	I love the concept of a stainless steel cup as I am trying to get away from plastic, but unfortunately I didn't really like this execution.  It holds quite a bit of liquid, unlike some other sippy cups, but the struggle is getting the liquid from this.  I use the straw insert because my one year old has been sipping from straws since about 9 months, so that is what he is used to.  At first I found it odd that his cheeks would sink when he was sipping, but I didn't think much of it.  Then my husband told me to try and drink from this cup.  It is near impossible to do so!  I feel so bad having given this to my son now.  You have to exert way too much effort for the little liquid you get out of it.  My husband commented that he found the water to have a very metallic taste, though I didn't notice any strange taste myself.  However, I have stopped using it with my son.  He sometimes like to drink quite a bit of water, and I don't want him breaking a sweat trying to relieve his thirst!  Too bad, it really looks very good and if it had a release valve it would be near perfect.  I never used anything other than the straw attachment so I don't know how it works as a regular sippy or as a travel sippy.  I still haven't found a sippy cup that doesn't leak so I always make sure to keep any sippys I carry in an upright position.  So far the best I've found is the Innobaby 3-in-1 stainless sippy, but even that one leaves quite a bit to be desired.	
1. 	I am on my 3rd Exersaucer from EvenFlo because it is the best one I have seen in 5 years.  My 1st child had one, got rid of of not knowing we were gonna have another child...then got another when baby 2 came...and now we are on our 3rd.It comes completely disassembled, but isn't that hard to put together with only a screwdriver being needed.  The most important thing when putting it together is to make sure you don't overtighten the screws because that will cause the screws to come through the plastic later in use (I know this because I did it with the 1st one I owned).  But other than that, simple!!The toys on the saucer are the best ones I have seen on similar items...the right colors and patterns that attract and keep babies attention...and there are a lot of them!  What I like best about the talking pieces on this saucer is the fact that they are much louder than other baby toys.  This may not be a good thing for other parents, but I don't care if I miss a few words on the TV or something else as long as baby can actually hear what the toy is saying is more important to me.  Often times, baby toys aren't loud enough for baby to hear...or they are too loud...this one is perfect (in my opinion), and also has a low/high/off setting.  The only negative I have to say about this is how hard it is to clean because there are so many toys...lots of nooks and crannies for drool to seep into (and my baby is a drooler!!).While this saucer is pretty large, it can fold to about 6 inches high (after simply removing the top toy arch).  I find this option pretty much useless unless you are trying to pack it into your car...but it is foldable.Lastly, mine arrived with 3 broken toys.  Amazon is great and would have just sent me a new one and let me return this one, but I didn't feel like digging through a new box to get the new pieces out (then packaging it all back up to return to them) so I figured I would just call EvenFlo and discuss it with them.  After being on the phone for only 5 minutes, they agreed to ship me the 3 new pieces and I don't have to ship the broken ones back...yeah!!  Love Amazon, love EvenFlo, love the saucer!!  :-)	
- 1	Haven't been able to use it-it's so hard to blow it up I think we need a bicycle pump to get air into it. Too much work when you have a baby!	
- 1	Bought this based on all the good reviews.  Live in a large single family home, no phone or electromagnetic signals except for cell phones which are kept far from the monitor and receiver, yet for whatever reason the receiver will make crackle noises at regular intervals while on.  These are so loud they can be heard upstairs in the baby's room.  Can't turn the volume down or we wouldn't hear the baby.  HATE this thing.	
- 1	We have a comparably priced Summer Infant video monitor, but we have had to purchase a second remote device (the hand-held device with the screen) because the remote has been dropped so much. When the opportunity to try this one came up, I jumped on the idea! We have our iPhones and iPads handy almost all the time, so it sounded ideal...Not so much.Summary: Setup was easy. Video is lack-luster, sound is meh and crackly. The internet aspect slows things down from the moment you try to log on. Quality and user experience are severely limited by the Internet involvement.Setup:Software: App install was quick and easy.Camera: Set up was annoying but not terrible. You have to make an account on their server, even if you only want to stream within your own house. And then you have to configure the camera for your network (which involves the camera starting its own default network, you joining that network with your phone, configuring the camera to join your network then switching back to your network with your phone). That went well and the instructions were very clear.Login: I find it takes forever for the app to log me in. It's annoying and unnecessary. It also means that you cannot run it exclusively locally even if you want to. If you lose internet, you probably lose the baby monitor. (I did not test this, personally.)Video: The video quality on this camera is poorer than the Summer Infant one. The night vision works, but it makes the room and crib look hazy, like a dark, smokey bar. (Summer Infant's makes it look like surveillance tape, but it's clearer and easier to discern what's what.) Both cameras use infrared LEDs for night vision.During the day, it's ok, but still not as clear as the Summer Infant camera.The picture looked much better on the phones than the tablets - the resolution isn't there for larger images. The zoom is digital, so it's not actually useful (same pixels, just larger!). Switching between high and low quality made no visible difference.Sound: I could not get rid of the crackly static noise from the camera. I tried different rooms, different angles...Also, I could not get the push-to-talk to work.There is a slight delay - maybe 2 beats - in sound and video.Controls: There's definitely a delay between pressing the button to move the camera and the camera moving.Loss of connection: If the camera loses connection, the device you're monitoring on will beep. Loudly. It's a nice beep - like an industrial elevator beep - but still quite loud. Just what you don't want to hear in the middle of the night, right?We did try connecting from offsite and that was easy if also slow. Video was very clunky at that point.Plus it's expensive.The room temperature display is kind of neat, but not nearly enough to make up for the short-comings.Conclusion: There are more tests we could have done but this small amount of testing turned up enough clunkiness that we decided this wasn't for us.	
- 1	While this portable mobile is a good idea in theory, the unit I received was virtually useless because the connector arm was loose.  Per the instructions, I snapped the 2 parts of the connector arm together, and then attached the mobile unit to the top using the velcro strap.  However, the top part of the connector arm (the part that holds the mobile and hangs over a crib, bassinet, etc.) was very loose and wobbly, no matter how much I tried to adjust it.  As a result, the mobile swung back and forth and was basically unusable with the bassinet of my pack-and-play.  What's more, the clamp that's supposed to afix the connector arm to the railing of the crib, bassinet, pack-and-play, etc., wouldn't hold the mobile upright, so it kept falling into my bassinet no matter how much I tightened it.  Not only inconvenient, but also downright dangerous!  The swinging connector arm only made the problem worse by rendering the entire unit unstable; the mobile kept swinging around, the clamp would give way, and the whole unit would fall into the bassinet.  Needless to say, this item is being returned.	
1. 	Once my son started on solids we were excited to bust these out.  We put fresh fruits in them especially in these summer months.  Also since my son is teething we pop in a few ice cubes and instant teether.  They are easy for him to hold on to as well.	
- 1	I bought these because I thought the bendable feature was a good idea. But now that I have them, I think that is the only good feature. The mouth of the spoon and fork is much too small for anything to rest on them.  The fork, in particular, is so rounded that I don't think it could stab anything, not even a bean. This is a bad buy, and the first time I have been disappointed with a Boon product!	
1. 	We purchased this for our three year old.  We plan to keep it as a travel bed for her when we spend the night away from home.  To get her used to it, we set it up in the living room and she loved it instantly.  It's low enough to the ground that we don't worry about her falling out and is long enough for her to stretch out with plenty of room to spare.  It breaks down in seconds and it incredibly easy to put into the travel bag.  So glad we purchased this item.	
- 1	I had bought them intending to use them as swaddling blankets. After 1st wash they shrank awfully and now i believe i can use them either as burp clothes or for laying the baby on or other purposes, anything other than swaddling.Although the prints are cute, they are not suitable for swaddling.	
- 1	Another waste of my money. Easier to wash by hand and dry. Wish I could return this item too. Never used and don't plan on it. Sorry I bought it.	
- 1	Don't waste your time with this version.  The older one can be found in most children's consignment stores and is much better.  I also have the Flutterbye version, which is even better.	
1. 	I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps our daughter perfectly clean while having absolutely no negative effects on her skin. We have a routine of bath-time every night before feeding and sleeping, and this cleanser makes bath time fun every time. It rinses away super-easily, with absolutely no effort involved. This is important, because our daughter has a lot of baby rolls with folds in her neck and arms and legs. It smells a bit strong, but the smell is from the natural ingredients they use, it's not an added fragrance. And once my daughter is rinsed, there's no residual smell at all. I'm so happy we found this cleanser.	
- 1	I read such wonderful reviews of this mirror, that I couldn't wait to get it.  My baby is only 2 1/2 months old right now, and I find this mirror an irritation.  It takes 2 people to get the mirror placed so that the driver can see baby's face (one person in the back seat and the other in the driver seat).  The smiley face on the frog takes up valuable space.  When trying to get baby's face positioned in mirror, the smiley face frequently cuts straight through baby's face, making her facial expression impossible to see.  Hubby and I worked for 20 minutes to adjust this mirror so that Baby's face was visible from the driver's seat.  Once the baby's face is visible and the frog's smiley face is around the area of baby's neck, the picture is warped so badly that I feel like I'm watching the movie Alien.  I CAN see if baby's head is in the proper position and see if baby is smiling or frowning, making this semi-functional when mirror is placed right.  The biggest problem is that when someone sits in the back seat next to baby, they may touch the hand or foot of the frog as they are buckling themselves in.  If they do, then it moves the mirror and the quest to get the mirror placed correctly starts all over again.  I give this 2 stars because I expect as baby grows, her legs will be long enough to reach frog's belly, and she may find the toy interesting to play with.  At that point, I seriously hope I don't need to see her in the mirror anymore.	
- 1	Although the concept of the cup is great my son can never get to his last sip of water as most of it is dripping or spilling out. It leaks constantly. I cannot put anything in the cup but water because of the leaking issue. If I put the cup in the fridge then take it out the water leaks out from the top and vice Versa. I  bought this cup because of the great reviews but I do not think it is worth the money. Also the straw is impossible to clean and that is another reason why I only use water for sanitary reasons. I would not recommend this cup.	
- 1	I was satisfied with this product (good padding, easy to use) except my son was able to rip them right off table corners.  It needs a stronger adhesive, otherwise it is worthless and baby then tries to teeth on it, and it can be ripped apart with teeth and cause a choking hazard.  I never put them on anything after trying one table.	
- 1	I fell for the hype of Sophie, so many great reviews, a great name, and a high pricetag..so it must be great right? Wrong! It is an over-hyped dog toy. It is nothing like I expected. I thought the legs would be a bit more stiff to actually allow for teething. But they aren't. It's super soft and squishy and hollow. My son who puts everything in his mouth won't play with this, and I don't blame him. Even the texture is weird. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does have a cute squeeker (again like a dog toy). But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if it were a fraction of the price.	
- 1	I bought this because it was supposed to work with the pack and play. But it doesn't! It's too big and it makes the fitted sheet on top super bulky! Don't waste your money on this!	
1. 	So far it hasn't peeled off.  I'm waiting for it to, but after a month, no sign of it.  It looks cheap, but I'd rather have this over the hard plastic.	
1. 	I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).	
- 1	I bought this bag after our last cooler was outgrown by our baby. I searched for a cooler that was sturdy and had enough space for at least two bottles and food jars. The only reason I am not giving it 1 star was because I was able to pack the above and then store the spoons in the front zippered pocket. After  a month and half of use the inside stitching came apart and the foam underneath became visible. Very poorly constructed. I have to say that my final decision fir purchase of this product was based on brand as Dr. Brown is known for quality products. I was very disappointed.As a side note, I did not buy this product through Amazon but through a large baby retail store.	
1. 	I bought this product after using the standard sized Medela Shield and being refered by a nurse.  If you have larger breasts/areolas, this is the product for you!  I had to pump exclusively with my son, and if I hadn't bought these shields, I wouldn't have been able to do it due to pain and low supply.  This not only increased my supply, the comfort it provided allowed me to pump for many weeks exclusively.	
1. 	Love! Easily adjustable and looks very comfortable for baby. She falls asleep instantly when carried in it. My husband loves it and wears it for hours with no stress on his back.	
- 1	I bought this for my 19 month old son's room. He can get out of his crib, wakes up before everyone else, and runs all over the house. He also opens the door and runs outside. Needless to say, we needed a tall gate to keep him in his room so I can hear him when he wakes up and give me enough time to wake up also. Contrary to what the manufacturer states, this gate CAN'T be pressure mounted. It slips out of place or sometimes he pushes on the door and it open even though it's &#34;locked.&#34; We are not allowed to screw anything into the wall so this is useless.	
1. 	I bought these for my grandson who spits up formula with each feeding and is drooling now too.  Very happy with them.We go through lots of bibs each day, and the soft A&A; bibs were nice, but pricey and not protecting the clothes underneath from moisture. Protective bibs with plastic backs were just too harsh against the folds of skin around his neck. These bibs have a protective layer sandwiched in between two layers of soft terry fabric. So they are soft against baby's skin and also prevent moisture from seeping through the bibs to the clothes beneath.So we still go through many bibs a day, but do not have to change outfits each time. They are absorbent, color choice is good and can coordinate with most anything he wears. Price is OK  and quality is good.	
1. 	I love these monitors. The only thing I don't like is that the nightlight feature is a little too sensitive. It comes on if you barely touch it when turning the monitors on or off. Otherwise, I love the fact that it even has a nightlight. Also, these monitors are very sensitive so I can hear everything that is going on with my baby. Some people may not like this, but being a new mom, I love that they are so clear and sensitive. Great product!	
- 1	I do not like this brush- harsh materials, so hard, it spray water everywhere when you use it. And good luck if you can clean any of your bottle or the bottle neck areas. And the handle design make it slips out of your hands easily. I had much cheaper bottle brushes which works much better (dis-continued). Big waste of money given the frustration and completely useless of this brush.	
1. 	We purchased these edge guards just to be cautious but, once my son became mobile, we were thankful for these edge guards. Our son has clipped his chin, run around corners and hit his head and even bit the sides of the furniture when teething. What a great baby proofing item.	
1. 	My toddler is 20 months old but is quite tall for his age and has begun using this to try and reach the sink to wash his hands.  This item stows away nicely, is sturdy yet lightweight and attractive enough.  The advantage for it is that your toddler can easily step on to it on their own.  Note that this could also be a disadvantage as an unattended to child could be standing on top in a heartbeat when not wanted.  So, be careful what the access to this item looks like.  The disadvantage of that height is that my 20 month old can't even come close to actually putting his hands under the faucet to wash his hands and I still need to hold him.My recommendation is to know what you are using this for and understand the dimensions of this item combined with the height of your child and about how far they can reach.  If it doesn't help you to just get a little but higher-maybe hold off.  If your child is tall enough to benefit from the Safe Step-this is a reasonable value for a safe, sturdy item that will not slide around on the ground or break easily.	
- 1	Just received the trays. There are two trays and one lid. Very disappointed. I can't return it because I broke the box before noticing the missing lid.	
- 1	I love this bottle brush, because it is so convenient to have the two brushes in one, and unlike the Munchkin bottle brush it doesn't swivel (the swiveling makes it impossible to get the brush on the sides of the bottle, pump horns, etc) but this brush broke after only 8 weeks of use.  The brush literally came out of the handle. I almost considered buying another, but at $15 (that's with shipping) it's too much money for something that isn't going to last long.	
- 1	I bought this for my eight month old who was just starting to resist bedtime in hopes it would help.  The first time we used it she was mesmerized and it worked like a charm.  Second time it semi captured her attention with a little help from mommy.  By the third time the moving frog had begun to squeak so that wasn't exactly soothing and my baby was bored with it.  Gave it one more try just in case and the squeaking was still there.  Needless to say I returned it.  Also, the light was pretty bright.  When I would first turn it on, my baby would squint from the light.  And the timer is not 18 minutes!  It's more like 5-6 minutes like other reviews said.  Not worth the forty dollars in my opinion.	
- 1	We wanted to be moby lovers/users, but our daughter does not like being carried in it (she is now two months and has not liked being carried it in since the beginning).  We are holding on to our moby wraps in the hope that she may change her mind as she gets bigger, but we find we get no use out of our moby and A LOT of use out of our slings.  Also, the thing is SO LONG.  We are each 5'9&#34; and the thing drags on the floor as you try to put it on.  I know it works for some people, so if you decide to go this route best of luck, it just wasn't for our little girl.	
1. 	Have had for almost 2 years and we use it all the time.  Great to have for little ones to keep them out of the sun.	
1. 	This is very soft, and doesn't shrink when you wash it (which is important, considering it gets washed a lot!). I bought two, so I could always have an extra on hand, and I'm glad I did.	
- 1	I have great difficulty fitting bottle nips into the basket, and it does not hold much overall, and hence, I continue to wash my baby's bottles by hand.	
1. 	I bought these to replace my leaking Avent bottles.  I've been using them a 4 months and I've not had any problems.  No leaks.  However I wish they made more rate flow nipples the #2's are too slow so I pokeed 4 more holes in them. Now my daughter drinks her bottle quickly instead of sucking for 15 mins and getting a red face.	
- 1	This gate probably works fine to keep kids in a safe place, but the gate itself is not that safe. There were numerous raw metal edges on mine that my baby could easily cut herself on, especially that she chews on everything. I have a wood gate now and find that to be much safer. This gate is just not refined and not well made. I would highly advise against purchasing this for a baby.	
- 1	Funny Taste and Great Idea, Poor Quality Control are both spot on with their reviews. You can't help but to not taste something when it's for your baby and someone says there's a funny taste. Like with new baby clothes, this toy requires a washing before the baby can play with it. Out of the 4 blocks, 1 did not come in the shape of a block. The sides on that one block are shorter than the others. The positive comments are also spot on brightly colored, have little tags on the sides for little hands to grab, they crinkle, etc. At $8 before shipping, there's enough profit for better quality control. Clearly, the people at Bright Starts are not thinking from a parents perspective. I won't buy another of their products.	
1. 	I bought this because i couldn't find the spinner that had the flying butterflies. My 13 mo old daughter can get this spinning pretty fast. The balls are plastic inside and is a great cat distracter as well. She never tires of pushing down on the top.	
- 1	I liked the look and feel of the Bundle Me Lite, but unfortunately it didn't fit my Maxi Cosi Mico car seat.  Specifically, the elastic that affixes the Bundle Me to the car seat did not have enough stretch, which resulted in the fabric that sits in the seat being pulled too taut (so taut that the baby would be suspended by the fabric instead of sitting back in the seat).  Also, the pre-cut holes did not line up with the car seat straps.  I figured that I could make it work somehow, but after struggling for a good 20 minutes, I realized that the product just wouldn't work for my seat.Another reviewer had mentioned this problem, and I just assumed they were doing something wrong.  Don't be as stupid as me - if you have a Maxi Cosi Mico car seat, just buy a different product to keep your little one warm.	
- 1	This product broke during the first use.  I never made it out of my house before the plastic piece snapped into two. I purchased this after reading the wonderful reviews but I was sorely disappointed.  The metal hook bends and doesn't seem very sturdy but it's the plastic part that doesn't work well as a weight bearing device.  I now have to incur the cost of returning this item.	
1. 	These are exactly what we needed! They are light, absorbent, and cheap! My son is running through bibs - 3 a day at least - now that he's started solid foods and he's teething. We tried some of the more expensive ones, but we love these the most. They keep him clean and they feel so nice to wipe his face with after the meal.	
- 1	The large size of these wearable blankets is a nice idea in theory, but poor in practice. At the age where this size is appropriate (18-24 pounds), children are moving on their own (even in the crib), and the extra floppiness just gets in the way, while the enclosed feet just tended to frustrate my daughter. To make it worse, the opening to one sleeve of this garment was half the size of the other, and her arm didn't fit through properly without a few alterations (I shouldn't need a seam ripper and a sewing machine to get a product this expensive just to function).I can understand this company's products for newborns and younger infants. Swaddling makes sense when kids are that young. But as children approach a year, this product really isn't necessary or all that helpful. Or even made well, in the case of the one I received.	
1. 	These are great cups.  My toddler loves them and they appear to be a great quality.  I don't put them through the dishwasher becuase I am not sure if the print on the outside would come off.  Easy to drink from but doesn't spill easily.	
1. 	This fits on my Britax stroller perfect! When it's cold I throw it on and when it's hot I remove it! Very easy to change out and very soft and warm	
- 1	This is the second Levana video baby monitor I've owned.  The other, the BABYVIEW20, is pretty decent.  This one is the opposite.  The best thing I can say about it is that it handles interference well and has a nice receiver unit.We use a sound machine to provide white noise for our kids.  This monitor has a sound threshold so that it will be silent until there is sound.  Unfortunately, the white noise sets off the threshold so it's always pumping out the white noise, which wouldn't be so bad if the lowest volume setting on the monitor wasn't so darn loud.  The thing doesn't resample the baseline ambient sound, so the white noise always ticks off the mechanism.  It's super annoying, and strange since the BABYVIEW20, an older product from Levana, *does* resample the baseline.Next up is the horrendous base station that is permanently fixed to the camera.  It is NOT omni-directional at all.  When you turn the camera on the base, the angle moves up and down in a continuous wave.  THAT's how you adjust the angle of view... ya.  The peaks and valleys of the wave are not large enough to provide necessary versatility.  The base oddly has a slot for a screw to mount it to a wall.  However, you would have to mount the camera directly over your child's bed, which might be OK if the power cable wasn't so short.  On top of that, the camera easily twists in the base, which throws off the angle.  I found myself readjusting the camera every night, which is a frustrating process altogether.The receiver unit does actually have one advanced feature.  You can pair multiple cameras to it (up to 4 I think) and cycle through them.  The main selling point of the camera, the invisible infra-red LEDs, is actually true.  I guess some kids get scared of the red ring on other cameras?  I don't know, but this one doesn't have that ring at night.  However, my camera strangely sent a foggy night time image after only a day of use.  I tried cleaning the front with lens cleaner, and it helped a little bit, but was still foggy.I really cannot recommend this product.	
1. 	Love this! Protects the seat and it is easy to clean. I'd recommend this. Plus, I like the mesh holder in the front.	
1. 	I would highly recommend this product. We used it the most from when our baby was born to about 4 months of age. Now he's 6 months old and I really only put him in it to shower. He prefers sitting up on his own now or being in the Exersaucer, Jumperoo or swing. But it was a life saver for a long time. I never really used the toy bar on it. It's easier to take them in and out without it. And he was never very interested it it.	
- 1	We were very excited about a swing that would allow us to move the kiddo straight from the car or stroller (Graco Snugrider Stroller Frame) without taking him out of his Snugride 35.  However, we were sorely mistaken when we thought this swing would function as a, well, swing.  The motor isn't even REMOTELY powerful enough to keep the Snugride 35 moving.  Brand new batteries won't get it moving.  Even if you kick start the swing by giving it a push, it will NEVER continue to swing unless you put it on the highest setting (there is a turtle to rabbit scroll wheel that is pretty worthless).  Once below absolute bunny the swing slows to a stop in a matter of seconds.  Not only that, but the fast setting is pretty jerky... way too fast back-and-forth in my opinion.  The vibration setting works fine, and the nature sounds are OK.  Music is, as always, awful.  When will they let us load up our own MP3's into these things?!  Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone... even my baby enemies.	
1. 	I would probably make some without holes for arms.  The kids also throw arms around and wake themselves up.	
- 1	Don't buy this. It's not safe, can cut your seatbelt, and kill your child.You need to get a good install without this dangerous product.	
- 1	It arrived with a broken clasp and when I contacted the seller, they wouldn't do anything about it.  I didn't have the energy to send it back to amazon so i just made a knot and tried it out.  my one year old son wasn't really into it, and so it didn't function as as the teether i was hoping for.  cute though.	
- 1	This product was a gift and it is more trouble then its worth.  I only used it for about a month and it was such a pain.  I would rather just empty the trash can once a day then mess with this thing.  The odor was still present while using it and when I would open it to put a diaper in it the horrible stench would become even worse and would linger for hours.  It is now sitting in our garage until we can give it away.	
1. 	these are some beautiful blocks. We've only had them a couple of days so the baby's love for them is yet to be seen but the parents love them for sure. They are gorgeous, well made and should last awhile. I want to buy a few more sets, if only they were a bit cheaper, but definitely going to make great gifts for friend's babies!	
- 1	My husband and I both tried and tried - it was impossible.  Now it's become a chew toy without anything inside to chew.  Oh well.	
- 1	My daughter hated having her teeth brushed.  I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon.  I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger.  The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all.  Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway.  It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket.  Also, do know you can't pick color.  We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice.	
- 1	Aweful. my husband made this quick and cheap purchase without reading a single review and it lived upp to the dismal previous reviews. It was super loud on both channels no matter what we tried even on the lowest volume! We could NOT go to sleep with this thing on in our room even with a fan on to dull the noise, it was very loud and static-y without any noise from our daughter, simply a bad monitor. We are returning this tomorrow thanks to Amazon's easy return policy.	
- 1	This was a gift and so I never thought to look up reviews on it.  She absolutely loves it and it was one of her favorites until I took it away.  She has had her bottom teeth less than a month and today I noticed big scratches in the plastic paint stripes.  I rubbed with my finger and off came a stripe of green plastic chips!  That has been going in her MOUTH!  I am contacting the company and urge all parents to STAY AWAY from this product.	
- 1	its cute but after seeing a few other people use other products, i see that this one doesnt work well. It doesnt have the right holding space for a new born, its would prolly be ok for a child who was only bottle eating 3 or 4 times a day.	
- 1	I bought these because I could not find white in our local stores.  I have Safety First corners that have been in place at least 2 years with no issues.  First, these are really not white, they are off-white.  The bag has corners & the stickers included.  They are not on the corners, you place it yourself.  I did that and places it on the corners of my girls' new dresser.  I pressed them down & held them for about 45 seconds.  They are not solidly stuck, but move & sick cock-eyed.  I am constantly pressing them back in place.  They are protecting my kids' heads from the sharp dresser corner, but I would not recommend or by it again.	
1. 	After reading reviews for multiple swaddling products, I registered for this and multipleHALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Cream, Small. We tried using this with our daughter the first night home, but me being a new parent, and she being a newborn, she cried and I couldn't figure out how to get her wriggly body into it! Several weeks later, I was still intimidated by this, so we tried the Sleep Sack. She wriggled her hands out and woke herself, so I gave up on those. We swaddled her with theSwaddleDesigns Lightweight Marquisette Swaddling Blanket - Pastel Blue with Brown Mod Circles(until about week 8), which worked great, I thought.Then I tried this again - WOW!!! It is so much easier to get a tight swaddle with this! My daughter had still been waking up for feedings every 2-3 hours, but she started sleeping longer with this. Now at 13 weeks she wakes only twice, sleeping 5-7 hour stretches (and sometimes longer) at a time.As far as size, it's beginning to get a bit snug (she's probably about 23 long). She was able to wriggle her legs out at first, but she stopped being able to as she grew, and as I placed her lower in the wrap.Wrapping is really easy as well. The secret is making sure her arms are snugly to their side, and putting the arm wraps under her body. Also, pulling the outer flaps tight is important.	
1. 	this playpen is just way too adorable!  its colorful there lots of stuff to look at and touch, it has a mirror, crinkly, squeaker and a rattle on the inside my daughter loves this great buy!	
- 1	First off let me just start by saying that this item arrived very quickly but unfortunately arrived damaged.  Upon inspecting this item I also noticed that it is very poorly constructed.  I can't see anyone receiving this item undamaged.  It is made from pressed wood which feels almost like thick cardboard. I can't imagine anyone being able to keep this for years of use.  If it didn't arrive damaged, I'm sure my son, who is 1, would have this destroyed in a few days.  I would def. steer clear of this product.  I liked the idea that this was microfiber instead of painted wood which was what attracted me to it in the first place.  I hope I can find a similar but well-made product.  Not worth the $106 that is on the price tag.  More like a $25 product.	
- 1	Lids are very hard to close. By the time you finally tight the lid to the ice cubes all the liquid inside is spread over the kitchen counter.	
1. 	I have these on our stove, they work great, my kids will play w/ them every now and then, they are 1 and have not been able to open them yet.	
1. 	I bought this booster seat thinking I was still going to want a real highchair for my 18 month old. I starting using it while I shopped around for something better. Guess what? I never found anything better! I bought and returned several conventional highchairs from local stores. They were either too big, the tray was ridiculously huge, tray didn't snug up close enough (cannot overstate how important that is), etc. This booster seat is amazingly perfect.	
- 1	I was excited about getting this when I was early in my pregnancy and wasn't sleeping comfortably. I will say I was let down by this pillow. It made it even harder to get comfortable. However, after having my baby it was handy when younger kids wanted to hold her, or breastfeeding.	
- 1	Very stinks! Water flows!Pour difficult! Plastic toys inside, heavy and bad swim.  Thrown out money. My child played 5 minutes and more do not want to watch. It is poison! Because it is - then the child periodically go face him and licks is chemistry!	
1. 	I got this for Christmas 2011 for my almost 3 year old daughter.  She loved it immediately.  I found the stars and moon very peaceful to look at.  It seem perfectly bright to me and was easy to set up.  I highly recommend.	
1. 	I just purchased this today. My baby will be born on Dec. 30th and I have already put this together. It looks cuter in person than in the pictures. I like that u can add more Miracles & Milestones toys to it. I will have to do an update review once I get to actually use it. The mobile has a mirror on it so the baby can see herself. Cute colors too!	
- 1	I wanted this to work, so I could stop watching my baby breathe in the middle of the night, but unfortunately, I could never get it to work for my baby. It seemed too big to fit on his little diaper, which was surprising to me considering he was born on the larger side at about 9 pounds.	
- 1	It is not safe for baby cuz it comes off easily. Stay away from this product. Cant find a good cover tho. That was my second try and still nothing(((	
1. 	amazing product! originally bought a body pillow and found it too difficult to turn in bed and deal with bringing the pillow in and out from under the sheets to switch sides with me. Got this pillow and every night has been a wonderful nights sleep. I turn from side to side and have even been able to maneuver the pillow a little so I can lay on my stomach for a little while. it is quite big though, so i feel like my spouse is being pushed off the bed and it can be difficult putting the pillow case back on after washing but... I say IT'S A MUST BUY! If you are not sleeping comfortable, this pillow could be your sleep saver!	
- 1	I must have missed it in the description, but every piece is 100% polyester.  Who in the world would allow his/her child to sleep in polyester is beyond me.  Needless to say, I returned it.	
1. 	I have a 4 year old, and didn't think I would be needing a double stroller when I was pregnant with my now 6 month old. I quickly realized that shopping with 2 kids was quite the challenge! I saw this stroller one day when I was out running errands, and knew it would be perfect for my family. I didn't want a huge bulky tandem stroller, so this seemed ideal for my 4 year old to have a place to sit or stand when she was too tired to walk. It is a bit heavy to get in and out of the car, but it's manageable. The infant seat adapter works well with our Chicco Keyfit infant seat. I did order the parent organizer, which I highly recommend doing since there is not a built-in place for small things like your keys and phone. Overall, I would recommend this for anybody who is looking for a double stroller to use with their older child.	
- 1	Mine broke the first week I had it. (One of the inner flap's spring broke.) It does not contain odors very well.However, I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though.	
- 1	As a new mother, I wanted to get everything that would make the baby comfortable.  As the months go by, I realized that there are some things I could have done without... this is one of the things.  Quite frankly, I think it drys out the wipes, and only warms the first two on top.	
- 1	I've owned this carrier for eight months and I'm getting rid of it.  Based upon the positive reviews, it works for the majority but not me.  I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a carrier but based upon much research, I was convinced that this was the one.  After seven children, I've tried many carriers but cannot say that I have a favorite, yet.  Most carriers have cons and this one had way too many for me to continue to use.  First of all, from birth, I could never get my baby's face to stay up.  She always managed to turn inward no matter how I adjusted everything.  That made me nervous because I was afraid that she couldn't breath.  I had to support her head while in the sling with one arm which was very inconvenient and uncomfortable.  As my baby grew, I used this carrier less and now that she's 8 months, I can't bare to have her in this sling longer than 20 minutes.  I'm always adjusting it because it rides up my neck and all her weight baring down over one shoulder HURTS!  I don't see how anyone could carry a toddler in this thing.  The instructions make it seem so easy to pull the sling down a little over the opposite shoulder to tighten it, but it's not that easy.  It's versatile and I did like that I could nurse her while staying covered and multitasking, BUT that alone wasn't worth the price if I really couldn't use it long.  I toggled back and forth between this carrier and the Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier.  The Infantino carrier isn't really useful during the newborn stage, but once your child grows, it's much more supportive,  comfortable and cheaper.  I can't recommend spending so much money on a carrier that isn't comfortable after a few months.	
1. 	The yellow part vibrates once little gums/teeth chomp down on it. easy to hold on to, can easily hook (Via rings or carabiner) to a diaper bag etc. Both my kids loved it while teething.	
1. 	Green Sprouts makes some of the best, economical bibs I have found for my baby. We bought a package in anticipation of him entering daycare at 4 months, and recently ordered another as he starts to teethe. The terrycloth bibs were comparatively big when he was 16 weeks, but they are a good, generous size as he continues to grow. I found the lack of cutesy slogans or images very appealing. They go with all his outfits.These are well-constructed bibs that hold up well to frequent washing. He hasn't been able to pull them off and the velcro fasteners are strong. The colours stay bright and haven't run, always a fear with a solid dyed garment. Handwashing or using cold water should help their lifespan. I find the terrycloth soft and non-irritating to the touch, but still absorbent and tough enough for baby's fairly regular, low volume spit-up. Unless he's really having trouble, the bib gets most of the spit-up without his clothing underneath becoming damp and the wide yoke tends to catch most everything. The bright shades mean you'll visually see the stains, though, and only the yellow and pale green seem to hide them for any length of time.Baby and parents are both happy with these bibs, and they are not so heavy or thick as to be a problem layered under his outer garments, too.	
1. 	You can't live without one of these with a newbie! It saves from the shock of something cold on your babies tush! Think about it do you use something cold on your tush...so why should your baby!Make sure you stock up on replacement pillows...you will need them about every month or two! Highly recommend for all new parents to be!	
1. 	Much better than traditional style clippers for tiny fingers.  Very strong and sharp.  Seem very safe, and easy to use. Worth the few extra dollars.	
1. 	So far, these are the only training pants that I have tried that have worked for me to last through an accident and not leak all over the place.  For the reusable potty training pants out there, these are absorbant enough so it doesn't leak through, soft on the outside so it doesn't resemble a plastic bag on his bum, and allows for him to feel the wetness to realize that he's had an accident.	
- 1	I sent this back as soon as I received it, never even opened it. I ordered this because it had a forward facing option. I had not been able to find it in a store to check it out where I live. I went back home and found it in a boutique, tried it on. My son was doing the splits! Yes I did the adjustments for forward facing, I can't even imagine if I hadn't. The straps look comfy online, but when you have it in hand you can see and feel the quality is just not there (especially if you have both the Lillebaby and the Ergo to compare). Not to mention there are way more straps to complicate things, and who needs anymore complication with an infant?! I went back to my parents house and ordered the Ergo, had it shipped to them so that I could use it on our visit. Don't waste your time on this, just go for the Ergo, it sucks that there isn't a forward position, but it is certainly the best!	
1. 	This is a good bib - keeps mess away and easy to clean, just run it under warm water with some soap. Never had staining on them. But when we first started using it, our 6 mth old would often push his chin all the way down and bite it - we didn't snap it on tightly around his neck because it isn't comfortable. It took some time for him to get used to it.Update: After more than 2 months, our baby now leaves the bib alone and it now works great! Easy to clean too. There is some staining from certain food like squash, sweet potato, carrot etc though.	
1. 	Love this! Carried all the essential gear to change my little one on the go. Converts any bag into a diaper bag, husband was willing to carry it, detachable and washable pad was a nice feature, great shape to cover flip down diaper stations. Minus one star as I would reverse the net pocket and the zippered pocket, I have a long baby and would rest his head where the zippered pocket is, so I kept the diapers there so it was soft instead of a hard wipes container or ointment. We are more minimalist now so this lives in the car to turn the back of our station wagon into a change station.	
1. 	My daughter has a great time playing with these cups.  We have like 2 of the cups in each room for her to play with.  They are also great in the bathtub as she likes to scoop up the water but because they have holes the water drains out before she can try to drink it.	
- 1	I have Avent bottles that I am very happy with so naturally I purchased Avent sippy cups.  I was not impressed with these cups at all.  They do leak.  I specifically wanted a cup that had a lid so it could be put in a purse or bag.  This cup does have a lid, but the lid is hinged and stays on while the child is drinking.  My daughter was distracted by this and just wanted to play with the lid.  I wanted a lid that is removable.	
- 1	Overall, this high chair is quite functional and intuitive, but feels like they prioritized the wrong features to invest in.The recline does not add any value, in my opinion (granted I bought this after my kiddo had stopped taking a bottle) and just adds to the footprint to take up space in your kitchen.The quick-adjust height seems like overkill - you only really adjust the height at major milestones, so I'd rather have a chair that is harder to adjust once every 3 months than ugly molded plastic and extra levers that I have to look at every day.Pros:- easy to assemble- simple, intuitive mechanisms for adjusting the height, recline of chair, tray- affordable compared to some of the more aesthetically attractive optionsCons:- tray is not easily washable - I'm worried about water sitting inside the locking mechanism and getting moldy- aesthetic looks like a hospital walker or elevated toilet seat- huge footprint 21&#34; wide x 32&#34; deep (compared to the Stokke Trip Trapp which is 18&#34; wide and 19&#34; deep)	
- 1	I purchased this mattress because i wanted to avoid nasty flame retardants and the price, even though quite high, was still lower than most other organic crib mattresses. However, after 1 month of use we decided to return this product and amazon was great in refunding the full amount.Pros: fits well in the criborganic without natural flame retardant barrierCons: extremely heavy - my husband even had trouble changing the sheets since I couldn't do it at allvery soft - even though it says it is a firm mattress, it was giving in quite easily and. my 10lb baby made a dent in the middle  that wouldn't go away. After just one month!cover deformed - the waterproof cover seemed well made at first but after just one month use and the formation of the dent in the center the cover started to have folds(for lack of a better word)overall, I was very disappointed in this product. I am still looking for a reasonably priced mattress without FRs that will last. This is not it.	
1. 	Playtex Original Nurser Newborn Gift Set (Assorted Colors)is a great way to get started with introducing your baby to the bottle, especially if you are nursing. However, as your baby gets older, you will need bottles that hold more. This package of bottles is the perfect complement to the newborn package.The reason is that first of all, they're larger. Obviously, as your baby grows, you will need to feed him/her more, and these bottles make it really convenient because they're larger. They're also more sturdy than the newborn bottles, so you don't have to worry about them being easily damaged and causing accidents.If you buy the nursers, definitely buy these as an accessory. Then you'll have all the bottles you need.	
- 1	I really wanted this bottle to work, because a. it's stylish and b. it's glass which I would have much preferred over a plastic bottle. Alas, this bottle didn't really work for us. For one, it is difficult to get it leak proof, second it can get kind of heavy (he smaller version would have probably fixed that) and third, baby did not accept the nipple. it seems that the wider nipples on of the Tommee Tippee brand are just a lot closer in feel to the real thing.	
1. 	We got this for the upcoming arrival of our daughter.  But, the first time I used it was to clean the tub after my husband gave the dog a bath.  IT IS AWESOME!  It's very sturdy and has alot of padding.  I love the arm rest, it came loose a couple of times but a quick cleaning of the side of the tub and suction cups solved that.  I was worried when I read the other reviews of this product, but once I gave it a try I was hooked.  Our daughter and dog will never have a bath again without it.	
- 1	When I ordered this, I ordered the wrong brush.  This brush is for wide mouth bottles -- standard size bottles are TOO SMALL and this brush will be hard to get into, and out of the bottle if you force it. Also, these are notorious for falling apart easily so buy more than one if you need it. I just ended up using the dishwasher for all of my son's bottle accessories.	
1. 	We used this carrier recently on baby's first trip via airplane. It was great carrying him around in the airport and having my hands free for luggage and other stuff. The carrier is sturdy and comfortable. I was able to sit on the plane with him strapped in asleep, which was nice. We used the carrier with him facing him forward as well. The nice bonus with this carrier, and I suspect with other carriers, too, is that you don't have to take him out of it when you go through the metal detector at the airport security gate, since the carrier has no metal parts. This is especially wonderful if your baby is already asleep and you don't want to disturb him/her just to get through security.The only downside with the carrier that we've found is that it's pretty difficult to adjust it for various baby sizes. The carrier did not hurt my back at all, and I'm fairly petite with an average-size baby.	
1. 	I am very happy with this purchase. I am a SAHM and only pump once a day, if that, so this is all I really need. It is comfortable and easy to use and I am glad I went against friends opinions that I had to have an electric pump.	
- 1	I love how the only two five star reviews are from people who ordered it to give as a gift and have never even seen the toy in use!  Uh...does it help anyone to know that it looks like the picture?  We received this as a gift, from someone who thought it looked fun.  It does look fun.This toy doesn't work, and it never has worked for us.The idea is cute: fill up the cup on top, and it will trickle down causing the top section to whirl, the middle section the move little balls around, and the final section to spin.  On ours, only the penguin part works.  Our penguin stays up pretty well, so it can collapse if you want it to, but you can also watch the interior twirl.  It does twirl a little, kind of slowly.If you fill the middle section, it has trouble filling, and then it has trouble draining.  The balls do nothing.  It does rattle when empty, but...this is a bath toy that doesn't do anything special in the water.If you fill the bottom section, it drains out the bottom.  The thing in the middle does not spin.If you keep the pieces connected, on ours, the top twirls minimally.  Nothing else happens at all.  If you separate the pieces, the starfish part in the middle drains with a pattern.  Sometimes.  If the water doesn't get stuck.  The fish on bottom still does nothing.I think we're probably just going to throw this away.  If you're considering buying this (for your kiddo or as a gift) save your money or buy something else.  Anything else.  Worst Bath Toy Ever!	
1. 	I used this for both of my kids (16 months apart) and the wipes never dried out. This is great during the newborn phase when it is the middle of the night, they are drowsy and almost asleep but soiled their diaper during feeding and need a diaper change. Nothing wakes up a newborn like a cold wipe and the shriek screams that are amplified in a quiet home once they have awoken. I used this until they started to sleep through the night.	
1. 	I am embarrassed to admit how happy I am about this potty seat. We were using (without any luck) the Prince Lionheart weePod. The BB toilet trainer by comparison #1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet, long or round. I put a small black dot on the dial where it has the perfect fit, because with time, it does adjust ever so slightly, so I know exactly where it needs to be snug. #2 The entire base that sits on your toilet seat is lined with rubber so there's a no slip grip. No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable. #3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way. My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up, on & over the hump on the weePod. This may be a downside for boys, but is a bonus for girls. #4 You can hang it. I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that's where we hang it between uses. My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself. All key things in her independence. And there's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right. #5 This is completely personal reasoning, but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material (in my head) makes it seem more sanitary. Or maybe because its clean & white, idk. That being said, when I say hard plastic, it is not by all means uncomfortable. The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it. The weePod, for whatever reason, would cause her to lean back in the seat. My daughter loves this seat.  A+++ in everyway. Worth every penny!	
1. 	We bought this because once our baby was a toddler we no longer needed to bring along blankets, bottles, and all that baby stuff. I can easily fit 3 size 6 diapers and some wipes in one pouch and a thin (anything summery or PJS in winter) extra outfit in the other. The pad is extra nice and the clip makes this easy to attach to our old diaper bag, which now is full with baby sisters stuff! The front zipper area fits my wallet, keys, and phone when I go out with just my toddler.	
- 1	I bought this for my 8 month old but it is extremely narrow. She can barely fit when she is all the way on the backrest without feeling too crowded. Also the table doesn t easily fix so the only position I can make it stay it's the maximum so the baby is even more crowded. I wouldn t recommended this product	
- 1	The idea for the mamaroo is great and I was looking forward to using this product. However, there are many design flaws and overall I feel this product is just not worth the cost. I would not buy it again. I have the 2011 model. Here are the major flaws in my opinion:1) The seat does not really recline. The seat basically goes just from sitting all the way up to sitting slightly up. I wish the seat actually reclined more. The company states that the mamaroo reclines all along its axis but in reality the seat belt harness is attached to the axis in a fixed position and limits how the seat can be tilted. I found that even in the most reclined position, my 4 month old baby is still falling down in the mamaroo and ends up basically supported by the crotch harness since he is so upright.2) The safety crotch harness has many flaws. First, I don't understand why a 5-point system with shoulder harness was not included. Instead, the mamaroo comes only with a 3 point crotch harness. As I mentioned before, the baby ends up putting a lot of weight on this harness since the seat does not really recline. The harness has the hard plastic buckle inserts facing the baby and not the parent! I find this to be ridiculous. I have to struggle to snap in and unsnap the harness by reaching around to the inner part of the harness where I cannot even see the buckle. The hard plastic of the harness buckles press against my baby. The plastic buckles should face out towards the parent who has to use them, not the other way around. This design makes no sense to me. Since the seat doesn't really recline and since this means the baby puts a lot of their weight into the harness while sitting upright, it makes having the hard buckles on the inside even worse for the baby. I don't think the safety harness is comfortable for the baby, easy to use for the parent, or even secure (due to the lack of shoulder harness).3) The mamaroo does not come with any actual music. You have to use your own music via an ipod-- fine for someone who has an extra ipod to hook into the mamaroo but not so good if you don't have an ipod or an extra ipod.... The nature sounds that are built into the mamaroo are fine but unfortunately you can't scroll through them on the electronic display. Instead, you have to just flick a circular switch to go through all the nature sounds to find the one you want. I find that this can irritate or wake up a baby. I would prefer to see the sounds listed on the display in order to choose the sound I want quickly.4) The motions that the mamaroo makes are fine. They did not soothe my baby, however. My baby seemed to find the motions pleasant and amusing but they did not help my baby to sleep. Other regular swings have worked much better for helping my baby to fall asleep.5) Although my baby is still under the 25 pound weight limit for the mamaroo, I already find the mamaroo seat to be small for him.  In addition, the seat is made out of material that causes my baby to sweat. I usually have to place a cotton cloth behind my baby's head while he is in the mamaroo, otherwise the back of his head will get too sweaty. I wish the mamaroo came with a better fabric that was more comfortable for the baby.6) The mobile balls that hang over the baby tend to fall off constantly and end up on the floor. They are also not very interesting for the baby.Overall, I was shocked to find so many flaws with such an expensive product and especially one that is supposedly designed for and by moms.	
1. 	When I met with a lactation consultant, she recommended the 27 mm (large) breastshields and they do seem to be more comfortable.  The biggest advantage to the personal fit shields vs the softfit is that they can be cleaned in the microsteam bags (for whatever reason, the softfit that comes with the pump can't be cleaned in the medela microsteam bags...stupid).  The biggest disadvantage is that the shield isn't as soft/flexible as the standard shield that comes with the pump.  The other disadvantage is the price ($12 for a piece of plastic - really??).	
1. 	I love our wipe warmer!  I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!  If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!  The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.  I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.  The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.  And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.  But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.  I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.  You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.  It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.  Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.  But this is a minor issue.  I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.  This isn't a necessary item, but it's definitely something worthwhile to have!	
1. 	This item is basically a tougher version of those sip tie holders with the sticky backs. instead of sticky backs, you get two screws to screw the item into a wall. These work GREAT! For optimum safety, be sure to screw these into studs. Where studs aren't available, make sure to get yourself some good anchors. This has helped keep a shelving unit and a light fixture in place. My niece has tested these and she can tell you they hold items well. Just a note, be sure that the item you want to secure can either have screws screwed into it or has some kind of bar the zip ties can hold onto. Otherwise, this may not be the product for you. Quakehold makes a couple of Velcro based items that may help in situations described above.	
- 1	I bought this for my 9 month old. She immediately loved it. I love the soft supportive seat and we all know it's absolutely ADORABLE. However, and this is a BIG however, The bar on the back is situated in such a position that the baby's heels hit, and get stuck. I mean, my daughter screamed as soon as she moved forward because it cuts in to her acheles tendon! Aweful. I will be getting rid of this and opting for a Chicco walker instead. Such a shame. They really should have the seat centered instead of towards the rear. Awful Awful.	
1. 	I thought our daughter would get too warm in warm pajamas (fleece) and this fleece Halo. However, the Halo is just warm enough... it's pretty thin, but still warm. We only use Halo blankets. They're great.	
- 1	Nice bag for the price, cute but not too girly for a baby boy. Not the biggest diaper bag I have seen but I don't haul a lot of stuff around.I really liked this diaper bag when I got it, but only had it a month before the mesh that is part of the bottle holder on the side tore away from the top part where it is stitched to the edge, I was using the small 4oz skinny bottles, so I didn't do anything to make that happen.	
1. 	Nice quilted pad, and waterproof.  Be sure to dry on low heat, because of waterproof backing.  Fit nicely on my 3&#34; Dream on Me coil mattress.	
1. 	fun designs and washes up so easily. I was tired of treating stained bibs and washing them constantly in the washer, these are so easy to clean up. makes dinner and self feeding much easier!	
1. 	This is a good step stool. It helps my cautious 2 year old get into her queen size bed (no frame).	
1. 	So far, so good!  We've used  this several times for travel for my 2.5 year/old.  I wouldn't say she loves it, exactly (she would rather be sleeping in the big bed) but it's a great, convenient solution for a kid that has outgrown a pack n' play.  It comes with a sheet, which has washed well, and seems reasonably comfortable.  No bar in the center - that design flaw has been corrected.  Love it!	
1. 	I absolutely love this sheet! Changing my babies sheet is effortless, thanks to this great invention. Just snap one off and snap another one on- so convenient, especially for those middle of the night changes! A couple of my snaps have fallen off over time, but it's no big deal, and the sheet will still work- I highly recommed this sheet to anyone who has a baby!	
1. 	My son really likes this but it is so heavy that I won't put it on his car seat while driving. So I clip it on his play mat.	
- 1	Half of the safety items for children are cheaply made and don't do what they say, so this gets 5 stars. This keeps our 2 yr. old out of the refrigerator every single time. These Munchkin latches have strong adhesives on both sides and are connected by nice heavier plastic strap. To open you push both tabs on the side of the latches and it releases, simple. To put back on, they do need to be lined back up to snap on, but that's really not much. Takes adults a little while to remember that the door isn't coming open until its unlatched. Finally a child's safety item that works, but it will take wallpaper and varnish off when they are removed.	
- 1	This is a piece of garbage.  once you get it under the chair, you can't scoot the chair up to the table.  if you want to use it as a booster when needed it's very clumsy, spring loaded, breakable (cheap plastic breaks) and it's too much of a pain to put under the chair and take away.  so if you buy this, plan to use it as a permanent fixture under your chair, scooted all the way up to the table, because it is virtually un-moveable once you get it in place.  a real pain in the neck.  oh, and it's not portable. (as in, if you're traveling)  it's very big and bulky when folded and doesn't stay folded.  it's huge.  if you packed this on a carry-on (on an airplane) you wouldn't have much room for anything else, so it's not meant to be portable.  overall, it's a piece of junk.  Great concept though.  would be nice if it worked.	
- 1	We did a great deal of research before purchasing this item, and loved the small size and seemingly unique features.  The main issue with this swing is that it is too SLOW!  Babies like small, fast movements, and even on the highest setting, this swing is very slow. It seems like a baby would like the gentle and smooth movements, but our baby didn't love it. Also the different settings all seem too similar.  It does not vibrate either, which, for the price, I thought would've been a nice feature. We didn't have another swing to compare it to, so we just used it anyway, but ended up mainly rocking her in the glider and doing the 5 S's as Harvey Karp suggests (he's a genius, by the way).  I would just get a traditional swing next time....if this item would lower the price by about $100 it may be worth getting and trying, but definitely not at the current selling price.  I like how it plugs in and is small, that's about it.  Keep looking...	
1. 	The Sleep Sheep is now a necessity for sleep at our house.  The soothing sounds that the sheep produces effectively elliminates the noises that would potentially wake our baby allowing us to carry on normal routine household tasks while our baby sleeps.	
1. 	My friend wanted this for her son, so I bought it for her. We both love how many stuffed animals it can hold.  It really is quite impressive.  Plus the other mums in our play group always compliment it.I'm tempted to get one for my daughter's stuffed animals, but my hubs is reluctant to put holes in the wall.	
1. 	For the most part, I like this product. The first one I bought died after about 15 uses. The second one outlived my son's bottle use, and it worked great. You do have to shake the bottle to distribute the heat evenly and test it, but that's normal for any bottle warmer. Ours worked in about 10 minutes, but it depends on how warm your baby likes their bottle. For $10 I was happy with it.	
- 1	Pictures make this product seem to be made of a different material - but it is rubbery, flexible and bends with some pressure. It actually is a good texture for a baby to teeth on, so I'm not complaining, just stating that the picture makes it look like it is made out of a harder substance. It is very, very casual looking. I do like the rope part of the necklace, because I had originally chosen this over ChewBead Necklaces because I had read reviews that said your  hair could get caught in those, but a simple string wouldn't do that. The problem is the clasp... it is CHEAP. Cheap doesn't begin to describe it. It doesn't take any strength at all for my 5 month old to pull on it and for the clasp to release, so it never actually stays connected around my neck. The part of this necklace that was so appealing to me was that it wouldn't be a toy that constantly was falling on the ground... well.. not really, because the clasp isn't strong enough to match my 5 month old.If I had only paid a maximum of $5-8 for this product, I'd be more apt to give it 4 stars, but I cannot believe such a cheaply made product costs $18+!!!!  I recommend anyone that likes the idea or concept to simply buy a rope necklace with a strong clasp and connect it to your baby's already favorite teether.	
- 1	This is such a cute thing, though I don't really quite understand it's full purpose, except to spend money that isn't necessary. I thought it would be so cute, but without the special plunger on the spigot (we have a third knob for turning on the shower) it doesn't stay on and is completely useless.	
- 1	i order this because my LO eat her hand often. i decided to give her this but she cried because its so hard. before i gave it to my LO i boiled them for 2 minutes. the mirror broke, the teether with rubber melt. i guess it was my fault. but i used to boil everything i bought before i gave my daughter.	
- 1	It is really cute but you can't get your hand in and a snack back out.  It didn't improve with time/use.  My toddler couldn't use it at all	
1. 	So glad I bought this!  I flipped flopped about getting one of these.  I have a 8 month old and a 3 year old (2.5 years apart).  My 3 year old son is actually the size of a 5-6 year old as he weighs 41 lbs... and is almost 40 inches!  So as you can see, he's too young to expect to walk around everywhere while my baby is starting to get to big to have to carry her in a bjorn carrier.  And because of his measurements, most tandem strollers won't work for me... and then I came across this one where it's designed where he can fit!  He loves to ride in the back... sits most of the time and thinks it's so much fun and comfortable.  My daughter loves the front seat as well- very cozy and comfortable for her.  It was very easy to put together- took maybe 20 minutes, it's very sturdy... so kind of heavy (but what do you expect with a stroller built for 2??), folds up sooooooooo easily and actually flatter than I expected.  And unfolds easily as well.  I can actually unfold it while holding my daughter- not super easy, but can be done if need be!  This was easily one of the best buys we've made- I can go to more places now, both children are happy, I have freedom..... what a super situation!!  It's easy to maneuver as well... thought it would be more difficult.  I'm just excited I can go for walks again!!  And go to the malls:)  And go to theme parks:)  and etc.!!And the yellow color... I was afraid it would be so bright and neon and it really isn't.  It's a nice yellow, but not blinding- ha!  Also... I bought the parent organizer- definite must!  I also already had an attachable cup holder which I put on the bar for my son for his convenience as well.  Just wish the basket underneath was bigger... but I'm able to fit a small backpack under there along with a jacket or two of theirs if need be.Very very very happy with this product!!! Highly recommend:).	
- 1	I wish the tray was easier to put on.  It has to be put on when the baby is already in the chair.  Of course he wants to grab it when I'm trying to slide it in and I get nervous that I am going to pinch his fingers.  Plus you have to remove the pommel on the chair first.  It seems like it's easy to scratch his legs without the pommel.	
1. 	I have 2 of these covers and love them.  i put them in the wash at least 2x a week, and after 5 months they haven't even faded (i have a blue and a cream colored one)I throw them in the dryer regularly as well and have no problem fitting them back onto the changing pad - which is an issue with most covers.  I have no time to wait for these to airdry, so that was a must.Overall i'm very pleased.	
1. 	Very nice my baby girl love's them nice size for baby and safe for baby to play with toxic free love it.	
- 1	Man! This thing is huge. I thought it would be small and discrete but it's the size of my hand. I also bought the O-cal-ette cups and they seems to be the better choice of the two. I don't think I will be using this product...O-ca;-ette cups: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UKXLJK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc;=1	
- 1	Got this primarily for the suction plate since my 12 year old has decided that picking his plate up and letting the contents slide into his lap is great fun.  When it arrived I was disappointed that the spoon was all jaggedy at the end, where it's supposed to connect w/ baby's mouth so definitely not using that.  Both spoon and fork seem awfully cheap and clumsy-big but that's not why I bought the set.  I really wanted the suction plate and this one kinda works alright I guess.  Took my baby about 2 minutes to figure out how to lift the tab and un-suction it, twice, but I'm not sure if he's really figured it out or if he got lucky (twice).  The lip on the bowl is actually what kept everything from sliding into his lap, earning this product a whopping 2 stars.  I have nothing to compare it with since this is my first baby and first purchase of this sort, but I'm not terribly impressed.	
- 1	We were disappointed in these play yard panels. Compared to others we have, they were floppy and not secure when baby pulls himself up on them. We also noticed that the connectors where you latch one panel to another, are extremely difficult to hook together and not very sturdy. They absolutely stand well and if they were constructed a bit better, we would be very happy with them. We would not recommend these, but rather would recommend ones that are stronger.	
- 1	Melts all over the place. Very messy.	
1. 	Our newborn is a very active kid, and no matter how tightly we cover him with blankets he manages to quickly free himself from those. In that regard this wearable blanket is a godsend. It has helped keep our boy warm and secure, and it has no chance of getting crumpled up and becoming potentially dangerous. It adds and extra step to our diaper changing routine, though, but that's a small price to pay for the peace of mind we have when getting him to wear this blanket. The cotton material feels soft, and it was easy to wash. Overall, we are very happy with this product and would recommend it to other parents of the newborns.	
- 1	I bought these before I started to diaper my son, thinking pins were intimidating.  I got pins as well.  In theory these are a great idea, but I found they gave a super tight fit and didn't hold the layers together well - like the inner portion of the diaper kept slipping.  They worked well enough when my kids were super tiny and in newborn sized prefolds (which you CAN just lay in a wrap but I don't care for that method, though my husband did, which drove me nuts as I would then find myself snappi-less or pin-less out in public when changing a diaper LOL) - since newborns don't move around much, the snappi tended to stay in place.  By by and large I prefer my prefolds pinned.  It's really not hard at all once you do it for the first time - pinch the dipe away fropm the baby, slide the pin through your hair to make it slippery, and pin.  You get a more generous fit and a more secure hold, and there's just nothing cuter than a good old fashioned pinned diaper on a naked baby waddling around.  A snappi'd diaper just looks odd in my opinion.We use these now to hold diapers on my girls' baby dolls.  :-)  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy them, though they did serve some use early on.  .	
- 1	I have been cloth diapering my fifth daughter since she was three weeks old.  She is now seven months old.  Thus far, i have only used grovia aio's, gerber flats and these osocozy flats.  My favorite of the three is the gerber flats.  These osocozy flats are absorbent but they are a difficult size for me to fold.  I can't do the origami fold b/c of their very nonsquare shape.  Kite fold is out too b/c of their shape.  I prefer to fold them into a prefold style.  My biggest issue with these flats is the big honkin' hem on two edges.  Okay, so it isn't such a big honkin' hem...but it is big enough to be uncomfortable, i think.  PLUS, the edges that are not hemmed wrinkle up after laundering.  I line dry and THEY STILL WRINKLE.  Grrr!  Gerber flats are serged on the edges.  Gerber flats are easier to fold.  Yeah, they're smaller.  But, i just stuff 'em with the doublers that came with my grovia aio's and, voila...a perfect diaper!	
1. 	I really love this bouncer!! It is perfect!! I love that my baby can sleep away in it.  No problems here at all!! Love the music and massage with vibration.  I wish they had one in my size,  LOL!	
1. 	My baby loves to sit in our lap so she can watch everything going on around her. The only problem with that is we have things to do around the house and she hates for us to lay her down. I saw this seat on Amazon and decided to try it out. It works perfectly for her. we had to put a blanket behind her in order to have a bit more support as my baby is only three months but she loves it. She sits there and laughs as she watches us cook, clean and do what needs to be done around the house. We DO NOT leave her unsupervised in it though. Just like anything else you have to keep a close eye on your baby while he/she is in any kind of seat, jumper,etc... It really is a great product and I'm so glad we bought it.	
- 1	This is such a cute thing, though I don't really quite understand it's full purpose, except to spend money that isn't necessary. I thought it would be so cute, but without the special plunger on the spigot (we have a third knob for turning on the shower) it doesn't stay on and is completely useless.	
1. 	My three month old loves to look at this mobile. She's entranced by the graphic colors and the baby face image. The cards are a little hard to switch around. But it's a great item. Other products from this line are also a big hit.	
1. 	i purchased this exersaucer for my 4 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has different height adjustments which is a must since she is already 25 inches. She is very comfortable in this exersaucer. After doing extensive research I originally was going to buy a different model but I took my daughter to the store and she hated my 1st choice.  This one she started playing with right away.  It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the directions were easy to read and assembly wasn't hard at all.  Money well spent!!!!!!	
- 1	I honestly think that this made no difference with the wipes. I still had issues pulling the wipes out and often times they would tear before I even got them out. Needless to say I returned it.	
- 1	I washed this book in cold water in our washer on delicate cycle. Not to label directions. Who makes a cloth book that you can't wash thoroughly, that your child will drool, chew and drop on the ground? I was appalled to see how faded the book became once it air dried. My child was sucking on the corner of that book. How much dye was she ingesting? What other substances/chemicals were in the books pages? I am not pleased with this and will not buy Manhattan Toy cloth books in the future.	
- 1	The bottles looked cute, but are very cumbersome.1.  Bottle is too wide and big for steamer machines.2.  Bottom part is really soft and tends to tip over.3.  The nipple causes baby to takes in air somehow and she screams in pain.4.  Expensive	
- 1	I don't know if I should have forked out the money for a full sized Sophie to experience the magic but this little guy does nothing for my son.	
1. 	I am happy i got these, they are sturdy, good quality, easy to use and wash. very practical when breastfeeding but want to have a supply.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor after my Summer Infant Slim & Secure that I had been using daily for 3 years stopped working. It is terrible. The reception is insanely bad. My daughter's room is 20 meters away from mine and I will get a no signal beep at least three times a night. Also, this will absolutely not work in my bathroom, which is an additional 5 meters away. An additional con is that the infrared and &#34;on&#34; lights are very bright.I am a fan of Avent products and purchased this monitor due to my confidence in the brand. I am incredibly dissapointed. I have already purchased another Summer Infant monitor to replace this one.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product but I couldn't. It's bulky since the ice pack is built into the cooler. Like other reviewer says, you have to put this whole thing in the freeze. So, it's big and cumbersome (can not fit into a diaper bag really) and holds very little. Good concept since it does stay cold for a long time but just not efficient.	
- 1	This is another one of those adorable kid things that should come with an advisory: the design of this product is wholly dependent on it being used on a spout with a shower diverter. Of course, our spout doesn't have one so this little whale was doomed from the start. I wish I had realized the issue before I had thrown out the packaging because I would definitely have returned it. Even after we swapped out the flippers for a sturdy zip tie this little whale wouldn't stay put! I'm giving it 2 stars because it's very cute, isn't a merchandiser character and I am pretty sure if you have the right kind of faucet it will work just fine.	
1. 	I was comparing this to Stokke Tripp Trapp, but this won in the end. It is fantastic! Beautiful design, solid wood. I love that it grows with the child (also so does Stokke). You can adjust everything continously, and I mean EVERYTHING, the seat width, height, the safety guard (with Stokke you can't adjust safety guard) And the biggest difference is, that this comes with a tray and a plastic tray cover, a HUGE plus! For me, tray is a must. But it comes of easily if you don't like it, and also stores at the back of the seat if you want to use it just ocasionally. Our daughter was able to join us to watch meal times starting at 4 month. I was able to adjust the seat small enough, and she could use the tray as extra support with her hands. I like the design better than Stokke's. The color options are more limited with this one, but they have a nice variety of seat covers. And even if I would have bought Stokke, I would have selected something neutral.If we have a second child, we'll be buying a second Svan, it is the best high chair out there!	
- 1	We bought a variety of cloth diapers to use with our newborn. We are not new to cloth diapering as we diapered our oldest in cloth until she potty trained. We used the one size Fuzzibunz for my oldest without any problems. However, we didn't start until she was 10 weeks. We bought this diaper to try and did not like it. The insert was difficult to get in. It leaked almost every time we used it. And my daughter seemed to outgrow it by one month old at 10 lbs. It was, however, soft. I would not purchase this again for a newborn.	
1. 	We bought this for our baby son but ended up using it in our room too!  It is so calming and beautiful to have the stars on the ceiling.  The timer feature is great so you can sleep with it on and it goes off within a set time.  It is a great way to get up and feed and change the baby without waking up the other person because you have to turn the lights on too.	
1. 	We use this on a daily basis to transport bottles back and forth to daycare.  Works exactly how I needed it to.  Haven't tested the time it will keep bottles cold since we have a short drive to daycare, but it withstanding wear and tear well.	
- 1	I really wanted to love this bottle.  There aren't a ton of choices out there in stainless steel, and this is the cutest of all the options I've seen.  The bottle itself is okay -- it could be better, but it gets the job done.BUT...- The paint chipped pretty quickly/easily, and I found green flecks on my baby's lips!!!  So if you go with this bottle, I highly suggest getting the plain silver finish instead of the fun colors.- The nipple ring sliced my hand open.  If you look closely at the ring in the picture, you can see how the bottom edge curls up and inward.  Well, it doesn't curl inward enough, and that inside edge is kind of sharp.  I screwed it on a little too tight, and sliced my hand open trying to unscrew it.  Now, I was exerting a lot of pressure (far more than a baby would be able to), so I don't think it's dangerous for the kiddos, but I'm a lot more cautious when I put this thing together now.- The volume markings could be better.  Since you can't see through these bottles like you can glass, not having every ounce marked on the inside makes filling them a guessing game.  The 5oz bottle, for example, only has markings for 2 and 3 oz.  That said, a lot of the stainless steel bottles out there don't have ANY markings, so it's better than nothing.- The nipples/spouts are wicked fast.  The level 1 that came with the bottle is comparable to the level 3 nipples from all the other brands I tried.  The sippy-cup transition spout is NOT a sippy cup -- it's just a soft (pliable as a silicone nipple) spout shaped like a sippy cup.  Both the sippy spout and the level 1 nipples will drip (quickly and steadily) without any suction whatsoever.  My daughter (now 8 months) won't touch this with the sippy spout on.  The sizing is standard (wide-mouth), so it's easy to buy replacement parts...but should you have to??- The cap is a soft, fold-on/peel-off deal that is pretty annoying, difficult to put on, and gets dirty easily.  I'd much prefer a cap that is more rigid (so it stays on and keeps the nipple or spout from leaking) and snaps on/off.  Kleen Kanteen manages to do it, so I don't know why Pura can't.All in all, this is a good bottle if you avoid the painted finishes, replace the nipple/spout with another brand, are careful with the sharp edge on the ring, and don't mind not having a decent lid.  Seems like a lot of trouble to have to go to for the price, though.	
- 1	This cup would be great, except for the fact it is so hard to clean all the little parts, and then to put it back together.  It definitely wasn't worth the money. I've since purchased other brands with straws that are much easier to clean and easier for my child to use.	
- 1	I have tried soooo many sippy cups for my one year old twins, these leak terribly!  I will be sticking to the NUK brand, they don't leak!	
1. 	LOVE this crib.  It's the perfect size and my little girl is just turning two and still loves it.  We're so glad we purchased it for her crib.	
- 1	First of all, this thing dries out wipes, even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy... forget getting Chubbs in its round container, for instance. The little storage area is a nice idea, but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive. Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers, which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub. These take up far less room and are much easier to clean, too. This one? You'll be continuously wiping it down, when it hasn't fallen over, that is.	
- 1	My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.	
- 1	With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young.  These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon.  Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth.	
- 1	They weren't functional. They didn't bend they did fit a larger cord (power strip) and you'd have to secure it to the wall. But the part of the cord coming out of the wall is still exposed. They just didn't work for us at all as a baby proof hire hider.	
1. 	Cute. Wasn't the material I was expecting it to be. It's more fabric ish than plastic, so I'm not too sure how waterproof it really is but it serves its purpose at preK I guess!	
1. 	I did a lot of research on different bottle brands while pregnant, and settled on the Playtex nursers as our first try.  While I planned to breastfeed our baby, I knew I would be returning to work when s/he was only a few months old and the baby would need to take bottles of expressed breast milk at daycare.  The Playtex nursers were recommended online for breastfed babies due to the collapsing liner and the wide nipple.  I also consideredDr. Brown's,Avent, andBreastflowbottles but decided against Avent due to reports of frequent leaks.  I crossed Breastflow and Dr. Brown's off the list because I knew I'd be washing pump parts every evening after returning to work, and didn't want to add to my workload with a complicated bottle assembly to clean as well.I had our baby in August 2010 and began breastfeeding.  We waited until she was 4 weeks old to introduce a bottle, but she took to it quickly with no issues going between breast and bottle.  She started daycare at 2 months and she has gotten 3 bottles of expressed milk each weekday since then, with an occasional bottle of milk given by my husband or a sitter.  She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months, when we introduced complimentary solids, and she continues to nurse now.  We do not feed bottles when she and I are together and in fact will not accept a bottle if I'm around.Likes~ No difficulty transitioning between breast and bottle, due to the wide nipple base and collapsing liner~ It's easy to find the drop-ins (including store brand liners that fit the nursers) in any store~ No leaks!~ Inexpensive~ Minimal washing is necessary if you're careful (just the nipples; we reuse the rings and caps unless there's a need to wash them)~ Using thePlaytex Drop-Ins System - Breast Milk Storage Kit, I'm able to keep extra milk in the daycare freezer - all her caregivers need to do is thaw the drop-in of milk, and put it into one of her nursers, and it's ready to feed.  They have only had to use backup milk once but they said it was very easy and they appreciated that they didn't have to worry about spilling the milk while pouring it into a bottle.Dislikes~ The drop-ins are not environmentally friendly since they're disposable. I struggle with this because we try to live a more green lifestyle but at the same time I enjoy the convenience of using this feeding system.~ The plastic nursers themselves have gotten a bit etched looking after nearly 8 months of daily use. This is just cosmetic in nature and does not affect function in any way.She's never gotten formula so I can't relate any experiences with smell in the trash from the liners, or from formula sticking to the drop-ins.  However I have a friend whose babies were formula fed and she used the Playtex nursers with no problems.	
- 1	I bought this as a second sound machine for my 1 year old for my parents house and it is a piece of garbage.  It only has 5-6 white noise sounds and most of them are strange and jarring.  There is one that sounds like rain which is the only one that is not horrible sounding.  It is also not very loud.  There on button has a blue light that is super bright and is annoying but you can't turn it off.  I am sending it back.  I bought the MyBaby by Homedics SoundSpa - Sleepy Snail for my own house and I love it.	
1. 	I got this extention with my playyard because i didnt feel the playyard itself would be big enough for my daughter to crawl freely around and really explore anymore than her pack n play did. plus, i wanted to be able to sit with her and play with her while she could freely move around. with this extension, we have PLENTY of room for BOTH of us and her toys...my 50lb hound dog even joined us at one point! the playyard itself was enough for the two of us, but barely. i definitely recommend getting this extention with the playyard.i can see where it would also allow room for puppies to roam around and even have the mama dog there, too! VERY nice!	
1. 	I must admit that in the past I haven't had the best luck with products containing miracle in their name. However, this blanket is the shining exception!Our son was a very big boy -- 10 lb, 6 oz of joy. We had read Harvey Karp's The Happiest Baby on the Block (highly recommended) and we knew we wanted to swaddle him. We had planned to use a receiving blanket, but we quickly found out that none of them were remotely big enough. Not even close. We spent a ton of money buying bigger blankets, and we tried two other expensive swaddling blankets as well. Nothing worked, nothing held the baby, and all three of us were desperate to get some sleep. We even bought a cheap sheet set and tore it up to get some bigger patches of cloth. No dice.Finally, I ordered this blanket online (Amazon didn't carry it at the time, alas.) BINGO -- our son slept through the night at once! Yes! We had to wake him from a sound, swaddled sleep to change and feed him; he went back down like a rock as soon as we re-swaddled him. He loved this blanket. When he saw us coming with it, he'd try to lie quietly with his arms in his sides in anticipation of the (very simple) process of swaddling him up. And I loved the fact that this blanket was so soft and comforting and had no snaps or any other fasteners that could rub him.I should mention that the two new parents I gave this to as a shower gift were pathetically grateful, and couldn't stop gushing. I understand; for a new parent, anything that grants you sleep is your favorite thing in the world.A note to parents considering this blanket: Be prepared for some of your friends (especially the childless ones) to recoil in horror at the thought of swaddling. You're tying your baby up? What if he suffocates? But he won't be able to move! It's cruel!, etc., etc. These people probably mean well, but their comments are very ignorant. The fact is, your baby has just spent months in the most confined space imaginable -- a womb where he could barely budge at all. And new parents will immediately notice that newborn babies have virtually no control over their newly freed arms -- they'll startle themselves from sleep time and again, then start flailing their hands around and scratching their faces raw. Newborns don't have the neurological control to stop themselves from flailing, so they love it when you return them to the safe, warm, familiar confinement they remember from the womb.Another comment you'll hear from some people is, How do you know when the baby doesn't need to be swaddled any more? Easy. They start to wriggle out of the swaddling. They may not be able to talk, but they'll let you know clearly when they're ready to move on.	
- 1	I purchased this seat when my baby outgrew his Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat.  I bought this seat because it is rated #1 on Consumer Reports and it has the highest rating in the crash test category.  Early on, I thought it was much harder to tighten and loosen the straps compared to the Chicco Keyfit.  But the real problem (and reason I returned this seat) was that my baby was so uncomfortable in it.  Almost immediately, he cried a lot in this seat, which he never did in the Keyfit.  I exchanged this car seat for a Britax Marathon 70, which tightens and loosens much more easily (and similiarly to the Keyfit).  My baby hasn't cried in the Britax seat since he's been in it.  While the Evenflo Triumph car seat is highly rated and well priced, I would not recommend it because it is hard to adjust and most of all, my baby was so unhappy in it.	
- 1	So while I loved these spoons the first time I used them (after hand-washing them out of the package), once I used them to feed my little one and then cleaned them in the dishwasher, they warped. I thought that it was because I had put the two spoons I used in the utensil rack of my dishwasher (on the bottom shelf), until I used the other two new spoons and put those on the top rack, because they also warped. And not a little, but a LOT. The spoon part (where the food rests) melted, and the handles became twisted and bent. So disappointed because these really worked great otherwise. I am debating whether I should get another set and just hand-wash them, but then I'll have to be vigilant about it (as will my husband) and with a little one, it's hard to remember small details like that.I am also annoyed that it doesn't say on the package that these are hand wash (and no, I don't have a super duty dishwasher, or a heat sterilizing one - in fact, it pretty much doesn't clean my dishes at all - just dries them after I wash them in the sink and put them in there). I would call it a dishdryer instead of a dishwasher at this point. :)	
- 1	The magnet works, the adhesive works.  The locking mechanism does not work.  My cabinet opened and closed without the lock ever latching correctly.  I read all the instructions and tried placing the latch on my cabinet a few different times, but could not get it to work.	
- 1	Didn't fit my Mama and Papa's stroller :( I wish they would have listed the strollers this tray would fit. This way I wouldn't have wasted my time ordering it.	
1. 	This is a wonderful product for nursing.  It fits a lot better around you than the Boppy. It is also more comfortable when sitting in a chair with arm rests.  However, after you are done nursing or when your baby out-grows it, you will not have much use for it.  The Boppy on the other hand can be used for tummy-time and to help them sit up.However, as a nursing pillow, this is your best choice.	
- 1	Overpriced and falls apart... WASTE of money, drawers do not stay on track at all.. Very small for it to be almost $200	
1. 	My son loves the Woombie.  My daughter loved the Miracle Blanket.  As a parent that has now used two of the most popular baby swaddlers, here are some pros and cons of each.Woombie - We used the Houdini woombie in pool party and in vanilla crea (have one of each) and one Original Woombie in Raspberry color.Pros:Allows the hands to be across the chest or up near the face - this was the main reason my son hated the Miracle Blanket and loves the WoombieSnug - I haven't really noticed a difference between the Original and the Houdini versions although the Houdini is supposed to be a slightly firmer swaddle.  Both are snug.Nice colors - All the colors we have are nice.  None have faded or bled in the wash.Cons:The Big Baby and Mega Baby sizes are too long.  There is so much excess fabric that hangs down.  My two year old can still fit in the Mega Baby size, lengthwise, because it is sooo long.Does stretch out after many uses.  You can fix that by tossing in the washer and then tumble dry.  (It says line dry but who has time for that?  We've always tumbled dry with no problems.)Fingers can creep out the top and scratch the face.  He's never managed to get anything more than his fingers out, but just a warning that it can happen.**Biggest con - You have to keep buying bigger sizes if you want to continue to use it as they grow.  If you buy two in each size (so that you'll always have one handy if one is in the wash), then that's over one hundred dollars in swaddle blankets.  Yikes!!**Hard to use if you need to put baby someplace with straps - like a bouncy seat or swingTerrible return policy from Woombie - only unused and unwashed are accepted for returns with a 15% restocking fee!!The Miracle Blanket - We have two - one in pink and one in blue.  We used these with my daughter until she rolled over from back to front, at about eight/nine months old.Pros:Fits any size baby.  It's a super long wrap, so there's no way that your baby will ever be too big to fit width-wise.  Lengthwise our daughter outgrew it around four months.  Then we just stopped putting her feet in the pouch but keep wrapping her arms.  Still worked great!!  Also if you leave the feet out, it's easy to put the baby someplace with a three point harness like a bouncy seat or a swing.Can only purchase two and lasts until you need to stop swaddling!Colors are nice - never faded or bled in wash.**Best pro** - Miracle Blanket has amazing customer service.  One of ours got a hole in it after three months of use.  Miracle Blanket replaced it free of charge, not even charging for shipping the new blanket or return shipping.  Doesn't matter where you bought it - they will replace it for you and fix the old one and donate to kids in need.  AWESOME!Cons:Learning curve - Babysitters and grandma had an extremely hard time learning how to use this.  The first time, despite a demonstration before we left, our babysitter put it on our daughter upside down so that the foot pouch was like a little hood!The blanket has a weakness where the foot pouch is sewn onto the main piece.  After much use, it develops a hole from being pulled on by baby kicking or moving the feet in and out of the pouch.  Both our blankets developed one.  We had Miracle Blanket replace one, but decided to just keep going with the other one.  The hole never got bigger that the radius of a straw but it's definitely a weakness in the fabric.Hands are down by the side - This was what our daughter liked, but our son hated it, so I guess it could be a pro or a con.Overall, I would recommend either.  You just have to think about what your baby likes.  I think the Miracle Blanket is better for a baby who really needs a firm swaddle with very little movement.  The Woombie is for babies who like their hands up.  Our daughter, who required a firm swaddle, just couldn't handle the amount of movement the Woombie allowed.  She needed much more restriction.  Our son prefers the freedom to arrange his arms around his chest or thighs as he likes.  If you want to try one, start with the Miracle Blanket first since their return policy is better.  If Woombie would change theirs, I would equally recommend them.	
- 1	We wanted to use this as a crib for our baby's first months when he was sleeping in our room. We also wanted to use it for travel. Unfortunately the mattress is really flimsy and doesn't lay flat. Also the bassinet doesn't have adequate support frame so it really sags in the middle. I try to lay my baby in it longways and he ends up perpendicular as he gradually slides down into the divot. It seems like there is a propensity for the baby to roll over because of this sag/slant. We put a giant piece of cardboard under the mattress as a support and this helps some but it still sags in the middle gradually as the cardboard starts to give.My mom also bought a Graco pack n play for when we are visiting and it has a simliar issue even though it is a more expensive model. Apparently Graco doesn't make them like they used to. My mother in law has an old Graco pack n play and it has an awesome bassinet that doesn't sag at all.We are looking to buy a new pack n play as the sag is so bothersome to us.	
- 1	I am shocked at how many good reviews there are.  I even tried to go through the good reviews to make sure I'm not missing something in terms of adjustments, but that does not appear to be the case.  We have a Summer Baby montior, and it is infinitely better, so this truly is just a poor product versus competitors.Here are the issues:1) There is a ring of red lights around the camera.  We had the camera installed over the crib, which meant my son just kept on staring at it.2) The video quality at night is poor.  Not a deal killer, but compared to the Summer monitor, definitely unacceptable.3) The sound is TERRIBLE.  If we had the sound turned over 3 bars, a buzz starts going on and off, on and off.  I'd be okay if it's just a constant buzz like white noisy, but it's sporatic, making it impossible for us to sleep.  There's a humidifier in the baby's room, so maybe that's causing the monitor to go nuts, but whatever it is, it's very annoying.4) The deal killer: for all the annoy sound problems we had, I was still too lazy to return the product.  However, a week ago, my son started coughing up a storm in the middle of the night.  BUT THE MONITOR HAD GONE INTO NIGHT MODE AND DIDN'T WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We only heard the cough through the walls.  By this time, he had coughed for so long he was chocking and throwning up in the crib.  We immediately took him to the emergency room.THIS PIECE OF JUNK IS GOING BACK TO AMAZON.  DO NOT BUY!	
1. 	Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option.	
- 1	Break off the doors. Kids just ripped them off with in hours of them being installed. A 2 and 3 year old. Sad. And only one key??	
- 1	Somehow missed the memo that not all Boppys are created equal.  Apparently I have the &#34;nursing pillow&#34; and this cover does not fit.  Since it's clear on the packaging, after the cover arrived, I checked the description to make sure I wasn't crazy.  While it says, &#34;Cottony cute slipcover designed to fit any Boppy Feeding and Infant support pillow (sold separately)&#34;, I guess the nursing pillow (which is more square, has a detachable strap, and a rubbery insert) doesn't count.  To my disappointment, Boppy doesn't make covers for that pillow.	
1. 	I purchased this set predominately for the pump parts so I wouldnt have to contstantly clean and pack and unpack and clean the one set I had between work and home.  I like the fact that the 'cone' section is not a separate piece... one less thing to take apart and clean.  The extra 4 bottles are good to have and I look forward to using the steam bags when I am on the run or traveling (havent used them yet).  The price cant be beat... so much cheaper than buying individual pieces.	
1. 	First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.	
1. 	He can stare at it for a very long time.  He is mesmerized and it keeps him calm.  I wish I had found this sooner!	
- 1	I bought this for $23.50, thank goodness I didn't spend a penny more! I hate this monitor. After using it for a few months, I went back to using my 8-year old trusty ol' Fisher Price old-school analog model.Pros:-Inexpensive (when I bought it)-Two-way walkie talkie feature is useful for older kids-Two parent monitorsCons:-Horrible reception (cuts out, notice this mostly when baby is crying loudly), one of the parent units randomly turns itself off-Connection drops frequently, even though monitors are placed quite close to the base. Often turn the parent unit off & back on to discover that the kid is actually awake, even though there was no indication that the unit wasn't receiving a signal.-Incessant beeping & clicking. Picture this: Middle of the night. Parents already suffering from lack of sleep. Units start beeping for no apparent reason. Daddy starts swearing. Mommy rushes to quiet the now-awakened baby. Not good.-Volume setting is way too quiet. Thank goodness my son isn't a fussy baby, there have been many times where I'll walk past his room and hear him awake, even though I couldn't hear a thing through the monitor.-Range is terrible in my house (split level) - can't take parent units downstairs or into the garage, neither of which are very far from the child unit. Not useful at all.Don't. Just, don't.	
- 1	This seat was fine when I was able to carry it around when my baby was small enough. Now that he is much bigger, and the damn thing is impossible to pick up without bursting a few blood vessels and developing a hemorrhoid, I find I have to leave it in the car.In principle this is fine, BUT... trying to tighten the straps while the child is in the seat is nigh on impossible. It takes me about 15 minutes every single time. By the time I am done, I have a screaming baby and a shirt drenched in sweat from the sheer exertion of wrangling this beast.The main issue is that in order to tighten the straps, you have to pull outwards on them. The issue with that is that when the seat is installed in the base in the car, you cannot pull outwards because the back of the seat of the car is in the way.The straps are also very short, so when you loosen them and try to take your child's arms out you have to contort and bend them into some very unnatural positions. And loosening them isn't fun either. You have to dig your fingers into a small hole, which is positioned at the very point on the seat where a child's kicking feet are most likely to get in your way.And finally, my final rant of disapproval is that when you install this thing without the base it is the most frustrating and time consuming part of it all. The lap belt fits OVER the child's legs and actually constricts them. You cannot take the child out without undoing the whole system which is tough because as you unbuckle the belt, the seatbelt retracts inwards and locks, meaning if you don't catch it in time you can't remove the seat without GREAT difficult.Please do not buy this. You will not be happy. If you are even considering it - picture yourself with sweat pouring down your face as you wrestle with the straps and your baby cries and screams and kicks and see if that mental image changes your mind.	
- 1	This bath tub is too small for my 14 month old baby.I would not recommend to buy this.I just returned mine.	
- 1	I hate stuffing these. Seriously, save your money for better quality, made is USA diapers. And I'm now ashamed I own alva diapers. The one print is copied from bumgenius, Lovelace pattern. Companies like this should not be supported and be put out of business.	
1. 	This is a perfect assortment for a baby who is just learning to grab onto toys and move them around.  The set provides plenty of variety of sounds, textures, and colors.  The pieces are all fairly small so they are easy for small, uncoordinated hands to grasp.  My 4-5 month old daughter loves this set, particularly the large ring with smaller rings on it.  Every piece ends up in her mouth, so it's great that these are easy to clean as well.	
- 1	I bought this primarily for the slip resistance and because it is BPA-free. Unfortunately, the slip resistance is all but nonexistent. The rim around the bottom of the plate has the equivalent of a rubber band to keep it from skidding. I suppose it does offer a tiny bit of resistance, but I'd say it is maybe 10% less likely to be thrown on the floor than any other lightweight plastic plate. It is extremely light, just like any cheap plastic baby plate.We have been using it for our baby anyway, and she does seem to like the added scoopability with this plate, as it is a bit easier to grab things from the rounded compartments. Unless your child has a lot of trouble picking things up from any other plate or bowl, though, I see no reason to buy this plate.Edited two years later: We've discovered a much better use for these plates! They are a perfect paint tray for my children while they are sitting at the table and painting on paper. With a blob of paint in each compartment, and with relatively no slipping (the children know better than to pick them up, but could if they wanted to) these are great for little ones who are into painting. I'd really recommend them for that.	
1. 	Our 8 month old loves to &#34;bang&#34; things so this is perfect. He moves it around, bangs on it and lights it up with music. Great buy!	
1. 	I bought TWO of these booster/high chairs for my daughter, one for grandmas and one to stay in the car. It is an EXCELLENT chair and well worth the money.  The only problem I have with it so far is it is hard to un-clip the tray from the seat, however this may be because it is new and needs to be used a bit to loosen.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  Not only is it affordable, the size is perfect!!	
- 1	Sad to say these weren't worth the money spent on them.  They were terrible!  The fabric wasn't soft at all, and they kept rolling up and wouldn't stay on or around her knees.	
- 1	Cons - Very expensive for the size.Not so great about it.Reading reviews, i purchased this giraffe but nothing so great about it. My baby is 7 month old and she played it for 10 mins. After that she got bored. The only part she likes is sound.The product could be 5-7$ but not like 18$. It is too expensive.	
- 1	I wanted some way to wear my baby that would be comfortable for both of us.  A few friends recommended moby and moby style wraps, so I got this with high hopes.  My son and I both found it cumbersome, hot, and constricting.  Maybe we weren't doing something right, but he hated.*There are SO many layers of material, once you finally manage to get the damned thing on properly, that the both of you will be sweating like proverbial professional women in a church before long.*Actually getting the thing ON is way too much like work, and if you want to nurse in it, it takes even more finagling and adjustment. I never managed to successfully nursed in my moby wrap.  It could be that I am too well endowed to nurse in a wrap, but the way the wrap squashed my son against me made it impossible for him to nurse without having his entire face mashed into my breast.  Suffocation is not exactly a positive side effect of breastfeeding.*On the subject of squashing, I never managed to find a happy medium for this thing.  Either we both felt constricted, or it was too loose for me to feel confident wearing it.  My son wasn't, I guess, normal in the constriction department.  Rather than being soothed by swaddling and confining wraps, he would throw an absolute conniption.I think some of our issues may have been worked out with practice, but the thing is so time consuming to put on and arrange, and I was so sweaty and tired after wrestling with the wrap and the baby, plus the wrap at the waist pressed directly into my c-section which was unpleasant for quite some time after I was (per the doctor) healed enough for normal activity, that I just didn't have the patience to keep trying at it.  My baby threw a fit every time he was in it, and that stressed me out completely.  I just didn't have the stamina for this  method.He did like a sling carrier when he was very young.  He was a very long and large baby (22 in at birth), so the sling didn't last long before that started to make him feel constricted as well, and a sling isn't as secure as the moby, which was a drawback for actually accomplishing much in the way of errands and/or chores while wearing the baby... which kind of was the whole purpose.I finally hit on something that did (and does) work for us.  It's a mei tai, or Asian Baby Carrier.  I found a free tutorial online, and it was a screaming success.  I am NOT an accomplished seamstress by any stretch of the imagination, but this was pretty simple construction, and only took a couple hours to put together, one the pieces had been cut.  Hip carry isn't very comfortable for us, but front and back carry are incredibly comfortable.  My husband has 3 ruptured discs in his lower back, and even he can carry our son in the mei tai for short periods.  I can get it on and off in under 2 minutes.  There are no complicated wrappings, twistings, or turnings.  My son's legs are free, and he can get his arms in and out if he wants to, which makes him very happy.  He's content to hang out in the mei tai for longer than I'm content to wear him.  He weighs 30 lbs now, so he's quite a load, but the mei tai lets me carry him with very little effort.  I can even squat, bend (with care, I mean gravity does still work), wash dishes, make the beds, I've even put on my shoes with him in the mei tai with no problems.Of course, everyone is different, so what works for us may not work for someone else, and it seems quite a lot of people love the moby.  We didn't.	
- 1	Let me first say that I love my Medela pump, and I love most of the accessories...but I do not love this nipple!  It is supposed to be slow-flow, but it is definitely not that.  Kinda silly, if you think about it; a premiere breast pump company selling nipples that will put breastfeeding mothers out of business!We found the Ameda natural nipples to be much slower, and I have no problem switching from breast to bottle (with daddy).	
1. 	I love this seat. It has held up to 2 kids so far and is in great condition for baby 3 coming very soon.The boys have seemed to be very comfortable in it, the toy bar is close enough to reach yet far enough away to 'see' as their eyes are developing. They loved it and so have I!	
- 1	I registered and received this monitor as a shower gift.  I thought it would be great.  My daughter is 10 months now and I have already bought another monitor.  Within the first month of use the hand-held audio only monitor broke.  The video actually works really well and aside for some NOISY interference that it picks up sometimes, its a great picture day or night.  The camera is kind of a pain, though.  The way that it is angled, you need to mount it on the wall above the crib, or have it sitting on a tall piece of funiture that can overlook the crib.  I don't have that, so we only really use it for the sound.  The monitor is very large, though, and so it would have been nice if the hand held auido one worked - so I could take it to another room.  This model has too many problems I wouldn't buy it if I could do it over again.	
- 1	I bought this to start potty training my second son.  With my first son, I had a very primitive little potty that simply closed and doubled as a foot stool.  This little potty is cute, with a good concept but it doesn't have any clasps to snap it together.  You just put it together and let it sit I suppose... because if you try to move it, it falls apart.  The back just comes off.  I like to hide the potty when guest come over, so this is a problem for me.  I really like the first potty I bought better.  This is too expensive for how cheaply made it is... sorry fisher price.	
- 1	I didn't notice that the colors may vary.  I thought I would be receiving green, blue, and orange pacifiers for my SON.  Instead, he got purple and pink pacifiers.  Lucky him!  Yes, he uses them, and yes, he's been called a girl by strangers when they see it!  I don't want to get into stereotypes, etc., really, but if you want a specific color, don't order this.	
1. 	These are perfect for the job.  Highly absorbent and prevents &#34;leak through.&#34;  Also better for the breast since some silicone pads just occlude the breast and have been linked with increased instances of mastitis.  Keeping is simple over here with these cotton nursing pads.	
1. 	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	This little gym is pretty cool! I started using it when my daughter was about 2 and a half months old, and now she loves it! She's already batting at the zebra rattle and she loves looking at the monkey in the middle. I had read a lot of the negative reviews before I bought this; a lot of people have said that it falls over, but underneath the ends of the bar it has 2 plastic rungs that you can rotate around so you can make it sturdier.	
1. 	This was the first diaper pail I wanted to get but we used cloth diapers for the first 8 months so I needed one that could be used wet or dry. So I bought the diaper champ. While I was using the champ there wasnt too much odor, of course I was washing diapers every other day so there wasnt much chance for odor to build up. However once we stopped using cloth and switched to disposables the smell was awful!There are two problems with the champ, one is it's top heavy so it tips easily and two is it has a hole near the handle so odor is always seeping through.The Diaper Dekor Plus solved both of those issues and more. Its compact yet holds the same ammount of diapers that the Champ does. Its the same size on top that it is on bottom so there is no chance of it tipping. There are also no exposed holes to allow odor to escape.On the inside of the door on the bottom is a cutting tool that isnt exposed which you use to cut the bag and tie off. SIMPLEUsing the Dekor is easy as well...no handles to twist or turn...you dont even have to use your hands. All you do is step on the peddel and the lid pops up (just like a regular trash can) and you drop in your diaper.I will admit that when Im being lazy and just try to cram one more diaper in the dekor that there is a small odor that escapes when Im pushing that diaper in. However it's nowhere near the same STENCH that the Champ had.My daughter is now a year and I couldnt be more pleased. If you are using disposables I highly reccomend the Dekor Plus. I have had mine over a month and have yet to change the bag. I was concerned that I would be spending a lot of money on the refills but so far that hasnt been the case.Now my daughters room has no odor except her sweet smell.UPDATE: I have had this for two months now, I change the bag once a week and I still havent had to put in a new refill! I bought the box about a month ago thinking it would be anyday but it still hasnt run out! Also the refills come in boxes of 3 so if one lasts at least two months then your looking at buying refills only twice a year! AWESOME!!!!	
- 1	This GoCrib is fabulously durably and I LOVE how it can be packaged so nicely into the GoCrib backpack. It also comes with a sheet for the pad. Really my only cons for this product is the ease of set up. I anticipated it being much easier to set up. The pump fills it up relatively quickly but laying out everything, pumping it up and blowing up the mattress was just a little more labor intensive than setting up a Pack n' Play. The Pack n' Play isn't nearly as portable or lightweight so it's the trade off you make I suppose.UPDATE:After only a handful of uses the pump has completely broken. Very disappointed in its durability	
1. 	I wouldn't quite describe this as a must have but ours does get its fair share of use.  As others have said its a plug-in or battery operated sound maker.  It plays womb sounds, rain, thunder etc.  We often turn it on at bedtime to drown out other household noises.  Plus, we notice our daughter seems to sleep better with music/white noise in the background.  My only criticism might be the volume.  Sometimes even when we have it up as loud as it will go certain sounds are barely audible unless you are right up on the machine.  If your infant is a fussy sleeper this product is worth a try.	
- 1	This car seat is huge, and takes up a large amount of space in your car.  I have an Acura SUV and it wiped out my blind spot totally, and the passenger front seat had to be moved all the way up (preventing anyone from sitting there) in order to accommodate this seat at the proper recline.  The material is foam, which in the midwest and warm humid summers would lead to disaster and overheating.  I placed my girl in the seat, and with the proper recline (based on bubble level installed in the carseat), she seemed too much in the laying position, and kept trying to get up or out.Being so HUGE, I had no blind spot and that would be dangerous driving, I returned the seat.	
1. 	I use these for my twin boys primarily after they are done nursing for spit ups. They are very absorbent and wash very well. I am very satisfied with this purchase.	
1. 	Easy to use and install. A little loose/wobbly on my toilet, even with the size adjustments, but not in a way that makes it ineffective...yet.	
1. 	We bought this when she was born and she is going to be 3 now and she loves it. Every night, she goes to sleep by playing with it. This is one of this products that grow with your child and a highly recommend it.When we bought it, with an infant in mine, I was not sure if it was the right choice because it didn't have music. She had music in another thing that she had in the bed, and she ended up enjoying that a lot, so it turned into an advantage. Light on one thing, music on another. Better to choose what you need.We ended up using this a lot for ourselves, to go into the room and have some light but not wake her up. It is really cute and soft.But since she is more independent, she just loves this toy. In fact, every night when we turn the light off, she plays with it, changing the color and looking at the stars. She learned to turn it off, in the turtle's belly, and to turn it on on the shell.Batteries last, by the way. Of course, we have changed them several times, but we forget in between, so it is pretty durable.The constellations part we haven't used. Maybe in the future, though I am sure I lost the booklet, but I don't think it is the best thing of this toy. I think the fact that it doesn't have music, and that she can change the colors are much better.	
- 1	I was so excited to get these.  I carefully followed all of the instructions, running hot water over the cubes to loosen them (food never seems to want to come out without a little help).  They weren't as easy to use as they were supposed to be and I found that the lids don't really offer a good seal (more on that below).  Well, less than a week after getting them I made the mistake of asking my husband to prepare our son's food.  He did what another reviewer did and pressed REALLY HARD on one end of the frozen food.  Instead of the food popping out, the tray shattered.  Now I have a hole right in the middle of the tray.If you buy these, use the hot water, don't try to get the cube out just by pressing.  When you use hot water, you do have to be careful not to get it in the trays.  The lids are completely worthless.  They don't keep water out and aren't at all airtight.  I highly doubt they keep freezer odors out of baby food and can tell you that they don't prevent freezer burn - they'd have to be airtight to do that.I should've just gotten silicone ice cube trays.  Sure, they don't have lids, but it's not like the lids on these things actually seal well enough to prevent freezer burn anyway.	
- 1	Put it in the fridge and when I took it out an ooz was coming out of it. The ooz was sticky and would not come off, it just kept coming out. Don't buy.	
- 1	I returned this wipe warmer to the store when I realized that it uses a wall wart rather than a standard electrical plug.  I will probably buy the Especially for Baby warmer, which does not use a wall wart.  Do you ever wonder why manufacturers use wall warts?  Because it's cheaper to get UL certification for a wall wart than to get certification for the whole device.	
1. 	The Boppy is GREAT! When I first brought my baby home, it didn't seem to serve me any purpose and I didn't think it was going to be useful. But once I got the hang of nursing and got the hang of using the Boppy...well, now I use it all the time! I can lay the baby on the Boppy to nurse and it frees up my hands to sit at the computer or do whatever else I'd like to do (while sitting) with both hands. The cover comes off and can be washed, which is great. I purchased an additional cover so I always have one clean one.	
- 1	This just did not do the trick for me. I'm 5'2&#34;, so I thought the mini snoogle would be better for me. I really didn't like anything about it. The top part is uncomfortable to use as a pillow, which is one way it is shown for usage. I have tried bending it all sorts of different ways, and just none are comfortable. It doesn't contour to my body well at all. I wound up getting a regular body pillow and am happier with that.	
- 1	I would give this product 5 stars for touch and feel. Very soft. Easy to wear and wash. However they are awful at containing any amount of leak. I go through all 6 pads before morning is over. And forget about them working over night. The smallest amount of milk soaks right through to my bra and shirt. I have gone back to disposable pads	
1. 	Hello, I purchased this for a new Grandson who has acid reflux and colic and it's turned out to be a blessing for him and my Daughter. It is his favorite seat over 5 of the newest swings and vibrating chairs etc.Worth every penny. I definately recommend to all Moms, Grandmothers, & for wonderful baby gifts. I happily give it at least 5 stars for sure.The delivery & purchase were everything promised.Thank you Amazon, keep up the great work!	
1. 	I purchased two for my twin sons.  This was easy to put on my sons and I love how the zipper unzips from the bottom for easy diaper changes.	
- 1	Poorly made and it does not hold heavy objects.  I returned this right away.  Don't even bother wasting your money.	
- 1	The title says it all...the edges of the bumpers were very tempting for my daughter to peel every chance she got. You'd think her ability to remove the ends of the bumpers would indicate the bumpers would be easy to remove.They were a nightmare and have ruined our beautiful coffee table. I've tried goo gone to no avail. If anyone has any tips how to get the tape off, which is coated with random pieces of foam from the old bumpers, I'd love to hear them. I can't believe how awful my table looks.	
1. 	Our daughter truly enjoyed this during her tummy time period. We have since given it to a friend who has a little one, and she loves playing with it when we visit... perhaps I was too hasty in giving it away.	
1. 	For us, storage space is an issue. I was originally looking for a dresser top depot, I was unaware this was a hanging one. It actually worked out better this way! Tons of storage space for all the diaper changing essentials!	
- 1	When my baby was born prematurely, it was important to me to get her breast milk by any means necessary.  I got the Ameda Purely Yours on the suggestion of the hospital lactation consultant.  They use Ameda pumps throughout the hospital and she thought it would be best if my hygenikit matched the ones they had.  In retrospect, I probably should have done more research on pumps before hand.I can use this pump, but I find it very frustrating.  It loses suction every 10 cycles or so, so I need to reset the caps.  The valves are finicky and weak.  They are supposed to last 2-3 months, but i find that if I don't replace them weekly, I don't get any milk.  Since I'm still pumping 3 months later, I rented an Ameda Elite.  It's better, but I wish I would have just gone with Medela pumps.	
- 1	This is so tiny! Your baby MIGHT use it for a month if they were born at 7 lbs or less! I was so disappointed with it! There is absolutely no room in it for the baby to move it's arms or legs - you better swaddle them tight if you want them in here! Also, it isn't very deep and the vibration feature is a joke, it is noisy and only vibrates the wall! DON&#34;T BUY THIS!	
1. 	I spent a LOT of time debating all of the different types of strollers, and eventually settled on TWO - this one and a Bugaboo. THIS one I use ALL the time. It is ridiculously easy to open and close, and is great for anyone who will be using it primarily for indoor use (although I haven't tested it extensively outdoors, it rides fine over the smooth pavement but doesn't maneuver over significant bumps, i.e. uneven sidewalks, very well). BUT ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING THAT I NOTICED ANOTHER REVIEWER MENTIONED - SHE SAID THAT THE CARSEAT POPPED OFF THE STROLLER WHEN SHE WENT OVER A CURB (CAUSING SIGNIFICANT INJURIES TO HER BABY), BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD SHE ROTATED THE TWO RED SAFETY TABS ON THE UPRIGHT BARS SO THAT THEY WENT OVER THE FRONT OF THE CAR SEAT (LOCKING IT IN PLACE). So, it is NOT a dangerous stroller - just make sure you read the instructions.Oh, and the reason I got the Bugaboo is because, while it is quite expensive, it is high quality, comes with very nice accessories, and is convertible in so many ways (from bassinet with several different positions to upright stroller with riding board for your older child). If you want a stroller for very frequent use on pavement (whether just for walks around the block or if you live in or near a city) that can hit almost any bump (other than a crater!) and handle it well, get a Bugaboo! It will last for YEARS, and retains its value (in case you want to sell it).	
- 1	We really like Dr. Brown's design.  We don't see any bubbles in the milk and the nipple is slow enough that our LO doesn't choke on it like other brand.We decided to get the standard model after finding out its wide-neck are made in china.  Sadly, our LO won't take to the narrower nipple and design.  The narrower neck also means harder mixing (if you are using powder)	
1. 	I think this is my baby's favorite bottle nipple shape.Like many others, I was worried these bottles would leak but they don't! Hurray!I really wanted to try these to see if they'd cut down on burping. They don't appear to do so, at least not significantly, but my baby is not exclusively bottle-fed.Pros:- They don't leak!- They are super-easy to get very clean (quickly!) because the bottom comes off. This is great when I'm out and about without my bottle brush.- The shape of the bottle is easy for me to hold and for the baby too although the 9 oz size is very unwieldy for young babies.- DISHWASHER SAFE!Cons:- Water will get into the bottom cap if you warm your bottles in water (but once you realize that it's easy to shake it out).- Can't tell if the bottle cuts down on burping and gas.- I wish this set came with an extra vent disk and nipple like the multi-size set.	
- 1	I hate this seat.  I cannot get the shoulder straps long enough to get my daughter's arms through the straps comfortably.  She is not yet 2 years old and weighs about 25 lbs.  I can't imagine using this seat until she's 70 lbs, as the manfacturer states.  In order to get her arms through the straps, I have to bend her arms awkwardly which frequently makes her cry.  I have not yet removed the HUGS chest pads and stitching, but I'm going to try that.  It seems odd that I have to remove the additionaly safety features in order to get her into the seat without making her cry.  I also bought th Peg Perego Convertible Premium seat and I am much happier with that seat.	
1. 	I've been using this carrier since my daughter was about one week old.  It supports her head just fine, and she usually falls asleep in it, making it possible for me to take the dog for a walk, go to the mailbox, or do a load of laundry, things I could NEVER do with a baby who won't be put down!  It took a few tries to get good at putting her in and taking her out, and I wish the adjustable straps had somewhere to go after tightening, because there is a lot of extra strap just flopping around my legs.  But all in all, this was one of the better purchases we made.	
- 1	Neither of our twins, both 9 & 11lbs will fit in this - they are just too small. Pity. Will stick with my bjorns.	
1. 	When my baby gets supper fussy and tired. I swaddle her up in the miracle blanket and within minutes she stops crying and is sleeping. It really helps against the flying arms. I'm grateful!! My baby can rest!!	
1. 	I was uncertain if getting a red sleep sack was a good idea after having read some of the reviews saying that everything that came in contact with it had red fuzz on it. But I am glad I did. We have used it pretty much every night for the past 1-2 months, and no red fuzz on anything. It washes great, it is roomy enough, and yet my son can walk in it when he wakes up. The color is vibrant, and NO fuzz coming off of it.	
1. 	These wipes are a life saver. I travel significantly for work and these make cleaning breast pump parts in my truck a breeze.	
- 1	Bought it during my 'god i need sleep i'll buy anything' weeks at the beginning. But seriously, nobody needs this. Miracle blanket, Magic Merlin sleep suit, regular sleep sack. That's all you need. The regular woombie never really worked for us either.	
- 1	First one we had didn't last a full year, the monitor stopped working unless it was plugged in (we replaced batteries and it still wouldn't work). So we continued to use and then the monitor stopped working all together. We replaced it after it completely died and the second one came straight from manufacture and the monitor didn't work at all.Only comes with one camera. For the price, it should at least come with 2 cameras to one monitor.	
1. 	My daughter loves these toys and looks forward to playing with them in the tub every day. My only concern is the paint on the toys which is starting to come off because my daughter chews on everything. Overall very cute toys.	
- 1	I love the Avent system, and I can't say enough good things about the bottles, nipples, caps, cleaning brush... But this pump doesn't work well at all. If you just need something to relieve engorgement, it works, but otherwise, buy a double electric breast pump. Check if your insurance will cover one... Mine did!	
- 1	Nice that it's small and portable.  But Baby doesn't like sleeping in it at all. Isn't very comfortable and the pad is very thin.  Bad buy.	
- 1	Very stinks! Water flows!Pour difficult! Plastic toys inside, heavy and bad swim.  Thrown out money. My child played 5 minutes and more do not want to watch. It is poison! Because it is - then the child periodically go face him and licks is chemistry!	
1. 	I loved it until it was stolen out of our pickup truck.  I guess it was popular.  It was fast and easy to use.  Great for restaurants.  Cleaner too.  I hate using high chairs.	
1. 	This worked for giving our newborn sponge baths, but I ended up getting a tub with a newborn insert when it came time for giving real baths. Overall, I wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	We were using a diaper pail for my son's diapers, but we had to put it in the bathroom because the smell was really bad! Now, we put all poppy diapers in these bags and into the trash bin they go into the garage. No more stink! Much cheaper than the muchkin ones I was buying at the store!	
1. 	As a mother to a little Houdini, I tried just about every swaddle I could think of to keep my baby girl from hitting herself in the face while sleeping and waking up. This is, by far, the best I have found. We have been using this blanket for two weeks now, both for naps and at night, and the little one is finally starting to warm up to the idea of being swaddled. She typically falls asleep quickly and sleeps longer when wrapped in her miracle blanket. It has also been great for soothing her during the more fussy nighttime hours. The only downside is, if you have a little Houdini on your hands, handling him/her too much while swaddled can loosen the blanket just enough for those little arms to find their way out. Otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever!	
- 1	I just got this delivered today and I'm so disgusted!  They sent me an obviously used one!!  My first hint was that it was just sitting in the box without the little plastic ties that hold it to the box.  Then I noticed several long black hairs wrapped around the giraffe's ears.I don't know if someone bought it and then returned it, but either way I don't appreciate being sent something with hair on it when I paid for a &#34;new&#34; item!(The product itself is actually pretty cute.  I like the giraffe, but I hate that it's used!)	
1. 	My three month old loves to look at this mobile. She's entranced by the graphic colors and the baby face image. The cards are a little hard to switch around. But it's a great item. Other products from this line are also a big hit.	
- 1	My son is on the large size. He is 37 tall & 39 pounds. These seat is too small for him. The hole is too small which requires him to push forward right up against the splash guard. The guard is hard plastic & cuts into his legs leaving deep red marks. He hates it. He tried it a couple times & now refuses to use it.I switched to a combo potty seat that has a removable soft seat & a much bigger hole. This one will be placed on Freecycle. I only recommend this for those training very small children.	
1. 	Revived this has a gift for our daughter, loved them so much, I purchased sets for two other people.  Both sides are cloth with the plastic in the middle	
- 1	When I started feeding my son solids, I purchased a pack of pouch pops to use on our 20 Squooshi pouches. These were the only ones available at the time, so of course I got them. The pouch pops lengthen & soften the hard spout on pouches, but that's pretty much it in my opinion. I still had to squeeze the pouches for my son because he would constantly squeeze too hard too fast, & end up wearing his food!Then came the Sip'n tops... It's like they read my mind! I seriously LOVE these caps. They have a one way valve, so baby can only get food out by sucking... They can squeeze & squeeze & not a single drop will spill out! I no longer have to hold the pouch for my son, he can hold it & feed himself in a matter of minutes! I also love that these have an attached loop & cover for storage... So if baby doesn't finish the contents of his pouch, just pop the cap's cover on and let him finish it a little bit later. I couldn't do this with pouch pops, they don't have any covers for storage. They also don't have the much needed (& appreciated!) one way valve!The Sip'n caps are more expensive per 2 pack, but are worth every penny in my opinion. I'd seriously pay double to be mess free like I have been lately! I bought 10, but still have 6 unopened and have been rotating the original 4 I first purchased.Overall, Sip'n caps win for me! They soften the hard spouts, have covers for storage/travel, and have that amazing mess free valve! If you just want something to soften the spouts, then the pouch pops would work for that!	
1. 	These bibs are perfect for my 6 month old.  I wanted a waterproof bib but not one that was so full of plastic that it warped after washing/drying.  These fit the bill.  I actually ordered 2 more packages after this one.	
- 1	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.	
1. 	got it because it isn't made in china, the spoon is a little wide for a little one, the handle is easy to grip though.  but it beats anything that comes from the land of no manufacturing standards.	
1. 	I have the Graco Pack n Play and this sheet fits perfect!  I was a little scared to dry it after reading reviews online so the first wash I did not dry.  After the 2nd wash and ever since I have dried on the medium setting and no shrinkage for me.  This is suuuper soft and nice and cushy!  I am not sure if I would use if it was summer time unless the house was nice and cool.  I also used it in other pack n plays that were not graco when we traveled and it worked great.  I would recommend and will for sure buy another if I need one.	
1. 	I purchased this set for my baby on the way.  I was a little hesitant on paying so much for bedding that gets used for a relatively short period of time.  With my previous children, I bought much cheaper sets and got what I paid for.  They wore out and faded fairly quickly and only made it through one child.  This set is beautiful.  The quality is obvious.  The bumper and comforter are twice as thick as cheaper versions and you cannot match the detail.  The animals seem to jump right out at you.  It is absolutely adorable and I like the fact that it is not baby colors.  Plus you get everything with this set including a diaper stacker and window valance.  I also bought it when it was on sale so I got 15% off.  Well worth it and althought this will be my last child,  it could easily be passed on to another.  Don't waste your time with cheaper versions.	
1. 	The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is a very obliging unit. It services all types of containers, and of differing sizes too. It can warm disposable, oversized, and odd shaped bottles, glass babyfood jars, and tin cans to name a few. It's small in size, measuring 5 x 5 x 5  high. Thus, it occupies very little room on the counter, or bedside table. A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer, and is removable for larger items. On the front of the unit is a dial control. It has 3 settings, 1,2, and 3, 1 being the coolest. Next to the dial is a power light, which serves 2 purposes.1.) It indicates the unit is ON and working, and2.) When the water reaches the correct temperature, the power light blinks ON and OFF to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer. For that reason, one must unplug it after each use. With a rather lengthy cord, 3 feet long, it is very adaptable. For those concerned about d&eacute;cor, the all white exterior is designed to blend in. In addition, the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable. By that, I mean it's lightweight; it weighs 1 pound, and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag. We traveled frequently when William was an infant, and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles, i.e. Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience:Right off the bat, I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day, as I was unable to breastfeed. Thus, I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer. Pop a bottle in the unit; plug it in, and in 5 minutes it's done. How difficult is that? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast, evenly, and it's durable. Moreover, now there's no more white, icky, stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer, I never encountered any problems. Let me tell you, this unit got a workout in my house. I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual. I know ~ geek alert. Okay, that's true, but it's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming. I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk, because I'd get distracted. Consequently, running a timer became apart of the routine. If Avent were to add an external timer, this would be extremely helpful to users. I almost never used the coolest setting, only when thawing frozen breastmilk, and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles. Both were rare occasions. I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator, and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here's another tip, adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product. Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch. I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue. Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience; although, a power strip would solve that problem. Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed. I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer. An hour might go by before I realized my mistake. Now that's a fire hazard!Closing Remarks:When it comes to bottles, Avent is still my 1st choice. I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand. I guess that goes to show... input from customers can, and does influence manufactures. Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer, which would certainly increase the price. However, I for one would be willing to pay for those added features. Would you? While writing this review, I've debated how to rate this product. I was extremely pleased with this warmer, but I also recognize its shortcomings. I've opted to give this product an above average mark, because1.) It did what it was supposed to do. It warms bottles fast, and evenly.2.) It accommodates plastic, glass, tin, and a myraid of bottles styles.3.) Warms disposable bottles, and bottle liners, and4.) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding,Mary	
1. 	I didn't use diaper pails at all. I used regular garbage can. Since we have a lot trees outside. Little mosquito's came inside. My baby got sick. So I decided to have a diaper pail. I order this one because it was cheaper and there  was no special bags to go with it. I have liked it very much. Only one thing I didn't like was that there was no packaging. It was like someone have had used it before. I would recommend it.	
1. 	We've tried a LOT of bibs - and Bumkin bibs are the best!  It is truly waterproof, yet it can be washed in the washer (yay!).  This one in particular is a favorite because the long sleeves and generous length are prefect for protecting long sleeve clothes (or nice dresses).  This also has a tie at the neck (instead of the velcro that the short sleeve version has) which ensures that it doesn't snag sweaters/dresses and if you tie a double know its a little more difficult for tots to take off mid-meal.  We have two for each child and love them!	
- 1	I really didn't care for these. They were soothing at first, but once they warmed up to your body temperature they didn't really seem to do much of anything.  Wish I had saved my money.	
1. 	Lots of paint to use several times. Advise: if you have more than one &#34;artists&#34; working on you buy extra paint brushes/sponges!	
1. 	The Halo swaddles were my favorite. We used the fleece and cotton versions until my daughter could roll over.  I wish we could still use them!  :)  Love the fleece for those cooler nights.	
- 1	We were very excited about a swing that would allow us to move the kiddo straight from the car or stroller (Graco Snugrider Stroller Frame) without taking him out of his Snugride 35.  However, we were sorely mistaken when we thought this swing would function as a, well, swing.  The motor isn't even REMOTELY powerful enough to keep the Snugride 35 moving.  Brand new batteries won't get it moving.  Even if you kick start the swing by giving it a push, it will NEVER continue to swing unless you put it on the highest setting (there is a turtle to rabbit scroll wheel that is pretty worthless).  Once below absolute bunny the swing slows to a stop in a matter of seconds.  Not only that, but the fast setting is pretty jerky... way too fast back-and-forth in my opinion.  The vibration setting works fine, and the nature sounds are OK.  Music is, as always, awful.  When will they let us load up our own MP3's into these things?!  Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone... even my baby enemies.	
1. 	I just got this tub and our 2 month old loves it!  Whenever he's crabby at night I just fill this up and he stops crying as soon as he lays in it.  He looks so comfy and he could just fall asleep in it.  He doesn't slip around either so I don't have to worry so much.  The only problem I have is that when it drains the soap builds up on the sling part, but I just spray it off with the faucet sprayer and wash it after every few baths.	
1. 	Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the cheap one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage.	
1. 	After a few turns of the lid there is a slight leak, but  over all great!  Great for kids learning how to use real cups	
1. 	The connectors worked really well with my medela symphony. They are easy to clean and work like they are suppose to.	
1. 	Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!	
1. 	I had a strange reaction when I first gave my baby a bath with this product.  I felt a little sad. My baby's hair was slicked to the side, his body clean and he smelled like he was going out on his first date.  All grown up already.  My husband came up behind me and said Our baby smells kinda...frou frou.  That's when I realized that the perfume in this product is a bit strong and the product itself seems a bit concentrated.  The next time I gave my baby a bath I used a pea-sized amount and the difference was amazing!  My baby's hair felt soft and not dried out, and he smelled clean and fresh, not like he was dipped in Chanel.  Clearly a little bit of this stuff goes a LONG way.  I've also used this on my baby's face for his baby acne.  It did not irritate his skin and his eyes were not irritated when I rinsed his hair.  I ran out of make-up remover and used a tiny bit on a moistened cotton ball.  Make-up came right off without scrubbing.  Now I'm using it to wash my face.  I LOVE this stuff and because you only need to use a little at a time, I'm going to have this tube for a very long time.UPDATE:  I have switched to Weleda Calendula Shampoo & Bodywash for my baby, solely because I prefer the scent.  However I will continue to use Mustela for myself since Mustela removes my eye makeup and Weleda does not.	
- 1	This is a really fun toy and our daughter loves it, however the suction cup does not work well at all. Within minutes (and sometimes seconds) our daughter pulls it right off. She is strong, but I would bet it doesn't take other infants much to remove it either.	
1. 	Last pregnancy I ordered the &#34;Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Leachco-Belly-Contoured-Pillow-Ivory/dp/B0002E7DIQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1390183256&sr;=1-2) since I thought having a symmetrical pillow would be easier. It was pretty comfortable, but even on my king size bed, it took up a ton of room. It was hot, and I felt like there was this giant divider between me and my husband. I also felt like the top of it dug into my shoulder - and I was never quite sure where to put my bottom arm (I'm a terrible side sleeper. Hence the need for the pillow.) It also seemed to lose &#34;fluff&#34; by the end of a few months.This time I decided to go with the &#34;Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow&#34; - and I'm hooked! I haven't used it long enough to see how the &#34;fluff factor&#34; works out, but my concerns about not having a &#34;symmetrical pillow&#34; have been alleviated. It's super easy to use, intuitive, and takes up so much less space. I love the support, it's isn't hot like the other pillow - and it allows me to snuggle with my husband if he's on the right side - and added perk!I feel way less 'isolated' in bed with this pillow. Would definitely recommend.	
1. 	I bought 3 of these - one for each twin's crib, and another one for the changing table. Mine came as a two-piece foam and it was no problem aligning the two pieces together. I keep these under the sheet+ waterproof mattress cover, and the seam between two pieces of foam is no problem with this setup.We also had the issue of our girls sliding down on these after a couple of hours. We tried rolling a towel and tucking it in as a U shape and that didn't work. But we finally figured out a way to keep our girls in place: rolling a towel into a Y shape and placing our girls into the fork of the Y. This prevents the sliding. Here's how we do it, also pls see the uploaded image. I recommend using a fluffy bath towel(i think these have more grip to them); also, I do swaddle my LOs before placing them in the crib:- Take a towel, unfold it and lay it out flat- roll from one side, widthwise, until the middle of the towel- roll from the other side, widthwise, towards the roll #1, until the middle of the towel- take a velcro strap, a ribbon or something similar and tie one end of the towel to hold the two rolls together and prevent them from unraveling. Where exactly you place the tie depends on (1) the size of your towel, and (2) the length of your kid. Your towel should resemble a Y shape now- flip your towel over, so that the rolls are facing down, not up, place the towel into the crib and unroll slightly to allow for the width of your kid- When I put my LOs to bed, I typically align their shoulders with the top of the towel. They stay in place and don't move.	
1. 	It is a great product, I love it ! the colors are lovely, and it is very practical. Easy to put together.	
- 1	This is hard to get on and off and you can't see how many ounces are left in the bottle!	
- 1	There isn't enough of a volume adjustment on this, and the sound has to be on for the projection to work.  We ended up getting rid of this and getting the project soother called SoundSpa by MyBaby.  We love that one and my son uses it every single night.	
1. 	This is awesome.  Even the adults love it. It creates such a soothing atmosphere with the stars lit up on the ceiling and walls.  The only thing I'd change is that I'd offer it in different colors, since I bought it for a newborn girl's room.  A nice pink would have been nice.  But it really is a great product!	
1. 	I've been using these for years and have yet to have a problem with my children getting into the outlets.	
- 1	I can't remember how old our daughter was when we got some of these for her snacks. Maybe 9 months. But within minutes she learned she could push into it along the edges, flip it upside down, and shake all the contents out onto the floor or wherever she was. We may as well have given the snacks to her in a cup without a lid.My wife picked up a Munchie Mug (Munchie Mug - The New Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Made in the USA. - BPA Free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top) and this one did the trick! Our daughter can reach her hand into it and pull out a piece of snack or two, but she can't empty the entire contents. Yes, it costs more, but I'm willing to pay more for superior products that actually get the job done.We will still use these Munchkin ones on occasion when the other snack mug is dirty or we can't find it, but we always use them reluctantly. Save yourself a lot of hassle and get the Munchie Mug instead	
- 1	I got this bib because my baby was messing with the flimsy plastic ones too much and I thought the inflexible design would work better and catch more of the mess. The bib doesn't fit my baby while he's sitting in the highchair because the bib is too long and there isn't enough of a gap between my baby and the high chair tray for the bib to rest. It ends up resting at an angle on top of the tray. It also makes it impossible for himn to bend forward to reach food on his tray because this bib gets in the way. Overall I'm dissapointed with this purchase. I guess I'm stuck giving my baby a bath after every meal.	
1. 	All I can say is buy it, it works better than anything else out there.  It's worth the price! you won't be disappointed.	
1. 	Love these.  Best thing I ever got. Use them for my twin grandsons ain't my small kitchen.  Easy to set up and take down.  The twins are two now and have been using these since they could sit up.  Easy to clean.  I sewed two towels together and put it over the back of the chairs to minimize those grimy hands.  We take these camping and when we visit friends and family.  There are three hieght adjustments and folds up to take anywhere.  Nice to have for many years!	
1. 	This padding works great, and has a nice fit. The velcro that comes with it is poor. I had to use silicon caulk to keep it down because my 10 month old kept pulling it off. The silicon works well. She doesn't even try to pull it off anymore. It has definitely saved us from a few accidents though.	
- 1	This cup looks like a great product at a glace, but is not...  This cup has an anti-leak component, which make it hard to suck from. Essentially this cup has 3 pieces:  the rubbery straw which is part of the cap, the anti-leak plastic  component, and the removable straight straw. The anti-leak component make it hard to suck from. If you remove the anti-leak component, then the straight staw has no way to attach to the rubbery staw, and the cup at this point will only function as a sippy cup that leaks.  The plastic covering on the cap is good for keeping the rubbery straw clean, but is not designed to prevent leaking.If you are strictly looking for a straw cup that is hard to suck from but won't leak OR if you are looking for a sippy cup that will leak, this may be for you.On a positive note, the rubbery material on the straw is a nice try because it seems gentle to little one.	
- 1	I haven't actually tried any cloth diapers - I'm due in three months - but I wanted to buy a few different varieties to see what I thought would work best for my husband and me.  I prefer the design of Cottonbabies (Bumgenius & Flip) to these.Update: After originally returning this diaper, I acquired some in a lot of diapers I bought. Turns out my 3 star review based on first impressions was too generous.While I do admit that I love the SoftBums inserts, I have not been impressed at all by the covers. I have two Omni and two Echos. First and foremost, the material seems cheap. The interior fleece is piling like crazy (and it's only been in the dryer one time for the recommended sealing) and it's dingy and discolored, despite multiple attempts at sunning.I hate the snaps. It's more aesthetic than anything, but I hate how the tabs fold over.The toggle is almost ALWAYS stuck in the gusset after a washSo irritating.When my little guy poops, the poop bleeds out through the stitching to the outside of the diaper, despite the fact that I did the recommended sealing in the dryer. I haven't tried resealing them because the diapers don't actually leak, but poop bleeding through is still gross. BTW no other diaper that I've bought/used needed this sealing.	
- 1	This walker is cute but of poor quality.  We purchased it from Babies R Us and were disappointed when we discovered that the frame was damaged.  The plastic where you attach the back wheels had broken off, and you could see the orange shards of plastic at the bottom of the box.  I called up Kolcraft customer service and they agreed to send a replacement frame free of charge.  Great, problem solved, right?  WRONG!  First of all, they only sent the bottom orange piece, not the full frame.  So, I tried removing the orange part from the green part, and realized it's not made to come apart.  I ended up injuring my hand and had to wait for my husband to get home and deal with it.  He also injured himself, but succeeded in separating the two pieces.  Yay, everything's fixed, right?  WRONG again, chief.  The frame Kolcraft sent us didn't have any holes where the frame should snap together.  Weird.  And incredibly frustrating.  So, I made another call to customer service, sent them photos of the issue, and they made another promise to send the correct part.  New frame arrives, and again, it's the frame with no holes.  I call customer service again, send photos of the problem again, and they ship out a new piece again.  Third time's a charm, I guess, because this time they got it right.  This process took about a month.  Now my baby has a walker, and I'll admit, she does seem to enjoy it.  Another annoying thing about this walker is the way it adjusts... you pull a strap in the back to tighten up the fabric of the seat.  Strange.  You would think it would make more sense to have something that adjusts on the frame itself.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing another Kolcraft product, like ever.	
1. 	If your child rearing has been anything like ours you have found that every manufacturer loves to make their product only work with their brands. This product is great because it will fit many different manufacturers car seats. It also does a great job keeping your little ones protected from the elements. We live in Chicago and we never had an issue with our daughter getting cold when using this product.	
1. 	I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...	
1. 	I like this pillow because it didn't give me neck pains. I used to have two pillows (on top of each other) to elevate my head to help with the acid reflux and end up having soar neck in the morning. This pillow is great. I highly recommend it. I am 17 weeks pregnant and it works great. The construction is great. It takes about two days to find the sweet spot. It is not mushy like other brands, so, it holds up.Enjoy!	
1. 	This ice pack is perfect for Medela bottles and carrying pack. I obtained my Medela Pump used without the ice pack, so this replacement part was extremely helpful.	
1. 	They do what I need them to do.  I wish they were a bit easier for adults to get out!	
1. 	I have to say anything Medela is great.  Always high quality stuff! Anyway this manual breast pump works great for on the go.  I have an electric pump that I use at home (the Medela Freetime) but I needed a pump I could take on vacation with me.  It works great.  It does not work great when your not full.  I don't feel it has enough sucking power to get the deep down milk (if that makes sense)  but i works great when your full.  My hand gets SO TIRED though!  So be prepared for that.  But otherwise it works great and is a great price. Def worth the money and gets an A+ in my book.	
- 1	I had been looking at a bunch of cabinet locks because we had a few issues: (i) all lower cabinets and no uppers, so all our glasses, plates etc are at baby level; (ii) Ikea modern cabinets with no frames so limited options for places to attach the locks and actually create a lock; and (iii) didn't want to drill in my brand new cabinets. I tried a bunch, hoping somehow, somewhere, one of these would work. These did not work for frameless cabinets, so i didn't even get around to checking whether they would work with high strength tape (in lieu of drilling).	
- 1	This is a bad, bad, bad design:1. It takes up a lot of floor space (21 x 29) when in use. Not ideal for small rooms.2. The tray does not slide on smoothly and often goes off-track when you are trying to side it in.3. The tray is poorly designed. There is an attached hard plastic piece that is designed to be straddled by baby's legs when it is in place. However, when the tray is slid in, it is easy to push the tray too far in and smoosh baby's crotch. Unpleasant. The same plastic piece prevents the tray from being set aside and laying flat somewhere for storage or just to set aside for a moment while putting baby in or out of the high chair.4. The chair is excessively HUGE. My 6 month old son is still too small to be buckled in snugly in this chair.I've seen a much better designed chair by Safety 1st. It is much easier to get baby in and out of the chair because of a much better tray and restraint design.	
1. 	For the price you can't beat this item. I bought and returned a couple of changing table hanging organizers. This one is what I settled on. It fits my badger basket changing table just fine. I was really looking for something small to keep wipes and ointments handy in. I like that I can also for my small prefolds (for cloth diapering) in where the diapers go. They don't fit perfect, but well enough that I'm happy! I paid less than $9 for this item so I really have no complaints. It serves its purpose!	
- 1	I bought several of these brushes because we go through them left and right. Afer 10 months of using them...I  have decided that I do not like them...at all. The nipple brush uses a metal wire...which rusts after about a month or so. The lengh of the brush is just a little too short. To wash an 8oz bottle is a little difficult because once the brush is fully in, there is only about 1-1 1/2 inches of the handle to hold on to in order to clean the bottle. Even with having smaller hands...this makes it hard to twist and clean. If you put the nipple brush back in and try to twist it...it doesn't work because the nipple brush doesn't lock.	
1. 	I love this whole system! It's made making baby food so easy. I bought these extra trays because I make quite a bit of food at one time and could use the extra trays. If you want to make your own food, get this book and these trays...you won't be sorry.	
- 1	Sending back for refund. A bead broke in half and was in my daughter's mouth within the first hour of wearing. Dangerous product.  Also, the necklace is ugly and unpolished, unlike the photo in the description.	
- 1	I expected excellent quality from Fisher Price for this Meal on the Go container and was sorely disappointed. The idea of the two compartment container with a travel spoon is great but it has more design flaw than positives.  First of all, it can only be used for dry snacks because when I tested if it could hold liquid without leaking, it failed miserably! I put a little bit of water in both compartments, shut it, and when I tipped it to the side, most of the water leaked out the sides. Part of the reason it leaked is that it doesn't snap completely shut - you have to push down in about 5 places to get it to close, but even when you shut one compartment, the other comes unsnapped and the cover pops open. Lastly, the plastic just feels very cheap. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it can carry dry snacks when traveling. Overall, this is not worth $1.00, let alone the $8.00 price tag.	
1. 	These bibs are cute, fit well, catch food well, wash well, and are great overall.  We use them everyday on our son.	
1. 	My 2 month old son loves this play mat. He started following the light pattern about 2 weeks ago and is now paying attention to the toys dangling down from the cross bars. The mirror that comes with this has been so handy as well, I didn't have to go out and buy one for him.	
1. 	It's strong and sturdy, but the gate itself can be kind of narrow when you are carrying things. It would have been nice had they considered this.	
1. 	I really wanted to love the drop-in bottle system.  I purchased eight bottles, several boxes of liners, and two breast milk storage kits prior to the birth of my son thinking it would be so convenient to just pump breast milk into the liners and freeze them.  Unfortunately, mother nature didn't cooperate with my plans and I was unable to breastfeed.  I figured they would still be good bottles even if my son was formula fed because you don't have to scrub them and they should cut down on gas.  This was a good theory, but in practice I have found that I tend to wash these just as often and just as thoroughly as I would a traditional bottle, so it really doesn't save me any time.  Plus, to me, it seems almost messier to deal with disposing of the liner (especially if there is leftover formula) than if you just poured the extra down the sink from a traditional bottle.  I have found the liners to be costly and kind of a nuisance to keep up with (one more thing to remember when traveling with baby).  And now that my son is taking four ounces at a time, I have found that it is just about impossible to fit four ounces of water plus formula in this bottle without making a mess.  It also bugs me that I can't use these with my bottle warmer (they melt...oops!) and the nipples do not fit well in my dishwasher basket.  These are small things, but when you deal with them several times a day it can get annoying.What does my 5 week old son think of these bottles?  Well, this was the first nipple he was ever introduced to, and he seemed to like it at first.  But in the past two weeks he has been acting like he doesn't want to latch on to it as well.  He actually preferred the narrower, firmer nipple on the Similac nurser bottle.  With the Playtex drop-ins nursers he eats very slowly and seems to lose interest halfway through a feeding.  Also, I can't tell that they really prevent gas all that much.  He has a lot of trouble with spitting up.  For this reason we finally decided to switch bottles.  He now uses the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles and is doing MUCH better....feedings are much easier and quicker and there is a lot less spit-up mess to deal with afterwards.I know every baby is different and I can see where these bottles would be great for a breast-fed baby.  Mom can pump directly into the liners and the nipples seem to be designed to mimic breastfeeding.  I will be saving my bottles, and hopefully I can breast-feed my next child so they will be used.  However, for my formula fed baby, they did not work as well as the Dr. Brown's.	
- 1	I read a lot of good reviews on this product and was very dissapointed that I don't detect ANY change in the diaper pail odor. We have a diaper champ and threw these in the bottom. No affect!	
1. 	Bought these after giving birth to my second child. Had trouble pumping/breastfeeding the first so I was looking for solutions. Not sure I needed the XL shields, might have been ok with L, but these work great. They are comfortable, wash up well & I feel they will last.	
1. 	After many nights of not sleeping through the night or naps getting cut short due to outside noise I NEEDED this machine.  It works great!  My daughter starts rubbing her eyes once it's turned on.  It cuts down all of the other noises so that she sleeps longer and sounder.  I am so glad that I bought this to me it is worth WAY more than what I paid!	
- 1	OK, I got this at my shower, and I thought it was pretty neat. But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box, because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part.  There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist, and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water.  So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that, with no warming.  It looks really nice in my nursery, nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something, but not worth the money to use just like this.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus, I like having my baby used to room temp wipes, because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes, she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit.  She didn't like room temp wipes at first, but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!	
1. 	We used this for our twin newborns until about 3 months.. it worked great!Now that they are 7 months old and teething we often put one baby in this pack n play in our bedroom overnight so whichever baby wakes up in the middle of the night won't wake the other twin (normally they're in their own cribs in the same room). Upon doing this, we found it can't be very comfortable because the bottom is a bit thin and there is a bar underneath their back. The bassinets were probably much more comfortable because they didn't have this bar there. I put quilts on the bottom for the time being, but think I may cut an old mattress topper to use instead, just to be more like a mattress.Love that is it oversized- both twins had tummy time in this for a while until they started rolling (about 4 months old).A down side is that with twins, we are now looking at getting another regular size pack n play for travel because they won't both sleep in it at 7 months old.. almost wish we had 2 regular sized ones to begin with.. another down side is that the need specific sheets, which aren't cheap when you have newborns spitting up and having blowouts on them.. we just used a mattress pad (the flat ones, not the fitted kind) then put blankets under the bassinet parts.. changed the blankets when needed and it worked SO much better than a sheet would have. We changed the individual sides by doing this and avoided spending lots of money.Overall, VERY useful for the first few months - but thereafter is seems a bit big and useless unless you travel a lot.	
- 1	My baby likes to chew on it. However I clicked on the blue one since I have a boy. I realize that it says that colors may vary but I HATE the fact that they shipped me a pink one. If colors are going to vary they should be at least only the nuteral colors.	
1. 	I like them for both the look and color.  I just didn't use them for my few months old baby yet.	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	
- 1	Such a compelling product.Alas.I tried 4/5 of the catheters, and despite repeated instruction-reading and tummy-rubbing, nothing ever came of it. These ended up being more of a novelty item than a useful tool.If my baby has gas, I have more luck laying him on his back and pushing his knees to his chest or leaning him forward on my knee and patting his lower back. Gas drops seem to work, too, though my doctor says they're all hooey.If you're registering and considering these, consider this: You will need a lot of plain white onesies in many different sizes. Yes, even if your child is super fashionable. Go register for those.	
1. 	My husband and I loved this when it was warm outside.  When it was chilly, we stopped using it.  Not really sure if it was worth having still. We used the backpack a lot more and for more months.	
- 1	The Avent manual pump is much more comfortable and efficient than this pump. This one squeaks and hurts my hand after a while. I also always struggled to get much milk. I only used it when we traveled. I had to start pumping three days in advance to get enough for one bottle on a plane. On our last trip, I got fed up and bought the Avent pump. I pumped four ounces from one side in less than ten minutes on my first try with the Avent. That never happened with the Ameda. The only good thing about this pump is that it has fewer parts and is easy to clean. But I had to clean it more often because I needed to pump more to get enough milk.	
1. 	My baby uses this as a teether.  it is the right size for her little hands and she seems to like the bristles.	
- 1	But honestly, they were too small and the mini freezer pots did not pop out as easily as I would have liked and the product was definitely not durable.  A short-term purchase.	
- 1	This is the worst bottle warmer ever.  The bottles were either too hot and I mean smoking hot or not warm enough.  Using this thing was the same as just heating a bottle up in a pot!  You could never leave the bottle, walk away and come back hoping that it would be the right temperature.  I would have to put her bottles in, stand there and check every minute or so.  The water tube that comes along with it does not hold enough water to warm her bottle sufficiently.  We had to pour at least three tubes worth of water in there to get her 5 ounce bottle warm.  I ordered the Dr. Browns bottle warmer and am in love!  This mess is going back immediately.	
- 1	I thought this one seemed like a great idea - it's tall, self-closing, not plastic.  But the self-closing thing, as it turns out, is more trouble than it's worth.Annoying: In the morning, for example, when I'm running upstairs a thousand times to get 'one last thing,' and baby is downstairs all morning, I don't want to deal with the gate clanging shut behind me or opening it up when I have arms full of stuff.Noisy: The gate's hinge is loud - I'm sure I would apply some WD40 if I were to keep it, but it's brand new (and we're not keeping it).  Louder still is the sound it makes when I shut the gate.  Even if I'm super careful, there are contact points up top and at the bottom that are metal-on-metal.  If those parts had been plastic or somehow padded, it would be a better model.Weak: But it still wouldn't fit our hallway.  We decided to block the hallway next to the top of the stairs instead of the exact top of the stairs - works better for full hands to have a nice landing up there.  Although this gate says it can be expanded the full range, the truth is that right in between sizes the gate is either really weak (the little bolts that screw out are wobbly when the gate is pushed on) or if we add the other section, the gate is too big.	
- 1	I was looking forward to using these bottles but when we tried them my baby did not like them. I also tried the first years breastflow bottles and she didn't like them either. I finally tried the Dr.Browns bottles and she took them right away, now I hope she wont reject nursing, we will see.	
- 1	I understand that they say colors may vary but, I thought it would be one of the three colors pictured! No! It was a totally different one and was dirty like it had been sitting on the floor. Not happy with this purchase.	
- 1	After a few weeks of hand-washing this item in lukewarm water, it warped and the top won't stay on. So formula has spilled all over my diaper bag.  Very poor quality plastic.  Could be deigned a lot better.	
- 1	This was a gift so no comments about assembly.  I haaaated this bassinet. The white is actually green and very plastic and vinyl including the mattress. The sides of the bassinet are a non breathable vinyl type material which was a huge concern since I kept finding baby's face smushed against the side! There are beah windows but they're small, the rest is NOT breathable. He mattress was so terrible I really thought it was a shipping error. Of course the bassinet is an odd size so I couldn't find a replacement mattress. Let alone SHEETS - it comes with a vinyl patterned sheet...I don't understand, is that what the baby is supposed to sleep on? So I bought FABRIC sheets (imagine that) but since the company doesn't sell them, they don't fit (SIDS risk). And because the mattress pad is so flimsy, the sheet buckles the mattress in half. Yet the sheets are also somehow too loose at the same time, and bunched (tried 3 brands!). So I added strong Velcro to the ends of the mattress and the plank underneath to keep it stretched out and not buckled in half. Worked decently well, still one end buckled but come on.  The worst part? We use an angelcare monitor with sensor pads. The mattress was so thin and flexible (uh hello SIDS prevention 101 is a firm flat mattress with snug sheets, is this company TRYING to disregard those recommendations?) that with the sensor pads underneath it created waves and dibs in the mattress. If the pads were too far to the left baby would wake up rolled all the way to the right with her face smashed in the side. I put some folded blankets in a few spots under the mattress to make it level again but do you see why I hated this piece of junk??  It's a freaking bassinet how could a company mess it up this badly?  To top it off my baby outgrew it super quickly, but to be honest I was glad. She's in a pack n play now and I sleep much sounder. I'm really surprised this thing hasn't been recalled for one reason or another. My bassinet from when I was a baby would have been far safer.	
- 1	These burp cloths are very thick and soft, two layers of good terry cloth bound together by the print fabric trim. But unfortunately, the seams tore apart after one wash. So far, I've bought 4 products from Bebe au Lait - 2 packages of these burp cloths, one of theSimple by Bebe Au Lait Organic Burp Cloth Set 3-Pack, and theBebe au Lait Hooded Towel. Every single product had the seams tearing after one wash.Amazon's been great about refund/replacement, but still, what a hassle! If it happened once, or even twice, I might consider that a fluke. But all four products tore along the seams after the first wash. (One of the towels was torn out of the box.) In fact, Amazon.com sent me a replacement for the burp cloths, and that one tore, also.When it comes to sewing bindings onto terry cloth, this brand definitely has quality control problems. Other than the constant ripping, these are actually very nice - soft, thick, and the print fabrics are cute. My only other complaint would be that they are a little on the narrow side.* Edited to add: I recently bought another set of burp cloths from Bebe au Lait. There was a discount on a cute print, and I was wondering if maybe I just got a bad batch before. And guess what? One of the cloths ripped again in the first wash. This never happens to anything else I own, so I don't think there's a problem with my washer.So that's 5 terry cloth products I received so far from Bebe au Lait, and all 5 have ripped in the wash. It's downright comical.	
1. 	I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.	
- 1	This is the second set of Zoli's that I've purchased in the last year. The two I just bought are leaking terribly both from the straw tip, and the sides of the cup (yes I checked to ensure it was threaded correctly). I'm not sure what is wrong with them but I'm returning them...The first set we bought last year were a little different (I can tell because the weight on the end of the tubing is shaped differently) did not leak like this initially. However over time even with those, the straw started to have problems (would leak repeatedly from the tip if you held it upside down, which it should not). I don't think I will be buying this brand anymore after this last experience. The cup also leaks just sitting on a table top idle, liquid running back up and out of the straw (room temp liquid, so no excuse for it)...I loved my first set when they were brand new, never had a single leak for a good while, and the biggest perk was being able to tilt it and still get liquid, but the leaking is non-stop now. Very unfortunate.	
1. 	Bought this prior to my daughter being born and we used it just about every day for the first 7 months of parenthood. Makes baths easy and comfortable for my little girl. She sits in the tub on her own now, but we will be saving this for use with the next bundle of joy.It looks almost exactly like it did when we unpacked it. Great buy.	
1. 	Fits the standard crib mattress well. It is soft and so far, it hasnt faded. I would recommend this product and buy again!	
- 1	We use this pacifier tether for the carseat and Ergo mostly. While it is cute and does its job, this device does pose a strangulation risk for smaller babies and the clip has sharp edges. Also the stitches are less than stellarly done.	
- 1	These wouldn't fit onto my stove at all. You would have to have a stove that is not between counters for it to fit. Great idea, bad design.	
- 1	There are a few problems with the design.  The biggest one is that the part that is supposed to be under the kid's head is too thick and makes my son's head fall forward.  I wish it was totally flat or maybe had puffier parts that go on the sides of the head (similar to the neck support).The pillows on the sides of the neck are ok although my son's face looked a bit squished when I looked at him (pic attached).It is too bulky for the kid to have it on while awake, at least for an almost-2-year-old, so it needs to be put on after the child falls asleep.  I guess this would be a problem with any of pillows like that.When he was asleep I put it on and he stayed like that for 45 minutes or so.  When I tried to adjust his head tot he other side, the magnets let go and I couldn't make them stick any more.I am going to continue my search for a travel pillow.	
- 1	Nobody wanted to love this product more than I did. I love the bright colors and thought it would be interesting to my son. Unfortunately, this mobile is just too darn noisy. I have to turn the volume on high to drown out the sound of the motor.  I had read reviews saying the motor was noisy, but I thought surely it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong, it's terrible. The motor noise isn't the only loud part. There are these sliding wafers attached to each arm of the mobile and as it turns, you hear the constant slide and clink of the little disc. I have no idea why this was even added onto the mobile as it doesn't stand out and isn't very noticable other than the noise it makes.  Lastly, my 6 month old was only interested in this mobile for 2 days.  I waited to install the mobile until he was a little older... I am unsure if that was a mistake or not.  I wonder if a newborn would even be able to sleep with the noise?	
- 1	These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution. I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces. Bad idea. These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere. I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits. And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary. Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby? God no. Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams.	
1. 	We really like this item because it keeps a bit of everything you need for baby within arms reach. Sturdy and easy to use.	
1. 	These are simple glass baby bottles.  They're not fancy, but they have no nasty chemicals. I know that the plastic bottles are now all BPA free, but who knows what chemical they'll discover next year that's been leeching out of our plastic and poisoning us all this time.These bottles are compatible with my medela pump and can take the same lids, which is convenient.  However, for a breast-fed baby, even these so-called slow flow nipples are way too fast, and caused my baby to choke.  I bought Dr. Brown's nipples, which work great.  I now have these in 4 oz and 8 oz sizes.	
- 1	I'm updating my review on this product.  After using some other brands of bottle brush, I'm going to give this one 4 stars.  This is because the sponge on this brush is denser than on other brushes.  A denser sponge holds soap better.  I found that when using other brands of brush, I went through soap much more quickly.  The denser sponge on this brush also lathers the inside of the bottle much better than other brands too, which means cleaner bottles in less time.  This brush still has a durability issue, however, I've come to the conclusion that it's probably a good idea to throw out bottle brushes every few weeks anyway.  I'm going back to this brush!(Old review below)Purchased this brush to use on my Dr. Brown's bottles.  I don't have a dishwasher so I use it every day.  The brush works well and cleans both the bottom and the neck of the bottle.  Unfortunately, mine have only lasted about 2 months because the sponge starts to break apart.  I'm on my second one.  I thought I had been to hard on the first one, so I was nicer to my second one.  But it still is falling apart.  Won't be buying another.	
1. 	We had a really hard time bathing our 2 month old. She screamed the whole time, wriggled around. We had to hold her in more of a seated position than the other bath seat we had would do naturally. We ordered this to try to make bath time a little more bearable, and it worked! she stopped crying the first bath time we had, and now she has even started splashing and having a little fun! You do have to watch your baby really close in here if they are small, so that they don't slide down, but that is NOT DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER SEAT. You should be watching your child very closely regardless of where/how you are bathing them.It may not work for every baby, but it definitely works for us. We are so pleased. I would give this more than 5 stars if I could.	
1. 	Our son loved this thing.  It wrapped him nice and snug around his arms.  I credit this for his sleeping for 4-6 hour intervals when he was an infant.  Its better than some of the other swaddlers that bind the leg area, which I read is not good for the baby orthopedically.  This is in the top 5 must haves for new parents.	
1. 	The changing table came quickly and was packaged properly.  It looks beautiful in our nursery and has plenty of space in the drawers/cubbies!	
1. 	I added every inexpensive safe toy I could find through Amazon.com to my wish list for our infant daughter and this was one of them. She received at at Christmas when she was 4 months old. At 6 months, this toy continues to be one of her favorites. It's light weight and thin enough that she can clutch it easy.	
1. 	These are great to have with the Beaba. I have cooked up so many varieties and have them in bags in the freezer. Really great idea	
- 1	The more I use this shield, the more disappointed I am.  I originally reviewed this item after one brief test application, during which I experienced no issues.  Having used a weather shield for a single BOB stroller for two years, I wrongly assumed the design quality would be similar.  However, during practical usage, I have found this to be poorly designed and of lesser quality than the older single model I own.My main issues:1.  The attachment to the handlebars is not secure.  This model uses two short velcro straps that secure around the handle itself.  The velcro strips are only 1 square, which doesn't lead to a secure connection.  These have come undone numerous times while running.  The older single model has long, adjustable looping tension cord that not only didn't come loose, but it was adjustable as well.2.  The velcro is connected to the end of the flap that hangs over the back of the stroller (parallel to the handle).  When you connect the velcro and fully install the shield, this flap is pulled into the gap between the back of the seat and the sun shades.  So, there is an opening for rain and wind to enter just above your kids heads.  If the rain is heavy, the water collecting on the top of the shade can drip directly into the stroller.3.  The cover is cut to fit on the duallie with the sun shades half down.  Unfortunately, because each part of the sun shade is a different size, the windowed half must be folded up.  This isn't ideal because, in this position, the excess shade is bunched around the heads of your passengers.  It would be better if it were cut to fit with the windowed segment extended.4.  Though not a difference between my singleThe rain shield should have a clear window that matches up to the window on the sun shade so that you can maintain visual contact while pushing the stroller.  In the case of the duallie, you can't install it with the windows in the proper position anyway, but it is a notable exclusion.I cannot say if these issues are simply differences between the single and duallie models or if design changes were made since the '09 models, but either way this current duallie cover leaves a lot to be desired.	
- 1	The picture for this product is deceiving. I thought the fabric was smooth. I is actually a cheap feeling scratchy and abrasive type material. I wouldnt want it on my bare skin. I tried my son in it once and he screamed hysterically and I haven't used it since. Its too bad because its a great size and constructed well. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use it.	
1. 	My son is 4 months old and drooling constantly right now.  I love that these can match any outfit and keep him dry. He does need about 3 a day though! They are easy to wash and dry.	
1. 	Very soft material, however I do not think it should be described as &#34;sage&#34; in color. It's more of a light lime green. I'm happy with the product and it still works with the theme of the nursery, however it was not what I was expecting.	
- 1	We recently bought this car seat without knowing that Graco car seats actually have 2 different kinds of methods of tightening the baby seat belt in the car seat. We found that this particular colour that we bought Tango, you had to place the child in the seat, tilt the car seat forward, all the while making sure to hold the child in the seat so that he does not fall out, tighten the belt from the back of the car seat before the belt is tight enough to be used. There is the other type of car seat where there is a strap at the bottom where you can simply just pull to tighten. I do not know why Graco is still circulating car seats that has the extremely impractical and inconvenient model. In the end we returned this seat to Amazon, and went to Babies R US to view the right model and bought from there. We ended up paying a cheaper price as well.	
1. 	The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.	
1. 	I was pulling my hair out looking for baby proofing stuff that wouldn't require a hardware install. These are perfect for my 50 plasma. Just a note, because I didn't see it in any of the other reviews... You have to pull the clips open to insert the plastic strap. The instruction page that comes with them doesn't mention how you're supposed to join the clips and it took me a bit of puzzling and trying to thread the strap before I realized you need to snap them open. Maybe I am just slow today, but there it is if anyone is wondering! I will absolutely recommend and buy these again.	
1. 	I adore this system.  My son only gets breastmilk, and the system works great for bottling/storing/serving breastmilk.  In conjunction with the breast milk storage kit, I am able to express milk directly into a bottle.  I then twist on a lid and put it in the freezer or fridge.  When the milk freezes solid, I am able to remove the liner and lid from the bottle.  This takes less freezer space and means I don't have to buy that many actual bottles.I will have to keep buying liners, of course.  But the cost isn't prohibitive.  And I did have to buy several storage systems, but compared to paying for formula, I find this cost unimportant.  Particularly because I will be able to use the system again for our next child.It is a tidy, easy system that works great for me and for my son.  He has no problem taking the silicone nipple in spite of the fact that he prefers the breast.  He IS slower about taking the bottle, but he takes it fine nonetheless.	
- 1	This was a waste of money.  Useless and worthless.  Didnt keep my son from touching the dvd player/cable box.  It would have worked better if there were some sort of clip or band that attached to the piece of electronic equipment to secure the shield.  Instead it comes off or slides away as soon as tiny curious hands touch it. I will be giving to thrift shop.

- 1	Got this for our first infant and it's been great.  First one needed ot be returned because of some bad stitching on an internal pocket but new one has had no problems.  Spacious and easy to navigate.  Magnetic buckle is nice as are the stroller buckles.  Distinctive multi colored polka dot is also easy to spot and see.  Whole family likes itUpdate 2/21/2011: After the stitching came undone on an interior pocket, we got a replacement.  Two  months later we've got the same problem--looks like poor quality and stitching.  4 star to 2 star.  Contacted support and will update once I hear backUpdate 3/15/2011: Contacted support and got replacement bag.  Unsure if quality is still an issue because it looks ok before use but so didn't the last one.  I'd add one star but I consider this a product review not a service review so this stays at 2 stars.  Glad to know their service is responsive and right on though.	
- 1	Very disappointed with this product. It is very thin, won't be warm enough for 70 degree room temperature.Quality is not very good either.	
1. 	I purchased this toy while I was pregnant with my son. I started using it while he was only a few weeks old. Although I'm not sure how well an infant eyes are, he did seem to look up at the lights occasionally, but he mostly liked the music at this age. Once he started rolling over and sitting on his own this toy became one of his favorites. While he was younger the color and shapes of the actual toy seemed to keep him happy, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on. Once he started sitting it was the stripped handle that kept his attention as he would flip it back and forth, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on, soon he learned to turn it on on purpose. It wasn't until around 9 months that I put it in his room at night for the light show. He loved it immedietly, and although he preferrred to roll on his tummy to sleep he started falling asleep on his back watching his light show. Soon I found a way to attach it to his crib with some cable ties, and since then he happily turns this toy on whenever he needs it! Sometimes I hear it him turn it on in the middle of the night on the baby monitor. Now at 18 months my son still plays with this toy daily. Before bed, before naps, and fist thing in the morning! It is still attached to his crib and he happily turns the music on and switches between the sounds, I have it set to play for 5 minutes, and I haven't replaced the batteries yet! I have the fish aquarium also attached to his crib and it runs out of battery power weekly with less use, and now even after I put new batteries in the fish he just assumes it doesn't work and doesn't even bother trying anymore.Pros:*By far the best crib toy we've had. Well worth it!*Baby loves it!*Soothes him to sleep (boring to us, not to him)he loves the music and and light show, but not over stimulating*Comforting, and easy to take along on trips or the sitters house (we used it on a 16 hour flight)*Excellent battery life! Used daily for the last 18 months, set to play for 5 minutes and have yet to replace the batteries!*My child still prefers the simpliest of shapes designed for the youngest child.Cons: *No crib attachment, (however we attached securely with cable ties, however cable ties will need to be cut and replaced to change batteries)*Wall images won't be very vibrante in a bright room (my son never seemed to care) we could always see them although sometimes faint*Images may seem somewhat blurry on a high ceiling, or if not on a flat surfuce.*Wish there was a remote control to use while baby was still to young to turn off and on himself. But he learned quickly.*Wish there were additional design discs to purchase.	
- 1	I ordered 6 of those, each different color, for my baby which will be born in April, will use it but this one came with a broken snap at the top- so not to happy about it , will try to fix it, color is nice thought	
- 1	I wanted to cut corners and get a much less expensive version of Sofie the Giraffe.  I was sorely disappointed.  This teether is fit for a dog, not a baby.  It smells awful, and the paint job appears to be done with a paint that I would compare to white-out.  It is lumpy and chipping off in places.  The picture makes this toy appear quite pretty, but in person, the face looks very poorly done, and the squeak is so so loud (just like a dog chew toy).  My suggestion is to spend the extra money and get the real thing.	
1. 	Initially, the upper curve was rather thick & firm, and too high for my neck - I'd wake up achy or with a stiff neck. But the rest of the pillow worked so well for me I stuck with it, and after maybe 3-4 weeks, the head part softened to where it is now comfortable most of the time.As another reviewer mentioned also happens to her, I sometimes wake up on my back, very comfortably cradled by snoogle, the one curve under my head and the other behind my knees. But the thing is - pregnant women aren't supposed to sleep on their backs b/c it can restrict oxygen and nutrient flow to the fetus. I don't want to be comfortable on my back!! This isn't the pillow's fault, I do get that, but one reason I bought it was to keep me on my side, so I wanted to pass this along to anyone else who might be considering it for this reason. It helps, but it doesn't prevent back-sleeping.Pros: (1) one pillow to maneuver; firm but soft enough to be comfortable; (2) it's a good size for me (now that the neck area has softened) @ 5'4 and 143 pre-preg weight; (3) while not percale, the pillowcase feels fine to me, tho I do also plan to make a second cover out of a softer knit jersey; (4) while my sleep is still broken up, I'm able to get longer stretches with snoogle than I was when using regular pillows; (5) there is less room in the bed, but I can still fit myself & snoogle onto my half of our queen-size mattress.Con: (1) the price (it's just basic pillow filling, not down or gel or anything fancy; polyfil costs a couple bucks a bag so I really think they are making $30+ profit per pillow); (2) the cover is hard to take off and put on; velcro, buttons, or a zipper would have been a much better approach; (3) maneuvering it under the blankets in winter is tricksy - I have to throw back the blankets, lift up the pillow, move my body, then put the pillow back. Often I (inadvertently, I swear!) smack my husband in the head with the upper curve while trying to extricate the lower curve from the sheets. Gets old quick, esp as I'm up 4-8x/night; and (4) when it's in the middle of the bed, my husband tends to hug it as a body pillow, further complicating this extrication/flipping process. Again, not the pillow's fault, but amusing.	
1. 	This book keeps my 2-year-old entertained for a decent amount of time, and I like that it's washable.  It has a good number/variety of activities in it, especially as compared to other similar types of books.There are some activities for babies, but I think toddlers/pre-schoolers will get the most use out of it.  My daughter has a hard time getting the snaps on/off (they require a little extra &#34;elbow grease&#34; and/or for you to hold down the fabric on the page).  There are also some &#34;older&#34; activities, like the clock, or tying a shoe.Overall, good purchase.	
1. 	The cap does what it should, but it took a very long time to get here.  I'm a little spoiled by Prime, but it took well over a week.	
1. 	When my daughter was a newborn these were great. She slept better and longer. As she started to grow out of it, I would use it as a sleep sack so that her arms were exposed. I used it for 3-4 months.	
1. 	We like this booster seat because it comes in an unobtrusive color (grey) so we don't mind having it always out in our dining room. We also enjoy the ease of which you can move it between seats because it doesn't feature straps and our daughter seems to find it really comfortable.	
1. 	I love this soap.  Our 9 month old has been using it since he was born and it gets him clean and soft and smells wonderful.  Not at all powdery (I know some people really dig that smell for their babies but not me).  And, it lasts forever!  I've been using the same big bottle and it is more than half full.  It makes small bubbles which he likes to play with as well.	
- 1	The idea of the bottles is good. They do help to reduce air. However, to me, it was not worth it b/c of the problems we had with the nipples. It seemed like every nipple had some sort of problem. EVERY bottle I bought was a newborn bottle- with newborn nipples ( I double and triple checked), but for some reason they ALL had different flows! Some would choke and gag him, some didn't even work and NOTHING would come out, some were okay... you get the point. It was always a guessing game with these bottles. We had to constantly try to keep up with which nipples were the good ones and which ones didn't work. And when you have a hungry, fussy baby, its no fun to be wasting time trying to keep up with stuff like that. On top of the fact that we had 20 bottles and only 2-3 nipples that worked the way they were supposed to. Another issue we had was that the nipples all colapsed! It was horrible. He would suck 10 times and the nipple would be colapsed. I felt that these bottles were very poor quality. Like I said, the idea of the VentAire is good, but the bottles just aren't up to my expectations.	
1. 	I do not know if it is easy to use, this is to help my sister to buy a child, he had not been born, so not useful.	
- 1	I bought this yesterday, and tried it out last night at a restaurant and my husband and I looked like idiots trying to figure it out. It didn't fit, and was totally useless. WAY more hassle than it was worth. I am going to try another one....	
- 1	My son also rips these right off the table.  He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack).  This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical.  I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well.  The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10.  These wrap around the edge of the table and cover more area than the previously reviewed brand.	
1. 	I thought my breast shields were too small, but turns out they were too BIG!  Using these smaller sized ones has improved my pumping 100%.  It's tricky figuring out the size fort hess, but basically your areola should not be pulled entirely into the valve, if it is, your shield is too large.	
1. 	What's not to love about the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat? It's easy to clean with a wipe or two. It folds up nicely so you can easily stow it away the car trunk when you're eating out. And with adjustable table settings (for that growing little pot belly), and height settings, it grows with you.When we are eating out and ask for a high chair, as a concerned parent, you have to wonder where it's been and what they've been cleaning it with. With this booster seat, you can alleviate that fear. You can use it out, or use it at home, the adjustable straps on the side make it easy to secure this booster seat to any adult-sized chair (though we've also used this in booths at restaurants, and while it's not as secure, works just fine).And to top it off, it's affordable. For a product that has this much utility at such a low price point, it's an easy purchase to make.	
- 1	My daughter is a little over 6 months old, she is eating some solids but as of now - odor is not a huge issue.Both my husband and I found the Diaper Genie to be a good idea, that is poorly executed.  First and foremost - it was genius for Playtex to create something that can only be used with expensive refills or its basically a $35 waste of plastic.Neither of us thought the Diaper Genie was worth it.The idea is there is a giant plastic bag tube that you tie off. When you have a full bag, you then use the cutter and tie the end and toss.  Ideally, it contains odors better and provides a hands free (little step handle) option to toss diapers.  However, 9 out of 10 times you need to lift the lid and the whole cutting/tying process takes longer then just retrieving a new bag.Construction seems kind of flimsy, and once you factor in the cost of this product plus the cost of refills the Diaper Genie Elite becomes one expensive diaper pail over the 2+ years your child will mostly likely be in diapers!IMO - skip this, buy a roll of 4 gallon trash bags (we buy scented ones at $4 for 100) and a small waste basket which is effectively the same thing at a fraction of the price.	
- 1	I like think the idea of our child not flinging his bowl on the floor while his was becoming more independent.These suction bowls did not do has promised.They become just another baby/toddler bowl in our cupboard.	
1. 	This is suppose to latch onto your changing table.  Instead I use it as a car seat toy when we are sitting around or walking in the stroller.  We are not on the table long enough for them to enjoy it there.  Very nice no batteries needed but you do need to wind it up a bunch of times.  If you have a toddler in the house this is a great job for them.	
- 1	We ordered this wanting to use it with out preemie once he was discharged from the NICU and thinking it'd give us more peace of mind at home.What a mistake- despite reading the instructions and watching a video online, it still went off randomly at all hours.Plus having the monitor clipped to his diaper snugly left our little guy with skin chaffing which must have been uncomfortable for him.We returned this.	
- 1	I got these because I thought they would add extra absorbency for overnight diapering. They haven't proven to be useful for that and overall I think they're pretty pointless. My daughter is only 3 months old (started using them when she was 2 months) so maybe they will come in more handy when her poop is less runny...? They are soft, but most cloth diapers/inserts don't need t be any softer.	
1. 	keeps all the diapers, lotions and creams organized. it doesnt move around and its sturdy. bought the wipes warmer to go on top. so worth it :)	
- 1	This really didn't work for me.. Looked bad, would fall down.  I have a Land Rover and the Roller Shade works so much better, and looks so much better.  This item is more appropriate for pickup truck windows because they are smaller.	
- 1	where do i even begin? this baby monitor is not safe, that's where. our infant sleeps one level directly above us and well within the 150  foot range advertised. we have had several nights waking up to a monitor with video on but the sound off, or at best breaking up constantly (try to sleep with intermittent white noise, i dare you). so we would have an infant kicking and screaming but when you're asleep, you don't get to see this activity but rely on the sound to wake you; worthless. the camera also completely blacks out from time to time, meaning we can hear (sometimes) our infant but the screen is black. it requires turning off the camera several times until it 'reboots' itself and works; worthless. the VOX function, which is supposed to allow the battery rest while monitoring the infant and bringing the video and sound back to the monitor if sound is detected. this function doesn't work at all. never; worthless. upon attempting the 'live chat' function on the Levana website, i was told to return the monitor and have one of their technicians spend some time checking it and either repair or replace (2-4 weeks). when i requested a replacement sent immediately, i was told i had to purchase it until the defective one was ruled defective. the chat session lasted more than 30 minutes, with each customer service response coming around 3-5 minutes after mine; so, yes, customer service: worthless.when it comes to something as important as infant safety and adult sleep, don't waist your time or money with this worthless product. spend more money and get a better product; this is indeed one purchase no one should skimp on. after much advice, i've purchased the samsung safeview and am hoping for a much better experience than this one, which was worthless.	
1. 	I bought a starter pack of these bottles due to the fact my daughter spit up alot of other bottles we tried. We now use these, and she can actually sleep after taking her bottle. I know they take longer to clean, but it is worth it if you have a happier baby!	
- 1	My mother bought this for my son along with the FP Rainforest swing & bouncer when he was born.....which by the way are FANTASTIC products and hold up exceptionally well! This shake & chime ball was just in NO way anywhere near as much as a winner as those other 2 were,here in our household. I would shake it and my son would look at it...& then crwal in the complete other direction towards another toy that involes a lot more interaction.He is now 11 months and I saw it the other day....dusty & alone in a corner, so I will be selling or donating it. Let me put it to you like this....If you are looking to spend $30 on a toy....Fisher Price has  A TON MORE out there on the market that are FAR better/educational & more intersting than this.	
1. 	This gate was placed at the bottom of stairs. we did not want to drill the banister and wanted to match the color of the stair balusters. ideal was powder black but we couldnt find it. plus it was hard to find a wide one. Installation was easy and it looked nice. However, the latch doent click properly. i could not get the two parts click precisely. Not a big deal you just push it to close it. Another drawback i see is the compatibility with the banister kit. The banister kit slips on the banister because our banister is round and thinner on top. Is this gate perfect? No. But, considering all the different specifications of doorways and stairs of homes, probably this is the best we could get from the consumer product market.	
1. 	great lock to keep our toddler from splash playwell pricedeasy to install and use18 month old hasn't figured it out yet	
1. 	We love this booster seat.  We have 2 of them (purchased the 1st one somewhere else).  We got the 1st one when our now 10 month old son was just starting solids at 6 months, hoping to buy time to research high chairs.  We like the booster seat so much we decided we didn&#8217;t need a high chair.  We got a 2nd one as a &#8220;traveling&#8221; booster seat.  For the price, this booster seat rocks!  The colors are nice and the seat doesn&#8217;t take over the dining room like a high chair would.  Plus, it&#8217;s easier to clean -- there aren&#8217;t any nooks and crannies that hide crumbs or other messes.The only complaints I have are not really complaints about the booster seat as much as maybe arguments for a high chair:-When my son tilts his head back when sitting in this seat (e.g., out of excitement or when drinking from his sippy cup if it&#8217;s not full), he doesn&#8217;t have very far to go before hitting his head on the back of the real chair.  I generally put a blanket or burp cloth on the back of the real chair so that his head hits something soft and not the bare wood.  I could also solve this problem by raising the booster seat about a foot, but then I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pull him up to the dining room table.-The booster seat has a hard seat and isn&#8217;t as cushy as some of the padded high chairs.  It doesn&#8217;t seem to bother my son now, but once he starts speaking, we&#8217;ll see what he has to say.	
- 1	We got this product off of our registry.  Our son is a nightmare in the car and screams the whole time.  We tried to install this so he could see himself and we could see him.  There is no way for us to install it in a way in which he can see himself.  We have a hatchback and there is no headrest in the center seat of the car.  There is a velcro option but we it's not the right length.  On top of it all, the remote does not work.  This is a waste of money.  Plus the music is very annoying (and my tolerance is high).  Find another product if you can.	
- 1	UPDATE 6/4/13 - I'm keeping the Vtech rating at 4 stars.  This is due to battery life.  I can get about maybe 6-8 hours out of a charge, which is not very much.  I'm guessing they really cheaped out on the battery.  It does beep to alert you when the battery is running low.  As long as you remember to plug it in every evening, it's not a problem.  Otherwise, it's a fabulous unit and has been working excellent for our family.  Still the best choice of the 3 I reviewed below.UPDATED 3/28/13I've owned the below 3 units over the course of the last 2 years.  I recommend the VTech for now (I've only had it a few weeks, but it is by far the winner in performance AND value).  For features, I only listed the features that I felt would be important to the average buyer.  Some of the units had other features that I didn't list because I didn't think there were critical in my decision making process.Also, it might be important to note that we live in a 2 story house and we have Wi Fi.Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology1 starPrice I paid: $95Features:talk back - yesnight light - yesbattery backup on Baby Unit - yesTemperature - no (but available on upgraded units)Visual sound indicator - yes, LEDEase of use and customization of features (ie: setting the sensitivity level, etc): easy, intuitive.Signal: excellent, DECT, crystal clearOther thoughts: Loved this monitor until....... after about 6 months of use the parent unit would randomly turn itself off with no warning, no beeping, nothing.  I started waking up in the morning to an off parent unit.  This happened even if it was plugged into the charger.  When I pressed on, it would power up just fine and work well for a few days.  Then it would shut off again.  After a few weeks, it started shutting itself of more and more frequently.  Thought it was a faulty unit, so I called Avent and they promptly sent out a replacement for free (nice customer service!).  After few months of use the second unit started doing the same thing.  Therefore, cannot recommend this product - it's dangerous if it turns off while you're sleeping.  If you run a search on the reviews for this product for turns off you will see that it has happened to others.Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White2 starsPrice I paid: $59Features:talk back - nonight light - yesbattery backup on Baby Unit - yesTemperature - yesVisual sound indicator - yes.  But it's not LED (which is very bright), it's part of the digital display, so you probably wouldn't notice the bars lighting up.  So, yes, there is a visual sound indicator but it's poorly designed rendering it not useful.Ease of use and customization of features: HORRIBLE, clumsy, not intuitive. You WILL need to bust out the manuel everytime you want to changes something.  Channel selection is done at the Baby Unit, not the Parent Unit. That means if you have a bad connection, you have to go into the nursery to change the channel and possibly run the risk of disturbing a sleeping baby. You have to go through a series of random steps, pushing buttons in a certain sequence on both the nursery unit and parent unit. Also, it doesn't scan the channels to seek the best connection. You have the manually go through and listen to each channel and decide which one sounds the best to you. Sensitivity adjustment is also done on the Nursery Unit.  Temp display is bizarre. If you turn the Parent Unit on AFTER the Nursery Unit (which is about 99% of the time, since I, like most people I know, just leave the Nursery Unit on 24/7) the display shows the channel. And will stay on the channel until the temp changes. So, the only way you can see what the temp is if the temp changes. It would have made a lot more sense to have the channel appear on the display first and then time out and default back to the temp setting since I think that as long as you're getting a good signal, you don't really care what the channel number is. But you probably do care about the temp.Signal: 8 channel 927 MHz frequency. Started off good but after several months of use, the reception isn't as clear.  I've tried all the different channels, but I still get intermittent static.  It's annoying because it wakes me up.Other thoughts: display on the parent unit is BRIGHT.  Some may find it annoyingly bright if you like a really dark room.  I originally thought this was a good value (at the time of purchse, my point of reference was the $95 Avent), but now after owning the $29 Vtech, I think the Angelcare is totally overpriced, especially considering how difficult it is to program the features.  Not acceptable.VTech Communications Safe & Sound Digital Audio Monitor4 stars (if it holds up, I will change to 5 stars)Price I paid: $29 (Value!!!)Features:talk back - yesnight light - yes (nightlight also has auto on feature which is kinda cool)battery backup on Baby Unit - noTemperature - noVisual sound indicator - yes, LEDEase of use and customization of features: easy, intuitive.Signal: excellent.  DECT technology, same as Avent.  Now, I've only had this unit for a few weeks, so hopefully the quality doesn't start to go downhill after a few months.  If so, I will post an update.Other thoughts: this monitor also has a vibrate feature, which I thought was interesting.  On the parent unit, you would not be able to tell it's on if the room is dark because the display screen is not backlit unless you are actively pushing a button on the unit (I assume to save battery power, it goes into a sleep mode).  I wish there was a small LED indicator for this.  After my Avent experience above I have trust issues ;).  With this parent unit, I have to reach for it and push a button so the screen lights up to confirm it's actually on.  It's minor, but I think worth mentioning.  The Avent monitor had a small LED that was lit when it was on.For the price, the clarity, the features, and ease of use, VTech wins hands down.  It has all the same features and clarity that the Avent had (actually, the Vtech has even more features with the sound alert and vibrate alert), but it was 1/3 of the cost.  So, unless it starts shutting itself off, this is a FANTASTIC monitor at a FANTASTIC price.	
- 1	It looks great, the cup holder is nice, but the crotch strap design ruins it. I am surprised by how many people complain about it but still rate the seat highly. The shortness of the strap (and yes, I have moved it to the most forward position) is ridiculous. I have a 2.5 year old skinny girl, but one who loves to wear dresses and frilly skirts. Try getting a child buckled in wearing a tutu with a super short crotch strap. My husband and I curse every time we put her in the seat. If your child is a pudgy one, or like ours, likes dresses, I strongly advise against this seat. I might call Graco today to see if they have an extension, but I am guessing no since a lot of reviewers have called in and no one has mentioned one.  I'll update if they provide one and give the seat 5 stars.	
- 1	These bags are terrible.  I thought they'd be such a great idea but they're NOT, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!-They don't actually hold 5 ounces unless you fill it all the way to the ziploc then spill some closing it-The measurements on the bag are so far off it's not even funny, what it says is 5 oz is more like 3-The ziplocs are terrible, you think it's closed but really it's only 1/2 closed.  I make kid lunches every night, I know how to use a ziploc, these are terrible-Milk gets above the zipper area, probably ok for pumping and feeding the next day, but not for longer term storage-5 ounces is not enough, need to be bigger (and as stated above they don't hold 5 ounces anyway)These seem like a great idea and maybe if they were made a bit better they'd be worth it, but they're not.  Don't buy.  I wish I could return but it's too late now.	
1. 	These are okay, good for the price. My toddler has figured out how to get the lids off though, so she still spills snacks all over the place. There's another snack catcher by munchkin that has a lockable lid. Get that one instead.	
- 1	Ehh, I didn't care of this cup much, never did my son when he was transitioning. The Spout Collapses too easily and he didn't seem to have an easy time getting the drink to come out.	
- 1	After only one or two uses one of the male snaps on the front of the diaper used to size it stopped snapping so now my cover can only be sized in the largest setting for my medium sized baby. I'm disappointed because I keep hearing how great these wraps are. It's the second to last wrap that I go to in my stash, which ultimately means that I never use it. Hopefully I'll be able to get more use out of it when my baby is a large size, but for now it's a total bust. Boo!	
- 1	My two year old chewed these straws flat the first time she used the cups. If the straws were slightly heavier they would probably be fine but these didn't last more than a couple of uses each.	
1. 	My daughter just turned 1 and LOVES this toothbrush. She thinks it's a toy... Fun colors and gripper. Actually gets her to brush, it catches her attention and wants to chew on it, then when I egg her on she keeps going :)	
1. 	Overall a very good stool.  I like the gripper stuff on the top and bottom.  My two year old can also move it around easily.  It would have received 5 stars if it was a bit taller.  Even with the stool, my daughter still can't reach the sink so we use this one for other purposes.	
- 1	My son loves these pacifiers - they are just pink with cherry's and other girly items. We are using them because we dont mind people thinking he is a girl from time to time but... just so you are aware (in case you care) the cute blue, white and yellow pacifiers you see in the picture may come to you in pink and purple. :D	
- 1	I love how soft and cuddly this changing pad cover is.  I also appreciate how many colors it comes in.What I am disappointed with is the durability.  I have 3 of these and have used them for just over a year.  They are totally falling apart at the elastic. Now, keep in mind that we use disposable chucks (those blue hospital disposable under pads) on top of this terry cloth changing pad.  It makes it less messy (especially early on) and doesn't require washing as much.  I also washed them in cold water with Baby Dreft detergent, hung them to dry and rotated the 3 covers that we have.While it is a nice product while it lasts, I just expected them to be more durable.	
- 1	We received several SwaddleMe wraps (which we loved for a new-newborn, but not for 10+ lbs), so I thought this would be an even better/faster way to get through the night with a newborn.  Unfortunately, our baby was able to easily wriggle her fits through the neck hole which frustrated her and woke her up even more.Might work for some, but I'd skip these in favor of the SwaddleMe's or just a plain blanket with a tight swaddle technique!	
1. 	We had the smaller (5 ounce) versions and they were our favorite (compared to medela and avent).So naturally we went ahead to try these ones. They have a nice slow flow, and provide the air vents at the bottom.However, I must note that those vents are like 99% gimmick. You hear the air come out of them like twice per drink (which can be like an hour if you have a little one that gets tired and sleepy every time they eat).We have used them quite a bit, and there is really virtually no difference in gas between these and the other 2. Add the fact that you virtualy never hear any air come out of it, and you get the idea.The shape is nice, especially if your baby has trouble holding down the food and you have to feed them in a more upright position.Overall a nice baby bottle for your baby.Highlights:- convenient shape- slow flow (pro or con depending on what you want)- ventaire system a gimmick	
- 1	updated review...17 months later. i purchased this because i liked that its a reusable and i love skip hop items i have their diaper bag!!i thought hey i can refill as needed and attach to the stroller etc. however the strap on it broke and it would no longer hang or attach to the stroller and the slider was not the best. It would not hold any moisture for the wipes. i have plenty of those cheap wipe holders you get and they hold moisture better than this thing. Not to happy about this item after all.	
1. 	This is exactly what I was looking for. It's super soft, and it very conveniently has a place for buckles to go through when strapping her in to the car seat. Also, it's so easy to use! I read about how swaddling your baby too tight can give them hip problems, but you don't have to worry about that with these. Perfect!	
- 1	I would not recommend this wet bag to anyone!  Within a month or two of using it, the zipper came off its track.  My husband repaired it, but we keep having the same problem.  Also, the bag has leaked.  We use the Planet Wise bag daily for our daycare and have no problems with it.  I purchased another Planet Wise bag to use when the other is in the wash.  I've also had problems with the hanging diaper pail bag leaking out the bottom and did not like the way their wipes shrank unevenly on the two sides.  I love my FuzziBunz diapers, but their accessories are terrible!  I will never again purchase anything from them except diapers.  Also, I tried contacting their customer support and received no response to my post.  (They no longer list a customer service phone number on their website.)Please read the reviews...I can't believe people giving this 4 stars before they ever use it!	
- 1	We got this bag to replace a JuJuBee BFF bag that was too small to carry all the essentials for two kids.  The JJ Cole bag is significantly larger and less expensive, and fits our needs better.  Some draw backs compared to JuJuBee include the following:-Cheap, flimsy changing pad-Plastic zippers (JuJuBee's are metal)-Not machine washable-Not anti-microbialThat being said, this bag is about half the cost of the JuJuBee.UPDATE: 6/22/2013After using this item for less than 6 months it is starting to fall apart.  The top zipper seam has separated across a 2 inch area, and more stitching around a rivet on the front pocket has come loose.  We will be sending it back to JJ Cole for a replacement.  It's good they warranty the item, but I would recommend paying a little more for something higher quality.  I'd rather spend the extra money for the JuJuBee and not have to worry about the JJ Cole that is falling apart.	
- 1	I've had 2 of the ultimate crib sheets and been using them for 7 months now and I do not like them. I don't hate them, but I don't like them and will never purchase them again. The idea is wonderful, but parts of the product are too cheaply made. Within the first washing, some of the snaps were pulled off the sheet (with following the directions to re-snap the sheet before washing). That was disappointing. Thankfully, it was only 2 snaps and I was still able to make the sheet function. However, it does take some time to snap the sheet on securely and it isn't very soft or cozy for baby. It has kept accidents from leaking through and it did work well in that area, but as far as adding coziness or comfort or ease of use...it failed miserably. I bought mine through Babies R Us instead of Amazon but wanted to contribute a review regarding the product because I shop through Amazon much more often. I wish I had been better informed, I would have gotten the quick zip sheets instead. The attachments for the snaps are not well made and I would not recommend this product to new moms. Go for a different crib pad that will protect and add some softness/coziness to the crib. This sheet also does not retain warmth well - even after throwing in the dryer and then putting on crib, it cools quickly and remains cool which may be nice in the summer but not during a winter in South Dakota...One more additional note, it does take a very long time for these sheets to dry - an extra dry cycle in the dryer. Not handy or helpful.	
- 1	We ordered this product because it is so hard to find black nursery furniture that is a reasonable price. We planned to use this as a dresser and changing table. Basically you get what you pay for, this item is made of processed wood/particle board so it is not the best quality. I knew this before I ordered it so I'm not giving it a bad review for that. My husband and I are not pleased with the dresser because it has a million pieces to it and the company put the wrong screws into the package. It is frustrating when you begin putting this dresser together only to discover part way through that they gave you the wrong screws. We tried to call the company but they were closed. Ultimately we can wait to get a hold of the company and I am sure they would send us the correct screws, but we don't really have time to wait. It is just a hassle to not have all the parts you need for the item. So now we have to try to find screws that will fit from a local hardware store. If we cannot find them we will have to wait for the company to send us the correct screws. I am sure the dresser will be sufficient once it is done but basically I am giving it a bad review because it is a hassle.UPDATE: After finding screws that worked and getting it put together I would NOT recommend this dresser. The wood is very cheap and cracked in a few different spots when tightening screws. We are not idiots and didn't screw them too tight, the wood just would not hold up. Also, we purchased the hutch (top part) for this dresser, it was actually better than this piece, but be aware that the top and bottom part do not match up perfectly. You can't really tell with the naked eye though. Once the hutch is on you cannot used the dresser as a changing table, as we would have liked to. It cuts a few inches off so therefore unless you have a very short changing pad it will not fit.	
- 1	I used prefolds and covers a lot, but this one tended to move every time. Couldn't keep the prefold in straight and so then we would have to change entire ensemble every time. One of the reasons I liked prefolds and covers was the ability to change the prefold and use the cover several times. Not the case with this one. Had to change cover every time.	
1. 	This toy kept my son's attention for a long time! Very nice colors and bendable too. It does not really hold a shape per say, and one of the sides is a little lopsided. Perfect as a teething toy for young infants!	
1. 	My 3 year old has eczema, in the first few months we quickly ruled out Johnson & Johnson products, our pediatrician recommended Cetaphil products; Cetaphil smelled good and worked fine for his skin, but I still had to use a shampoo on his hair as the Cetaphil left his fine hair brittle and tangled. After all this time I decided to look for something new, and found this Mustela 2-in-1. Skeptical of the shampoo portion, my pediatrician said it is another good brand for sensitive skin, so we tried it out anyway. LOVE IT. It makes his hair SO soft and managable, without looking dirty or oily in any way. It actually does a better job than the shampoo/conditioner I was using that was not for sensitive skin (which is why I wanted something new). I also love the smell of this product. It is light and clean. My new favorite product for my toddler's bath time, I plan to stock up.	
- 1	I bought the Swaddle Designs muslin swaddle blankets on Zulily because they were on sale (obviously, I guess...) and they were so soft and work perfectly for what I wanted them for.  I purchased these as a second set because I find myself needing to wash the swaddles frequently with a breastfed, spitting-up, occasional blow-out-diaper baby.  Even after washing and drying them, they were so much rougher than the Swaddle Designs blankets that I didn't even want to consider wrapping my newborn up in them.  I immediately packed them up and sent them back to Amazon.  I only gave them two stars because the designs are so cute.  I do have the wrap-around burp cloths and bibs, which are also kind of rough but it doesn't bother me as much because they won't be tightly wrapped against her skin for long periods of time...	
- 1	I ordered a couple of these clips but this one, for some reason, had a HORRIBLE clip part. It was almost impossible to open and when I was trying to pry it open one day, it snapped shut on my finger and actually injured me. I ended up throwing it out because I didn't want it near the baby. The other color [blue/green stripes] that we got didn't have the same issue, but this one was horrible and I would never have wanted it near the baby. Perhaps it was a faulty one, but I thought it was worth pointing out. The other one was useful and we used it for as long as the baby had a pacifier.	
1. 	I love love this diaper pail.  We had a Diaper Genie with our first child and I hated paying for all the refils.  I also found that it never really contained the smell.  With this one we use regular kitchen garbage bags (actually, the scented ones)and use the Arm & Hammer Nursery Air Fresheners in the air freshener spot inside the lid.  We're going on 3months of baby diapers now and haven't once had a smell leak out.  It's absolutely great and really does fit a ton of diapers!	
1. 	So, I have a 4 day old daughter, and due to medical reasons, we have to supplement with formula. We have triedTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Newborn Starter Set, but their slow flow nipples flow at the speed of Niagara falls compared to how these flow. These work a million times better as the flow actually works at the speed my daughter needs. Other ones would cause milk to spill out the side of her mouth, and allows her to take so quickly she projectile spits up because her little stomach can't handle it.Anyways, these are perfect for my newborn, not sure how she will grow with them, but she will definitely be using these for the meantime.	
1. 	This boppy is a must have for breastfeeding and tummy time! Highly recommend it!	
1. 	Easy to use. I like being able to pump right into the bags. Just make very, very, very sure the seal is closed. It's sometimes hard to tell. I wish they were more ecofriendly but otherwise they do the job well.	
1. 	We used this on our son's crib with the included velcro that helps attach it to the sides. Make a noise that is similar to what the baby heard before being born, that wishy washy sound they call it. Really liked it and is made of good quality overall.	
- 1	I received an envelope with three small disks in it just as another reviewer did. There was nothing else in the envelope just the three disks. I was also surprised how lacking they were, they really do look like the free disks you get from some places. However, the smell is good but I am not sure how they will work in the nursery for our daughters diaper pail since she is not here yet. They are not very strong so I hope they will be able to mask the odor from her diapers. I am glad they were so inexpensive so I don't really feel like I wasted much money if they don't work.	
1. 	Even so I am not nursing, I got this pillow and will help a lot when holding the baby because of my incision.	
- 1	Snug fit at first and appeared to do the trick of keeping my 9 month old from pulling on her dresser drawers while climbing the handles to a stand.  But, she was constantly drawn to the locks because of the contrast of white on a dark surface.  What baby doesn't like contrast?  (so why all the locks in the world are white, I'll never understand).  After a few days of using the locks to climb on and smacking her head on the dresser, I ultimately left the locks unlatched and dangling.  New toy!?  She then decided she liked yanking on the loose locks and was able to twist the adhesive on the plastic backing.  The adhesive didn't fall off the dresser, it fell off the actual lock!  Removed the locks and said forget it, and suddenly the dresser isn't so interesting anymore. :)	
1. 	Buy with confidence. This is a great item to have for you diaper bag and at home when those moments of sickness arise.	
1. 	I am still hoping my son will &#34;catch on&#34; with this toy.  It is a bit &#34;big&#34; for a little one - probably best for a 6+ month old baby.	
- 1	I got a very gently used one from a friend. It had been used for 2 babies, so about 6-7 months total, and my baby is now almost 6 weeks. The cloth platform that the mattress rests on is sagging like mad and lets my baby slide towards the open side. That is absolutely unsafe as there is no mesh there and she could suffocate. It was never stored, it was just closed up and left in the front hall closet, so it's not like it was exposed to extreme temperature changes or abuse.There's also a gap between it and the bed. Due to the gap there's really no simple way to reach over and pull the baby in; you still have to sit up or at least prop yourself up on an elbow and be kind of unsteady while you pick the baby up. Plus, to be honest, you have to change baby before and/or after a feeding, so honestly, you're getting up anyway.So, I guess if you're only going to use this for one baby for a few months... and have a ton of money to burn, this is a great item.If you're going to use it for multiple babies, I cannot recommend it.It's not really portable up and down stairs, either. It's not hard to set up but it's time consuming, but it's nothing you'd lug around the house with you all day. If you have a one story with a fairly open floor plan, this would probably be fine, but in a real house with rooms and hallways, it's not convenient.	
- 1	I bought this diaper and two different brands for comparison. This is my least favorite. The sewn-in insert does not go all the way up the front so it would work ok for a girl but my little boy, even when pointed down, has had this diaper leak all over him. I never leave diapers on for more than two hours, but this diaper doesn't last that long. It's best if you turn it inside out when washing it, otherwise you'll never get the smell out. I am not sure how you are supposed to strip this diaper once a month since you are not supposed to strip the covers. I do not recommend this all-in-one diaper. I suggest buying pocket diapers.	
1. 	Let's start by saying I love this thing - it was easy to put on the stroller, it's easy to take off the stroller, and it zips right up to baby's chin to keep her warm.  I love it; it is exactly what I wanted.  HOWEVER, it does not attach perfectly to the Britax B-Agile stroller.  Because the B-Agile seat is attached at the top, you cannot hook the cover over it and slide the elastic down.  You have to hook it over the top of the back pad, which makes the cover less than securely in place.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.  Also, it doesn't attach anywhere on the bottom (legs area), so when you fold the stroller up, this cover is loose and it's a little annoying.	
1. 	These are colorful and do not fade after washing. I bout them when my son was about 3 months old and are still looking great not to mention they are water proof. I love and recommend them!	
- 1	This pad works well , but beware it has that California 117 flame retardant material that is in question.  I use it for my grandson when he comes to visit.	
- 1	The plies of wipes doesn't really come out 1 by 1, which is the what this dispenser is suppose to do.  it is good that it has a window to show how much wipes are left though.  It is very easy to clean.  But doesn't work for me.	
- 1	This pillow must be designed for women with very short torsos.  I find that if I try to curl it around me, it feels like it is attacking me.  The pregnant woman shown in the photo fits neatly into the inner curve but I wonder if she is holding the top in place, because when I tried to use it that manner it would curl under my neck.The cover is scratchy,  you really cannot put your face on it.  So you will need to add the cost of a cover to this if you are going to use it for sleeping.I breastfed two kids, and used a U shaped pillow at times. I can see that this might be better for breastfeeding, since you can get a double &#8220;height&#8221; by wrapping it around yourself.  However, it is a fight to get it into that position, and you cannot just get up easily with it wrapped around you.It is much harder than a regular pillow and also thinner than it looks in the photo.  I also washed the slip cover to see if that would soften it up, but it did not. And getting the slipcover back on was a monumental struggle, like wrestling a reluctant snake into a tight jacket.  It actually reminded me of a topology problem and took almost 20 minutes to accomplish.  This means if you use it to prop up your baby and he/she spits up on it you will have to face trying to get the clean cover back on.Back to my full length body pillow, this one is just physically too hard, too scratchy and fights me too much.	
- 1	My timer was defective in that LED screen for the top function (the diaper change button) was not complete...meaning you could not discern the digits (was it an 8 or 0?). Otherwise, the other functions worked and I was able to see how much time elapsed.  Overall, though I stopped using the timer fairly quickly for a few reasons.1. I had a newborn and when she was yelling/screaming crying for her bottle or permanently attached to my breast...I just forgot to press that button to start the timer over.2. For some reason, I envisioned a product that would not only keep time between feedings, diaper changes, etc. but would also keep track of the sleep time during the day, etc. or the number of diaper changes & feedings per day.  BUT it only tells how much time has elapsed from the your last feeding, changing etc. Maybe I am asking too much, but I don't see what differentiates this product from a multi-use timer.  It's essentially several times on one device. Overall, it is a good but for all the raving reviews I just expected more.I came back and edited this review because I wanted to add that they company has fabulous customer service.  I emailed the company to inquire about getting a replacement for the timer. The president of the company emailed me back promptly on a Sunday asking for my address.  He did not ask me to send back the defective timer and must have shipped the replacement priority or overnight because I received the replacment in no time.	
- 1	These create lots of tiny bubbles that my son swallows when he drinks from this top. It's a terrible design because the rubber on the back side covers the air vent and the spout so the air gets sucked into babies mouth instead of back in the cup. Boo! I was really excited to still use my Avent bottles to transition to cups, but this prodect doesn't cut it, I ended up buying other sippy cups.	
- 1	I bought these because I got an incredible price for them somewhere else. I really wish I hadn't bought them. My son kept getting nasty rashes after we switched to these. He was getting them from around the opening and also on his testicles. He also got a blister on the tip of his penis that we ended up taking him to the doctor for. The doctor had us use Vaseline on it and we took him out of cloth diapers for a few days. It cleared up and we put him back in cloth diapers with these liners and it came back so that's when we figured out it was the liners causing the problems for sure since we never had issues with our other liners. Do yourself a favor and avoid these. The only plus I can give them are they are very large and you do get a lot for your money, but what we spent in taking him to the doctor killed that savings anyhow.	
1. 	We love the cover - it is a great idea. The only drawback is that it takes a bit of trial-and-error to get the fit correct. The instructions aren't very helpful. Once it's on, though, it's great - comfy and roomy all at the same time!	
- 1	Sponge fell apart after 1 week's of use. Nipple brush rough and not dense, thus hard to thoroughly clean a nipple.  I would not buy this product again.	
- 1	They fold in at the side on the top and bottom so they are kind of just more in the way than anything. I wish they were a little more sturdy on the frame or somehow able to be secured to the seat so the corners are pulled tight. My kids really haven't used them at all either like I thought they would, it's probably something I didn't really need in the first place but it sounds like a good idea. Now if I could only keep my son's feet off my a/c and heater vents in the middle position!	
1. 	This cushion is a must have if you already have the Svan highchair.  It makes the chair much more comfortable for the child.  I would recommend getting two so you have a spare when you need to wash one.  They are machine washable (which is awesome!) and very easy to get on and off without having to remove the buckles from the highchair.	
1. 	we love this gate so much that we have seven! 3 at our house, and 4 others at grandparents' houses. They weren't too hard to install (in our older house it was more difficult than my inlaws because our walls aren't completely straight and we had to make some wall corrections) They are easy to open and nice and tall. The clear window is a plus visually, allowing light through and an open view of the baby and pets on the other side. The greatest feature is that the gates work both as wall mount and suspension gates. we have them mounted to the stairs and pet area, but in the occasional instance that i need a gate elsewhere (like to contain my son in one room while i mop the floor in another) i can just take it off and move it, it's so easy! .	
- 1	I purchased this Temporal Thermometer as a present for my wife, who is an ER RN is the Los Angeles area. We had been looking for about a week for a dependable and consistent thermometer for our child when I broke down a few days from her birthday and got this.When she saw the device she was pretty unhappy about it as she had been forced for over a week to use these devices at her work, which proved to be more trouble and a larger headache in the institutional setting then they were worth. All of the Temporal Thermometers were tossed into a box and collected up and either most likely returned for a credit or tossed. Time is of the essence.But I was intrigued and opened the package anyway and we experimented and test-ran this thermometer for about a month side by side with another thermometer, theBraun Thermoscan. I saw exactly the same results that she dealt with at her work. Here are some examples of the inconsistency:1. Have a temperature or a fever? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings by more than one-point-five and sometime two-point-five degrees, which is huge.2. Moisture on forehead ... from the fever ...? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings.3. Head angle and forehead shape will dictate whether or not the device will even work.4. Different degrees register on different portions of the same forehead.5. Different degrees register with darker skin(!) That's the first time for that one.Some of the reviews tell you that you need to practice with the device and develop a technique, which is absolutely absurd. What? You're supposed to go around the neighborhood interfering with other parents when their kids are sick to work on your 'technique'? Gimme a break, please. It's a thermometer , it should work and work consistently. Unfortunately it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and therefore Exergen should take this product back to the drawing board and also remove the labeling on the front about how it's the most accurate, which it is very clearly not.I openly suspect a lot of these positive five-star reviews of this product have been placed by people directly related with this company as an ad effort. And coming from a long-time review on Amazon, this kind of thing is more rampant than you might think.Don't buy this, getting your money back will be harder then taking a temp.... ...	
1. 	We have this cover in sage and blue, and have no complaints. The cover is soft, cleans very easily, and retains color very well (i.e. Not washed out after laundering). The colors are pretty and look great in my son's room.	
1. 	Sturdy, good size, well-made, and (apparently) comfortable for twin babies to sleep in.  This bassinet has come in very, very handy --my life would be a lot harder without it.  This is highly recommended.	
- 1	There is serious design flaws with the bumbo potty trainer. I purchased a pink one in February, and was initially very pleased. We had potty trained my two year old with the baby bjorn potty, and it was time to graduate to the toilet. My daughter really liked this potty, and it seemed to be very comfortable. The fit was a little funny on the toilet seat (it wiggles around a bit), but I was just happy she was happy to use it.After a couple days of use I realized that the seat had a funny design because urine simply runs all around the under side of the rim, thereby needing serious cleaning after EVERY use. Not only that, but urine gets between the seat and the toilet seat, and therefore the toilet needs to be cleaned after EVERY use. Further when you pick the potty off the toilet, you need to be very careful to not dribble on the floor, or you will be washing the area around your toilet after EVERY use. So, a lot of cleaning needed after use, but it did wipe down simply enough.I was willing to overlook this annoying feature if it wasn't for the fact that two weeks later a crack developed in the groin area of the seat. This is a serious concern because it could easily pinch delicate baby skin and hurt very badly. I contacted the local store I had purchased from and was told these cannot be returned/refunded because of hygienic reasons - this includes returning to the manufacturer. So I assumed I had purchased a dud and decided to shell out another $35.00, because my daughter liked it and was familiar using it. FIVE DAYS LATER THE POTTY CRACKED IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE!Please do not read my review and think it won't happen to you or that I am simply using this potty wrong. I truly want to stop people from wasting their money like I have done. I have spent $80.00 on two potty seats, both of them cracked in the exact same place, in the front groin area. This can seriously harm a child if their skin gets pinched there.If you would like my suggestion, I am now using a prince lionheart wee pod, and it is working very well.	
1. 	I hate to use that as my title cause you hear it all the time BUT I swear I have tried just about all of them and this one is by far my favorite... Honestly everything is going to give you a little back pain after awhile... heck my purse alone does... But this Bjorn distributes the weight and pressure of the baby that you honestly will be thrilled with the carrier. I have tried all of the little cheap ones and I figured I was saving money but not I have a carrier collection and only use my bjorn. So Honestly Save money by purchasing just one.My son loved me holding him when he was little and when he got  interested in looking around I just flipped him around and he had the comforts of mom but yet could see everyone else.. And I had the use of my two arms... :-)	
1. 	I bought this to use with cloth wipes and I couldn't be more satisfied.  I just soak my wipes in warm water with a tablespoon of coconut oil and two drops of tea tree oil, then I roll them up and pack them in.  Holds enough for two days.	
1. 	I can't even begin to express how wonderful this swing is!  My baby was in NICU and the hospital for his first 18 days of life due to a heart condition, thus making him very attached and clingy.  He doesn't ever want to be put down UNLESS he's in this swing.  He adores it to all ends and will cry to get into it.  The music is great and soothing for him and he loves playing with his 'friends' (the swinging fish) above his head.  You do have to keep running to it whenever the music runs out while the baby is starting to doze off, but it's only a slight inconvienence compared to having to bounce him around the house all day!  This swing is well worth the extra money and is by far the best baby item out today.	
1. 	I've been using this for my son who's now 7 months old.  He loves it. The features are nice & it's built pretty sturdy.  He's never tipped over in it, but I also don't put it in the rocking position since you aren't supposed to until the child is a toddler who's getting into and out of it by themselves.I also have an older model of the same chair for my daughter who's now 3 and she still uses it!  I got her's used, so I don't know how old it actually was, but the vibrate function quit on her's when she was a little over 1.  (Of course, she didn't use the vibration anymore by then anyway, so it didn't really matter.)  My son's vibration on his chair is still working great though, so perhaps they have improved their manufacturing on these newer ones.I like how the seat belt is able to be put underneath the chair for toddler rocker use. It seems safer that they aren't actually removable plus they don't get lost that way either.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for only a couple reasons:1. If you have a very small baby the toy bar is too far away. (My daughter was always small-below the bottom curve on the growth charts...at 2 years old she'd barely reached 20lbs.) However, for average or bigger babies, the placement is perfect. (Like with my son, he is in the 75th percentile & it has always worked fine for him...but he was the exact same height and weight at 4 months that my daughter was at 1 year).2.  While being used as a rocker for toddlers, it is reclined a bit further than I'd like.  There are only 2 settings for the seat back and even the one that's more upright is still leaned back pretty far.  It works well for kids to lay back and relax to watch tv or something, but it'd be nice if you could sit it up more like a regular chair.Overall, a great buy & will last you a long time! (which is really nice since most baby gear gets outgrown pretty quickly)	
1. 	I am quite pleased with this seat. I had a fold up one, but it would pinch my granddaughter's legs and she would always exclaim, &#34;It's cold!&#34; This seat does the trick!	
1. 	The name says it all! I was told to try this by a friend after our old school receiving blankets were not keeping our daughter wrapped up as she got stronger. She sleeps SO good in it! We now have 2 of them. One that is in the diaper bag for when our daughter is at Grandma's and one for home. She has now out grown it, but only in the length. So we leave her feet out and purchased a Swaddle Me that we wrap ON TOP of this one. So she is now double swaddled. Her arms NEVER come out of this blanket. I was lazy one afternoon and just used the Swaddle Me, big mistake. She took a bad nap and had an arm out in 10 min! Some one said it was hard to use. I would always swaddle while she was awake and THEN feed her. That way she would fall asleep after eating and we just set her in bed. She would calm as we started to get one arm in the blanket. I now give these as baby shower gifts... as they make our lived so great!	
1. 	Love this system and these drop-in liners work great! I would recommend these to anyone and I'm picky so you know they are good.	
- 1	I ordered this item based on other reviews that said it stuck to the side of the tub way better than others. Unfortunately, this was not the case for me. It fell down four or five times within the first 20 minutes I had it up.	
1. 	This product really works well for my 10 month old. It keeps her snacks inside without spilling out everywhere. She was a little confused on how to get her hand in and pull the snacks out, but once she realized there was food in it she caught on real quick. I'm satisfied with this purchase.	
- 1	We washed this one time on warm and dried it on normal with the baby's crib sheets and all of our new baby blankets.  We didn't try it on the mattress for fit before we washed it.  I've never had sheets shrink, so I'm not sure if this shrank or was too small before washing, but it wouldn't go on the oval mattress at all.  Together my husband and I used a lot of force and were able to bend our mattress and get it into the sheet and zipped up... resulting in a majorly buckled mattress which now falls about four inches short of the ends of the bassinett!  And there is no way I'd put baby on something so uneven and uncomfortable, it's crazy.  We have no choice but to look elsewhere.	
1. 	This allowed us to install a baby gate at the bottom of our staircase without damaging the round banister.  We used it with a Munchkin gate and it works fine.	
1. 	As prior reviews have stated, the sticky tabs that come with this toy scoop are not the best. We purchased Waterproof Command Strips, installed the product on a completely dry surface, and did not use the tub for a couple of days. I love the shelf in the frog's mouth that holds two bottles of baby shampoo!!	
- 1	I thought these clips were great, until a few weeks of baby drool and a couple trips through the washing machine had the metal clip rusting. Yuck! Dont' waste your money. Try a pacifier holder with a plastic clip instead. I love the PBnJ paci holders!	
- 1	The seat is strange. rather than letting them stand up straight it forces them forward into the tray. The battery does not last from one use to the next. Very disappointing.	
1. 	My son took to it right away and was happily brushing away.  The shape, texture and flexibility is perfect to soothe his aching gums as his new teeth come in; this is especially helpful for the new teeth towards the back.  I tie the toothbrush to a short tether that's typically used for sippy cups, because he tends to throw things on the ground, and we're good to go!  The product was exactly as advertised, useful and delivered quickly with good packaging. Couldn't be happier with this seller.	
- 1	plastic melts in heat.  These are plastic, if you leave the oven door open for any amount of time the metal pin hinge in the cover conducts the heat from the oven and melts the hinge...	
- 1	After reading the glowing reviews for this mobile, we were really excited to put it on our baby's crib.  When we received it, we found out that the music box portion which needs to be mounted on the side railing of the crib, doesn't fit!  We don't have a fancy crib or anything, but like many of the other cribs we've seen in the store, ours has a thicker (er.. taller) top railing all the way around, but it is by no means elaborate or huge or anything like that.  The music box can't be mounted on any top railing that is taller than approximately 2.5 inches.  REALLY wish that Amazon's description had stated this information so people can know that it won't fit before they have to buy it and go to the trouble of returning it etc.... but to be fair to Amazon, I even went to Tiny Love's website and did not find the same info.  You basically have to buy it and see if it will fit your crib.	
1. 	I bought this as a Christmas present for my step daughter, who was having trouble sleeping in the dark. I love the color options, and she loves getting a choice each night. She has used this pretty much every single night and 3 years later, the lights are still bright! I love this product, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I have seen other products similar to what I bought, but they also feel cheaper, or the lights burn out earlier. Just save yourself some time and buy this one.	
1. 	We use these bibs daily, they save us so much time on cleanup vs when we were using cloth bibs,  really happy with this product.Just be careful when putting it on,  if you do it too quick and are not careful, it can pinch the back of your child's neck.	
1. 	Love this product! Keeps my son's arms swaddled much better than other products. I struggled a product that would keep his arms secure because he was around the 70th percentile when he was 4 months old and most products were too big around or too short.	
1. 	This makes it very convenient to use the car seat in two cars without having to mess with the seat belt.  Snap in and snap out quickly and easily.	
1. 	During the height of my baby's colic, i purchased an insane amount of items. The Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker was one of those items.While my son didn't care about it much during his more insane times, he now (at almost four months) enjoys sitting (and playing) in it. The toy bar is great for hanging other toys on (and it comes with toys of its own). I hang the Baby Einstein octopus from the bar and baby loves to grab at it since it's big and easy for him to reach. The toys that the chair comes with don't hang very low and are hard for baby to grab at, but I'm sure he'll be able to as he gets older.I would love if this chair would rock on its own, but you can rock it with your foot or hand if you want. I also like the kickstand that comes out if baby falls asleep and you want to lie him back and be more stationery.I also wish is that the chair vibrated a little more. Even with a new battery the vibrating isn't very significant, however, my son is a fan of items with more powerful/strong movements, so this vibration might be enough for a baby who isn't quite so high maintenance!Overall this chair is recommended, and it's awesome that it can be used well into toddler years. Great shower gift as well.	
1. 	We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails! I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her! It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only two downfalls I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static. Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room...  The other the cord from the camera dangles on the wall next to the crib- presenting a safety hazard for curious baby.None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews. I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product. However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy! It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!	
- 1	This car seat does everything it's suppose to do, it secures the infant tightly, has the sun-canopy and stylish looking BUT it's heavier than a ton of bricks.  The car seat alone is almost 30 lbs and then you put a kid in there, no weakling is picking this baby up. The knobs to push in are hard to push and it's difficult to secure without the base. Overall I wouldn't recommend just because it's so heavy and most likely a single mom isn't going to be able to lift it out of a back seat.	
1. 	I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.	
- 1	I had bought them intending to use them as swaddling blankets. After 1st wash they shrank awfully and now i believe i can use them either as burp clothes or for laying the baby on or other purposes, anything other than swaddling.Although the prints are cute, they are not suitable for swaddling.	
- 1	I thought this was going to be a great tool to keep my sanity. It's actually more hassle than it is worth. I only really used the feeding button but finding the device every time was annoying and I probably only used it for a total of 4 days before it became a decoration. Oh, the clip on the back broke also.	
1. 	I am not sure what all the complaints are about. The color is great and exactly as I expected. The dimensions are given online and the size of the dresser and drawers are also exactly as I expected. I think the quality is great, especially for the price. My husband (who is in NO way mechanically inclined)put it together in about an hour and half and said it was pretty easy. I love this dresser in my sons room and it matches his crib from Graco. I would recommend this dresser in a heartbeat.	
- 1	Could find a changing pad that would fit my ikea changing table. I've had this for 3 months and it has started to crack. I'm replacing with a new one because I can find something else that fits.	
- 1	I ordered this product expecting the Snuzzler with the light/baby pink on one side (which is shown in the photo) and instead I received one with HOT pink on one side. I cannot use it and I had to return it. Otherwise, the product seemed good. Very soft.	
- 1	This was returned right away, for two reasons. One, it actually complicates the swaddling process...and when you have a baby who doesn't like being swaddled, you don't need more complications. We gave up on swaddling him, which was reason number two why it was returned.	
- 1	When we first added this on to our Joovy double stroller we thought it was great. Both of our kids could sit forward in the stroller very comfortably, but when we started to use the stroller we noticed that our son's feet have to go in the bottom storage area (there is no where else he can put his feet). The only problem is that his feet push the front of the storage area into the front wheels and stop the front wheels from moving. The friction of the front wheels against the storage area actually created a hole in the front of the storage area. It's a quality product, but I can't recommend it due to the functionality flaw. Don't buy this add on, just use the Joovy double stroller as is.	
- 1	I read the reviews and got them anyway because they are inexpensive but these diapers do run very small.  They dont hold alot of moisture and will soak the entire diaper.  Spend a few more dollars on something else.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this activity gym. It changes position so a baby can by lying down or sitting or standing to play with it. But. Ours broke. My son is only 7 months. We have had this for probably only 4 months. He is sitting and standing up on things now but I can't change the position it is in!! It is stuck in the lying down position. Now I have changed the position many times before so it is not user error. The little teal/blue buttons that you press to release it are no longer functional.	
1. 	Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it, its so much fun.he loves the vibration, the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it!	
- 1	I assume by everyone else's reviews I got a lemon, but both sound and night vision did not work with my monitor. I called Infant Optics' customer support, and they were accommodating and were willing to process a return for me - but could not generate a free shipping return label like Amazon could if I returned it through them. I considered reordering this product again, but instead am going with the Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor which seems to have consistently high ratings.	
1. 	Bought this before kids for picnics with the hubby and loved it. Now with a little one I can't say enough about this blanket! Virtually stain resistant! Most stains come off with a baby wipe...a wet towel for worst case scenarios. Love how it folds up neatly and doesn't heat up too :)	
1. 	Thank God for this high chair. I LOVE it. It fits perfectly on my kitchen chair, takes no extra room. It's really cute, not ugly or ridiculous looking. It was easy to install. It's comfy, easy to clean. My 5 month old really likes it too. It reclines, and just is wonderful.My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner than I did. I could have used this a long time ago.(edit): My son is now 14 months old and I still absolutely love this high chair! He's 30 lbs and still fits nicely in it, it's still easy to clean and we use it every day. It easily slides up to the table and we use it with the tray and at times, without, so he can sit at the table with us.No regrets!	
1. 	Reviews on baby bottles are wide ranging. What works for some babies doesn't always work for others. All I can say is that these have been perfect for us. No spills. No bad seals. Slow / medium / fast nipples have brought our nine month old along perfectly. I would rate the VentAire system 6 stars if I could.	
1. 	One did break eventually, but I got quite a bit of use out of them. They're the first stove knob covers that I've found to work. I also cut the backs of them a bit and use them over door knobs. They work well that way too.	
- 1	I'm bummed because this is the first bottle my baby has been able to latch onto easily, but the slow flow is much too fast for her.  She ends up crying because too much fills up on her mouth.  I went and bought more, twice, thinking maybe I had bought malfunctioning ones or something.  Unfortunately not, they are all way too fast flowing.  When the milk is warm and I turn the bottle over it doesn't even drip, it actually sprays out.  Not for us. I'll give it 2 stars only because my baby has a good latch on the nipple.	
1. 	Our daughter turned one in December and although she is still in her infant seat.  She didn't want to be in it in the stores.  We got this for her stroller to go in and out of the store.  We love it!!!  Keeps her warm and cozy!	
1. 	We have this over our children's bedroom door.  Their stuffed toys are visible, but they are out of the way and not taking up any floor space, cupboard space, or toy box space.  It's a wonderful, sturdy net that keeps our lovable furry friends right there!	
- 1	I bought these for my twins' nursery and I love the way they look but after one washing, they don't seem to properly fit the baby mattresses anymore. I still use them but I really have to fight with them to get them around the corners of the mattresses.	
1. 	I don't know why but i felt compelled to write another review about these bottles. I cannot say enough... except what are you people complaining about ??? These bottles are not expensive when compared to buying stupid refill liners and trying a bunch of different bottles, and can you really put a price on a happy baby ? They are not hard to clean unless possibly you are letting the used bottles sit around to dry up and get yucky. They do not leak if you use them right and follow the instructions included. I rotate 6 bottles, keeping them washed and filled with formula (in the fridge of course), when baby is hungry i simply take one out and remove all parts and warm it up, which is not hard to do, then replace parts, feed baby, and rinse the  bottle out and fill sink with hot soapy water, drop all parts in.. let soak, then rinse and put to dry on drying rack. What is so hard about that ? (do boil the parts prior to first use and then about every 2 weeks or so) I don't even know where the little brush is that came with my bottles, don't need it. And I have inspected them afterwards, they are clean. and I should say that i usually use the ready to feed formula, I hate having to mix the powder. But the times that I do use the powder i just mix in separate container and pour into the Dr. Brown's.  So what you can't shake the bottle, you can swish it, you really shouldn't shake any bottle anyway, that's where the bubbles come from. I have used these bottles for 4 months, Katie is 4 1/2 mos. old. She had terrible colic for the first 2 weeks of her life, she would scream and ball up in pain from 11 pm to 5 am every nite  until I tried Dr. Browns. (I had used Avent and VentAire first, what junk.. also everyone kept telling me to try Soy or one of those special colic formulas, which are expensive, but I still use Similac Advance b/c the Dr. Browns bottles work) The FIRST day I used Dr. Brown's she slept all nite, I still didn't sleep though but that is just because I stared at her all nite in amazement !  I have NEVER had one of these bottles leak at all. I just don't get what all the complaining is about, I would do whatever it took to make my baby happy. If your baby doesn't have colic or get gas then maybe you don't need these. However, I am such a fan that with my next baby I will use these, I will not wait to see if the baby has colic or not. Another plus is that these bottles are designed to help with ear problems too. I really cannot say enough good about them, i have used both the standard, and the wide-neck, both are great in doing what they are designed to do but i (and baby) prefer the wide neck ones. I suggest skipping the purchase of the 4 oz bottle and go straight to the 8 oz, baby grows out of 4 oz size quickly, you can put 4 oz in an 8 oz bottle but cannot put 8oz in a 4 oz bottle, you know what i mean ?  PLEASE take it from someone who knows.. try these bottles, you won't be sorry.. baby's tummy will thank you.	
1. 	I love it!  It fits easily into my diaper bag, it's lightweight enough that my baby and I don't swelter in the heat, it's wide enough to cover all of me, and I love that I can see my baby while I'm feeding her.  It may seem unnecessary to some people (just use a blanket) but when you're new to breastfeeding and need to be able to see the baby to get her latched on, it's a lifesaver!  I also don't have to worry about it slipping off my shoulders.  Plus, it's pretty!  I would definitely buy this again.	
- 1	Before using to warm actual food or milk for my son I tested it out.  In the recommended time it was hot enough to leave blisters on my wrist when I tested it!	
1. 	I am embarrassed to admit how happy I am about this potty seat. We were using (without any luck) the Prince Lionheart weePod. The BB toilet trainer by comparison #1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet, long or round. I put a small black dot on the dial where it has the perfect fit, because with time, it does adjust ever so slightly, so I know exactly where it needs to be snug. #2 The entire base that sits on your toilet seat is lined with rubber so there's a no slip grip. No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable. #3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way. My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up, on & over the hump on the weePod. This may be a downside for boys, but is a bonus for girls. #4 You can hang it. I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that's where we hang it between uses. My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself. All key things in her independence. And there's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right. #5 This is completely personal reasoning, but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material (in my head) makes it seem more sanitary. Or maybe because its clean & white, idk. That being said, when I say hard plastic, it is not by all means uncomfortable. The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it. The weePod, for whatever reason, would cause her to lean back in the seat. My daughter loves this seat.  A+++ in everyway. Worth every penny!	
- 1	I bought this to make and store my baby's food. The first time I used the tray, it ripped in 3 places.	
- 1	Don't buy this! Total waste of money. Chains always break. Drinks spill. Cups break. Such a mess. Sticks out so far you can't fit through standard doorways. Go with a Jolly Jumper or Joovy Organizer instead. Save yourself the headache.	
- 1	I haven't tried any other breast pumps, but from what I read on the internet, there are better alternatives. I cups, I guess you can call them horns do not come in bigger sizes like medela for different nipple sizes. I took out the plastic inserts for it to be relatively more comfortable. I got a lot of painful, plugged ducts from using this.	
- 1	This thermometer never worked for us, and we tried everything! The strip must have been a dud. Buyer beware. This was very disappointing to us.	
1. 	These breast shields are a perfect fit for me in the regular size -- they work exceptionally well without any leaking. The fit is comfortable during pumping, and I've never had any pain or discomfort after I was finished.	
- 1	Please don't waste your money on such expensive bottle washing bottle brush. This was way to expensive and it didn't even clean the bottles as good as the Munchkins bottle brush did.	
1. 	My husband & I became pro-swaddlers with receiving blankets, so we didn't think we'd even need this, especially since our baby girl was born in June.  But even though summer in California should be warm enough to not need fleece, the fleece really worked perfectly for a tiny baby that always seemed to be cold.  Believe me, they want the warmth!  And it was great to use if we were in a hurry to swaddle her, or if we wanted to pick her up and didn't want the blankets to come undone.  It's also great when they are 2-3 months old and want to kick their legs free (you can swaddle them tight up top and leave the legs loose in the bag). I will definitely be using this again for my next baby.	
- 1	I bought this item at Amazon because it included the bottle brush and formula dispenser, however when I got it, the box contained neither of those items. It did contain a pacifier. This is considered false advertising. Also, the box was shipped on a yellow envelope, and arrived very damaged (the box was a gift....no time to return it for baby shower). Very not happy (and I paid for shipping!)	
1. 	i have the baby bullet (useless by the way, use your food processor) and the cute smiley face 2 ounce containers that go with it and dial the date of the month on them. great if your baby eats food in 2 ounce portions, but this method is so much better. each cube is one ounce so you can give baby as much or as little as you want. they stack easier in the freezer than the other containers, and are much easier to warm to the right temp.	
1. 	This cotton sleep sack has been perfect during nights when it is too warm for our fleece sleep sack. Part of our routine at night is a bath and then putting on pj's and a sleep sack so I was glad to find this lighter one so we could continue our routine. My son is 10 months and around 20 pounds and the large size is nice and comfy for him. He has lots of room but doesn't get tangled in it and can stand when he wakes up (which he always does when he wakes up and calls out for me). The light blue color and cute dog pattern is adorable also. I would recommend this sleep sack as a great alternative to blankets (which we never use because of SIDS and the fact that he moves around so much I don't think a blanket would stay put anyways!).	
- 1	This mat isn't really big enough for the car seat we have. I'd rather have one that is wider and has a longer seat.  We have a Britax Advocate and part of the seat always seems to be on the car seat rather than the protection mat because of the size.	
1. 	We received a number of swaddles as gifs before the birth of our first child and this was hands down our favorite swaddle. We had a big baby and he thrashed around quite a bit but slept best when swaddled. While the aden and anais swaddles were very soft and had cute patters on them he almost always managed to break free. We also liked the Woombie swaddles in terms of keeping him in the swaddle, but the zipper went up really high and we worried about choking him. The Miracle blanket was the best of all worlds because the inner arm flaps kept his arms in place so that we could wrap the long outer strip really securely. Highly recommend!	
1. 	We've tried several sippy cups and this one is one of the few truly leak-proof ones we've found.  More milk leaks from from my baby's lower lip than from this cup, even with vigorous shaking.  The only downside is there aren't any volume markers on this cup like most starter cups.  Plus the handles are integrated into the lid, which means that we'll be buying new (Playtex) cups when we're ready to ditch the handles.  But just having a leak-proof cup is worth 5 stars!	
- 1	I have this bag and do not like it at all.  It is way too small!  All the pockets are great but if you put anything in the pockets you have no room inside the bag in the main space.  It's so frustrating!  I can hardly fit all that I need and I just have a newborn so there isn't a ton that I need at this point.  The stroller clips are why I bought it and it is nice but not worth it when I cannot fit what I need into the bag.	
- 1	While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has balls collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  Go for the white!  I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!	
- 1	I read different reviews of this product, all were different, and for me this mattress is not for a new born use, is very hard, not comfortable at all.	
- 1	I used these bottles and loved them with my first child who was formula fed. Since then, the design has been changed (they added the ring)as well as the materials used. Everything I loved about them with my first I still love. The problem is with the nipples. My second is exclusively breastfed and the flow is just too fast. We are still using newborn nipples (baby is 4 months old) and it drowns him. Hes used to the super slow flow of eating on the breast and this just doesnt cut it. He ends up eating too fast and then throws up a good ounce of precious milk, only to be hungry again in 30 minutes. Needless to say, I am now in search of a new bottle.	
1. 	I'm so grateful for this monitor. The price was just right and it's just the item I need to quickly get to my baby when she awakes from naps, etc. The clarity is perfect for our large 3-bedrm apartment.	
- 1	I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!	
- 1	The lids were strange - guess they were specifically made for their pumps but awkward to handle and keep leaking from where it attaches to the bottle. I was also amazed that the gauge reading was pretty inaccurate - for example when I measure 2 oz of milk and pour it to this container, it only shows 1 oz and a bit, and so on. Realized that on the bottom of the gauge, it says &#34;approximate&#34; - meaning their gauge was approximate. I simply had never seen a milk bottle that has incorrect capacity reading so rather unimpressed. I mean, how difficult is it to label the gauge accurately? Or why would you even bother to make it different?? With the leakage issues and inaccurate capacity reading, we tossed out the whole set - feeling guilty about creating another plastic waste... Would not recommend.	
- 1	I don't understand all of the positive reviews on this product!  I'm glad it works for some women, but it has not worked for me.  First of all, it is a pain to put on, and sometimes takes me a minute or two just to get it in position before I start to put the flanges on.  The waist strap is very flimsy and gets turned around, so it is difficult to clip.  Second of all, it is extremely uncomfortable!  The part that goes over your neck has two cheap badge clips (that's the only way I can describe it) that dig into your neck.  Third, I find that the flanges don't even stay put once you begin pumping, so I end up having to hold them anyway.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this product, and will now have to buy a pumping bra instead.  This is a good concept but poorly executed design.	
- 1	The pacifiers are great. My baby loves it. It was MY mistake to buy all translucent pacifiers. DON'T. Once you set them down, it is hard to find them, spot them and when you have your baby asleep... the hustle with no lights to find these translucent pacifiers is hell. My first mistake as a first mom: wanted &#34;cute&#34;pacifiers and forgot about practicality. AVOID translucent. I then bought the same with colors and my baby loves them. So i do highly recommend the brand and product, just not the translucent ones!	
- 1	This is a waste of money and the return policy is awful.  So you are stuck with this.  First of all, it does not close and the lid keeps popping up.  I hate this sippy cup.  I wish I never purchase this one.  Do not buy this  . . . buy the NUK Disney ones.	
- 1	Worked for the first 10 months and then could only use it when plugged it.  After 18 months, it completely died.  Such a shame because I loved the features but who wants an unreliable video monitor?	
- 1	I was hoping this would solve the washing-hair problem every night for my super squirmy toddlers, but the water kept on getting into their ears even if I hold them still and seal the front as much as I could.  Now we simply use it as a water bucket.	
1. 	I gave this five stars as this is the third one I've purchased.  I purchased one for myself, one for each of my grandchildren who's parents have counter height tables and the grandchildren are too big for their high chairs.  I originally purchased this one for our granddaughter (since we too have a counter height kitchen table) who was 9 months and it was perfect for her!  Now that our grandchildren are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 it is perfect for them still.  I HIGHLY recommend this for grandparents, people who do not have children as it is so handy to pull out and use for company that has little one/toddlers.  The seat conveniently folds up and has a strap for throwing it over your shoulder if you're going to someone's home that doesn't have a high chair/booster seat.  Fisher-Price has done it again!	
- 1	The concept of this is amazing! I was so excited to give it a try. Try was all I did, however, because it was not as expected. The tray is 4 pieces that snap together and its flimsy at best. The snap together sections leave openings which pinched my daughter's arm. Also, the foam insert felt cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled by the thickness of the Bumbo but this foam part falls out and was very thin. I returned it.	
1. 	This arrived super quick!  I ordered it on Tuesday night and it was on my doorstep on Friday afternoon.  It arrived in perfect condition.  It was pretty easy to put together, it only required a philips screwdriver to put it together.  Make sure you have plenty of room to put it together and two sets of hands.  I tried to put it together by myself and some of my boards banged together and it did leave some marks.  But other than that the product arrived perfect and the color was beautiful, I ordered espresso.  I am very pleased with the crib.	
- 1	Pictures make this product seem to be made of a different material - but it is rubbery, flexible and bends with some pressure. It actually is a good texture for a baby to teeth on, so I'm not complaining, just stating that the picture makes it look like it is made out of a harder substance. It is very, very casual looking. I do like the rope part of the necklace, because I had originally chosen this over ChewBead Necklaces because I had read reviews that said your  hair could get caught in those, but a simple string wouldn't do that. The problem is the clasp... it is CHEAP. Cheap doesn't begin to describe it. It doesn't take any strength at all for my 5 month old to pull on it and for the clasp to release, so it never actually stays connected around my neck. The part of this necklace that was so appealing to me was that it wouldn't be a toy that constantly was falling on the ground... well.. not really, because the clasp isn't strong enough to match my 5 month old.If I had only paid a maximum of $5-8 for this product, I'd be more apt to give it 4 stars, but I cannot believe such a cheaply made product costs $18+!!!!  I recommend anyone that likes the idea or concept to simply buy a rope necklace with a strong clasp and connect it to your baby's already favorite teether.	
- 1	i had got this product excitedly ordering from here but when we started using the color shade started peeling off and my son..use to chew on that .it was unacceptable n we somehow cudnt return the product.neways i wiidnt suggest anybody to buy this product which claims ORGANIC but cannot deal with basic problems.	
1. 	I had the original ( smaller version) for when my baby was 0-6 months and after she turned 6 months we started using this one. Is thicker and more bulky offering more cushion and keeps warmth better so now it's perfect. But I am not sure about summer time... it may be too thick.	
- 1	I have the Octoplush and this hanging Octopus that I bought because I thought it would be similar to the Octoplush but able to go along for stroller rides.  It is almost identical in concept, but the differences make this product a huge letdown.  The legs are not fun to press and you have to pull the string to make music rather than pressing the head, which my daughter knows to do.  I think this product was a blend of the Octoplush and Baby Einstein's answer to the Lamaze toy Captain Calamari, but they made him more like CC than Octoplush.  You'd be better off figuring out a way to attach the Octoplush to a stroller/carrier and take it along.	
1. 	I really like this monitor. It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. I would recommend this.	
1. 	I had registered for this blanket out of the recommendation from a friend who had one.  We use it almost daily.Pros:1) Conveniently folds up and has built in carrying system.2) Decent size, but wish it was at least a foot longer all around (at least 6x6 instead of 5x5).3) Easy to cleanCons:1) Did smell initially, but wash it a few times (which you should do before using anyhow) and it will go away.2) Wish it was larger.3) Limited pattern option.  We got the Cococa Bubble pattern.  It's a really really busy pattern.  In hindsight I wish I had gone with the gray/green instead which looks less busy.	
1. 	Play yard arrived timely and in great shape.  Started using it when the baby was 9 months old - He is now 2 1/2 and I am still using it.  Easy to assemble and safely contains the toddler.	
1. 	We needed these for both our baby gates which don't seem to come wide enough to cover a normal hallway, but this extension works perfectly and we haven't had any problems with it in over a year of everyday use.  My daughter even grabs the rails and shakes them everyday and it has held up without becoming loose.	
1. 	This is the perfect sound machine for a baby's room....helps block out sounds that could wake baby.  Plays for up to 45 minutes which is really nice.  It's great because you can bring it with you when you are traveling...packs well.Not a fan of the whale sound option but the rest are great!	
1. 	I bought this white cover (model 40896, UPC 3676840896, code on label X0000DM4BB) andSafety 1st Power Strip Coverto compare the two.  Unlike that item, this cover is not expandable.  Its dimensions are fixed at 14 length, 2-3/4 wide, and 3-1/4 high (except for the 4 at the power strip cord end which is only 1-3/4 high).  The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 1/2 wide and 7-5/8 long. When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-1/8 by 1-1/2.  There are no holes for wall mounting, but four outlet covers, two plastic cable ties, and ten cord identifier stickers are provided.To open the 4 cover at the power strip cord end, you pull up on a single tab; this seems rather easy for a child to disengage, which means that he/she might have access to the outlet nearest the power strip cord end.  To open the main cover, you pry open three tabs, then open the unit like a clamshell.The plastic is softer but probably more resistant to breakage compared with the Safety 1st model.  I like the fact that you can simply open the 4 cover to flick the power strip switch on and off.  It is narrower and shorter than the Safety 1st model by about 3/4 in either direction, which may prevent using wider strips or transformers more than about 1-1/2 high with it.Buy this from Amazon.com!  (BTW, about the Amazon photo, the interior is actually white, I don't know what produced that egg-yolk-yellow color inside.)	
- 1	These crib pads do help keep sheets dry but they wear out quickly.  They looked awful after the first time I washed them and have started falling apart after 6 months.  I wash them with natural baby detergent and hang to dry so I am surprised that they have worn out already.	
1. 	Needless to say we have been trough many different bib brands. This one is by far the sturdiest and nicest of them all. My daughter cannot easily take it off (she tries, but then gives up fast because it is not that easy). It is super easy to clean (just rinse) and the pouch actually catches all the food so there is no more mess on the chair and clothes. Love this bib!	
1. 	HUGE help for breastfeeding both of my sons. One had a high palate and weak suck and the other had a retracted jaw. Not the best for long term use but a huge help in the beginning. Why there is not a 27mm & a 30mm I will never understand! This is the largest available and seems to do the trick.	
1. 	I was very very leery of jumpers.  Terrified infact.  However, my son was jumping so much in his saucer that I figured I'd give it a go.  I am so happy I did.  It really does seem very well constructed and my son LOVES it! He is so very funny in it.  He is eight months old and I wish I had tried it sooner. He actually sleeps better since we bought it.I still have to say I don't trust it and I am supervising very closely when he is in it.  I am just scared of the thing coming down on top of him because it is so heavy.  I practically hung on it myself with full body weight though and it didn't budge, so I do think it is safe.  I do have an old victorian with very big doorway molding though, so I don't know about newer homes with small molding.	
1. 	these are adorable, gender neutral bibs. i bought cloth bibs before my son started eating bc i was trying to be one step ahead of the game. big mistake. cloth bibs are for drool!! these are for food! they're awesome for traveling too because they dry so quickly! we just took one on our 2 week vacation and it suited us just fine. i won't be buying another kind of bib. BUY THIS	
- 1	I expected these to be a rubber-type material so as to help my hurting nipples- to keep my bra from putting pressure on my sensitive nipples. Instead, they are hard plastic and put too much pressure on my breasts. They were uncomfortable. The basic design is good (shape, size, fact that they catch leakage,etc) but the hard plastic is no good!	
1. 	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.	
1. 	Love these. For some reason, most other bibs I've tried had uncoated fabric edging, which means you can't just wipe food off the trim, however easily it wipes off the main portion of the bib. That means you either send it through the wash (and most of them say not to machine wash them), or slowly build up nasty, unremovable crusties along the trim and piping until the bib is so gross you just throw it out. These are not like that. Food rinses easily off the entire thing, front and back, main part, pocket, and trim. So great! Even if you forget and find the bib a few hours later, it rinses right off with just warm water. They're also soft and flexible enough that my toddler doesn't pull or complain about it until she's done with her meal. First bib I can say that about. I threw all her old bibs away after getting these.	
- 1	This wipe solution has good essential oils and smells nice, but it is way too expensive!  You might as well use disposable wipes, because you won't save any money with cloth wipes if you use a solution like this every time.  After I went through a bottle of this, I decided to save money by mixing my own solutions.  There are a lot of recipes out there or you can make your own, save a lot of $$, and fill your child's individual needs.  I personally just use a tablespoon of baby wash and a tablespoon of coconut oil mixed with 2 cups of hot water.  This makes enough wipes to last three or more days, and it costs barely anything.  The coconut oil helps heal or prevent any rashes while the wash cleanses.  The wipe solution won't do either.	
- 1	I was so disappointed when I took these out of the package.  They smell SO BAD!!! Even after washing them with vinegar and letting them air out they have that terrible chemical/plastic/off gassing smell.  I don't even want to give them to my toddler to chew on. Even a few feet away I can smell them and it is strong enough to make my head hurt.	
1. 	These are very useful to wipe down parts when pumping at work or when traveling. I did a lot of research on them first as I was skeptical to use something that I didn't rinse off. I didn't find any red flags warning against it, just make sure the parts are dry before using.	
1. 	The wipe warmer has been working great for a few weeks. Our baby really enjoys the nice warm wipes. A must for cold weather.	
- 1	These aren't round. they have a straight sewn edge at the top so they don't fit as nicely inside the cover and they bend inward instead of stay rounded. stuck with it now.	
1. 	I'm a nurse, so I'm extra picky about health care products.  This is my choice for my two girls.  It's fast.  It has a ridge to indicate how far in to insert the thermometer rectally.  It's backlit so you can read it in a dimly lit room.  And it's accurate.	
- 1	This bassinet is useful for a newborn, as we could take our baby from room to room, but I wish the mattress was sturdier. You can see the dent in our baby's head makes daily. What's worse is that when the bassinet basket is placed on the stand, as in the pictures, the mattress and frame dip in the middle. It's built w/o a sturdy bottom so that it can be converted into a seat for older babies and is a major construction flaw, in my opinion. It helps to place the bassinet basket on a flat surface like the couch or floor, but then we can't wheel it it around.	
1. 	Feeding himself (and the dog) is a must for our 10 month old.  These bibs work great as a catch-all and keep most of the food off of his clothes and off the floor.  They are easy to clean and are a big hit in our household.	
- 1	5 stars- Really?Just received this stroller today in the mail - disappointed...- 1 handed pushing? I don't think so.- child tray does not flip open- bench seat should lock in place.- difficult to fold- Seats are not well padded, I can understand the bench but the front seat should be softer.- The canopy makes a loud clicking noise when ever it is moved. Anyone else's canopy really loud? Did I get a defective  stroller?- Handle bar too high, wish it was adjustable... (I'm 5'2)If anyone has any suggestions on how to add something to lower the handle are (a reverse handle bar extender?) that would be awesome.	
- 1	I was hopeful, even after reading some of the negative reviews - however, this just didn't cut it for our needs. I'm not upset by the purchase (it's not that expensive) but I'll probably never use it again.I got this strap in hopes to avoid bringing a stroller (save space), but also enable us to use my 15 month old's car seat once we reached our destination.  To put it plainly, we only used the strap for 1/4 of our airport adventures  :-(First, even after reading other reviews, we intended to use the strap to transport our daughter from the car to the gate. Meaning, I needed to attach the car seat to our carry-on, not larger luggage, which was not recommended by other reviewers.  I should also mention that my daughter is still a lap child, so I never intended to use the car seat on the plane.My daughter LOVED riding in her seat around our house and through the airport... BUT, after we strolled her from car to check in, detached and reattached for security and were 1/2 way to our gate I noticed that the wheels of our small carry-on luggage were vibrating badly & had become very hot!  Issues on our end: we have relatively cheap luggage, a heavy toddler (35 lbs) and I walk very fast... that being said, the wheels on our carry-on may be ruined after using this for only a short time.  We did not reattach the car seat to the carry-on after we landed or for our return flight.  (The strap did end up making a nice handle, and keeping the LATCH straps out of my way when I attached everything around the front... but not the intended use)Helpful hints from other reviews: Practicing attaching and detaching well before your trip  (It's difficult, but not impossible... don't plan on using this if you're on your own with a child - she would have wondered away by the time I got it all back together).  Having your luggage packed FULL is also a must for a secure fit.In the end, would I recommend this to a friend??  Ultimately it depends on their needs - but probably not.  If you are planning to use it with very sturdy luggage and / or a very light child - it might not be so bad.  If you are a casual traveler like myself - either check the car seat and figure out how to carry your child through the airport or get a different product. Yes this is a cheap alternative, but in the end we may end up with new luggage because of it.	
1. 	I highly recommend this to anyone buying a pack'n play. It fits great in my graco pack n play. It's wrapped in a plastic water proof material and the crib sheets fits great on it.	
- 1	I purchased this since my baby is moving around more in her crib. This is thinner than what I thought it would be, compared to the thick crib bumper that came with the crib set.  It is easy to install with strong velcro on the ends. However, I am wishing that I bought the other brand breathable crib bumper... this thin mesh that the BreathableBaby bumper is made of slides easily down the crib slats. I have found my baby with an arm or a leg between the crib slats, pushing the mesh bumper down, even with the bumper tied and velcroed as tight as possible. The thin material also does not protect her from bumping her head against the sides of the crib... which is mainly what a crib bumper is for. She still rolls over and hits her head on the sides of the crib, waking herself up and crying! I am buying the other Summer Infant breathable bumper. This one was a waste of money. I can't return it because I tossed the packaging... Im going to try to convert it into something that can baby proof something in my house.	
- 1	Edit: 6/7/2012Changing my review from 3 to 1 stars. We've only had this unit for 6+ months and after 1 fall on a CARPETED FLOOR it stopped working. I am stuck buying a new system (parent unit + camera), since the parent unit can't be ordered separately. All in all, this was not a good purchase: no support for multiple cameras in web cam mode, no calibration for the thermostat and no durability. Stay away.***We put this monitor through the paces this weekend.  Since we are having twins, we bought an additional camera.  Using the main screen, the images are bright and after some adjustment everything seems to work fine.  I have STRONG words of caution if you are buying this because of the Skype features or are planning to plug it into your Windows computer.*You need a CD drive to install the drivers.  There was no place to download the drivers.  You cannot find the product under the main Samsung.com website, you have to go to Samsungsv.com.  Something not smell right? Yeah...  But SamsungSV.com is no help either - no driver download, nothing.*There is no software that comes with this camera.  They don't mention any software and in fact there is nothing, only a driver that allows the camera to be used like a web-cam.  So officially you can't complain about this... but I do find it very odd.  I was expecting at least a lame viewing interface for your computer.*The image when viewing through the main monitor LCD screen is way larger than what appears when you view it as a web-cam.  So if you are aiming that camera at your baby and it looks great on the screen you are carrying around, odds are that most of your baby will be off screen if you try viewing it as a webcam.  This is aweful - in 2011 isn't digital information being carried through a USB cable still digital information?  Shouldn't the image information like image size and format stay the same??  But no.*When viewing as a web-cam, you can only see one camera.  This is very annoying. When using the main viewer, the cameras can be set to auto-rotate.  Works great.  When in USB web-cam mode, this is disabled for some unkown reason.  You CAN change cameras, manually, if you sit and hit the button on the viewer that is hooked into your computer, but that makes no sense if you are trying to use this device over Skype.  And the reason has to be just poorly written software.  Why sell a unit that can support 4 cameras but then not support all 4 cameras for internet viewing?  Sad, for an otherwise great looking product, especially if you have multiple kids/cameras.*Skype - well it works with Skype - sorta.  I was able to create a Skype account for the monitor that is hooked up to a dedicated computer.  It can be set to automatically connect to video calls, BUT for whatever reason the camera does not automatically come on, I just get an icon without video.  If I'm with the Samsung unit and the computer, during the call I can hit the video button and vwalla! it works.  But again, that doesn't work if you are trying to use it over Skype.  So I am very dispointed with the internet functionality of this unit.  I think the description is misleading in selling the Skype functionality.  Otherwise, I am happy with the portable monitor unit and the cameras.	
- 1	We had to get some of these for the bottles.Like: 1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it. 3) LEAKS! - No valve except the hole in the cup spout. 4) No valve except in the cup spout. Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year. Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options. I recommend anyone investigate those first	
1. 	This product works well, I can't say BG's nails are very straight, but I have not nicked her yet, where as the regular clippers caught up some skin and made her bleed.	
1. 	My wife and I were deciding between a Fisher Price two-way swing or this two-way glider as our tool to help put our newborn to sleep when she's less than cooperative.  In the end, we decided on this glider because of the ability to pick it up and move it around. Here are my thoughts: (1) at first, I thought it was more like a solid infant car seat with a motor attached beneath.  It is not.  It's just a hammock draped over a tubular metal frame--quite flimsy.  But it gets the job done.  (2) The arch from which the toys dangle is NOT a handle that you can use to move it; it's just a non-weight-bearing tube from which the toys dangle.  To move it, you grab two handles at the ends of the seat. (3)  The motor is much quieter than what I expected after reading some of the reviews here.  Maybe in a very quiet room, the motor noise may be noticeable.  But the noise is never annoying or intrusive, and it doesn't disturb baby.  (4) The faster of the two movement speeds is probably about right; any much faster and baby's head would get jolted back and forth.  The slow setting is very slow.  (5)  The seat is rotatable 360 degrees, so the back-and-forth movement is not just limited to 2 positions.  (6) The music tends to be on slightly louder side even on the softer setting, but it's not a big deal.  (7) As with all such seats, baby's back is slightly arched, and I'm not sure it's healthy for baby to sleep long term day in and day out in this posture.  But for calming baby to put her to sleep, it's fine.	
- 1	It never stays closed, and doesn't contain very many bags.  The bags themselves are surprisingly large and thick, and much bigger than I need for one dirty diaper or a dirty outfit.  I just don't understand why they weren't able to put a decent clasp on the dispenser to keep it shut.  We had to tape it closed, which doesn't look great.  When it's time for refills, we'll probably just get a different dispenser from another company.	
1. 	What can i say, they loved playing with them. Until my dogs chewed them to pieces. But they're great for some water fun for the kids.	
1. 	We ordered this to sit at our breakfast bar as we eat meals there sometimes. As so as we got it we stopped using her traditional highchair, she prefers this seat. It is so portable and love that it has 2 trays and doesn't take up additional space. This chair may not be comfortable for young ones sitting in chairs for first time but our daughter (18 months) loves it.	
- 1	I wanted to like this because I'm all about my baby having a clean nose, but the rounded tips make it hard to see what I'm getting at in his nose. The rounded tips are a safety feature; I understand, but I just can't seem to work around them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe my baby's nostrils are too small; he's currently 6-months-old, but I've been trying to use this since he was a newborn. Anyway, it still sits in his little hygiene bag, but I don't use it at all. Instead, I either just use my pinky or theBaby Vac Nasal Aspirator 2012 Modelaspirator (with saline) to get those boogers out.	
- 1	These cloths are so small and so thin, I'm not sure they'll be useful for anything. At about 4x4, they are definitely not worth $16.	
1. 	This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.	
- 1	This basket doesn't stay on the tile empty, let alone with a few foam toys.  We have regular smooth ceramic tile.  We tried cleaning the tile, wetting the back of the suction cups, putting on dry etc. I wish I hadn't thrown away the box because I really dislike this basket and can't return it.  A total waste of money.	
1. 	I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.	
- 1	My son loves these pacifiers - they are just pink with cherry's and other girly items. We are using them because we dont mind people thinking he is a girl from time to time but... just so you are aware (in case you care) the cute blue, white and yellow pacifiers you see in the picture may come to you in pink and purple. :D	
1. 	This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to keep it all in if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size bowl, some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!	
1. 	I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.	
1. 	I really like how easy this is to use. The one thing I don't like about it is how small it is. It says it fits up to 14lbs. My son is 9 lbs and I do not see it lasting until he is 14 lbs. It is quite snug at this point (I realize they are supposed to be somewhat snug).  I was worried that the fleece would be too hot, but I haven't noticed my son being too warm when I take it off of him in the mornings. I will definitely buy another one when he grows out of this. Maybe I will try the cotton one for summer.	
- 1	I bought this set before my baby was born because of the great reviews and how cute it was. He's three months old now and I've had to replace most of the items in the set. The thermometer takes forever to take a reading (more than a minute, which is a long time to have it stuck in a sick baby's bottom), so I replaced that. The light on the nail clippers works when it feels like it... so, not often... and the little post that holds the lever onto the nail clippers has a lip rather than being solid, so the lever falls off if I'm not incredibly careful when getting the clippers out or putting them away... so that's been replaced, too. The hairbrush bristles are super soft, and does absolutely zero to help with cradle cap (my baby was mostly bald, and the bristles are so soft I can't imagine they would be useful on a baby that had a lot of hair, either, b/c I don't think they would actually get into the hair at all), so we've been using the brush the hospital gave us... ugly, but way more effective. Even the emery boards are sub-par; the ones that came with the replacement nail clippers do a much better job. The medicine droppers are fine, nothing to write home about, utility-wise, but nothing wrong with them and they are cute. And the nasal aspirator is also ok, if you like the bulb style (I don't... I use the nose frida, I learned with my first child that it's far more effective... and I've tried both on this baby, and still prefer the nose frida for getting snot out)... but that's not a lot of useful stuff, especially given that this set was more expensive than many of the others I looked at. Such a cute idea... but terrible as far as actually taking care of the baby.	
- 1	These little musical instruments are simply not worth it.  They are cheap, they don't make much sound and honestly were a waste of money.  They are not infant or toddler friendly either.	
1. 	I use it's as a room spray for my kids' rooms after cleaning. I use couple sprays per room and the bottle lasts for a long time. It smells very fresh and clean.	
1. 	Received the crib recently, came less than a week after I ordered it, and everything was packed very nicely.We put it together last weekend and it looks gorgeous.The only issue was that some of the bolts did not easily work with the screws ... so it took a little bit to get the bed put together. We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material. I know it is a soft wood - so we'll need to be a little careful with it.It looked really high when we put it together, but now that the mattress is in it's fine.Very pleased with this choice.	
1. 	It's really comfortable for that extra support during pregnancy. Some people use regular pillow also but I think this particular shape makes it real comfi for a good night sleep. Price is good too.	
1. 	Even though I don't use the Dr. Brown's bottles anymore I use these to clean the straws and little pieces of other sippy cups.	
1. 	I have made some unbelievably moronic choices when it comes to baby gear.  This was definately not one of them!I had originally wanted to just go with an infant to toddler feeding station set up, but then I saw and purchased a Peg Pergeo Prima Pappa out of the PennySaver.  Oooooh, Peg Perego...  Had to have it...I hated hated hated HATED that chair.  It was huge.  The tray was too high.  It had a zillion and one little nooks and crannies to get food into.  I ended up shoving it back and forth between the kitchen and the laundry room for months.  Once my baby really got into eating solids (which he didn't do until 7 months) I fed him in his bouncy, on the floor.  I just didn't want to deal with cleaning that high chair.  Even once he got to be a better (neater) eater, the space issues drove me bananas.I sold it - at a loss - and bought the Fisher Price booster seat instead.I love love love LOVE this little chair.First of all, it goes on our dining room chair - so it takes up no additional space.  My baby fits in it very comfortably - it is just his size.  I can put Cheerios on the tray for him and he can pick them up and eat them (although it does seem he drops and sits in them about half the time, too...)  No nooks and crannies so clean up is easy.  We can easily pack it up and take it to a resturaunt and he is so happy to sit in his little seat, smack the tray, play with his toys, eat his Cheerios - we are able to eat out in public again.  I never thought I would be a germophobic parent but I do appreciate being able to take our own seat along from a cleanliness aspect, too.  This chair is inexpensive enough that if you are lazy, or just like to be prepared, you could even buy two and always keep one in the trunk of your car for going out.I don't really see the point in having the tray insert - the tray is so easy to wipe down but, who knows.  Maybe it will come in handy some time.I do have some concerns about this chair really suiting a child from infant to toddler.  It does not recline, as some of the other boosters do.  However, in my experience, my child really was not ready to eat until he was able to sit up right.  I think that a lot of people force solids onto children too soon, partly in hopes of getting their kid to sleep through the night sooner, partly out of deference to grandparents.  You can always feed your baby in his bouncy, if he needs a reclining feeding seat.It does seem a little small to fit a toddler into, but once the tray is removed and it is used as just a booster seat, it will probably be fine.  I really like that your child can get so close to the table using this little seat.Thumbs up, way way up, for this little seat.  I plan to buy two more as baby gifts for my brother and cousin who are expecting babies in October (not with each other).--Update--I had twins last year and we needed a second booster.  I wanted to get the same one and we went to TRU to get one - but they only had the yellow and orange one.  I did notice it didn't have the extra tray, but I also noticed it cost less.  Since the extra tray was kind of useless anyway, I didn't mind much.  So we got the yellow and orange one and took it home and then I realized the height doesn't adjust like it does for the green and blue one.  Arg, I thought.  Then I thought, does it really matter??  The yellow and orange one is at the same height as the blue and green one when it is in the 2nd/middle position.  So I just put the blue/green one in the second position, set the chairs up next to each other, and let the girls eat.  Works just fine.  I was a little miffed at the cutting out of features but it's nice that the price is lower - and really these features aren't needed.  I'd assumed the blue/green one was d/c'ed when I only saw the yellow but I guess that's not the case.  So blue and green, or yellow and orange - they're both good.	
- 1	Mine won't stay linked together to form a caterpillar as pictured. It's basically just like any other set of bath cups.	
1. 	My wife has the large Bugaboo she uses all the time, but I needed a stroller for our one year old to keep in the trunk of my convertible (BMW M3).  This fit the bill.  It is light weight, fits easily in my tiny trunk and my daughter seems happy in it.  Does it have all of the bells and whistles the Bugaboo does?  Of course not.  Does it give me a place to put her when we are out running errands on the weekend.  Yes.I am fairly short (5'4) and have absolutely no problem with the height of the handles.  My only complaint is that occassionally my feet will hit the rear wheels when walking.When folded, two wheels end up at the top and two at the bottom.  This means that if the wheels are dirty, there is no clean side.  Also, the dirty wheels will tend to make the sun visor dirty since they are in contact when folded.The buckle seems to work well although there is a velcro cover that folds over the buckle assembly from the outside in.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of it is, but I guess it keeps my daughter from opening the buckle herself - not that she has the hand strength necessary.Overall, for the reason I bought this, I am happy.  I would not recommend this as the only stroller you own, but is perfect for a second car or for grandma's house.	
- 1	maybe the one we got was defective but it wasn't accurate at all.  i love the idea of being able to swipe across the forhead to read temperature of sick child but it needs to be 100% accurate.  we were getting readings in the 60s...(!)  ended up returning it and keeping my rectal thermometer which while a pain to use is always correct.	
- 1	Like many parents to be we found ourselves looking for reasonably priced nursery furniture and this seemed to fit the bill; multi use drawers and changing top, ample storage, clean design, and reasonably priced.It showed up in a big box, pretty well packaged on the outside with crush bumpers on each corner and running along the lengths of the box. So far so good right? Apparently they must have spent all their packaging budget on the outside of the box to prevent damage and very little on the inside, there's damage to a few of the pieces including the main top board corner. Although there were a ton of crush bumpers and corner braces they still neglected to adequately protect the pieces inside. Contrast this to the crib I just assembled last night that had the main pieces wrapped in sheets of foam and therefore didn't need the multitude of bumpers and braces. Sometimes spending more to package it right inside the box makes more sense than making the outside bulletproof.On to assembly, I've assembled many cheap particle board based furniture in my day so I regretfully dismissed the reviews here about assembly difficulty. I grew up on K-mar and Ikea furniture assembly, how bad could this be? Apparently I've fallen off my high horse, the assembly design of this thing makes Ikea assembly look like genius design, a beacon of pictorial assembly art, and a shining example of using as few as possible different bolt/screws combinations. This literally came with a big bag of bolts. Do yourself a favor and download the assembly PDF from the manufacturer's website: [...]. Now take a look at the assembly hardware list. Confused yet? I resorted to counting the specific screws to make sure I was using the right one at times, in fact I probably spent more time making sure I was using the right screw than I did actual assembly, it was a game of logic to figure out which screw is which # on the part sheet and some were packed in the wrong pouch.And about the hardware, drawer rails were completely plastic, even the dowels to connect pieces were plastic. I guess the design was tested to make do with plastic but the cost cutting is apparent and noticeable. The drawer rails are completely made out of plastic which seemed odd to me for such a crucial part, they are also hammered into the panels and use no hardware whatsoever. Not sure how much they saved with this design but doesn't give me much confidence that it's built to last. The design has also been changed and instead of updating the assembly instructions they chose to add a separate insert to call out that parts xyz are deemed no longer necessary and to ignore in assembly, this tells me the company is focused on saving cost of updating printed manuals vs. the customer experience. There are also pre-drilled holes that are not used and add to assembly confusion. Again a sign of we changed our mind but we'll let the customer figure it out. Onto the pictorial assembly, download the PDF so you can zoom in and see the parts and orientation much more clearly than the provided print copy. Instead of laying out the pieces and coming back to them in the same perspective, they'll abruptly change direction (flip the picture) on you and made me question if I had it right. The logic of the assembly is also suspect, it stops assembly of the frame mid way to focus on the drawers which in turn draws out the time where you would have parts just strewn about the room. It's an odd choice and something I fell into since I was following directions.On the bright side, the company is readily wiling to send me replacement and assembly parts free of charge. Awesome right? A manufacturer that stands behind their product but.....it could take up to 10 days to get your part. So here I am now with a 50 by 42 box siting face down on in the nursery with assorted parts still laying around that's making it harder for me to work on other parts of the room now. Lesson here is that yes you can get parts easily but plan on plenty of room to assemble and be prepared to wait if you're missing hardware and/or replacement parts.We will keep the piece now that I'm already 80% complete but I would reconsider given how much time it's taken to get assembly this far (4-5 hours already). If I paid myself $20/hr to save the headaches and for an easier to assemble and higher quality piece I could have bumped up the budget to a different price point and gone with something else.It's not a terrible piece of furniture but be forewarned what you're in for.EDIT: It's been 8 days now and I'm still waiting for replacement parts to arrive and the latest shipping update shows I have another 4 days to wait. Mind you, this shipping to PA, if you're further from Canada it could be longer still. I've had a 80% finished dresser hanging around the nursery over a week now and by the time the parts show up it will be close to 2 weeks since I even started to put this thing together. In retrospect, this is not a delay I need in getting the nursery ready. Be warned and account up to 2 weeks after receipt.....	
1. 	I loved my Graco high chairs in the black and white damask pattern because they were really cute.  BUT, I have twins and so I had two of them, cramming up my breakfast nook.  They take up a tremendous amount of space.  And, although they clean up beautifully, it takes some time to do so (you have to wash & dry the fabric covers, then scrub down the whole frame) .  These Healthy care Deluxe Boosters take care of both of those issues!  I now have a ton of room in my breakfast area and spend a tenth of the time cleaning them!  That means more time doing the stuff I want to do like play with my kiddos!!	
1. 	It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use.	
1. 	Bought these for extra milk storage, these store well in the freezer and the elongated shape helps to quickly defrost them as well. the only downside is that it's hard to read the volume markings on the side.	
- 1	Used this exactly twice in our Britax B-Safe infant seat, because it made the seat too cramped for our 9lb baby.  She hated being in her carseat until we removed this pad, then she was fine.	
1. 	I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol. But they are not too bad, so no complaints.	
- 1	I don't return a lot of items to Amazon, but this one I did.  We first ordered this bag in black/avocado, but after two months of saying that it would be shipped, we got word that this color was no longer available.  So then we ordered this in black/tuquoise, thinking it would work.  The color was ok, but the bag itself just didn't work for us at all.  First of all, it was BIG.  When I opened the delivery box, I just couldn't believe how big it was.  I'm all about spacious bags, but this one wasn't even that spacious; it was just big and flat, which leads me to my second complaint about this bag.  It didn't seem very practical.  I couldn't imagine it being very easy access to the things that I would need because it was long and deep, but very skinny.  In the end, this bag just did not work for me.  We ended up returning this bag and getting an Eddy Bauer bag for about ten bucks more that has been great for us.	
1. 	I bought this stroller to be a lightweight travel stroller. I love it and it is perfect for my needs. It is VERY lightweight and folds up nicely. The height is great and I have no complaints with it whatsoever! I'm very glad I bought it.	
1. 	The product is as advertised.  We used it for our baby car seat.  It has worked fine.  Additionally, the seller shipped the product very efficiently.	
- 1	These only cling when the weather is rather warm (they don't even begin to stick if the glass is cool), and even then, fall off in about 10 minutes.  Should have returned them but who wants to bother when they are so cheap to begin with.Don't waste your time.  And please, if you have found something that works well (for both side and rear window) comment on my post!	
1. 	I  am very pleased with this 4moms bath tub. The tub fits nicely into my double sink (you can use this in a single sink as well). It also comes with an adaptor if there are different sink heights. There are multiple drain's which so far have worked perfectly. Some reviews stated they leaked.. mine have not (yet) but even if they did, I'd still love this tub to use in the sink. My daughter is 3 months; and the tub is recommended 0-6 months. She doesn't play to much yet, but I felt the water level was just right. I absolutely love the thermometer and the clean water system in this tub. Sure, anyone can bath a baby in any type of bucket, tub or container. A bath is a bath... but this is a comfy one for mom and baby. My daughter slants a bit in the tub, but still quite safe and nothing one of those space mats can't fix (for a newborn I'd definately recommend one of those mats as they can really slip in) This tub is a step up because of the extra features that make it easier on mom or dad. A thermomer makes it easy to keep that comfy bath and not constantly check the water... its definately an extra visual aid and it changes color.. water is cold (blue), warm (green) or hot (red). The clean flow system definately helps keep babies water clean but constantly creating that flow of fresh water in one area, dumping to baby area, and then out.. and it does make a difference. I've tried 4 other tubs.. and this one tops them all. The first 3 I returned immediately after trying and retrying. The last I used for her first 2 months but wasn't fully pleased with it, but it did its job. All in all, this ones a keeper for me and I am pleased.	
1. 	Our baby girl LOVED these cups. She still plays with them in the bath now at 16 months, as some of them have holes and can drain the water through. These are a great way to keep your child out of the measuring cups and have something fun to play with for a long time. I would recommend from age 5 or 6 months to at least a year and a half, maybe longer.	
- 1	These fit amazing in the beginning.  They worked great with a wiggly young baby with the grovia inserts or a prefold.  After a year or so the velcro won't lay flat and comes off.  I have to use a snappi and am going to convert to snaps.  They have come off my very active toddler which is not fun for either of us.  The color on the waist part faded a lot and leaves terrible red marks on his lower back.  Maybe the snap version last longer?  I use them now only as emergency dipes or as a swim diaper.  Wonder if I can see them.	
- 1	The Boon Bug Pod is a complete scam. I ordered the Boon Bug because I thought it was so cute, but when I finally got it, the only way to attach it to my tub was to drill into the wall. So I had to make another purchase of the suction cup bracket so make it work. What a rip off.	
1. 	with our first kid we had so many cutesy bibs. most of the time the bottle would soak through them, which inevitably stained the clothing. with the second kid I decided to get a pack of these to supplement. they have been so good I went back, ordered two more packs, and am ditching the other bibs which are worthless.	
- 1	I'm updating my review on this product.  After using some other brands of bottle brush, I'm going to give this one 4 stars.  This is because the sponge on this brush is denser than on other brushes.  A denser sponge holds soap better.  I found that when using other brands of brush, I went through soap much more quickly.  The denser sponge on this brush also lathers the inside of the bottle much better than other brands too, which means cleaner bottles in less time.  This brush still has a durability issue, however, I've come to the conclusion that it's probably a good idea to throw out bottle brushes every few weeks anyway.  I'm going back to this brush!(Old review below)Purchased this brush to use on my Dr. Brown's bottles.  I don't have a dishwasher so I use it every day.  The brush works well and cleans both the bottom and the neck of the bottle.  Unfortunately, mine have only lasted about 2 months because the sponge starts to break apart.  I'm on my second one.  I thought I had been to hard on the first one, so I was nicer to my second one.  But it still is falling apart.  Won't be buying another.	
1. 	This is huge, but a really  nice change table to put on your bathroom counter if you don't have any room for more furniture in your house. It's really convenient to change baby right by running water too.	
- 1	When I read the reviews I saw a lot of bad and a lot of great comments. It seemed like if you just read and followed the directions it would work great. NO WAY! If you tighten enough so that it doesn't leak then the baby can't get anything out of the spout. If you loosen it like the directions say it leaks all over everything! I'm returning it ASAP.The only good thing I can say is that it does fit with the parts from Dr. Browns bottles, so you don't have to buy everything.	
1. 	This is the second Kidco product I have purchased.  Let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and I have every confidence in the security of the gates I have installed. BUT, the first gate I purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install.  You can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall (even when there is a stud).  So, instead of including another set of screws that would've cost them about $0.90, Kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves.Well, this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day.  Kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market.  The thing they don't tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall.  Each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another (which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces).  However, because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place, this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate, make sure each of the 4 separate extension brackets and two separate support bars, and the 4 metal extension bars which the brackets slide over (none of which lockinto place in anyway) don't fall off, all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time...  I cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process.Throw me a bone Kidco!  How about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don't slide off while I'm trying to mount the gate?  Something!?!Unfortunately, you will find that Kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent's life a LOT easier.	
- 1	We could not get this to work properly. We tried over and over, following the instructions provided. The grate kept popping out, the food that did get ground up was still too coarse for our child to eat. The juices from the food also ran everywhere, even with the silicone around the plunger. It was also very hard to clean and reassemble.	
1. 	I really like this changing pad. I like that it has a full four-sided shape. Some reviews say that it's difficult to find covers that fit it, but I bought 2 Carter's changing pad covers and they work perfectly. It seems large enough to hold my baby for a while, and it has a nice strap to help keep her fastened in there. Overall, a good buy.	
- 1	I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick. Also they don't really block the sun either, I don't think any product like these would. I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face.	
- 1	I bought this item because of the Sealy Posturepedic name, the price, and the fact that the positive reviews outweighed the negatives. Well...I should have paid attention to the customer who said that the mattress indented where her child was lying down. This is exactly what happened to me. After only a week, there was an indent in the mattress where my son's head and torso lay. I turned it over and the same thing happened. I think it's because of all the air above the springs, but I can't be sure. I returned it due to its very poor construction. I'm surprised, but at the same time I'm not because the mattress also had the Kolcraft brand name on it and I'm not particularly impressed with that brand.	
- 1	Initially, I loved this pod--design, colors, functionality, everything. Then after 3 uses, it started leaking the perspiration of the cold bottle through the seams at the bottom, into the diaper bag and all over everything. If you put an ice pack in it, it's even worse. Returned. Found the Tommy Tippee versionTommee Tippee 2 Count Insulated Bottle Bagand they are solid, stellar quality and everything I need them to be, without leaking.	
1. 	Love this not permanent so I can take it off after the &#34;stage&#34; no glue or any hardware.  Easily goes together fits any size toilet and very very secure.  Durable material easy to open lid (adults that know how to).Would buy this over and over again if needed but the one's I have will last forever.  Have already recommended to several friends.	
1. 	At 7 months pregnant my back was killing me. I bought this based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did. After the first night I noticed a huge difference and after a few more days, my back pain was gone. I gave birth back in January and I still use it---it's just that comfortable. I also like that you can use it in other positions (it shows you on the package). I've had it for 8 months now and it's a little bit flatter than I'd like but still does the job. Fully recommend to all preggos suffering from back pain. I just wish I'd had bought it earlier on!	
1. 	This is an pretty good bottle warmer. However, it has a timer and auto-shuts, but there is no alarm to tell you that the milk is ready so it's very easy to burn bottle. I used this with many different types of bottles (e.g., Advent, Playtex, Dr. Brown. etc..) and it works for all of them.I would prefer the Dr Brown warmer below which has certainly more featureshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035LLG2W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0035LLG2W&linkCode;=as2&tag;=justckem-20	
1. 	Great product, planning to get more for family members to use when we are at their home. It is very secure and attaches very easily. Get this product rather than a high chair, have both, and this is far better.	
1. 	i bought the Safari Open Top Take Along Swing when my baby was born because the price was cheaper. i didn't take into consideration about the entertainment. so, my baby didn't like sitting in that swing. so now i bought this aquarium swing and my 12 weeks old baby loves to be in there. it's very expensive so i thought about it many times before i actually bought it.  she looks and coos to the toys, lights and music. she stays so calm in the swing for more than half an hour. the only draw back is the music doesn't last long. i have to reset it every few minutes.	
- 1	waste of money. if your kid is old enough to hold this heavy thing then their old enough to eat fruits/veggies- cut them up small/ mash them.	
- 1	My LO doesn't like using this snack cup as much as I thought he would. He is not afraid of this line of products, but we have had a bad experience with the entire line from nuby (normally our favorite and go-to brand). His little 1 year old hand gets stuck in the mouth and he gets easily frustrated. I have the worst time trying to clean it out when we do use it. I didn't even realize that it came apart until I read other reviews. :( Very disappointed in this entire line of products.	
- 1	What seem to be an overall all-in-one gadget is actually pretty useless when it comes to practical use. We have a 8 week old baby and tried to use this product actively in order to make most use of all of it s features and observed following:- feeding diary feature is useless since there are many apps these days which can keep full log of baby's feeding and other activities like sleeping, diaper change etc. Whenever she has to feed baby, it is not possible to keep looking for this gadget and feed the time. iPhone app comes very handy for that purpose. There is one by Similac which is very useful indeed.- Time/clock is not visible from a few feet away due to small font size and weird color combination of black over dark blue lit screen.- When used on AAA size batteries, it eats them very fast. When connected to power cable limits the positioning of this device.- Nightlight feature is very distracting if you are trying to make your baby sleep because its light is very catchy and simulates his mind instead of relaxing. He keeps looking at it with eyes wide open instead of sleeping.- There is no wall mount feature...seriously? So we have to either keep it near crib or changing station and in either case its usability goes down due to its distance from bed.Overall, it is very inconvenient and poorly designed product with a high cost.	
1. 	I initially bought this pail for cloth diapers after searching all over the internet and in stores for one that would work. This one is great! You can close the lid down on a cloth pail liner and then use the push-button opening to drop in the dirty diapers. I wash the load about every two days, and the pail does well to keep the smell in. I do use the air freshener disk in the lid to help as well.The first few weeks I used the pail for disposables that had been given to me at baby showers. The bucket is great because you can use regular trash bags inside, though it's a little smaller than a 13 gallon trash bin. I used it each time until full and only noticed an odor on hot, humid days.Over all, great pail!!	
- 1	I have never be so impressed with customer service but so (very) disappointed in the product.When I was doing my research leading up to getting a pump, I chose Ameda because of the glowing reviews on Amazon, and dreamed of short, fruitful pumping sessions as described by all the mom's that had their own Purely Yours pump. 10 oz in 15 minutes?! (said one review) That sounded wonderful.So I received my Ameda Purely Yours pump through Edgepark medical suppliers, cleaned it, and had it all set up at my &#34;pumping station&#34; in the living room for my next workday (luckily I only work 3 half days a week so I don't have to pump at work, just in the morning). When I got all settled down the next morning and &#34;hooked up&#34; to the pump, I was surprised to notice how little the pump was was getting even though I felt engorged. I never even felt my milk let down. Reluctantly, I detached one flange and just tried one side at a time thinking the suction just wasn't enough divided. I sat there for 40 minutes and only got 4 oz from one side (which I know should be a good amount, but I've dealt with oversupply since my son was born and I could literally feel milk still in my breasts) before frustrated, I had to quit so as not to be late for work. I told my husband he'd need to dip into my stash in the freezer because I hadn't been able to pump enough for 2 or 3 feedings.I tried a few more times with similar results before contacting parent care. They were very helpful and friendly, and sent me reducing inserts (as I though maybe that was the problem), and then, when the green light on my pump started flashing and then dying after being on for 20 minutes, she sent me a new AC adaptor,I thought these two changes would improve my situation, but they did not. It still took 40-60 minutes just to pump 2 feedings worth of milk (8oz total). Frustrated and sleepier than I wanted to be (because of a son who at 6 months still won't sleep through the night and being forced to get up an hour earlier just to pump), I called the Ameda support line and spoke with a lactation consultant, who helped me troubleshoot and narrowed down the problem to perhaps the valves. She sent me more, but that didn't help much more than anything else had. I tried some troubleshooting of my own and finally figured out that the real reason I'm having problems is that the diaphragms start great, but after about 15 contractions, they stop fully relaxing before the next contraction. This affects the power of the suction and the pump's ability to draw milk out.I told this to parent care, and they then sent me new flanges, new diaphragms, new caps, and more valves just for good measure. She mentioned the manufacturers had cut a bad batch of flanges and that must have been my problem.FINALLY I thought I had my solution. I washed all my new pieces, put them together, and the next morning sat down with optimism.Nope.The diaphragms were the still the issue. I had to constantly uncap the flange as I was pumping so it would relax all the way, which means I could only pump one side at a time. Parent care suggested the tube adaptor was pushed too far in, so I tried adjusting that to some improvement, but still not enough to be worth the effort.At this point I gave up. It amazes me how excellent the customer service was for such a poor product. I contacted Edgepark and will be receiving a Medela in the mail soon. For your convenience, I will update this review to compare the two products.	
1. 	This is the BEST infant bath seat around!  We live in a small apartment and really needed a bath seat/tub that was compact and easy to store.  We first had the Puj Tub, which seemed like a great solution, but it was actually too SMALL for our sinks.  It came unsnapped as soon as we placed our baby in it because it wasn't fully supported all around.  Then, I was over at a friend's house one night and saw that she was bathing her 6 month old son in this infant bath seat.  I was amazed at how small it was, but how well-supported and comfortable her (hefty) baby boy was in it!  And then, when I found it on-line, I was even more amazed by the inexpensive price tag compared to all of the other tubs on the market.  I immediately bought it and haven't looked back!  It fits perfectly in our single basin kitchen sink (although we have to position it along the diagonal of the sink).  Our son loved the seat from the beginning.  He sits in it without any complaint.  We now have to put it in our bath tub, though, because our son is really long and didn't like having his legs scrunched up inside the sink (this is an issue with bathing him in the SINK, not with the bath seat).  The bath seat has suction cups on the bottom, so the seat doesn't shift around in the bath tub while he kicks away in the water!  Best of all, it stores away neatly in our linen closet and would probably fit in most under-sink cabinets (we have a pedestal sink, so we keep it in the closet).  I would recommend this bath seat to ANYONE and I've already purchased one for my brother's new baby!	
- 1	I bought this cover thinking what a great deal until I got it and was SO disappointed.It is so small, that if you're baby moves or wiggles even a little bit then you end up flashing everyone anyway.  Not only that, it's a struggle to get on, adjust your baby, and stay covered up.  I found it's easier to just use a receiving blanket than it is to hassle with this darn cover.The stiff collar on it to let you see you're baby while you're nursing is a struggle too!  It flops over or falls down...the whole thing is just a mess.  Knowing what I know now, I would've picked a cover that I knew for sure was larger and had a collar with a better design.	
1. 	I bought this one for my friend but I also have one.  They are very nice to have if you need to feed your baby in public.  I've enjoyed mine and I'm sure you would too!	
1. 	I really like this sheet. It matches the colors of my pack 'n' play really well. I have a kolcraft and it fits perfect. It has been spit up on about a million times and has been washed about a million more. It hasn't faded at all and is very durable. I would definitely recommend this sheet!	
1. 	Easy to clean.The &#34;lip&#34; at the front pretty much prevents boys from making a huge mess while on the potty, but there are not any rough edges to catch skin.Easy to take the &#34;bowl&#34; off to pour the contents in the toilet.  Even my 2 (almost 3) year old can easily pour in toilet without too many spills.I like the back and the arm rests on the sides. Makes it comfortable for the child, especially when we initially began using the potty.	
1. 	Unlike the previous review we loved these bottles, and yes we have a baby that spits up alot and the bottles do make the difference. Our son loves these bottles, they help on the gas and the spitting up and he is able to latch on and drink with no major effort. We also love having a different choice of nipple sizes. Both of my children were given ceral bottles at young ages by there doctors and with my first we had to poke hole in the nipple and hope it worked. With my son we are able to buy stage 2 nipples and not owrry about him getting too much formula too fast. These are wonderful	
- 1	Not really sure how this is suppose to take anything off my babies teeth. its more of a gum massager. a wash cloth works better. no purpose to purchase as a toothbrush.	
- 1	We needed a tub without all the bumps in the bottom so our son could play a bit more without using the whole bathtub and wasting water.  This was too narrow but would've been okay if it weren't so slippery!  The bottom is ridiculously slick, he fell 3 times at the first use.  Also, the latch is hard plastic and just stick up like a toy.  I'm sure that would break if we used the tub long enough, but we won't be.  Just awful.	
1. 	The title says it all, this is absolutely the best diaper diposal system i have tried and i tried a few. The best thing about it other than hardly any smell is the liners that come with last a long time, i did not have to buy refills until i had already used it for 6 months. Holds the smell well enough but nothing is going to cover it up perfectly, adding a bounce dryer sheet helps but the best thing to do is empty it when your trash comes every week.I love the fact that when emptying it you hardly smell anything because you open it from the from and can hurry up and cut and tie the bag before any smell but that comes with a price when your baby becomes older they can learn how to open the top and drop stuff in it but this didnt last that long with my son, he only did a few times.All and all i definately recommend.	
1. 	This chair is quite nice.We had the more expensive Chicco chair, but this is just as good for its purpose.This fits our table top because of its adjustable handles and doesn't make our kitchen/dining area look like a childcare.If you are on a budget. This is the one to get.Much better than those big bulky high chairs everyone uses.Only got 4 stars because there is no color choices.	
- 1	I can't help but agree with other reviewers who call this item out for what it is...pure price gouging by Arm's Reach.  Leg extenders should absolutely 100% be included with this product, not sold separately (especially for a price of $20+).  I'll also be buying a more reasonable, sturdy alternative.Also misleading is the fact that co-sleeper instructions (I have the mini model) state that the unit as packaged is adjustable for beds up to 24 in height.  This really only means that the top of the co-sleeper frame is 24 high, NOT the mattress platform.  Be aware of this when purchasing.  If your bed is higher than 23-24 and you want your baby sleeping at the same level as you...you'll need to buy extensions, whether you choose to purchase from Arm's Reach or not.	
1. 	We love this!  We actually use it as a back up in the car, especially when my husband takes our 2 year old out alone so that he does not have to drag her into a male restroom.  We have also switched to using old grocery bags with napkins inside - it works just the same (so long as the bags have no holes) because when she first started potty training we were going through the other bags too quickly and couldn't order them fast enough (and I haven't found them in any stores yet). It really helped us to be able to pull over to a parking lot and let her go as soon as she felt the need.  I was alittle timid about it at first but we never had any probelms with the potty not locking into place and it's the perfect size for her - she actually loves it.	
1. 	I purchased this item as a shower gift for my sister.  She loves it!  My nephew used it daily for his first three months.  When we pulled it out of the box I was impressed with the fullness and softness of the area where baby lays.  I wish they made one for adults! ;)	
- 1	Neither of our twins, both 9 & 11lbs will fit in this - they are just too small. Pity. Will stick with my bjorns.	
1. 	We love this seat so much, we ended up getting two...one for each of our bathrooms. Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she's going potty like a grown-up. Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo (gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea) since it goes right in the toilet!	
1. 	This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry. I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.	
- 1	We bought a variety of cloth diapers to use with our newborn. We are not new to cloth diapering as we diapered our oldest in cloth until she potty trained. We used the one size Fuzzibunz for my oldest without any problems. However, we didn't start until she was 10 weeks. We bought this diaper to try and did not like it. The insert was difficult to get in. It leaked almost every time we used it. And my daughter seemed to outgrow it by one month old at 10 lbs. It was, however, soft. I would not purchase this again for a newborn.	
- 1	We bought this because we were going camping and wanted to sit by the fire while our little one slept in the camper. The battery only lasts about 15 minutes on the one you listin to, so we had to find a plug so we could keep it going. It doesn't get very loud. If it weren't for the vibrating and the red lights, you wouldn't know your baby was crying. I had the volume up all the way and heard him through the wall yesterday rather than the baby monitor. I do like the vibration idea so you can know there is noise even if you are someplace noisy.	
- 1	I purchased this to replace a Baby Bjorn potty seat. Mostly to save money. The Baby Bjorn last us through 2 kids so about 4 years. It finally got a cracked handle so it was time to junk it.My son is 3. He knows how to use the potty all by himself. This includes putting the potty seat down, climbing up and down on his own, etc etc.This seat comes with two plastic pieces that slide onto the seat to adjust to the size of your toilet seat. They are extremely loose and when I tried to adjust it to the proper setting to keep the seat stable the plastic pieces moved to the next setting.I came to the reviews and read that you have to squeeze it to get it on but this would not work for my son. He has past the age of needing help with the potty so I shouldn't have to go into the bathroom each time he needs to go to put the seat on the toilet.I also read the review about the plastic piece getting stuck in the toilet! You seriously would never consider this to be an issue unless you have had to replace a toilet because something was stuck. We have and it isn't fun or cheap! When I saw how loose the pieces were I was really concerned that my son would drop one into the toilet and flush and we'd have to buy ANOTHER replacement toilet.So I sucked it up, returned this one, and paid the extra for the Baby Bjorn. It has no loose pieces. It has a dial that you can adjust to the size of the toilet. Plus it has a handle that is perfect for hanging. I recommend the Baby Bjorn over this seat!	
1. 	Being very pregnant, I know I am supposed to sleep on my side. But I simply cannot do it on my own and always wake up flat on my back. This pillow kept me on my side for probably 70% of the time (just a rough estimate based on how I find myself when I wake up). I am thankful for that.	
- 1	When I received this item I was excited. Finally. Then I unwrapped the item to realise that during shipment, one hinge had been completely broken off and the other cracked and ready to drop off with first possible use. What good is this product now since the cap must be in place in order for the heat to remain inside of the warmer to be any sort of effective. I am TOTALLY dissatisfied. This is the first item I have ever received from Amazon in this state. With all the hectic daily routines and unpredictable moments which motherhood can bring, the last thing I need is to deal with a damaged product. This item is now useless as the steam will obviously not be sealed inside.	
- 1	I am a professional nanny of about 10 years and I have come to view swaddling as one of the best baby care tricks you can ever use. I have NEVER dealt with a baby that did not sleep better when swaddled. There have been many babies who strongly fought the swaddling process if they were not used to it but after a few times it worked like a charm to keep them alseep. I have cared for dozens of babies including several sets of twins and triplets and truly, I could not have survived if I could not swaddle. Many parents told me that their baby did not like to be swaddled because they would always get out of the blanket within a few minutes. I always tell them that just because the baby gets out does not mean that they dont like it. You just have to find the right products to help keep the baby wrapped up tight. I have found that the Swaddle me does not do the job very well for most babies, but the Miracle Blanket really does! I love the miracle blanket, I have only found one baby who could get himself out of it and he usually only removed one arm so it did not wake him up. It is pricey but very very worth it! The Miracle Blanket will change the way your baby sleeps for the better so it is worth the money. The Swaddle me just cant get the job done, or at least not as well so I never recommend it to any parent.	
1. 	the traditional swaddle blanket it time consuming and my son can break out with ease. He now sleeps through the night. He's now 4 months. We will continue to use it until he can break out of it also.	
- 1	It looks cute  but it doesn't work consistently.  Sometimes it doesn't want to spin around.  Thought about sending it back but just haven't gotten around to it.  It didn't cost much but I guess you get what you pay for.	
1. 	They do their job of cleaning out all the holes and crevasses of those darned Dr. Browns bottles.  These bottles really are great for keeping gas and reflux to a minimum, but boy are the a pain to clean.  You can't clean them without these things (and shouldn't, because if you don't get every crevasse, ick will build up on the tan colored plug thing especially - talk about nasty germies!) so buy a pack or two today!	
- 1	this bag lasted one way of a round trip flight-on teh way back it got a huge hole.  served its purpose but if you are looking for an investment-this is NOT it.	
1. 	I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my let down and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.	
1. 	It expands to hold a LOT of toys! Very simple item, but feels like it's of good quality. I don't think it's going to fall apart anytime soon, regardless of how much weight I've thrown in there. the stitching/rope weave seemed solidly done. It'll come with hangers, but I just used nails and made sure I hit the studs. Also, I didn't have a full wall to mount one side because of my window layout, and I just used a couple of zip ties to shorten up one side so it would fit snugly in the corner. Cheap and easy storage!	
1. 	I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them. I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.OH!! And if you would rather, the bottles and all parts fit in the munchikin dishwasher basket.. even the sraws can be put in the straw things on the side of it!!! just discovered that...	
1. 	As long as we used the newborn sling our son was very cozy in this tub and loved bath time. When he got to be 6-7 months, we tried removing the sling and it didn't go well. The plastic molding intended to keep baby sitting in place is just too slippery and anytime our son kicked his legs he slid his butt forward over the hump and we had to catch him before he got water in his ears. Needless to say this frightened him and he started crying, which meant bathtime was over. I'm going to get a tub ring for him to sit in next, but this tub worked great for the first 6 months.	
1. 	Working full-time and pumping at work and at home.  Needed the extra set.  Didn't hurt when I saw them come with the nipples for those emergency feedings in the car!	
1. 	We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great.  He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast.  We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you.  So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!	
- 1	You are better off spending the extra money to buy a better sippy cup. These leak like crazy and the lids are a hassle to put together. I recommend NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce.	
1. 	i really loved it but you should know that it does seem to fill up a queen size bed. and hubby may feel a little robbed of his side of the bed. it was too firm for me at the top, i need a slighter softer pillow for my head. i always woke up with a cinked neck when i used the head part. but if you are having acid reflux and you need to elevate your back, put a head pillow on top of the head part of this thing and it helps (a little) to keep the acids down... but you will be sleeping in a slanted slightly upward position.	
- 1	This is a great bag for everyday errands with one baby. The stroller straps are very convenient and it has a good amount of pockets for both baby stuff and the stuff you would normally carry in a purse. I use the 2 wide zippered pockets on the front for wallet and make-up and gum. The 2 small side by side zippered pockets on the very front of the bag are good for your cell phone and keys and hand-sanitizer. Part of why I chose this bag was because I liked that there was a zippered pocket above the place where the diaper changing pad is, so I can keep extra diapers AND diaper ointment right there. The mesh bottle holders on the sides of the bag are great for water bottles. My only problem is that when you use all the pockets on the outside of the bag, it is very hard to get to the stuff you shove into the center of the bag. I manage to fit an extra onesie or outfit, a 9oz bottle and several 8 oz bottles of formula, one receiving blanket and one burp cloth and maybe 5 extra diapers. This is on top of the extra diapers and wipes in the back pocket and all the other stuff I put in the front pockets. I could fit more stuff inside the bag if I needed to (like a few little cardboard books, another bottle, maybe a toy), but it's already pretty packed.It's a great bag, easy to carry as a messenger bag or to strap onto your stroller or shopping cart. I love having my purse stuff in those 2 wide front pockets because it makes it easy to switch to a regular purse if I run out on my own. But this bag could really just use more space on the inside. They should remake it with the exact same set-up but just more fabric!EDITED TO ADD: I was frustrated by the lack of room in the bag when using the outer pockets and resigned myself to carrying a purse in addition to this bag. But after only 2 months of use, one of the inside pockets completely ripped from its trim and is fraying. I am sending this bag back and I bought a Ju Ju be BFF instead. After doing a ton of research, I've found that Ju Ju Be bags have a reputation for being very durable and they also have extremely functional design.	
1. 	my daughter just started teething and LOVES to knaw on this toothbrush! she holds it herself, and refuses to let it go! Im so glad something gives her relief!	
- 1	I am very disappointed by this diaper. At the beginning it worked great and I liked it more than my diaper covers with snaps. I used it with prefold diapers and I had no leaks. However, after only a month of use the velcro does not hold anymore, so the cover is now useless. It was a waste of money!	
1. 	Great bib with excellent coverage.  Love the pocket for catching what baby drops.  I hand wash in-between meals and let air dry, but I can also throw them in the washing machine--which I really like.	
- 1	This cover leaks through the fabric.  I have a bunch of Thirsties duo wrap and duo snap and they do not leak at all.  I will not buy another and only use this one in a pinch.	
- 1	I was really, really looking forward to getting this baby monitoring camera. It has all the features, and then some, that I would want in a baby camera. However, despite all my attempts, I was unable to set it up to connect to my network. THE ONLY way it seems to be able to connect to a network is through an Android or an iOS app. However, those apps are an absolute garbage - very hard to work with and incapable of basic functions. The Android app couldn't find my camera AT ALL, and the iOS app was unable to log in my home network. So right now I have this camera sitting pretty at the side of my desk, unable to function properly due to the utmost crappy software. I really hope they fix this soon. Until they do that, I would stay away from this over-expensive useless gadget.	
1. 	I needed a booster for my 2 year old and at first wasn't sure if this would be too small, but it turned out to be perfect!  He loves to sit w/ us at the table. I love how it extends three heights, so it can still grow with him.  (he is 27 lbs and 33 inches and he fits great, although he is a little small for his age according to averages I think there is def. room for him to grow in this).  He loves the table too--makes him feel like he is sitting w/ us at the dinner table but also has his special chair. Very easy to attach to a chair too--we have one w/ a cushion and no problems. Very secure. PERFECT item!	
1. 	I originally went up to size 27mm shields and was happy with them, but tried these and was glad I did. These fit me well, but I wish they made 33mm shields. They fit into the connector well (unlike the 36mm) and are well made. I'm glad Medela makes different sizes to make pumping more comfortable for us mamas! If you are debating on whether or not to try another size and you are having pain, discomfort, excessive redness, or blanching, go for it! Trying different sizes has made pumping much more enjoyable for me.	
- 1	Kudo for the design as a breastfeeding mother I was very excited about a paci that close to the natural shape of the mother's nipple but when I received this pacifier from amazon it felt a little waxy so I wash it and it still felt waxy. After washing it for about 10 times it feels better but as soon as i give it to my baby he spit it out. After so many time trying it. I try it o myself. It taste very weird. Pacifier supposed to be taste-free... and the smell is not something you want to smell for a long period of time. I threw these away and stick to the soothie that was given by the nurse in the hospital.	
1. 	I love it, and a lot of people keeps asking me where did i get it. My 2 year old and i've had used these untill a couple of months ago, she's getting heavier for my back, but i still have it on hand in the closet in case i need to go some place where the stroller would be a hassle and i'd need to have my hands free.	
- 1	Even on maximum volume this machine is so quiet that it is completely useless.Ambient noise in the room completely drowned it out. I returned it immediately.	
1. 	I bought this for my wife when she first complained of back and hip pain during her pregnancy. In her case it was around 15 weeks.She was sure that putting a pillow between her knees would be sufficient, but after two nights it was clear that would not work, as she was waking up complaining of a sore back and hip. I ordered this as a surprise and had it sent next day shipping with Amazon Prime.First Impression:The pillow is big. Like, really big. It came in a box that was easily four feet long by two feet wide and a foot and a half thick. The pillowcase was soft and the stuffing seemed soft yet supportive. It was a bit intimidating to look at out of the context of bed.Using the pillow:We put it in the bed (queen size) and she tried it out before actually going to bed. Her first impression was that it was quite comfortable to lay with. It took up a decent amount of the bed but didn't encroach my side too badly and I knew it would be worth it for her to be comfortable.She was sold on the first night. The loop that goes between the legs kept her hip in alignment and she woke up the next morning pain free. She said it did not sleep warm so she didn't get hot snuggled up against it. It helped her to stay laying on her left side for most of the night, as it made it tough to roll over with the loop between her legs. Now that she is more advanced into her pregnancy (28 weeks), the part that goes under her belly is providing good support to keep her back from getting torqued over night.She isn't experiencing any issues with the seams causing chafing as some reviewers have had.The only notable flaw is that the pillow case is getting some tiny pill balls, which is a little disappointing. However, they are very minor and would not stop me from buying the pillow again.Bonus: My dog and I also find the pillow to be extremely comfortable.	
1. 	Baby Einstein rocks!  This activity mat was the best baby gift I received.  From a few weeks old through about 6 months old, this was my baby's favorite toy.  In the beginning she's stare lovingly at the ladybug.  Then she discovered the star and she fell in love!  Once she discovered how to kick the mat to make the star play music, she was in heaven.  As soon as the music stopped, she would kick the mat again.  She would do this over and over again.  For months, the only way I could escape to take a shower was to put her on this mat.  When she got older, she loved playing with all of the hanging toys.  I got this as a gift, but if I had bought it, it would have been well worth the money!  I highly recommend this product.	
1. 	These are great for distraction-type snacks in our jogging stroller since it has no snack tray.  I worry that repeated removal of the lid will stretch it so the child will be able to remove it easily, so I don't take it off unless I have to - I just shove food in through the slits.  My only complaint is the lack of a lid so I can store in in my diaper bag already to go.  Not a huge deal though.  Very glad I bought these!  One of my girls hates to ride in a stroller (she likes to ride on my back) but sometimes she has to - this helps a lot.	
- 1	This was way too small for the price that it is.  Also it seemed like my kid could just knock it over.  Check out super panel playyard for same price and the extensions are much cheaper!	
1. 	This &#34;starter set&#34; is perfect for a new Mom, even if she's breast feeding! I have breast fed all our kids but this kit is new to me. I use it to stock up a little supply for times I'm away, and it's worked out great. I was concerned about our little guy accepting the nipple, etc, but it's been no problem. Recommended!	
- 1	I am not too impressed with this product. It was okay for the first week, but then my son started to slide up or down and would not even be on it by the time he woke up, which defeated the purpose. The sides do not attach very well to begin with and definitely are not helpful if the baby scoots during sleep. Another problem is with washing it. It is very hard to get the cover back on once you take it off. It is like it doesn't fit properly. My son is 5 weeks old and I stopped using this 3 1/2 weeks ago. Don't waste your money!	
1. 	Love these! Thank you....It's a universal color. Wish I would have bought these for my daughter when she was an infant. They aren't took bulky, easy to wash (I throw them in a pillow case in the washer) and they're easy to put on and take off. :)	
1. 	This is a great mini crib for the price, and beautiful.  We like that it fits into our master bedroom, as a full-size crib would not.  It's also pretty lightweight.  Our twins are not here yet, so this crib has not been kid-tested yet, but it looks sturdy and solid.  Pieces attach very firmly together.  I gave the crib 4 stars instead of 5 only because the assembly kit was missing one of the specialized bolts, so we had to call the company to get one shipped to us.  They did send us more (several actually), but it took a couple weeks to get them.  Luckily, we were not assembling at the last minute, so it wasn't a big deal.  We would buy this again.	
1. 	fun designs and washes up so easily. I was tired of treating stained bibs and washing them constantly in the washer, these are so easy to clean up. makes dinner and self feeding much easier!	
1. 	I'm glad I bought these and it would be really helpful if the hubs would actually read the labels so I wouldn't have to reorganize every week...	
1. 	love these!  i use with california baby diaper area wash and love the results.  no waste and no nasty chemicals.	
- 1	this doesn't fit in my car (volvo) and I had to rig it with tape to kind of work.  Should have just returned it but I opened it to install it.	
1. 	I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later! Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is! AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills. Need I say more?	
- 1	Followed mounting instructions multiple times, this absolutely DOES NOT stay up on my type of cermiac tile -- a rough surface that is not slick/shiny. Be aware. Very frustrating!	
1. 	We didn't buy this seat until our daughter was 4 months old, because we were previously using the Puj tub. I only wish we had bought it sooner! I love the fact that it is non-toxic plastic, made in the USA, and can be used for many months. One side has a cradle seat for younger babies, and the other side has a round piece that keeps older babies who can sit up from slipping and falling. Right now our daughter is using the cradle piece, and loves that she can splash around. When she can sit up, we will put her on the other side. We will feel much safer putting her in this knowing that she won't be able to slip like she would in the regular bathtub. One of our best baby purchases!	
- 1	It requires great force to install the tray on the bumbo, and you have to put the baby in the bumbo first, and then install the tray. I tried doing this and I almost hurt my baby by letting my hand slip when trying to force the tray on the bumbo. Then you have to remove the tray before taking baby out of bumbo, and again...this requires great force. I am very disappointed in this product because it would be nice to have a tray that is easy to install and remove.	
- 1	I give them a two star due to the fact they hold a car seat but one of them ripped in Half after the first flight and on the way home the other one lost a zipper. The material is extremely inflexible in cold weather too. I actually cracked it on a thirteen degree below zero day! It was cold no doubt but these were brand new. Find another option.	
1. 	these are perfect! they are a tight fit in our 7 year old outlets. they take a lot of work by an adult to get out much less a child. i think maybe the people who reviewed them as being too loose had older homes where the outlets may be different.	
1. 	Works perfectly! My son can enjoy drinking without slurping, coughing and spitting. He fell asleep today while drinking from the bottle - something that never happened with regular bottles before. Super easy to use and clean. Nobody should use regular bottles when these are available.My son is almost 2 months old and likes the slow flow nipple quite well.	
1. 	fun to bang, fun to eat, fun to carry! easy wash and put away. We didnt know that they had cut outs and numbers but its cute.	
1. 	This toy is the upgraded version of the classic stack the ring game. The elephant is adorable and my son loves playing with the different rings.. The balls also rattle which gets my son excited. He hasn't figured out to drop it in the elephant head but I anticipate many more hours of fun when he does. I would recommend this toy to anyone with a curious baby!	
- 1	Looks just like described. But my baby don't like it. It's too big for his mouth. He is 5 month old.	
- 1	This is a good idea but there are two things I didn't like about this and was the reason I returned it. First is the water reservoir. There is no way to tell if its clean. I'm sure I can clean it every so often with vinegar but its just not good enough. I have to be able to see for myself if there is possible mold or hard water deposit forming and there is no way to tell because you can't see inside it. Second issue is that there is so much water used during the cooking process. I used it to cook butternut squash. I followed the amount your suppose to use for it and seemed like the squash was being boiled in a lot of water. I don't like that the food was this watered down and yes I can pour the excess water out before pureeing but all the nutrients will be lost in the cooking water. Plus, I want to be in control of how much liquid goes into the baby food. I'm just going to buy a small processor and use my steamer and then transfer. Its just one extra step and I feel better about the food i'm giving my baby.	
- 1	First off, the 'key' you need isn't included in the package with the lock and it never said that (grrrr). Secondly, they don't work.  A good yank on the doors and my 15-month old granddaughter had them both open.	
- 1	I purchased this pillow based solely on the overwhelming positive reviews for this product on Amazon.  I cannot state enough how disappointed I've been since using it.  I find this pregnancy pillow to be extremely uncomfortable and somewhat difficult to use and here's why:1.  The Pillow Cover - the pillow cover for this product is very difficult to get back on the pillow once taken off.  I had hoped that the cover would be loose enough so that one person could easily slide it back on.  I couldn't get it back on by myself at all!  I had to have my husband help me and he did most of the pushing and shoving of the pillow back into the case.  I washed this pillow with cold water once... there wasn't a ton of shrinkage due to that.  The cover design is poor in that it is too tightly fitted.  No pillow case should require 2 people pushing, shoving and stuffing the pillow to try to get it to fit back in.2.  Body Temperature Issues - Based on most of what I've read about pregnancy, most women's temps go up at least 1 degree during this lovely time.  Many pregnant women that I've spoken with constantly complain about how hot they are so I would think that a company that designs pregnancy pillows would take this into consideration and perhaps create pillow contents and coverings that would keep pregnant women cool or at least not overly warm.  I keep the temp at around 70 or 71 degrees and have a drafty condo.  While using this pillow at night with 20 - 30 degree temps and drafty windows, I burned up.  I would literally wake up sweating whereas not using the pillow and having 2 blankets and 1 sheet I was fine.  The only way for me to be semi-comfortable in regards to the body temperature issue was to literally turn the heat off.  I was great after that, but my husband was freezing.  I have used regular bed pillows between my knees and 2 under my head and I was never this hot.3.  Overall Design & Comfort - I have had to use 2 other regular bed pillows with this product to make it comfortable.  I've tried sleeping with this pillow positioned at opposite ends and both are horrible though the open end at my head is the easier to deal with of the two.  One reviewer on this post who also gave the product two stars said that she tried placing her left arm underneath one of the legs of the pillow to try and get more comfortable, but that only managed to put her arm to sleep.  Did the exact same thing to me.  Since conventional medical wisdom is pretty much telling women to lay on their left sides for proper blood flow to the child, you really don't have too many options of sleeping in any other position unless you accidentally end up that way in the middle of the night.  I have not had one restful night of using this pillow by itself since purchasing it.  I have to use other pillows to make it reasonably OK.  I do not get the supposedly great back support that is listed in the description of what the pillow is supposed to give you either.4.  Size - this pillow is huge.  Too big, I think.  I have a queen sized bed which is pretty average for most couples in America and this pillow takes up more than half of it.  I think they could have made this either one long piece or 2 separate smaller pillows for pregnant women to use.Overall, I am highly disappointed with the money I spent for this product.  If it wasn't such a hassle (because of the sheer size of the thing and just being pregnant and feeling unwell most of the time) I would have shipped it back to the company within 3 days of using it.  $70 is way too much to pay for a product like this.  If you are dead set on buying this pillow, see if your local store (Walmart, Target, Sears, Kohls, etc.) has it before purchasing it online just so you can easily return it if it is not to your liking.The president of this company emailed me in early January asking me how I liked the product.  He stated that if my review was positive to go ahead and post it on Amazon, but if not, to let him know before posting a negative review so that he could possibly fix the issue.  I emailed him and told him that I was not happy with the product at all and since there isn't a whole lot he can do about it, I didn't expect much.  I feel that I need to be honest in my review of the Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow because $70 used in this economy and during an uncomfortable period in most women's lives is too much to pay for a below average product.  You really should save your money and either use your own pillows or buy 2 smaller ones at your local store.	
- 1	Would give this zero stars if I could.  Every time I wash a bottle, this brush flings soapy water everywhere--all over the sink, counter, and my face!  And the nipple brush is way too thick and the bristles are too hard.  A double-sponge bottle brush is what I had before (a sponge tip and sponge at base, with bristles in between), and that's what I'll be going back to.  And by the way, the tip of the nipple brush rusts right away, as other reviewers have mentioned.	
- 1	I had the unit before and we loved it. But this one started leaking from the bottom after a few days of use. I might just have gotten a defective product but some of the reviews indicated the same issue as I was having	
1. 	My son used his Kid-Ding fitted mattress cover for over a year. It had gotten kind of gross so I decided to run quickly to the store to pick up a replacement. I made the mistake of not reading the details. This company Kid-Ding makes TWO different mattress covers that look almost identical if you don't read between the lines! About the same size, one is a Kid-Ding FLAT mattress cover and the other is a Kid-Ding FITTED mattress cover.I wasted my money cause I couldn't return it once I opened it and realized the one I got at the storeWaterproof Crib & Toddler Bed Pad - 27 x 50 - Whitedidn't have a fitted skirt to wrap around the mattress! I tried to make the best of that one, but it was AWFUL! Underneath the crib sheet, it slips and slides all over the place and crinkles up like crazy! What a disaster!I went online to make sure I get the correct one this time, and I did!!! This one is a fitted mattress cover by the same company and is just PERFECT! Wraps around the crib mattress flawlessly and doesn't move an inch! It stays put and makes slipping on the crib sheet so much easier!!! I have since bought another one! They're great and reversible. I machine wash mine and air dry -- DO NOT put it in the dryer!	
- 1	I dropped this adapter from about 3 feet and one of the latches broke off rendering it unusable. Amazon was quick to replace, so disaster was averted. Besides that, we are happy with it.	
1. 	We love this!  We actually use it as a back up in the car, especially when my husband takes our 2 year old out alone so that he does not have to drag her into a male restroom.  We have also switched to using old grocery bags with napkins inside - it works just the same (so long as the bags have no holes) because when she first started potty training we were going through the other bags too quickly and couldn't order them fast enough (and I haven't found them in any stores yet). It really helped us to be able to pull over to a parking lot and let her go as soon as she felt the need.  I was alittle timid about it at first but we never had any probelms with the potty not locking into place and it's the perfect size for her - she actually loves it.	
- 1	Our daughter had massive colic and I would pop her in this swing to sooth her. At first we loved it! After two months it started to slow down and by three months of use the motor had perished. We returned it for another one and it would not even turn on! Then we returned it for another and it was missing pieces! Ugh. We gave up after this. Customer service had the motor on back order and was not helpful. We ended up exchanging the swing for other baby items. We will never get this item again.	
1. 	My wife enjoys the privacy of breastfeeding covered.  This is a great product for that.  The black tends to blend well with clothing and is not very noticeable.  The pockets are a good feature and the quality is top notch.	
1. 	It fits the play pen mattress (not too snugly, but well enough). It's also pretty water proof, to a point. It's a bit high, but tree better quality of the covers I've found.	
1. 	We bought this mobile after a defective Fisher Price one didn't work at all. Although the animals on the FP mobile were cuter than this one, the music on the Tiny Love is very high-quality, long-lasting and impressive. The volume choices are just right for us - neither too loud, nor too quiet. The colors are great and the googly eyes on the animals catch our 2-month-old's attention. Works great on our cradle so far - the hook that holds it in place is another added advantage over the FP mobile we had. It's worth the price for the remote control extra - just think you can sit across the room or at the door and just press the button to restart the mobile. Worth it!	
1. 	I used to be one of those people who would cringe when I saw somebody with their child on a leash like a pet, I swore I would never be one of 'those' parents.Well...needless to say my mind was changed by a very active toddler who loves to run and doesn't like to listen.  I got one of these to take with us on our road-trip so that at every rest stop when we got out to stretch our legs I could actually let my daughter run and get some exercise and burn off some energy without having to hold onto her or carry her.  The harness allowed her some freedom but within limits and she learned very quickly how to walk with me while it was attached to her.It was super-easy to use and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has to take an active toddler someplace where you know they're going to want to run but can't have total freedom.	
- 1	Too small. It is harder/denser that the Boppy, but this also makes it more rigid, making it a little more difficult to position the baby	
1. 	This has worked great in our bathroom.  We put all the toys in the frog and then were able to hang things from it's toes.My daughter and son both think it is funny and like to clean up after themselves (the only place they like so far).Recommend it for even small bathrooms as it fits in our tiny one just fine.	
1. 	i dont like that if you stop it mid cycle when you come back to warm another bottle it starts halfway through the cycle. it does not re-set. it warms by steam. there is a hotplate at the bottom then you pour water into the chamber and the steam that is created warms the bottle. it comes with the container that you fill up with the water to pour in.	
- 1	This toy seemed like a good idea to help encourage my daughter to crawl. She seemed interested in it at first, but it quickly fell over and that was the end. I would keep putting it upright but as soon as she'd get to it she'd just knock it back over again defeating the whole purpose. It also continued to make its annoying barking and howling noises long after the &#34;play&#34; was done.	
1. 	I think it's cute. The dial controls the sound very well. I like the several options of noises although the whale one is just weird. I love that there are two timer lengths. It hooks on our crib easily. I would buy this as a gift.	
1. 	i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.	
1. 	I was trying out different breastpads, this among them. It came with a trial pair of the nighttime pads, they're thicker and worked great. The daytime version works very well, they're soft and cushy with a nice contour. They'd be perfect if there was a second sticky pad. As they are, they travel all over my bra or nursing tank and get flipped down when I go to nurse. It's a trial to get it back in place when I'm trying to 'zip up' after nursing, with a curious 4 month old looking and squirming around I'm fumbling with a bunched up nursing pad. In a pinch I'd definitely pick up a package but my primary will be lansinoh's disposables.	
1. 	I read the reviews on many drawer chests before purchasing this one for my 5 month old son's room. I was a little apprehensive before I received it because of some negative reviews, but I am pleasantly suprised. This chest is very nice for the price I paid. It was not that difficult to put together, just need a screwdriver and patience. It took about 3 hours to assemble. There aren't any scratches on the finish, it is also pretty sturdy. The drawers are on metal tracks which makes them open and close very smoothly. I can see us using this for at least several years to come. It came with an anti-tip over attatchment that is very important as my little guy learns to pull up on things and walk. All in all, I am very satisfied with this chest, it was worth the money and I would buy it again if I needed another.	
1. 	With this sit my girl's back became strong very quickly and she discovered that she can hold her back straight very fast. Pushed her sitting time a lot faster. Get the table for it too. I put toys on it so she can play while sitting. Also, if you have small leaving space, it is a good alternative to a high chair. If you get a table attached, you can easily feed your lo there.	
1. 	These worked well and were easy to use but we are tall people. If you cannot reach the top of the closet door easily you may want to try and find a different product.	
- 1	I bought this bra hoping I could wear it under my clothes while at work, pump and continue to work - not so much. I didn't try any other pumping bras and I guess I didn't realize how bulky they would be, but no way could you wear this thing under any outfit, except for a heavy sweater. The option of taking it to work and putting it on before every pumping is a complete waste of time, it takes longer to put it on than it does to just open my regular bra, pump and slightly cover up with the shirt I was wearing. I wish I hadn't bought this bra it is just too impractical.	
1. 	This is one of the most beautiful toys my son has. I love the rainbow of colors. The clackety-clack of the outer segments, the colors, and the changing shape of the globe keeps him interested. He'll still look at it now that he's 15 months old. It's also very durable--it shows no signs of wear still.	
1. 	Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.	
1. 	This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)	
- 1	These are literally cheap rubbery foam corners with stick ons.  They serve their purpose when I can keep them on the table.  Unfortunately, my daughter can tear these off within seconds.  They are extremely cheap and don't look nice in addition to being way overpriced at $7.99.	
1. 	We love this whole kit. It has everything. When my son takes night time baths we use the lavender soap and boy is he ready for bed when we get him out. The carry case is also a great. We take it on trips with us and we carry his basic shampoo that came with the kit, toys, towels, washcloths and such and there is still room for more!!! The lotion is great and very thick which helps keep babies skin ever so soft after bath time, and the moisturizing stick is fantastic for getting a dry patch here and there. We keep it in the diaper bag. Great set for any parent, a must have for first time parents.update: my son is now 9.5 mths old and we have yet to even finish  our second bottle of wash. Everything except the lotion and 1.5 bottles of baby wash we still have plenty of. This gift set is fantastic, talk about the gift that keeps giving. At this rate we will not need to buy shampoo/body wash until after his first birthday!!	
- 1	The music quality on this toy is horrible. It is poor quality and there is a big lopsided lump on the head where the speaker is. My daughter never cared for it. However I do know someone who said their child loved it. My dog wants it more than my baby.	
1. 	Bought this for when we sit outside with my 5 month old, it is small enough to keep in the car for outside parties, picnics, etc and very convenient to carry.  We went to an outside party where the grass was just watered and this kept us dry and provided a nice place to put the baby down so she could play out of the sun.  I've washed it a few times and its held up great so far.  Love it and predict it will get much use in future outings!	
1. 	Our 9 month old baby boy has many of the little toys, and this is one of his favorites.  He likes to hold it and shake it back and forth.  Haba toys are the best!	
1. 	My little girl who is 4 months now has been fascinated with this mobile from day one. I hung it above her changing table when she was younger but now its over her crib. She loves it and stares at it for minutes (thats a long time--ha ha) in awe.	
1. 	I have 0 complaints about this gate! I purchased it from our local W*l-Mart for 34.97, and didn't have to wait for it to be shipped to me. I would suggest checking at your local store before waiting for it to be shipped. (Super-saver shipping takes forever) We use this gate to keep our Sheltie in the kitchen when she is eating, and to keep our 4 year old and our 13 month olds out of the kitchen. We love it! Perfect all around! Our 13 month old uses it to balance when watching me cook, and she shakes the door, hard, and it is just as sturdy as it could be! Opening it and closing it is very simple, and it has the slam shut feature, so you don't have to push the button and pull back the handle to shut it, that would be a pain. We will get many years of use out of this, considering it can keep our 4 year old out! It is just great!	
- 1	It is NOT no-slip.  I bought this after The Baby Guy reviewed it as being great for not slipping around the table.  I figured it would be really challenging for my daughter to pick up/throw.  It's not.  She picked it right up and threw it on the floor (along with the food in it).  Once she gets over this throwing phase, it should be fine, but it's definitely not worth the cost compared to other similar items.	
- 1	This product does not stick to anything. Do not waste your money. I will be returning this. The suction cups have no suction with or without being moistened.	
1. 	I love that you can unzip these from the bottom and perform a diaper change at night without having to completely undress the baby.  The fleece blankets are great to layer over footie pjs in the winter to keep baby toasty warm.Good quality material and zipper.	
- 1	We loved this seat until today our baby girl was choking on something while we were driving.  Of course, we stopped to help her and found that she had chewed off and swallowed some of the black felt used for padding on the arm straps.  This is completely unacceptable for a car seat!  The item should be recalled immediately.  Even if your child doesn't choke on it, the material cannot be good for them to eat.	
1. 	By far the best bib I have found to date! Excellent quality and the most adorable prints. I know others complained about the quality but if you wash and dry by hand per the instructions they will last forever!! They keep my children dry and food, drinks, markers, playdoh, etc... Off my child. They wipe off very easily. My child would get sick in the car and we would put the bib on before leaving the house and this would catch most of what came up. We are so thankful for these bibs and highly recommend them.	
1. 	We were a die hard Avent family becasue of our daughter tummy troubles.  But they just didn't seem to be working for her.  They were great in reducing air intake, but she just seemed to leak an awful lot with them.  She would be covered by the time she was done and that was with the number 1 nipples.  Plus for some reason my husband and mother has trouble with the bottle themselves leaking.  So I started to research and try other bottles.We hated the liner in the nursers, she hated Dr. Brown's, and the paln jane bottles allowed her to take in too much air.  So we were stuck on Avent until last week.  My cousin had a little girl and we traded a bottle to try the other guys out.Well, we steralized what we had and traded!  Her daughter does great on the Avent and doesn't leak....our daughter does great with the Vent Aire and does not leak.  I guess it just depends on teh child.  But, these are great.  She manges to keep it all in her mouth and she doesn't fill up with air.  They are also more afforable than the Avent.Anotehr plus is that she is 3 months now and very much wants to hold her own bottle and with these, she is almost there.  She can wrap her hands around them and pull her feet up for extra support and just about hond them herself.  This feat makes her very happy and the lack of leaks and tummy aches make us very happy.	
1. 	I recently purchased this yard when my twins ((now nearly 8 months old)) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house, but I have super-yard'ed the family room! I have it shaped as a square, and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside, to protect my carpet. The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes, and be able to play with many of their toys ((rather than being confined in a pack n play)). It is pretty sturdy if used properly, I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it, obviously it would collapse. It DOES fold, but not at all compactly, and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard, look else-where. I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area, or even remove/add panels ((sold separately which we did not buy)) to make it larger or smaller. Also, due to it being plastic ((very well rounded I may add, no sharp edges!)) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving!I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to gate off 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room. My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ((with the full hole, not the 1/2 hole) to either side of each door frame, and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate, that it will work. Of course, this will do damage to our walls, but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ((please note that these are NOT meant for stairs, or doorways. They are NOT baby gates... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention)). And, one of my friends owns one, and used it to surround her christmas tree last year, which I thought was an AMAZING idea!I think that once our boys master crawling, and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now!	
1. 	It's basically just a large, oddly shaped duffel bag. For the price it's still not bad, but don't expect anything special. There is no way to open it from the bottom as stated on the product page, but I don't understand how that would make packing easier anyways. There is a clip for the zipper which is nice in idea, but the loop from the zipper to the clip is a cheap, flimsy material that I can easily imagine tearing if caught on something. I'd be more comfortable with two zippers that I can lock together.I haven't used it yet, but will update after I fly in September.EDIT: trying to put the car seat in the bag in the airport while having to hold an 11-month-old in a carrier was a challenge. I was flying alone and in a hurry that I accidentally put the seat in the bag sideways. Oops. After the international flight and layover, the bag held up well except for one small tear that was actually caused from the car seat on the inside. I have a feeling it was caused by stress of the awkward placement. Otherwise it held up really well. I just wish the top was labeled and that the strap wouldn't get so much in the way.EDIT 2:I've currently gone through 4 flights with this bag and 4 more planned for this year. It's still awkward to put in, but I'm getting better at it the more I use it. Also, I haven't had any more damage aside from that small tear. It's surprisingly durable so far. Considering the other reviews about it tearing easily, I kinda expected it to be in shreds by now. Also, I have an Evenflo Tribute 5, if that makes any difference.Edit 3: I've gone through a grand total of 2 international transatlantic flights and 6 domestic flights (within the US) using this bag. It's great!!! Yeah, the design of the bag is a little difficult to work with, but it gets the job done. I haven't had any problems with any rips or tears since that first flight when I put the carseat in sideways. That tear (about the size of a quarter) hasn't caught on anything or gotten any larger. It's completely protected the carseat.  Also, the clip on the zipper has surprisingly held up really well.  The reviewers that had problems with it tearing easily probably should re-evaluate how they were using the bag and the type of car seat they were using. My son's carseat is a fairly standard convertible car seat with no accessories (like a cup holder). Also make sure the bottom of the carseat is in the wider end and either facing straight down or up, but definitely do not lay the carseat on its side inside of the bag. Because of how the bag is tapered, putting it in sideways will cause unnecessary stress and inevitably cause a tear. I have another international transatlantic flight coming up this fall and plan on continuing to use it for as long as possible.  I still wish the straps were placed farther down the side for better stability and to keep it out of the way when putting the carseat in, but I've gotten used to handling it.	
1. 	This sheet fit great on our crib mattress and held up in the wash. It's very soft and comfortable. Would buy again	
- 1	If you own this product, the motor WILL fail.... not a matter of if.... when.  Lasted 4 months.... died on a night that my wife and I were completely exhausted and left us with even more lower back pain.This is not a product that you should leave your kid in but for us, it was great at rocking him to sleep so we could more easily transfer him to the crib from time to time.	
1. 	This is a great item to help your child strengthen their legs, plus the added bonus of wearing them out before nap time!  The look of joy on their little faces, once they figure out how to jump, is the greatest thing ever!	
- 1	I bought these for my two-year old daughter who loves Elmo.  However, the Elmo handle is not comfortable to hold for her or for me and the spoon is almost flat so nothing really fits into it.  Since this is the only Elmo set like this I could find I would say you can get it but don't expect much practicality out of it.  my daughter was only interested in the top portion of the spoon and wanted to take it off of the spoon and just play with Elmo until I explained to her that this is the design of the spoon and it won't come off.	
- 1	This product contains almond oil.  So if you or anyone in your family has a history of severe nut allergies, you may want to skip it and go with Lansinoh instead.A reaction is probably unlikely, but why take chances with your baby?  (I wish that the product ingredients were listed somewhere on the Amazon page... that would be helpful.)However, if you really want a plant-based alternative to Lansinoh, you might consider the nipple cream by Motherlove. It contains olive oil and beeswax instead.Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream (1 oz)	
1. 	My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.	
- 1	Because of the bright colors on this items, i though my daughter will love it. On the internet, it looks like the teether was small enough for a 5 and half month old child to hold. But when i got it, i was not impressed at all. It was too thick for her to grab, and will not even fit her month either. So, now it is in the box with the rest of the useless items that will never be used again	
- 1	I read the reviews on this item before I bought it so I knew it would be a 50/50 chance I would either like it or hate it.  I can't get it to stick on our tub walls.  Have tried a few things to help them stick with no luck.  It was inexpensive so glad I didn't spend any more than what I did on it.	
- 1	This bowl is okay, but not great.  I find the spill catcher on the side is actually more of a handle for my 13 month old to rip it off the table.  The suction cup doesn't seem to prevent him from pulling the whole thing off and dumping it on the floor.	
1. 	This thing is GREAT. Better than the Snugli or other items similar to that. In the sling, the baby's entire body, not just the trunk, is cradled against you, sort of like in the womb. It actually looks uncomfortable for the baby, but mine sleeps quite soundly in it.Not only is it comfortable for both you and baby, there's enough material to provide a covering for nursing, unlike the snugli types.It also provides mom with hands-free mobility.And it's SO SO SO much better than lugging around a two-ton car seat! The baby is quite secure without additional support of any kind. It does take some getting used to. It took a while to figure out the right position for both carrying and nursing. So if you buy one, don't be discouraged if you can't figure it out right away. You'll love this thing!	
- 1	Or at least mine died.  The monitor died and I could not get a replacement (it was not the batteries-I checked and was sad).And it is not compatible with the later models either.  So I have a working camera but no working monitor.  Really frustrating, considering I had to buy a second monitor before I ever even got pregnant again.I gave 2 stars because it was great while the handset was working.  It was good to be able to see if my little was fussing because she was angry she had to go to sleep or if she was really in trouble.It seems this company is a bit of a racket-would it really have been that hard to make the newer models play nicely with the older models.  I probably will go with someone else, or plan on buying extra bits the first time so I am not out $200 with no notice on a camera.	
1. 	Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottle Sealing Discs work on both the Classic and the Natural.  Clean easy and are slightly rubbery for a tight seal.	
1. 	We bought a used swing at a consignment sale for our second child, now 4 mo and about 18 lbs, 26. I wanted to buy one for our first, but just couldn't afford a new one and there weren't any used available!Love the Ocean Wonders line, which was brand new back in 2004. Great colors and well themed.Anyhow, our swing has a fish, crab, seahorse, and clam on the mobile. There are also two pockets for toys (an Ipod fits perfectly for the napping soundtrack).The newer models have just fish and no pockets. It sounds like FP has dropped its quality control on the swing, allowing bad screws and a weak swing motor.Our motor is keeping up well with our enormous baby. It's annoying that the swing only takes D batteries, but my baby uses the swing every day for 3-5 hrs, and we are only on our 4th set. I can tell it's time for new ones when the mobile won't spin. The swing will still rock effectively for at least another week.I love this swing. It's wide 'stance' and well-designed seat feel very safe. We haven't gotten to the top speed yet, so I feel like it will be useful for at least another 5 lbs.This older model is worth a craigslist search or checking out some consignment sales.	
1. 	I chose this soft food feeder because it was made in the US and the feeder bags weren't dyed.  Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth.	
- 1	Didn't seem to do anything. Smells nice though. However, if your baby has colic I'm sure you are willing to try anything. Colic Calm works better.	
- 1	This product has a very good build quality but the back doesn't recline properly. I compared the images posted on bobs website and the product delivered by amazon and the strap that hold the back of stroller together is at the wrong place. this is the second one I got from amazon that has wrong strap. I am now contacting the manufacturer bob to see if this is a production issue. once I have the answer I update you	
1. 	My one year old son and I share a shower/bathtub. The older he gets, the more bath toys he seem to acquire! Well, after finally getting frustrated with lining them up along the edge of the tub, I found this little cubby at Wal-mart one day. I wasn't expecting much, but it was something for the time being, till I could find something I felt would be sturdier. Fortunately, there's no need!I've had this for about 2 months now, and it has never, not once, fallen down. I have your average, fiberglass shower/tub, and this thing is FILLED with bath toys. I guess it depends on what type of tub you have, but this was a great find for me. I absolutely recommend it.	
1. 	Like another reviewer, I picked these up for only $8 at TJ Maxx. They have been selling tons of Boon products lately, which is great! My daughter loved these immediately. The pieces are a good size, interesting blob shapes, and cool colors (includes brown, teal, mustard, etc. in addition to your typical baby primaries). She loves standing up in the bath now (eek!) and sticking these to the wall. They stay on well with very little pressure and water. She has been chewing on them too, and has yet to tear one, so they seem quite durable. They show some teeth marks, but that's it. The scrubbies are a little rough to actually wash a baby with (stick to a washcloth), but they are another tactile item to explore. The balls in the new sets (shiny vs. matte) are PVC-free, and daughter also loves chewing on those. So does the dog for that matter, she's gotten a hold of and destroyed two! Overall, I'd highly recommend them, but try to find them on sale :)	
1. 	No fuss, no muss.  It's basically a trash can.  It's no Diaper Decor but it absolutely does the job.  I also like that it has a little compartment on the lid for you to put a deodorizer disc.	
1. 	My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended)	
- 1	I bought this play mat for my daughter a little over a month ago, all was great with it until this week when out of no where the music and light travel player started skipping music, it would play the same section of a song over and over and over again. I was able to exchange it at the store I bought it at and I got a new one (the same exact play mat), brought it home, put it together and found that this new one had the same glitch!!!!! so frustrating!! I brought it back and got a completely different brand!Update:: Its been about 3 months since I called the manufactor and advised them of my issue.  They were awesome and sent me a new music box (even though I already returned the whole baby gym and bought a whole different make and model.) I was using the music box in the car for my little one,  SADLY the new one now also skips like the two others I owned before. Its really annoying because my daughter loves the music and lights so much, but I cant take the skipping over and over and over again.  Even though the company tried to make it up to me, it still doesn't work....  Don't bother with this baby gym at all!!	
1. 	My first review EVER on any website but figure what site to better start my review process than Amazon itself.First, I received this as part of my registry and Amazon had sent the wrong version of the tub. Despite the error, Amazon customer service was outstanding. Not only did the rep corrected the mistake and got everything processed in a matter of minutes with free shipping to return the wrong product but the replacement came literally overnight at no cost to me or the gift giver. That's what I call customer service and surely many retailers should learn from Amazon especially if they want to keep their customers happy and loyal.Okay, now to the product... This is one of the most functional and practical item that all new parents should seriously have on their 'must have' lists. The sling certainly comes in handy for newborns as it acts as an extra support for their bodies and prevents them from sliding down. In addition, the storage area is a huge plus - the right amount to put in what you really need or use to bathe your child. To help the drying process, I angle it and put it upside down against the tub sprout, which I find to help a lot if you want to prevent mildew etc after each use.I'm looking forward to using this tub as my baby grows and transitions from newborn to toddler... &lt;(^.^)>	
- 1	Many of my friends had these and told me that their babies loved them so I bought one for my 3 month old son. I thought at first that the idea of this item was really great. A combination of a pacifier and stuffed animal seems like it would be so soothing! My son showed no interest in this item and even when I tried to introduce it as he grew he still wasn't impressed. He is 1 year old now and has never used this item. So I guess it depends on the child if they like it or not, but this is not why I am giving it two stars. I am giving it two stars (stars are for the good idea) because this item it almost impossible to clean. You cannot sterilize the pacifier and when you wash the stuffed animal you need to let it air dry (you can't put it in the dryer because of the pacifier). I wish it was made in a way that would allow you to detach the pacifier more easily so that you can clean the stuffed animal and pacifier separately.	
1. 	I bought this co-sleeper to use when my baby outgrows the By Your Side Sleeper which will be very soon. I was looking for something safe to put baby in to cosleep. The By Your Side Sleeper was great to use for the newborn stage and to have baby safely right in bed with you. But I needed something bigger and the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper was the answer. I have it set up in co-sleeper mode but I don't have it attached to the bed yet. I am currently using it as a changing table to get baby used to it so I can hopefully transition easier soon. The co-sleeper is a nice size and I like that it has mesh all around the mattress area on the liner for breath ability. I also love that the co-sleeper turns into a playard so I can use it after outgrows co-sleeper. It's a great value. It's a 3 in 1 deal for me: extra changing table so I don't have to go to baby's room for diaper changes in middle of night, co-sleeper soon, and then playard.I did buy extra things for the co-sleeper.I had to buy theArm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Naturalsince we have a high bed with a pillow top mattress. I haven't put them on since I haven't attached to bed yet.I boughtContinental Quilting Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Padfor extra cushion on top of the mattress pad and it will also absorb any leaks that might happen. It fits the co-sleeper great and covers the whole mattress pad.I also boughtAmerican Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play Sheetsince I wanted a nicer softer sheet. It fits the co-sleeper perfectly and its super soft.	
- 1	Doesn't adjust well; doesn't stay on, and comes folded up from China so that it basically never takes the right shape again.	
- 1	The problem with this monitor is that it doesn't hold a charge. I go to bed with a full charge at 100% and in the middle of the night I am awakened by the annoying beeping sound alerting me the battery is dying. I have a baby, I am awakened every night by him, why would i want to be woken up by this monitor TOO????  Why not keep the monitor in the charging unit? Because the manual says that if you consistently keep it on the charging unit, it will ware out the battery and limit battery life!!! Then I will have to buy a new battery. I have returned this item 3 times in case it was just defective and they were all like this. I finally had to buy a new monitor from another company who's monitor last 36 hours while in the sleep mode without being charged. Much happier!Other than that, I like the monitor but the charging issue was just a terrible.	
1. 	I was tired of of putting blankets on my daughter and figured this was easier.  It's easy to put in the car seat but I thought it actually went on the seat in replace of the original car seat cover.  It only has a band that goes around the top and sits on top of what's already on the seat.  There's nothing that attaches the bundle me at the foot.  The original reviewer was right when they said the top is really long when you unzip it.  Overall though I think it's a great product to keep her warm so I don't have to mess around with sweaters and blankets.	
1. 	We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the Notes section to write some story, etc.  It also helps Dad see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!	
- 1	I had high hopes for this activity gym. It changes position so a baby can by lying down or sitting or standing to play with it. But. Ours broke. My son is only 7 months. We have had this for probably only 4 months. He is sitting and standing up on things now but I can't change the position it is in!! It is stuck in the lying down position. Now I have changed the position many times before so it is not user error. The little teal/blue buttons that you press to release it are no longer functional.	
1. 	I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!	
1. 	Bought 2 of these and have been using them in rotation for 2 years or so.  It's perfect for when you are at the beach or soemwhere where you want your kid to keep the pacifier in the mouth instead of picking up random objects and sticking them into the mouth.  In the backyard, the leash helps keep the paci from being lost in the yard or dropped into the dirt.  Also keeps the pacifier from being lost in the piles of toys in the playroom so we all know where it is when it's needed.I get compliments on it all the time...how cute it is.  It is starting to show its age...the (wooden) beads are starting to crack at the edges, and the colors are not as bright. I will be happy if it lasts long enough for my son to get out of the drop anything on the floor as soon as you are done with it or if you find something momentarily more interesting phase.	
1. 	I purchased a travel size Pack n Play to keep at my house for my granddaughter.  This sheet fits the mattress perfectly and it is a nice quality.  I should have bought two!	
- 1	I bought these to go along with the snack traps which are a waste. Just a poorly made product (the snack traps). I haven't even taken the tethers outof the package, they might be good for other things besides the snack traps though.	
- 1	This newer, cutesy version of the Playtex Nurser has a major design flaw - the ounce markings on the side of the rigid plastic shell holder are not horizontal LINES, which you expect for an accurate measure. Rather, the ounce gradations are marked by adorable but basically useless rounded leaves, bubbles, raindrops, etc. Where does the ounce mark truly begin? At the top of the icon? Bottom? Smack dab in the middle?? (Try eyeballing THAT at 3 AM!) Because baby is on a strictly liquid diet for at least the first 4 - 6 months, being able to obtain correct & exact measurements at feeding time is VERY important.I'm sticking with the less attractive but much more practical ORIGINAL Playtex Nurser. They are hard to find but worth it! They are also made of a much sturdier plastic than these flimsy bottles. My baby seems to be doing just fine with them and they're working well for us, though I'll probably switch to a non-liner bottle system once he passes the 3-month mark.	
- 1	I bought these because I could not find white in our local stores.  I have Safety First corners that have been in place at least 2 years with no issues.  First, these are really not white, they are off-white.  The bag has corners & the stickers included.  They are not on the corners, you place it yourself.  I did that and places it on the corners of my girls' new dresser.  I pressed them down & held them for about 45 seconds.  They are not solidly stuck, but move & sick cock-eyed.  I am constantly pressing them back in place.  They are protecting my kids' heads from the sharp dresser corner, but I would not recommend or by it again.	
1. 	I like this blanket, it is big, and folds nicely into a bag of a sort. It did smell horrible when I first opened it, but once I washed it, the smell was gone. It looks to be well constructed, and I like the material it is made of. I am giving it 4 stars because it is heavy, other than that, great!	
1. 	I really love this product. it was perfect for my changer topper and most covers fit that I bought for it. one thing is though the picture looks like the changing cover vynil is alwyas flush against its surface but actually it is not. The pastic vinyl is loose and hovers above the surface. No big deal since the cover does the same thing.	
- 1	Even though the idea was a great concept for avoiding flat head, my newborn hated it. Every time I place him on the boppy head support, he would wiggle until he was off the support. I didn't want to waste the purchase so currently we are using it as a head support for the changing station. That he doesn't mind.	
- 1	Worked great for a few days, then started developing quirks - like it would get stuck on one sound or wouldn't turn on right away.  The iPod plug in never worked.Used if for a few weeks at night in baby's room, he slept to the white noise.  At three weeks it got stuck on - could not turn it off and then it died.  Completely dead.  Piece of junk!Tried to return to amazon.com - but they said it had been too long since purchase.  NO REFUND!!!!Read a bunch of other reviews and this happens a lot.  It's a defective product and the manufacturer knows it.  BUYER BEWARE.You should not have to purchase a new baby sound machine every month!  I'm going to try the Ecotones and the Marpac - both of which have way better reviews even though they're more expensive.  BUT since I've been using a fan for about ten years - it's worth the investment to me.I hope I can save some others from a faulty purchase and waste of money.	
- 1	I had high hopes after to doing lots of research, but it was clunky and stiff. Its even uglier and bulkier in person for not much added features. We returned it, and decided to go with the britax b-agile. It folds differently, but smaller than the Joovy and a little lighter. Joovy is hard to open and close, and the storage is tiny! Britax B-agile i can close with one hand while holding my baby, fit my huge diaper bag in the storage and it out maneuvers the Joovy everytime, not to mention the canopy is larger and it is a GREAT looking stroller and way less $$. Dont go with Joovy for a stroller, i have both the Joovy playyard and playyard2, which are perfect and wonderful, Joovy is a great company, but needs to stick with play yards.	
1. 	I wasn't so sure about buying this product.  The description says it's soft foam so I really was unsure about how much my preschooler would sink into it.  I was also concerned that, without the straps holding it to the chair, it would move around on top of the chair and possibly fall off while my son tried to get in or out of it.  I'm glad I took a chance.  He LOVES it!  He used to complain that his old booster seat with straps (both straps around the chair to keep the seat on the chair and straps to hold him in the seat) would be too tall for his legs to fit comfortably under the table - even with the height adjustment.  My son loves that it's so comfortable.  He doesn't sink at all, and it doesn't move around on the chair.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a booster without straps.	
1. 	when i saw reviews online that said it was a pain to adjust to fit the first time, i was a little leary of getting it but then i tried it and it was VERY easy.  of course you'll need someone to help but it can be done quickly.  took about 5 minutes if that.  its great for when they are fussy and want to be held all the time.  my sister love it because she can carry her neice and do what needs to be done around the house.  i use it everywhere i go.  if i walk to get coffee, i take it because its easier to get around in a store without a stroller.  always use it in the grocery store.  i hate putting her in the baby seats that are attached to the carts.  and she is still too little to sit up in the cart so the sniggli works wonders!  would recommend it to everyone	
1. 	This little fence/playpen is one of the best things we bought for our daughter since her birth!  We bought this PLUS one 2 panel extension...and put it on an 8' x 6' puzzle mat!  It gives her a huge space to play in while we are able to make meals, do dishes etc... without having to worry about not having our hands on her constantly.  We have had as many as 4 adults in the pen with her at the same time...and had more than enough room.  Way better option than one of the TINY traditional playpens that really are like little baby jails!One suggestion is that when we first got this we set it up in a square at almost 6' x 6'  However, when you have two panels straight together...it isn't super stable...it works only OK.  If you think...Octagon and bend the fence a little between each panel...it is way more stable and works fantastic!!!Highly recommend this product.  Daughter learned to stand in here AND started cruising all around the pen within days of standing.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Oh last thing, it comes apart and folds up very easily for transport...we take it with us to the grandparents house to use when they watch her for us and when we just visit overnight!	
- 1	I have no idea how this cup is so highly rated, because it is honestly the worst cup I've ever bought. It leaks so horribly, I had to change my son's clothes the first time I gave it to him. Yes, it was perfectly closed, but it just leaks, from the straw and the sides and all over.I have a Playtex one and was upset because it leaked when my son would shake it but after buying this one here, I think the other one is great.	
- 1	These little musical instruments are simply not worth it.  They are cheap, they don't make much sound and honestly were a waste of money.  They are not infant or toddler friendly either.	
- 1	What I don't like:The size is on the small side. The bib itself as well as the opening for the neck.The size of the velcro and the part that attaches to the velcro do not match, so the extra velcro scratched my son's face when he moved his bead in that direction.The appliques that are attached to the closure part are so hard and rough. It also scratched my son's face when he moved, so I went ahead and cut them off each one with a scissor.The material is on the thin side. There are times where it would literally be soaked after a feeding.After a few washes, the material shriveled up and started to fuzz.I do not see myself reaching for these bibs at all. I only use them when I need to do laundry and have nothing else to use.	
1. 	This a review of several swaddling blankets that we have tried with out newborn.  The Miracle Blanket is by far our favorite and the only one we use.  My mom friends feel the same way.-Miracle Blanket: This thing is a little bit of a contraption, it has all sorts of jersey flaps to keep your baby secure in the swaddle.  The reason the Miracle Blanket is so good is that you secure your baby's arms first with separate flaps so they can't wiggle out like the rest of the swaddling blankets I have tried.  It's a little more expensive but totally worth it because its the only one where she stayed swaddled until we unswaddled her ourselves.-SwaddleMe: This is an okay swaddling blanket, the problem is that she can get her arms out when she wiggles enough.  I think the Miracle Blanket is much better.-Aden and Anais Swaddling Blankets: These are great little blankets to have around that work for a ton of things.  They are really cute and the muslin is a really nice fabric for blankets.  When we first had our baby, before we had the Miracle Blanket, we used these to swaddle.  The are definitely harder to use than Miracle and require some swaddling skills but they work pretty well.  She will wiggle her arms out unless you do a really good job swaddling your baby.  The other thing that made me nervous about this is that sometimes there is some loose material around the neck and face and made me paranoid about SIDS or her being smothered.	
- 1	I do NOT like this tub!!!!!  It gets 2 points for cute, but -3 for having NO drain, being TOO slippery, and too short on the inside.  The duck tub is better, we got this car tub to replace a holey duck. I didn't realize it didn't come with a drain, which is really fantastic if your baby/toddler pulls a maneuver that causes a need for emptying the tub quickly for safety reasons.  I feel it's a potential safety risk, more than other tubs.  What a disappointment, it's otherwise really cute and the pockets are fun.  It's also a lot harder to inflate than the duck tub.	
1. 	this is a bare bones baby monitor, but it does what it's supposed to do. we get strong reception throughout our 3 level house with ceramic tile floors and thick walls.  we can hear even very quiet things like our girl's soft snoring and the rustling of sheets.  i have no need for a super fancy monitor -- i just want to know if the baby is asleep or awake and needs tending to.  this monitor is all i need for that.we've been using this monitor for about 6 months now and have had no problems with it. i was a bit hestitant to order when i saw how many people had problems with the product, but thought it was worth a shot.	
- 1	I purchased this set for my toddler because he was demanding his own fork and spoon at mealtimes, and he did not want the plastic kiddie ones we had. Since regular forks and spoons are a bit large for his mouth, I found this set. Well, he doesn't like it. He still prefers adult forks and spoons, which he uses with success. The spoon in this kiddie set is too wide to fit in a toddler mouth, and the fork's tines are so dull, he can't stab anything with them. Otherwise, they're nice quality, but not meeting our needs.	
1. 	This booster is pretty handy to have! My 7-month-old uses it instead of a highchair. The only problem is that the moment I place her in it, she removes the white tray. Not sure why the manufacturer didn't place the fastener elsewhere. I just don't use the white tray or green cover. The blue tray fits securely on and easily washes in the dishwasher, so it's really no big deal. I've seen people bring it to playgroups, restaurants, etc. It fits perfectly on our chairs and I can push her right up to the table and counter without the tray.	
1. 	Some people say that these drop-ins did not keep a good seal, but I found that those individuals were trying to push all the air out through the nipple and the pressure is what broke the seal.  If you want less air just press some of the air out before putting the ring on.  Pressing all the air out is unnecessary.  The liner does its job without pressing all the air out.  The point of the collapsible liner is to not let more air in as your baby eats, and it does a fantastic job.  If you would rather not buy replacement liners, Playtex VentAire takes the same nipples and does the same job with a vent at the bottom, keeping a seal when the pressure of the milk is on it, and then allowing air in through the bottom to replace the milk as the baby eats.  These don't leak as long as the bottom ring is screwed on properly.  I loved them because I didn't have to buy replacements and it did the same job!	
- 1	We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.	
- 1	very adorable but did not fit our tub. I am not sure if I was supposed to stretch it our more or if just not the right size for our bathroom.	
1. 	This bottle does have a lot of parts to clean but if you weigh the options of spending about an extra 10 minutes per day cleaning bottle and your baby having less gas, it is worth it. This bottle has 5 parts to clean and others usually have about 3. So if you clean 8 bottles per day and the Dr. Brown's bottles have 2 extra parts, that is like cleaning 16 extra parts per day. Really, it takes maybe 10 seconds per extra part. So, what is an extra 2-3 minutes. Nothing!! Everyone says, yes they are great bottles but there are so many parts to clean. Really, think about it. It doesn't take that much longer to clean! I will stand by these bottles all the way...less gas, less smacking when he eats and a happier baby in the end. And, I have tried every bottle including, Avent, Playtex vent air, MAM and others. Also, get the 8 oz bottles right away. If you spend the money on the smaller bottles because you baby only eats 4 oz now, he/she will be eating more in a few weeks/months and then you will have to buy more bottles. 3oz fits into an 8 oz bottle so why not just get the larger bottles right away.	
1. 	Fantastic! My 7 month old loves to gnaw on his new toothbrush and I am so happy we are beginning these wonderful habits now. He is teething, with teeth coming any day now so this has been a welcomed soother without having to freeze his hands holding a standard water filled tether. I do recommend having a spare as they are easy to loose! :-) Dog grabbed one too... darn it! I also recommend NOT leaving baby along with this to avoid any choking issues. I'm sure the packaging states this as well but important to repeat. This is a great product and is 3-4 bucks more at retail baby stores. I also like that my son is doing the 'brushing' verse me putting a finger brush on and putting my fingers in his mouth. He can bite! LOL... Only improvement? Make the loop bigger to prevent the brush from going into their mouth too much.	
1. 	This is a hit.  Baby loves these.  Whenever we have them out around other kids a little older, the bigger kids want them too.  Great for the tub, playing on the floor, high chair, beach... well, we obviously travel with these.  We know they will always offer consistent entertainment for out little one. The colors were different than shown, but still bright & cheery.	
- 1	Mine did not pass authenticity tests and did not work. We purchased a Hazelaid after this and it works perfectly.	
1. 	so classic and beautiful. I wish I could justify buying every set they  make! Their surface is not slick and paint like, thus they stack so nice for my 1 year old.	
1. 	I LOVE these bibs!  We've used these and two other types and these are far better.  They're the right balance of water repellent and flexible.  I dont like the cheap plastic Gerber ones because as my daughter moves, they're all over the place.  These stay put like a t-shirt.  Also, they're easily washed.  I threw them in the wash and they even accidentally made it through the dryer too... while I wouldnt recommend drying them, they seemed to survive.Our daughter at 10 months though has figured out how to pull on them to unvelcro them from her neck...so I may end up modifying them to use a snap.  But it doest take quite a bit of effort on her part to get them off.	
1. 	In the beginning, my son had a terrible time with gas bubbles in his stomach.  Within a few minutes of eating, he would scream in pain.  He was difficult to burp, so no help there.  We tried the Avent bottles, which only made the situation worse given the odd shape of the nipples.The FIRST time we used a Dr. Brown's bottles we noticed a significant difference.  In a very short time, he was no longer screaming after every meal.  Yes, there are 2 extra pieces to wash, but that's trivial compared to the alternative.	
- 1	What I like:- There is a detachable hood. I wish all non-wrap/sling carriers and covers came with hoods! Hoods provide privacy and quiet in addition to warmth & weather protection.- It is easy to snap the cover on over the carrier straps.- The foot pocket is not large, but it is slightly adjustable and is better than no pocket.What I don't like:- The snaps that attach the cover to your carrier's straps are not secure! Mine may be defective, but one of the cover's snaps won't stay closed with a light tug, and the other is better but still somewhat easy to detach.- The material is incredibly flimsy. Hoodie makes it sound like a nice cozy sweatshirt- it isn't. This is very thin material... You get what you pay for.The faulty snaps make this impossible to use. In the event that mine is defective, I would only recommend this for very mild weather where you either need a hood or a little extra leg protection. The idea is excellent- it's execution that is flawed.	
1. 	We purchased this for our 9 month old daughter and she LOVES this chair.  We've been able to use this in almost every restaurant we've been in. This won't work on thin metal tables or tables with a limited ledge.  The top metal piece that sits on top of the table has a cushion on it so it won't damage tabletops.  I keep this in the car all the time and I can easily store this in the basket of our stroller when we're in NYC or D.C. It's very lightweight and has a great harness (not just a seatbelt) to keep my daughter safe. My daughter enjoys that she can sit next to us during meals instead of watching us from her stroller.	
1. 	These snack containers work well as, well snack containers...but don't think they will keep the snack from spilling or going all over the car.  It takes about 5 minutes for a toddler to figure out how to make them through cereal all over the place. LOL!  I had high hopes the cereal would be contained...but no.	
1. 	The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.	
- 1	This was a gift and so I never thought to look up reviews on it.  She absolutely loves it and it was one of her favorites until I took it away.  She has had her bottom teeth less than a month and today I noticed big scratches in the plastic paint stripes.  I rubbed with my finger and off came a stripe of green plastic chips!  That has been going in her MOUTH!  I am contacting the company and urge all parents to STAY AWAY from this product.	
1. 	Excellent blanket, I used it to change my baby daughter's contact lens, so I if it fell off I would  see it, not the usual use I know, but now that she is older I will start using it for picnics and it is still in great shape.	
- 1	The packaging says not to boil or steam-sterilize. If I'd known that I'd've spent the extra money for the name brand.	
- 1	We were not sure about bumpers so many say no some are ok with them so we went ahead and got this bundle did not like how the bumpers fit loose in certain spots slide down and went under mattress, but the quilt was nice we used it as a play matt on the ground he loved the design and was very comfortable	
- 1	This brush fell apart after only using it for two weeks. The sponge at the very top of the brush completely came off and is now useless to clean the bottom of the bottle. Don't waste your money on this one....it won't last.	
1. 	Though we didn't use this as a rocking chair, we used it as a chair to feed it before our daughter was able to sit comfortably in her highchair. It was very comfortable to feed in and she would get so excited when being put in this rocker because she knew food was soon to come. I love the fact that you can position it in a way that stops it from rocking keeps it in a leaned back sitting position. This is a really great product!	
1. 	Big fans of halo sleepsacks because of the quality and upside down zipper.  So much easier to just change their diaper and zip them back up. OR, in our case, to unzip slightly to check if their socks are still on without making a big fuss over the zipper and waking them up too much. The cotton ones seem to shrink a little bit after the dryer (gentle cycle wash, low heat dry).Follow the length and weight guidelines for size... not age.Preemie: 14 to 19 in, Birth to 5 lbsNewborn: 19 to 23 in, 6 to 12 lbsSmall: 23 to 26 in, 10 to 18 lbsMedium: 26 to 30 in, 16 to 24 lbsLarge: 30 to 35 in, 22 to 28 lbsX Large: 35 to 40 in, 26 to 36 lbs	
1. 	Good price for such a convenience!  Driving down the road with your breast pump attached is one of the biggest joys in life!  :/Thanks for making it possible!No problems with this product.  Works perfectly!	
1. 	What would we have done without this?  When my son was 7-9 months, we'd strap it to him like a pacifer when we went out.  He's never been a paci baby, always a biter.  So good for teething little ones.  By 10-11 months he was over it, but he was onto cutting molars then, and this must not reach back that far.  It was so soothing for him, and it's dishwasherable.	
1. 	This booster is pretty handy to have! My 7-month-old uses it instead of a highchair. The only problem is that the moment I place her in it, she removes the white tray. Not sure why the manufacturer didn't place the fastener elsewhere. I just don't use the white tray or green cover. The blue tray fits securely on and easily washes in the dishwasher, so it's really no big deal. I've seen people bring it to playgroups, restaurants, etc. It fits perfectly on our chairs and I can push her right up to the table and counter without the tray.	
1. 	My 4 year old like it when he sleeps in my parents room, and is great for travelling its similar to what they use to sleep in his day care.  No assembly required, easy to fold.  Toddler bed crib sheets is a perfect fit.	
1. 	Easy to use and install. A little loose/wobbly on my toilet, even with the size adjustments, but not in a way that makes it ineffective...yet.	
1. 	According recommendation for all my friends that have babies... It's the best brand to our babies... I love it so much	
1. 	Very cool--just like the Fisher Price Baby Papasan Cradle Swing, I wish they made a seat like this in my size.  My baby loves the vibrations (when she's in the mood) but she always loves to watch the little fishies and the water moving.  It is portable and convenient to use.  She sits in it while we cook and eat dinner, and she also sits in it when I'm on the treadmill in the morning.  I don't want her to ever grow out of it--it is so awesome!  Definitely recommend.	
- 1	It's too big and he ends up gagging on it. I'm better off with him chewing on his Soothie pacifier. Maybe eventually he will like it but for now he just gets frustrated.	
1. 	My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep.  This is a very small wedge, but I don't think you'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly.  She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed.  When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor, this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring.  She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout.  Sometimes it is under her belly.  Sometimes it is wedged into her back.  Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it.  We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more, so I think I got my money's worth out of this.  I'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA:  Found another use for the pillow.  It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars!  Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard, but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that.	
- 1	Our child would not let us put it on him. So in the end, the product did not serve its intended purpose	
1. 	They've held up really well, and the classic colors match any outfit (we just leave them on since our baby is a drool fool).  I loved these bibs until my baby outgrew them when he hit 16 lbs.  Looking for another, affordable product now, and can't find one.	
- 1	There are two MAJOR reasons to avoid this product.First, installation is a mess.  It's nearly impossible to align the latch with the hook properly.  Too high, and the door won't close to engage the latch.  Too low, and the latch doesn't work, allowing the child to easily open it.Second, a hard yank will allow it to open even if it is installed properly.  For some reason or another, the fast yank seems to cause the latch to fail, with easy access.The only pleasant part about them is that because they have short screws, they're easy to remove and throw away.If these reasons aren't enough to steer away from this latch system, I'm not sure what is.  Horrible installation process, poor safety, poor functionality...  If you aren't ready to tear these out in a couple of days, then you must have gotten a miraculous batch.	
1. 	I had something similar to this sponge 18 years ago.  My old one was a bit longer which was nice.  It doesn't seem to hold water in it as well either.  I do think it is better than the hard plastic bathtubs but it could still use some improvements.	
- 1	I don't like that these are just the covers. i thought i wouldn't mind but it's a pain in the neck.	
1. 	easy for me to put into the outlets, and hard for the baby to remove from the outlet - at least so far at 9 months.	
- 1	We bought one of the starter sets and two fo the 4 packs and have been really disappointed.  We installed the two from the starter set first.  One was broken and wouldn't latch and the other had such a sensitive magnet in it the nails in our cabinet door caused the latch to be permanetly down so it wouldn't lock.  We are not happy with these and will be returning the rest of them.	
1. 	I worked in a nursery for 5 years and used these everyday for babies! They are perfect for everything. Babies that love to sit up but can't yet, this is PERFECT!!!!! I love that it can be used for many different functions and has the add on tray you can purchase.When I became a parent I had to get one for my baby daughter. She is a baby that loves to sit up and know what is going on but is too young to sit up on her own. I put her in this and let her sit on the floor and she is so happy. I put toys in front of her and she loves to play. I am so happy she loves it so much.Please if you purchase one, DO NOT sit these on a table or chair. It makes me terrified when I hear or see a parent do this. This is not a high chair or something that should be placed on high surfaces!!!	
- 1	I have always subscribed to the AAP's recommendation that bare is best when it comes to crb bedding. But when my son started pulling himself up in the crib he was constantly getting his legs and feet stuck through the rails. So I ordered this to keep his limbs safely in the crib. I easily installed it and it really did look sharp and stylish. However I didn't think it looked like it would still allow for air circulation. I used it for 3of my son's naps and every time I got him up from a nap he was sweating and flushed. That let me know that the air wasn't circulating as normal. So I took it off and returned it without any issue. I guess I am just a nervous nelly. I have friends who use these without any problem. It's just not for us.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, I found these pads leaked easily after only one feeding. Maybe I leak more than others as I have had an OALD and oversupply with my first, but now with my second I took pains to avoid it and have not had problems, so I tend to think its the pads, not me.I am editing this to add: I believe these are not absorbant enough due to the material. After researching and experimenting with several cloth diapers, I have discovered that hemp and bamboo are MUCH more absorbant than jersey, cotton or microfiber. If you are looking for nursing pads (or cloth diapers for that matter) that are highly absorbant, look for something made with those fabrics.	
- 1	The handle you have to turn in the top of the gym is hard, and when you finally turned it, it pops strongly.It is also hard to fold (once it's collapsed) I have never being able to fold it like in the picture.I've to say that it looks just like the one in the picture, tho. (color and design wise)Mirror is cheap quality, can't really see anything.I bought it because I needed one I could carry away from home to the grandparents house and it's good for that purpose. But it should definitely be cheaper.It's not too big, so my 7 months old will get off the mat in a second.	
1. 	They do the job and are unobtrusive.	
1. 	I gotta say, I don't know what much there is to say about this product.  I find the SnugRide car seats to be very nice and basic and have been so far happy with mine.  All that was lacking was another base to stick in another car.  I find this easy to install once I got the concept down and really quite secure.  I enjoy being able to use the LATCH system or simply the seatbelt.  It's a light, yet sturdy base that does everything the original car seat base does.  Great product to add to your various Graco systems.	
1. 	I have 3 of these, one at my sister's, one for the car and one for home. The only thing I didn't care for THIS one is that it doesn't have a hole in the back of the seat so you can use it as a handle. My other 2 which I had bought for my first son over 5 years ago has it.  I use these chairs for a long time! It made my older son stay put in restaurants!	
- 1	I wanted to like this so badly.  Even when the lid is closed, if the bottom so much as tips over, as soon as you bring it back to vertical, the content leak out.  Very disappointing.	
1. 	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	
1. 	Best bottles that my wife and I have found for our baby. The vent on the bottom really works.  How do I know?  Because my child never has to burp ever after downing an entire bottle using this system.  With every other bottle we have used she is burping for twenty minutes after a feed.  This means no danger of colic which means a happier child and a more well rested set of parents.	
- 1	I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born. However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher, they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic. No other bottle kept that smell, it permeated my home for days!!! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong, they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back. I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30. It was offensive and disgraceful. Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info. Disgraceful company. Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick. The smell in the air was awful enough!!	
1. 	This is a great all purpose blanket.  It is large enough that all three of us can comforatbly lay on it.  It is also nice that is has the waterproof fabric on both sides so it is very easy to clean.  The folding is super quick with the soft plastic guide so that even my husband can do it neatly.  We use this mat everyday outside and it still looks great.  Perfect for the park, beach, or even at amusement parks to stake out your place.	
1. 	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!	
1. 	We have several receiving blankets for our 10-day-old son, but this is our favorite. It's big and soft and works well for swaddling or just for cuddling. We also love that it's organic. Highly recommended.	
1. 	After purchasing multiple bibs from Walmart and Target, and ordering others online, without a doubt I recommend these bibs. I only wish I found these earlier. I purchased 2 for my twins, blue fizz color and they match the photo. My twins are 15m and these fit great, room to grow and also not so large they could of worn them when they were younger. The sleeves have elastic on the ends so they don't slide up or down. The pocket works well for my kids. The tie in the back as the closure is prefect because my twins know how to take bibs off but the tie is long enough to not be tight on their little necks. It works well as waterproof and after washing there has been no fading in color, rips or fading on waterproofing.	
1. 	My daughter used to refuse the bottle, even with my breastmilk in it. My mother, who has been working in a nursery for 30 years, suggested the problem could be the material the nipple was made of and the slow flow. These nipples work with Medela bottles once screwed and they flow nicely for my 4-month-old daughter. She now takes the bottle when I am not around!	
1. 	These replacement caps do exactly as they say they will do.  We didnt have enough caps to fit the amount of bottles and these were just an addition.	
- 1	This is too bulky for most kids. My son is grabbing at it all the time. It's also very hot in the summer, we don't use it.	
1. 	This pillow was a great sleeping aid for the prego. Its still gets used for a body pillow. Its also great on the couch, lol!	
1. 	I purchased this item as part of a gift packIt is waterproof but it surprised us all by being vert soft and not feeling plasticy. It feels like clothEasy to clean and easy to washFit the graco pack n play with napper elite vance perfectlyOrder processed fast and delivered on timeI recommend this item	
1. 	This bottle warmer works and it works fast!  Only thing people don't realize, is that it takes trial and error.  Bottle sizes are different as well as milk temperature.  It will take longer to heat a bottle from the fridge, rather than one made with room temperature water.  I suggest you use this the first few times BEFORE your baby becomes hungry so you can get to know how it works without getting flustered by a crying baby.  For me, I fill the line to 6 and that heats my 4oz of milk perfectly.  Leave the bottle on for longer after the light goes off and the milk will continue to heat.  So very important you take the bottle off as soon as the light goes off, give it a swirl, test on your wrist (or take a swig like I do) and you'll be good to go!  I've used this with formula and breast milk w/o any issues.	
- 1	When I started feeding my son solids, I purchased a pack of pouch pops to use on our 20 Squooshi pouches. These were the only ones available at the time, so of course I got them. The pouch pops lengthen & soften the hard spout on pouches, but that's pretty much it in my opinion. I still had to squeeze the pouches for my son because he would constantly squeeze too hard too fast, & end up wearing his food!Then came the Sip'n tops... It's like they read my mind! I seriously LOVE these caps. They have a one way valve, so baby can only get food out by sucking... They can squeeze & squeeze & not a single drop will spill out! I no longer have to hold the pouch for my son, he can hold it & feed himself in a matter of minutes! I also love that these have an attached loop & cover for storage... So if baby doesn't finish the contents of his pouch, just pop the cap's cover on and let him finish it a little bit later. I couldn't do this with pouch pops, they don't have any covers for storage. They also don't have the much needed (& appreciated!) one way valve!The Sip'n caps are more expensive per 2 pack, but are worth every penny in my opinion. I'd seriously pay double to be mess free like I have been lately! I bought 10, but still have 6 unopened and have been rotating the original 4 I first purchased.Overall, Sip'n caps win for me! They soften the hard spouts, have covers for storage/travel, and have that amazing mess free valve! If you just want something to soften the spouts, then the pouch pops would work for that!	
- 1	First off, DO NOT use this seat in booster mode. It does not position the seat belt in the correct way and is actually dangerous to use.Aside from that, this seat is notorious in child safety circles for being very difficult to install securely, and even more difficult to get the correct incline level.It will be a struggle every time you need to move it, and even then you may not get it quite in the right spot.There are many, many different seats out there at this price point that are much easier to use correctly.I am giving it two stars only because *if* you can get it installed correctly, it will contain your child in an accident as long as you are in harnessed mode. Of course, that should be true of any seat, and almost all will be easier to install correctly than this beast!	
1. 	this is a great product for baby bath time.  we were using 7th generation foaming cleanser, but it would dry out our daughter's skin and her hair would be oily looking within a day.  with this, her skin is soft and doesn't dry out and her hair is soft for days.  plus she smells so clean without being too &#34;perfumey&#34;	
- 1	I bought this when I found out that my daughter would be very small when born.  Then I learned that you are not supposed to use any aftermarket products with any carseat.  Do your research!	
- 1	Love Boon products but this one missed the mark. My toddler was never able to use it for snacks. Opening is too small and slightly rough. We use it as a bath toy instead.	
- 1	Very dissatisfied with this monitor. When it works, the picture, zoom, and sound are fine - both in night vision and daytime - and it's a relief for new parents like us to be able to see our sleeping baby. HOWEVER, the system itself is of very poor quality. We have been through two of these monitors now. The first one just stopped working in the middle of the night. The second no longer holds a charge, even though the battery indicator says it's full.  When plugged in, the charging indicator light sometimes says its charging, sometimes not. The monitor often blinks randomly over to &#34;out of range&#34; and beeps before eventually coming back. Using the antenna seems to make no difference for reception or range. We never use the VOX option because we can't be sure whether the baby is quiet or the monitor has stopped working again. Having such an unreliable monitor eliminates much of the peace of mind a monitor is supposed to provide. Buy another model until Samsung works out their quality issues.	
1. 	All I do is fold two dozen baby washcloths in half and pour in water. That's it!! You can use it for disposable wipes, too. Just use the spongy thing and make sure they stay damp.	
- 1	My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it.	
- 1	i had got this product excitedly ordering from here but when we started using the color shade started peeling off and my son..use to chew on that .it was unacceptable n we somehow cudnt return the product.neways i wiidnt suggest anybody to buy this product which claims ORGANIC but cannot deal with basic problems.	
1. 	This changing pad is very soft. My baby boy has tinkled on it and it just beads up because of the kind of material, makes for easy clean up.	
1. 	One disclaimer--if you're used to sleeping with a feather pillow and down comforter, and you don't buy a different cover for your Snoogle, you're going to overheat in short order.  It's stuffed with polyester, which is fine--it holds its shape well and supports you--but by itself with this cover, it becomes waaay too hot.  That said, I love the shape and the support the pillow gives.  I've only had it for 2 nights, and the first night (without a separately purchased jersey cover) was hot, but with the new cover, I can already tell I'm waking up and flopping around the bed less.The also-pregnant friend who recommended the Snoogle to me said her dad got one and likes it for his back trouble, too.  I may have to recommend it to all the poor sleepers in my life.So, Snoogle with original cover:  4 stars.Snoogle with jersey cover:  5 stars.	
1. 	So my baby was very frustrated when she was in that awkward &#34;I don't want to lay down but I don't have the physical capacity to sit up yet&#34; phase. It's the phase I hit after 4 glasses of wine. She hit it at 3 months. I brought this with us everywhere we traveled, my dad found it hilarious, called it a baby container. This nest propped her up and gave me a break, she loved sitting in it I would haul it into the bathroom and I could take a shower. A shower! Thank you Galt, my husband thanks you as well. I was getting pretty desperate. And stinky.  Once she got the knack of sitting up and crawling I stopped relying on it so heavily. But, still a nice spot for her to relax when she first wakes up, she's 9 months now and she likes to look at the animals and recline in it. It looks so cozy, I want one in my size. It's bright, colorful, very high quality fabric. This is a very well made and amazing product, those Germans, they know how to make nice things.	
- 1	I purchased this kit my boyfriend applied it, he is very artistic and good with hands. It looked like total crap. I threw it out but I have the pictures from making it. Worth more than the cast. Total Mess of the house	
1. 	The corner pockets were perfect for nursing pads or pacifiers. The print looked just like the picture and I got a ton of use out of this product.A little overpriced and does not wash well around the boning.	
1. 	The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google Door Guardian installation instructions, find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8 inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16 inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16 inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.	
- 1	I got my ergo when my daughter was over a year so I didn't know how to use it with my newborn son. I got this and can't say it did any good. I could never get a natural, comfortable hold. I used my moby for the newborn days.	
1. 	Our oldest is 3, and this diaper pail has been doing its job, right next to my bed that entire time (now containing the stinky diapers from our younger son for the past 19 months).In light of the 600 other reviews for this product, I'll boil it down to these four points:(1) It really does contain smell, despite its simplicity. I have a very sensitive nose, and the only time I catch the odor from within is if I purposely hold the two flap doors open and take a whiff, or when I'm changing the bag and compacting the full one with my knee to squeeze all the air out (definitely an outside task -- stinky!).(2) Price the bags before hand, because as others have pointed out, they're the real expense over time.(3) Our secondary flapper door was hanging open the past few weeks, probably the result of a loose spring affected by corrosion (the air stays moist inside this pail). I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.  Problem solved.(4) It's pretty durable. Our oldest regularly climbs and sits on this -- says it's his rocket. He hasn't managed to break anything, despite it being very conventional construction (i.e. lightweight, not overbuilt, though I hesitate to call it flimsy).	
- 1	I am a mom of two and have owned several baby swings. My kids needed the swings to get them to sleep when they were infants - if you have a bad back and can't rock your child, then a swing is what you need! If you are looking for portability then this is a great swing, but keep in mind that NO travel swing will be as powerful as a full-size model. We have the full size Fisher Price papasan and the ocean wonders swings, and they were amazing and plenty powerful - colicky babies prefer vigorous swinging to soft rocking. Yes, they eat through batteries, but who cares when your child will sleep 4 hours in the swing as opposed to 1 hour in the crib! But I digress...As for this travel swing:Pros:Much more portable than a full size swingMore portable than the fisher price travel swing (I had the ocean wonders model)Folds pretty flat for travelNo noise at all (the full-size models always click when swinging)Decent battery life for a swingEasy to assembleHas a recline optionDecent music if you want itTimer if you want it, or just leave the swing on constantlyCute to look at for you and babyEasy to cleanCons:Speed settings are really all 1 speed - why bother with a speed dial? This seems to be typical of all swings though, both travel and full-sized.Will never move as vigorously as a full-sized swing - top speed is barely moving in comparison to a full-sized swing. If your child is used to a full-sized swing, this swing might not move vigorously enough to rock him/her to sleep. However, if they are not used to a full-sized model than this one might be fine.A tip for all swings: Use good batteries (Duracell only) to get the most vigorous swinging out of your swing. The cheap ones, even Energizers, will barely move your swing!Update: 1 BIG CON for this swing that I discovered last night - it automatically shuts off after 1 hour, even without using the timer feature. I wanted it to run continuously like the full-size swing would, but it won't. Why include a timer for 15 minute increments if the swing shuts off in 1 hour anyway? My babies wake up when the swing stops, which is exactly what happened. Argh! This makes the swing fairly useless to me if I want my baby to sleep in the swing during the night, because she will wake every hour when the swing automatically shuts off!	
- 1	My 10 month old soaks through every diaper.  Thought I would try thick cloth diapers, but to no avail.  Must have some sort of vinyl cover to go over.  I can't stand the vinyl covers since they don't breathe.  That is just a perfect environment for a rash.	
1. 	I got tons of bibs at my shower... they are cute ones but do not work for my newborns who are bottle feeding... maybe better for eating solids when they are older. These bibs are perfect for babies who are bottle feeding catches the milk dripples. Argee with what pervious person said too $$$ on amazon $6.99 for same thing at Target.	
1. 	I am so glad I registered for the Baby Bjorn carrier.  It is so simple to use and my baby always falls asleep in it (she's 6 weeks old).  When I first put her in it at about 2 weeks old, she didn't like it.  But I tried it again with her at about 3 weeks and she loves it.  (So if you have a baby who fusses at it, avoid it for a few days and try it again for brief periods to get the baby used to it.)  I like to go shopping with her in it so that my hands are free.  You won't be disappointed.	
1. 	I bought a starter pack of these bottles due to the fact my daughter spit up alot of other bottles we tried. We now use these, and she can actually sleep after taking her bottle. I know they take longer to clean, but it is worth it if you have a happier baby!	
- 1	My son is to big for it, wish it came in different sizes to much of a hassle to return it since I'm half way across the world	
1. 	Who really needs a crib any bigger than this???  It is perfect for smaller rooms.  No need to buy a mattress either.  Comes with a cheapy one but it's pretty firm.  We got a good mattress and regretted it as none of the sheets fit on it.  The sheet sets only fits the cheapy mattress that comes with the bed.	
1. 	Can take out the sound machine and use as a soft toy as well. Baby enjoys this, but doesn't fall asleep. It seemed to help him sleep longer when he was a newborn, but since around 5 months he didn't react to it. He still loves to play with the sheep and snuggle with it.  Definitely would recommend a crib soother once your baby stops reacting with this.	
- 1	Since I had already made the commitment to make homemade baby food for my little one, I figured why stop there. I began searching for what I thought would be the best reusable Baby Food Pouch, and came across these from Go Fresh Baby. I really liked how the zipper was on the side instead of the bottom and how the feeding tube was on the top instead if the side. I was so excited and placed my order fairly quickly. I really appreciated how the product came with easy to follow, step by step instructions. I followed the instructions so that I could wash the pouches for use this upcoming week. The zipper was extremely hard to open. In fact, on one of the pouches the zipper separated from the pouch. Now there is an opening to the pouch and the zipper remains sealed. This was disappointing because I haven't had this product very long at all. I'm hoping I'll be able to get this sorted out.	
- 1	It's a good sippy cup, but you really have to bite down on the straw good to get any liquid out.But, at the same rate, that's it's job, so I guess it isn't all bad.	
1. 	These are great to use with your Medela Symphony pump. I ordered an extra set so I didn't have to sterilize my other set immediately after each use.  Was nice to have a backup.  Just like the ones off the Medela website.	
- 1	So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.	
1. 	Both my babies love activity play mats and this one offers a lot to play with, especially since you can hang other toys on the extra rings. But this one is exceptionally expensive, especially if you're a frugal mom. There are some nice models for half the price.The one does have a 20 minute music timer to help keep your babe entertained which is a very nice feature. The mirror is also great for tummy time.If you're looking for a complete list of things to add to your registry, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com. In the baby gear essentials category you'll find a stroller shopping guide, crib buying guide, and a comprehensive article about what you need versus what you don't need (especially if you're a minimalist). There's also articles on what to expect at the hospital and during recovery and how to get the most sleep postpartum.	
1. 	I have to agree with many of the reviews here...these outlet plugs manage to keep babies and adults from accessing outlets pretty effectively, but that was why I bought them.  It seems there are two types of outlet plugs available at this point: those that babies can figure out in very little time (and are easy for parents to remove too) and those that keep babies out (yet give parents trouble as well.)I have lupus and even in the middle of a flare, when my hands are very weak and stiff, I can still get these plugs out even though it requires a good deal of effort.  They do give me confidence though that my baby is safe--now he's only 8 months, but is very active and I'm sure would figure out other plugs in no time.  So far, he has seen these, touched them, and lost interest pretty quickly.  I do have to say, though, that I have access to some outlets placed higher on the wall that I use for vacuuming, kitchen appliances, etc. and have tried to minimize the need to take these plugs in and out of high-use outlets.	
- 1	First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the monkey is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the monkey.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.Third, the monkey is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the monkey doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the monkey into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place.	
- 1	This wipe solution has good essential oils and smells nice, but it is way too expensive!  You might as well use disposable wipes, because you won't save any money with cloth wipes if you use a solution like this every time.  After I went through a bottle of this, I decided to save money by mixing my own solutions.  There are a lot of recipes out there or you can make your own, save a lot of $$, and fill your child's individual needs.  I personally just use a tablespoon of baby wash and a tablespoon of coconut oil mixed with 2 cups of hot water.  This makes enough wipes to last three or more days, and it costs barely anything.  The coconut oil helps heal or prevent any rashes while the wash cleanses.  The wipe solution won't do either.	
1. 	So easy to use and not as much clean-up afterward. Just pop liner in the bottle, add water and powdered formula, shake and you are good to go.	
1. 	Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents.I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic!	
1. 	We have a boy and its missing a higher lip upfront for sure. That is the one thing this design is lacking but if you have a girl this should be prefect.I like our BJorn seat a big better bc of coverage up front.	
1. 	I use this to keep the toilet locked from my toddler daughter. It's a good product and does the job. It's also easy to install. She can still lift the toilet seat even with it on about 1/2 an inch, but it still prevents from anything or her hands from going into the toilet.	
1. 	My 13-month-old daughter loves to rip bibs secured with velcro right off.  These, will certainly stay on and they are easy to wash.  However, it's not super easy to fit wiggling arms through the arms (which are a bit long on my daughter who is in the 50th percentile for height and 10th for weight).  Overall, we like these when we really want to make sure her outfit will stay neat and clean.  Otherwise, it's not really worth the effort.	
- 1	The cover is too tight and it is difficult to put it on when the tray is filled. It is also not air tight so I have ditched the cover and use cling film. The trays are good and the shape of the pocket makes removing frozen food easy. Wished it came with two trays instead.	
- 1	this product it is ok, but from 6 months and up.cover until my newborn neck.material and quality are ok.	
1. 	Bed came well packaged (box is heavy).  Espresso color is beautiful, bed is made of quality durable products. There were a few &#34;nicks&#34; on a couple of the pieces the mattress rests on, but since they will be covered, I didn't mind.  Easy enough for one adult and a very helpful two year old to assemble in a half hour or so (although a second set of hands would have made it even faster/easier).  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFEs very durable!  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFECT.	
1. 	My baby is 11 lb plus at 3 weeks and 24 inches long. He likes to sleep with his legs bent or he just sticks them over the end. I think we will get another month out of it.He loves this bed and I love that I can sleep so close to him. Its safe and great for both of us. Its tight in a bed with my husband but we do it anyway :)I understand all of the negatives that other people wrote, but what do you expect for $40!? Well worth the price to our family!	
1. 	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!!!! The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags...ANY Garbage bags will fit. The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend...This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers....FANTASTIC!	
- 1	The pattern is not worth the price difference. You can get a plain organic cotton cover for the same money & be much better off. I bought a few Summer Infant patterned covers like this one along with a solid organic terry cotton one (also Summer Infant) and now I wish I had gotten all of them in organic cotton.The material on these feels very plastickey to me, almost like they would not absorb water. I don't like touching it let alone have my baby's head rest on it. The pattern is very cute but I use a pad liner which covers most of the surface so I don't get to see pattern too often.LOVE the 100% solid color, organic cotton version of these though.On the plus side, they fit the pad very well and I like that they have slits on the side for the safety buckles to come through though I am not using the buckle yet, I guess I will when baby is older.	
1. 	I got the snoogle when i was 4 months pregnant. I'm now 8 months pregnant and it has served me well for 4 months! I LOVE this pillow. It serves so many functions. I use it every single night to prop me up as I read in bed (you just fold it into a little ball or nest as they call it), and when I sleep, I lay on my left side with the snoogle under my large belly supporting it all through the night. I honestly don't move until I have to get up and go use the bathroom. Then I come back and get comfortable in a different position (facing the snoogle hugging it). It's so versatile and if I get sore hips, I just roll over onto the snoogle under my back and it takes pressure off my hips.I should also mention that since the age of 13, I've had a herniated disc in my lower back. Well, thanks to this pillow, I haven't had any problems with my lower back at ALL in this pregnancy. If you want to sleep through the night comfortably, I would recommend this pillow.The only negative thing I could think of to say is that sometimes it's difficult if I decide I want to roll over onto my other side. You have to shift and finagle your way around the snoogle. But other than that, it's been fantastic. I fully plan on taking the snoogle with me to the hospital!	
1. 	Sound machine AND adorable stuffed animal in one? Win-win. I love that the sound machine is removable for travel, because the sheep is pretty big. I don't use it all the time, and didn't even get it until my daughter was 3 and 1/2 months old, but it helps when she's worked up and fussy around bedtime (overstimulated would probably be the technical term). I imagine it would have helped her fall back asleep after eating in the middle of the night back when she was still doing that. I like giving baby gifts that are cute and practical, and this definitely fits the bill.	
- 1	I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs.  It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle. This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby.  It also didn't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about.  I'm 5'4 and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and didn't hold still.	
1. 	baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome. especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty. Ziplock is useful but not reuseable. It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots. This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.	
- 1	Bought this because it looked like it would be a good teething toy; well, never got to use it. It smelled so heavily of plastic that we washed it, aired it out for a month and the smell still wouldn't go away. It's been about 4 months and the smell is still there. Our kid won't even touch it.	
- 1	Cheaply made mats, I ordered a set for my SUV and my compact car. One ripped right away, and they don't fit like the picture, they are always curling off at the edges. I will probably throw these away and buy some cloth kick mats.	
1. 	They are not white like the picture. They are pink with pink fabric.  They are slightly cheap looking but they are still very cute in the nursery and I am glad I got them.  I use one for toys, one for diapers and the other one is on display on the top shelf.	
- 1	This does not absorb odors at all. I was not expecting it to add fragrance - just neutralize . Disappointed.	
- 1	My daughter will not go anywhere near this teether - it's WAY too big for her mouth...if you compare the size of it to a normal pacifier, it's HUGE...I didn't think to do that as I was purchasing it.  She's intrigued by the colors of it, but all she does is hold it in her hand and then eventually she throws it - it's not worth paying for this.	
- 1	It doesn't fit how you would expect it to. The bottoms a Velcro strap that wraps around near the wheel but the top doesn't wrap around anything. You have to fold the canopy to secure it and that's not even secure at all. Maybe I'm putting it on wrong?	
- 1	Good concept but as others say the actual food cup is small.  It only fits a baby carrot.	
1. 	I bought this sheep out of desperation when my girl was a newborn. She ignored it completely. Now that she is 8 months old, I tried it again, and it is amazing. The noises captivate her as I am petting her and trying to get her to sleep. She concentrates on it instead of on freaking out (she really just does not want to sleep, ever). It helps me get her to sleep. One of the weird things is the timing on this.. instead of a half hour and a full hour, it gives 25 minutes and 43.. it seems like it is just random. I like that it turns off so that we can save batteries, but I almost wish that there was an option not to. In the afternoon, once the sound goes, she wakes up.It has a great velcro feature in the back, so we can secure it safely to a crib or bassinet, for newborns.A great thing, this sheep.Heck, it puts ME to sleep while I'm holding her. An adult with insomnia might even consider owning it.2 YEAR OLD UPDATEMy daughter is STILL using this sheep. I have put it through the wash (though it says not to, sometimes you just have to), and she listens to it -every night-. She can't go to sleep without it. The only thing that has changed is that it runs through batteries a little faster than it used to, but it is still going strong.	
1. 	My daughter's bed had sharp edges and she once bumped her head pretty bad and didnt want to sleep in her bed anymore. So I brought this to resolve that issue and prevent further damage-- works well.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and never used it (minus one time). This is something that is not needed. I had it in my baby registry since I read such good reviews here. My bad! I sold it on craigslist right after the first time I used it. Please don't waste your money here, go buy something useful for yourself or your baby. Good luck with nursing!PS: I didnt have the fireworks, I had one with polka dots cover.	
1. 	The Diaper Dekor is excellent and does the job well.  My newborn's diapers easily drop into the Dekor with just a step of the pedal.  Once the Dekor is full, the bag is easily removed and cut to just the right length which means no bag is wasted.  The bag has a nice scent which isn't overpowering.  The bags have proven to be durable and strong to support the weight of the diapers.  My nursery has been smell free from diaper odor because of the Dekor Plus Diaper System.  My only complaint would be that I wish it was bigger (it's smaller than a standard trash can).	
- 1	I have had this pillow for only a few months now. I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester, and now I'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester.  Within that time, the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out, making my legs too close together.  I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips don't hurt when I sleep.  Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying, if you haven't experienced it already, you just might if you are using this pillow.  In addition to this, the head part of the pillow is too flat.  I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts.  Overall I do not recommend this product.  I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows, and this one was the cheapest with the best review.  Don't fall for the same trap I did!!! Shell out the extra bucks and get a better quality, better stuffed pillow.... you'll be happier sleeping if you do.	
1. 	You absolutely cannot wear these out in public!  This is for home use only!  They do not match the contour of the breast at all so there's a totally weird bulge on your boob when you wear them.  So with that being said, if you do just wear these at home, they can be great!  If you have really raw nipples they offer a much needed relief and the ability to get air.  I use them at night so that they catch anything that I leak, and I can then just pour the milk into the baby's mouth via a little spout on the edge.  I find that I go the longest without nursing through the night, so this offers a great way to never waste a drop!	
1. 	This stroller is great for parents with two or more kids. We have a couple other strollers but ended up buying this one when we had an infant and a 2.5 year old. We were about to take a trip to Disneyland and thought it would be worth it.The stroller fits one child in the front and the front seat has three reclining positions. When the seat is all the way up in the sitting position, then another child can sit or stand in the back. If the front seat is reclined to the middle position or laid flat (it doesn't go completely flat, but goes down far enough for a child to sleep), then the back cannot be used.The stroller comes with an extra piece so you can attach various models of car seats. We were past that age with our infant, but we kept the part in case we have another.Also, not shown in the photo, the stroller comes with a fabric band that wraps around the top to hold drinks and other items. I thought I had to buy this separately and did so, but ended up returning the separate accessory because it already came with the stroller.The stroller can be heavier than regular strollers (it weighs around 20 pounds) so when pushing our 20 lb infant and 40 lb 2.5 year old, it can be quite a workout. It's not as maneuverable as I'd like it to be either. Also, the rear brakes aren't as reliable as I'd like them to be. You really need to make sure you press down hard.Setup was really easy. I was able to set it up myself in about 25 minutes. Probably would've been faster if my 2.5 YO wasn't trying to help me so much.It was really nice having this in Disneyland. Our infant could sleep in the park and when our preschooler got tired, we could let him take a ride. He is in an age where he constantly wants to run away from us, so it was great to park him in the back when we needed to walk for a long time.	
- 1	We bought this to use as a trash can in our babies' room when they were a year old and starting to get into everything.  I figured if it is marketed as a diaper pail it must be able to handle simply trash!  I was wrong.  The pail is so light and flimsy that it flips over as soon as you hit the pedal with your foot.  Nor does it close tightly.  My kids were into it immediately, and we put this trash can in the trash a few days later.	
1. 	I didn't even know this existed for my first baby and thankfully i received this as a gift for my second baby. wish i had it sooner!  we're in nyc frequently and it's great to be able to strap this on with my baby and still have 2 hands free for my toddler.  i think this is much more comfortable for my baby than keeping her in the stroller with the cover.  it is definitely wind resistant and light rain resistant.  not for heavy rain.  keeps her very warm and comfy.	
1. 	I received a smaller portion of these at my baby shower and waited way too long to use them.  I figured I would save them for special occasions such as travelling or something, only because I would never normally spend money on a bag just to throw it away.  Well, I have recently decided to change my ways by not hanging onto something waiting to use it for a special occasion that never happens.  Now, my husband and I drop every deadly poopy diaper into one of these handy dandy little bags, tie it up, and throw it in the garbage bin.  It saves time and trips from having to empty the garbage so often by eliminating the explosion of rotting poopy diapers when you open an air tight garbage bin.  This is a smell-saver must have.	
1. 	I was recently invited to a few bridal showers and I needed something to put the gifts in and baskets work good because they are easily reusable!	
1. 	We have the Graco Clarion Pack N Play and this sheet fits perfectly.  Can't understand why there are so many negative reviews about the fit and wear of this sheet. It fits our model perfectly and has withstood many washings well.  It is thin, but we haven't found that to be a problem.	
- 1	It is so big my baby is lost in it....It is an adult sized towel to wrap around my neck....I would not recommend it....	
- 1	Let me start by saying that EVERY bottle I read about through reviews on Amazon had complaints of leaking. I was so torn in choosing between classic glass bottles, Playtex Vent-Air or Drop-ins, Avent, or MAM. I've now proven to myself that this is most likely related to operator error and how awake you are when the leak happens.That said, I'm not as happy with these bottles as I wanted to be. I found the Avent bottles work better for my circumstance. Before baby's arrival, and after lots of reading reviews here on Amazon, I was sold on MAM for their nipple shape, especially as I was planning on long term breastfeeding but would have to send baby to daycare. I liked that you could take it all apart for better and easy cleaning too, but it turns out it's not so easy. The 'self-sanitizing' feature was another good idea on their part, doesn't work for me though, because the inside of my microwave is too short for the 9oz bottles. Another selling factor that got me was their cuteness. Shame on me.I regret buying the MAM bottles after I learned how easy the Avent bottles are. The MAM bottles work as intended, but are unnecessarily troublesome. When it came time to send my baby to day care for my return to work, I discovered just how frustrating the MAM bottles are. First of all, you have to make sure the bottom is screwed on **REALLY** tight, otherwise the water used to heat will mix with the contents of the bottle. This turns into such a pain - literally - when it comes time to take the bottle apart for washing. This extra thick, screw-on bottom makes warming the contents extra long compared to other bottles, such as Avent. Once you finally do get the milk warmed and take the MAM bottle out of the hot water, you have to be very careful not to burn yourself or your baby with the steaming water that collected in that screw-on bottom through the vent holes. Banging it out doesn't get all of it and makes too much noise for all those night time feedings or anytime for that matter. Using a wash or burp cloth to protect yourself and baby is yet another added hassle and one more thing to maneuver while trying to feed the baby.None of these issues exist with the Avent bottles. An extra ring is nothing compared to the base parts of the MAM bottles. Popping the lid on and off the Avent bottles is also another easy thing compared to MAM. When you're juggling a crying baby and a bottle at once, it's not convenient to have to use a counter-top edge to pop off a bottle's lid, but it's something I've had to resort to, unfortunately. Avent's lids are secure enough and prevent leaking without requiring a 2-hand operation.As an added bonus, Avent has a conversion kit that allows me to pump using my Ameda Purely Yours electric breast pump directly into any Avent bottle.	
- 1	This giraffe is very cute, and I'm sure my daughter would have loved it. But as soon as I received the item (purchased from Dainty Baby) I followed the directions to wash the item with soapy water and a washcloth, and the paint started rubbing off (and I've since read about the same thing happening in other reviews). Whether it's safe (food dye?) paint or not, I'm not comfortable my baby ingesting anything from a toy.	
1. 	My son used to scream at the top of his lungs whenever we had to change him.  Holding the wipes in my hand for a minute or two to warm them up didn't seem to help.  Someone suggested that I get a wipe warmer.  Boy am I glad I did.  Now, he is more content and even laughs and smiles while being changed.  I love the warmth of the wipes so I know he does too!  Even though it's the travel version, we use it in the nursery and refill it as needed.  If I want to take it with me, I can just unplug it and go.  I highly recommend.	
- 1	Great product!!! Its small, doesn't make too much noise, it looks good in the countertop, and my daughter loves all the food that comes out of it. Making your own baby food can't be any easier.UPDATE - 6 MONTHS LATER:Don't love it AT ALL! It had sooooo much potential! while it worked! At first, the power cord started to fail... electricity would not reach the baby chef at all times. I live in south america, so returning it was not a very easy option. I had an electrician look at the cord and he said it was a simple contact fix, and he fixed it. It worked perfectly for 5 months like that and I loved it. I really did. Then last week the blender stopped working. Electricity was reaching the unit ok, but it just wouldn't move. I sent it to get fixed again, and now the say there is no fixing. The internal unit is dead... whatever that means... all I know is that I now have to go buy something else, and it won't be Babby Chef.Too bad, I really liked it while it worked...but its too much money for something working for so little time.	
- 1	The only problem is that if your toddler pushes on the door when it is in place in the door jam then it will pull the screws out of the door where the hinge is!	
1. 	4 Stars because they did their job but the little one just got tried of them and wouldn't wear them any longer. Nothing wrong with the bibs themselves, just with the little girl that wouldn't keep them on. I would recommend them because while she had the bibs on they did their purpose of keeping the top half of her clothing clean.	
1. 	We love love love this pop up toy storage thingie! not only is it adorable but it does exactly what its supposed to do. my only issue is that the top doesn't unzip all the way around. it only unzips half way. but that's probably a good thing since a child will be using it mostly. for an adult, its a little frustrating that i can't see all the way in there, but then i remembered its not for me, its for her. Definitely worth every penny spent!	
1. 	I love this blanket, can throw in the washer and hang to dry.  Folding it up is easy and the strap is super convenient.  Tons of moms I know have these, that's the only potential drawback - they're so popular you might have the same one as someone else and have trouble telling them apart!  Definitely recommend!	
1. 	I love this bib!  I am nursing my baby but he's a spitter-upper and this has saved me from many outfit changes.  The best part is the sizing.  All of the other bibs out there are made for toddlers but this one actually fits snugly on a baby ( he's 8 weeks).  The fabric is soft too and doesn't irritate his skin.	
- 1	These do keep cloth wipes warm and moist but the night light on this is obnoxiously bright. Like another user said, we have to cover it up with a prefold diaper. I have only had this for about a week and the washcloths that came with it are already fraying. I also noticed the wipes smell kind of like mildew around the 24 hour mark (the smell when you leave clothes in the washer too long). I use a combination of kissaluvs lotion potion and water and replace it daily. The lid also opens really hard and I usually have to use two hands to pry the darn thing open. Since there are no other options for cloth wipes I think I am going to keep it, but I am not thrilled by it by any means.	
1. 	I used the snoogle with my first pregnancy two years ago and I'm using it again with this pregnancy. I wanted to get a new cover since my old one was pretty haggard. I like the pretty pink color of this. Some reviewers have complained that the pillow is hard to get in and out of the cover. While I can't disagree with that, I'll say it just takes practice. You get used to it. If it bothers you that much, get the zipper cover, though that costs more money and I could see the zipper being kind of uncomfortable to sleep with.I like the cover and I'm happy with it.	
- 1	I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review. Let me start by saying my son is only 3 1/2 months old, but is teething. I found this very difficult for him to hold because of its size, and the only parts that really fit in his mouth were the ears and legs.  Any Mom with a teether knows how they jam the toy in their mouth. He tends to do that with the head portion, which is to big for him and he just gets frustrated and cries.  I do think the texture is good, very soft and very squishy. I will continue to give this to him as he grows, perhaps he'll be able to hold it better as he gets older. Unfortunately for now, I have to give it 2 stars for the stage I'm in.	
1. 	The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the drain plug that is difficult to set in place. Once it's on everything works good, my boy likes it and I'd buy it again.	
1. 	We have four of these for our son.  He likes them and so do we.  They hardly ever leak and they are easy to hold for little hands. They stand up to the dishwasher well too.	
1. 	Although my spindle didn't hold up, I was able to use this against my larger bottom pole. I have small white spindles like in the picture and once installed I could tell the spindle was bowed and would slowly give over time. Instead I extended to the central pillar which is very sturdy. I love that I can keep the bottom of my stairs safe for now without having to put holes anywhere.	
1. 	I bought this booster seat thinking I was still going to want a real highchair for my 18 month old. I starting using it while I shopped around for something better. Guess what? I never found anything better! I bought and returned several conventional highchairs from local stores. They were either too big, the tray was ridiculously huge, tray didn't snug up close enough (cannot overstate how important that is), etc. This booster seat is amazingly perfect.	
1. 	We love this seat, It is compact enough to take to restaurants or anywhere you may need it. Our daughter just loves sitting in it. The tray is really nice and the cover is a great option. I would definately reccommend this seat.	
- 1	I bought this when I decided to start potty training my daughter who loves Dora.  I ended up just making my own.  There wasn't a lot of space for stickers.  The card was filled up really quickly.  This costs almost $7.  For less than $5, I made my own that lasted a lot longer than a few days.	
1. 	These are great! My baby girl has loved these since she was just a few weeks old (she's almost 6 months now & still loves them.) At first, I'd place them on the sides of the car seat handle, so they'd catch her peripheral vision. It's been fun seeing her develop & her enjoyment of these little bugs just keeps developing, too. First she just watched them, then she batted at them, now she grabs & pulls & of course, tries to eat them. Only problem is that the jitter toy (the firefly) broke a long time ago, before she even got to the point where she could pull it & enjoy it. Still, she doesn't know she's missing anything.	
- 1	poor rating because my baby sucked half air half milki liked it because i thought it was going to come in handyi would probably not recommend it	
1. 	When we first tried to bathe our infant in the &#34;big girl tub,&#34; she was terrified and cried so hard! A friend suggested we try the boon flo water deflector, and ever since she has loved them! It slows the flow of water and even helps it not sound so loud. Our tub only has 1 water control, so in order for it to be warm water it has to be a higher flow. With this handy little device she now loves playing in the water as it falls out. Totally worth the money spent!	
- 1	I purchased this on Amazon and it broke with the first use. The center piece that combines the red part broke and ended up in the shape of a circle rather than a figure 8. My child had little or no interest in this toy.	
- 1	We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great...for 24 hours.  Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying.  To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted.  My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static.  Don't waste your money - buy another one.	
- 1	Odd, this product seems to be high quality except for the motor! It plays nice music (and I'm easily annoyed), deep, and well padded. There isn't much of a low setting for the swinging. When I first put my little one in at 9lbs she seemed to hate it...it swung too hard. But I tried it out of desperation one night because I needed to eat (she was slightly colicky)...and she went right to sleep. So from then on, while mommy ate, it was her dinner nap spot. After about two months of use, it started to squeek (annoying). Then shortly thereafter, it just stopped swinging. She is only about 13lbs and 3 months so it wasn't because of weight and we didn't use all that much. After I looked through these reviews I saw many bad issues with the Snuggabunny, even one with a electrical fire!!! I would buy something more reliable. Sad, I thought Fisher-Price was a decent company.	
1. 	My son drools A LOT. He was getting really bad rashes under his jaw and on his chest from all the wetness. These bibs have solved the problem plus the colors are great without stupid commentary on them and they aren't bulky. Just remember to fasten the velcro before throwing them in the wash.	
1. 	Such a clever little thing to have for those little teethers! They are a bit hard to clean but I guess that's because the mesh is so fine to avoid chunks breaking through!	
- 1	It was very cute when I received it in the mail. After the first wash it was totally deformed and didn't look the same. I don't recommend this item at all.	
- 1	While my NB was in the middle of a bottle he began to shout out a cry cuz he had a lot of air from the bottle, the burp that came out of him was horrible and scared me from EVER using these bottles again. I could even hear him swallowing air at some points.	
- 1	I hate this pillow.  It takes up way to much space on the bed.  I am too tall to use it between my legs.  I did not find it comfortable during my pregnancy.	
1. 	Great bed! Transitioned my 2yr old daughter to this bed after her crib and we LOVE it! She does too! She was so excited to have her first real bed and wanted to go to bed right away when she saw it! It is rich in color, very well done and sturdy. I sit on it (150lbs) often and I have layed down with her a few times with no problems! She sometimes walks on the bars supporting the bed underneath when we remove the mattress for linen changes (she is 38lbs) and they hold her.  The standard crib mattress fits snugly right into this frame with no problem. We actually purchased a memory foam padding (twin size) and cut it to fit her crib mattress and encased in a mattress covering. Crib mattresses are so hard and we really wanted her to have comfort now that she is old enough to not have a hard mattress. All this fits great in this bed. The bars are great keeping her from rolling out of bed. I usually find her backed up against them while sleeping so glad they are there.  My only gripe is that we had the davinci crib which was supposed to convert to a toddler bed but did not work out so we had to buy this product. Anyway...glad we did because it is perfect for her. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed!	
1. 	The product is semi-clear so it looks nice. I like that they are super simple, and not &#34;adult-proof&#34; as well as child-proof.	
- 1	Would not purchase these again.  They had a loud buzz that came out of nowhere. We often ran into the room to find that there was nothing that trigger the sound.	
- 1	Returned the large because it was ridiculously over sized. The medium really isn't much better. I am not sure what the point of this product is. By the time they are big enough to use it, they are old enough to keep their covers on. Oh well, the quality is great, but the sizing is way off.	
1. 	This is my fourth mini crib from this company they work amazingly in my small daycare space for my infants! Would purchase again without hesitation.	
- 1	These bottles completely did not work for us.  My son ended up sucking just on the tip of the bottle, giving him an even more shallow latch!  Even if you look at the baby in the picture amazon uses, he is just sucking on the very tip of the bottle.  For us, these are worthless.  I am taking them back today.	
- 1	These are cute and will serve the purpose. But they are very thin, I doubt they will absorb much when used. But as nasty as burp rags tend to get they will be fine for a short time I am sure.	
- 1	The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush.  The nail files are okay.  The medicine dropper was useless.  It wouldn't suction up any medicine. The fingernail clipper is also useless.  It's just an adult-sized one with an attachment.  Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then (on their pediatrician's advice).  I'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital, which I'm told are the best.  So, in all, if I were to do it again, I'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I haven't used much of it, and the parts that I have used, have mostly unimpressed me.	
1. 	These saved my nursing relationship with my daughter. We used them for 6 weeks while we fixed latch problems and allowed cracked nipples to heal properly. I don't think we would have been successful without them. Make sure you get yourself an Internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) before you use them to properly diagnose the problem and help you with fit!	
- 1	I think the material for the mold especially and for the entire frame is somewhat cheap.  I know a couple of people who've been happy with this product but it just didn't work for us.  It is tough to do with a squirmy baby and once we did finally get a mold the contrast wasn't very striking--a footprint with ink may look better.  Not worth the effort or $, in my opinion.	
- 1	When they say &#34;small&#34; it is truly small. I chose small because they suggest you select your size, but in the end the baby's size &#34;prevailed.&#34; Couldn't fit her in, it was very uncomfortable.	
1. 	I have owned several bottle brushes over the course of the last 4 years.  From the cheap 99 cent ones, to the relatively expensive Oxo Tot.  This has been the best of the bunch.The design is excellent for narrow neck bottle users.  Other bottle brushes have bristles all the way around the handle (360 degrees).  That seems very intuitive at first.  You probably think, like I did: more bristles means easier to use and gets the bottle cleaner.Unfortunately, the 360 design it presents several practical issues *if* you use narrow neck bottles, like me.  The bristles spray water everywhere each time you pull the brush out of the bottle - annoying.  Also, the friction of constantly stuffing the brush in and out of the narrow neck causes the bristles on the 360 degree brushes to become matted, because they are so wide with the bristles going all the way around.  This Avent brush is narrower by design, which prevents the spraying water and preserves the integrity of the bristles.I would say about 95% of the bristles are still in excellent, like new, shape after 6 months of daily use.  The other 5% are a little flattened (but not matted), but it doesn't affect its ability to get the bottles clean.Sure, you have to twist the brush around to get the entire inside of the bottle clean, but it's quick and easy to do.The nipple cleaner part is eh.  It's hard plastic, so I don't see how it can really clean the nipple.  I must prefer theBaby Simba Lion Bottle Nipple Brushes. BPA Free Holder w/ Sterling Silver base. Set of 2	
1. 	I was worried this would not fit well and in fact it does very well. Very happy to have this during the cold winter!	
1. 	So I am a huge researcher in products for babies and toddlers that are organic or BPA, free.  My son is VERY picky and I had a very hard time convincing him to drink out of a sippy cup.  I literally tried about 4-5 different brands and shapes.  He was just not having it.  The day i tried this particular cup (sippy not straw version) he used it!Now, most kids are not this picky and would probably drink out of anything.  I like this product also because it is 1) BPA free, 2) LOW PRICE 3) You can sometimes find cute versions of this cup with Disney Cars on it or Toy story etc.  You can also lose or forget these sippy cups and not feel bad because of how incredibly cheap they are.  I have bought this product least 10 times over the last year and a half and that is only because I can't stand when my son starts to chew and leave teeth marks on the lid.	
- 1	Being my first experience with breast feeding, I didn't know there are different sizes of flanges.  I bought this one and it was painful to pump.  Luckily a friend was visiting and told me the flange was too small.  So I called AVENT and was told I couldn't buy a different size, they only used a one size fits all breasts model.  When I said, well this will not work for me, the customer service immediately took my information, emailed me a prepaid label to mail the pump back to them.  Once it arrived, they credited me the entire amount of the product.During this same time, I did find another breast pump that had a number of different sizes of flanges (yes, I bought them all to try out)!  To help you, this website gives the sizes:  [...]Overall, the product didn't work for me.  BUT the customer service couldn't have been better!!!	
1. 	Highly recommend buying online from Amazon the prices in the store are a lot higher these are good bottles cause you can actually hear the air coming out bottom less colic, and you can take them apart so your getting a cleaner bottle and can order different flow nipples . Recommend this item .	
1. 	I keep this attached to links and keep with my babies stroller. She has two bottom teeth that are a few millimeters in, and loves chewing on this. I like that its multipurpose, it's fun to chew on and it simulates the feeling of having your teeth brushed.	
1. 	My son is 18 months old 36 tall and 33lbs. All other potties were absolutely too small for my son, he dwarfed all seats but this one. We love it so far!!!	
- 1	I purchased the Zoli stick gum massagers along with the Teethifier for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how that product would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. I worry that he'll push it too  far into his mouth when using it that way, since the stopper is at the other end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier over these stick teethers.	
- 1	baby likes it, however when my son was 3 months old, he didn't have good control over his arms, so he hit his head really hard and it left a mark there. i would recommend it for a baby with better motor skills.	
1. 	These snack cups are AWESOME! I can put all sorts of small snack items (dried fruit, crackers, cookies, etc) in here, and my toddler can't get the lid off to make a mess. He can get his hand in all the way to the bottom to get the last few pieces (a problem I've had with other snack containers). Yes, if you have small crumbs and your child turns the cup upside down and shakes, you might have a little mess. However, it wasn't that big of a problem for me - just make sure you have fresh, whole pieces of your snack.	
1. 	Got this blanket as it was highly recommended and I am grateful for the referral. Easy to use and babies are happy.	
1. 	Nothing quite gets my goat more than waking up in the middle of the night covered in milk because of a leaky bottle. Temper, angry words, hurt feelings, the inevitable rest of the night sleeping on the lumpy couch because you blamed your wife for leaving the bottle on the bed after putting the newborn back in the crib. These were the events that followed due to the dysfunction of every set of bottles I have ever owned before receiving the Playtex VentAire bottle set.These bottles do not leak as long as you screw the lid on tightly. I am really glad that these bottles do not contain BPA and relieved that they are supposedly easy to clean but what makes me really pleased is that if the bottle makes it through a night on the bed I do not wake up doused in milk.For the good of your relationship with your SO, for the sake of your back, for the sake of the environment because of all of the laundry required due to a leaky bottle just go ahead and add this item to your shopping cart.	
1. 	It's been awhile since the last review so I thought I'd share my opinion. While some hospitals may (did) give you some of the items in the kit, it's not a guarantee that they will and there's nothing wrong with  having a backup. I actually have 2 of these kits, one for the house and one for the diaper bag.	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. this does not work. I ordered it to replace that horrible bulb but it does get anything out of my baby's nose! Had to go back to the bulb	
1. 	My 15 month old, LOVES LOVES LOVES to shut the door behind him. This door stopper is awesome - it stops the little bugger from closing the door and causing trouble :o). Fits on any door. We love it!	
1. 	The hospital where I had my son gives you one of these halo sleepsacks to take home with you.i loved it so much I had to purchase another one. I wish I would have had these when my daughter was born.	
- 1	I revceived this item as a baby shower gift.  My baby used it for about a month and seemed to really enjoy it.  After one month of use the portion that lights up and makes music quit working.  The ends still spin, but she is no longer interested.  I emailed the company re: my problem and am waiting to hear back.  I will update my review if they respond.I rated this item three stars because I really enjoyed the product but it didn't work for very long.January 11, 2013 - Two months later and absolutely no response from the company. Buy at your own risk.	
- 1	I bought this stroller when our son was 1 month old and used it not even for 5 months and also occasionally. I found this stroller to be a piece of junk!! The back bends like a letter C and our son who is not even 6 months yet was so uncomfortable that I had to buy another stroller Peg Perego Aria and am so glad I did because it is much lighter than chicco and much sturdier. Peg Perego also has a bigger basket. In the end, I returned the Chicco, the customer service at BabiesRUs was so great that they gave us a store credit. Beware!!! The chicco stroller at the beginning seems to be great but after a while as the child gets older and heavier, the flimsy back bends!!! Don't waste your time and money on this stroller!!!	
1. 	Vastly overpriced.Couldn't live without it.When I opened the box I thought it was an example of style over substance. Something that looks good, is expensive, and cost practically nothing to make (all of which is probably true). Three weeks later, I've got to admit: Overpriced or not, The Kid Loves It.	
1. 	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.	
1. 	We bought this gym for our 2 month old son and he absolutely loves playing in the jungle!  Between the flashing lights, the music and the hanging toys, he's got plenty to keep him busy.  Although it seems early, I'm pretty sure he's already figured out which toy rattles when it's hit and he bonks it to hear the noise!  He dances and coos and looks at everything.  I'm just so happy with this purchase.  It was $30 cheaper on Amazon than the local stores too!	
- 1	Did not fit on my crib (orbelle sleigh style). Bumpers come in 4 pieces, one for each side of the crib. The instructions said to use only 2 of the bumpers if they didn't fit right. I didn't really like the idea of spending all this money on bumpers and only being able to use half of them. If the ties were a bit longer they would've fit on the crib. Returned.	
1. 	I am still a little nervous about feeding in public and this helps. I know I'm not going to drop it and expose myself and it also helps keep him from getting distracted. I recommend it for anyone who wants to bf in public.	
1. 	This gate is CLEAR and it has everything that I wanted. I needed a gate that would lock my toddler out of the kitchen and that would lock my dog into the kitchen. I felt so bad getting a gate that wouldn't allow my dog to &#34;see through&#34; because she gets sad when she's in the other room, but then I found this! This allows her to see my toddler and vice versa. The door is also very easy for adults and difficult for my toddler. We took off our kitchen door and put this door in its place. It's a swinging door so it's easy for us to get in and out of the kitchen without having to worry about the baby getting her fingers smashed. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this door!!! I researched these gates for weeks and the only thing that I found that compared was a DIY door that would cost me 5 times as much and it wouldn't even have a clear view.	
- 1	I bought these for my teething toddler twins in the hopes that they would give them more relief than a regular pacifier. Saying they didn't like them would be an understatement. They literally screech and chuck these at the walls with the force of a major league pitcher. Even if there is no other pacifier in a five mile vicinity, they hate these on sight and refuse to even touch them. My two love pacifiers, if you can't already tell. These are not pacifiers. Ah well. Hey, I tried.	
- 1	eems to be more expensive than the product. Halsuitneun item is correct, but to protect the child head, I listen to the wind, if not go to the fire, the product seems to be more expensive compared to.	
- 1	I purchased these training cups about a year ago when the spout had a Y shaped cut to allow the flow of liquid to pass through.  They were the best cups for transitioning my son from a bottle to a sippy because of the soft spout and the slow flow of liquid.  Recently the spouts on the 2 cups that I own became really worn out with one yellow spout turning black (at first i thought this was mold but I could not scrub/boil it off and realized it was the material itself changing color) and the blue spout finally being bitten through.  I purchased replacement spouts only to find that the cut in the tip was now a horizontal slit instead of the Y cut.  The material also seemed to be a lot firmer making the slit stay open instead of closing immediately once my son stopped sucking.  This allowed for liquids to spill out easily and also for too much liquid to flow out while my son was drinking.  After failing to find suitable replacement spouts I decided to call the manufacturer to see if they still made the Y cut spouts.  I was told they do not make them any longer and that they had changed manufacturers for the spouts.  When I asked if the materials were the same I was told they were.  However I doubt this to be true since the old spouts were much more pliable.  Overall the cup USE TO BE amazing but now with the new horizontal slitted spouts they are totally disappointing.  They leak everywhere!	
- 1	It seems like a great idea, but....- way too expensive for essentially just a paci with a hole- the back part that actually holds the medicine is REALLY hard to snap close! Have to fiddle with it every time and it's annoying.-  a lot of the content (medicine) simply does NOT go into the pacifier part - somehow ends up clinging to the container, so you are not sure what amount actually went into baby's mouth.I eventually gave this thing up and ended up doing the following:- adding medicine to a small amount of milk/formula and just feeding it to the baby (small amount of milk ensure that the baby will drink the entire dosage of medicine)- using dropper/syringe to directly administering medicine/vitamins if I know that the baby does not mind the taste.Some reviewers pointed out that some stuff (like Baby Calm) has think particles to it that would not go through regular bottle pacifier. Well, use dropper then or punch a bigger hole in the bottle paci, because things will get stuck in the NUMI anyways!	
- 1	My almost two year old daughter is not always good at holding hands, so I thought I would give this a try.  I had another brand that was not stretchy, and she tolerated it.  However, there was no give, so she would sometimes fall down when it ran out of length.  The Safety 1st has nice stretchy material, so the child can tell when there is no more give and not fall down.  My daughter did not like the material around her wrist, and within a few minutes asked to have it removed.  I have read a recommendation to tie the strap to pant belt loops which is a great idea.  Unfortunately, my daughter does not have pants that have belt loops, so we will work on holding hands and I have ordered a carrier.	
- 1	Our son quickly started eating them. He he easily bit off two pieces and even swallowed one before we could stop him. Do not buy.	
- 1	After reading all of the great reviews for this straw sippy cup I thought I had finally found THE sippy cup to beat out all other sippy cups.  And the fact that it was only $5 was just too good to be true...and it turns out that it was.  The sippy cup worked as advertised - it has a straw and you can get liquid out of it.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's a bit hard to get liquid out of the straw but not THAT hard.  My 10 month old managed to drink out of it right away without any issues.  The reason for giving it only 1 star was the fact that I had it for only 3 days before it cracked on the bottom from being dropped, which I didn't notice until a few hours later when I found a huge puddle of water all over the table.  I really wanted to like this sippy cup so I was disappointed that it broke so quickly.  I've been through a lot of sippy cups and this one definitely took the record for shortest time between entering the house and exiting the house (in the trash).  Too bad.	
1. 	I haven't had this blanket long, but have already used it a couple of times.  The size is nice for 2 adults and 1 little one to use.  It folds up and packs very nicely.  I wouldn't pay a lot for it (since my closet is full of other blankets), but think it is worth the price that I paid.	
1. 	These finger guards are simple to use and very effective. I highly recommend this product for anyone with a toddler or infant on the go!	
1. 	This is by far the best bib I have ever bought! Originally I only added to my order so I could get free shipping, but it turned out to be the best bib purchase I have ever made! Before this bib we were using plastic/fabric bibs and over time they get smelly and dingy, this bib is SO much easier to clean, never gets an odor to it, and it catches everything because they pouch always stays open unlike fabric bibs! You will not be disappointed! It is also harder for children to rip off during meal time unlike the ones with velcro. My son is now 2.5 years old and has just started learning how to take it off. He could take off the velcro bibs around a year old! So this is definitely an improvement! I cannot say enough good things about this bib, I recommend it to every one I know.	
1. 	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!	
- 1	I bought several of these brushes because we go through them left and right. Afer 10 months of using them...I  have decided that I do not like them...at all. The nipple brush uses a metal wire...which rusts after about a month or so. The lengh of the brush is just a little too short. To wash an 8oz bottle is a little difficult because once the brush is fully in, there is only about 1-1 1/2 inches of the handle to hold on to in order to clean the bottle. Even with having smaller hands...this makes it hard to twist and clean. If you put the nipple brush back in and try to twist it...it doesn't work because the nipple brush doesn't lock.	
1. 	After hearing a story from a friend about a preschooler turning on all the knobs on the gas stove and then going to bed I began my search for a solution and came across these simply knob covers.  They are easy to install.  You simply slip off your own knobs, install these with the front latch open, then close the case over the knob.  Toddlers can hit the knobs and spin them but they can turn the knobs themselves or accidentally turn on the stove.  They are easy to cook with.  With one hand you can pop open the top cover, reach inside to turn the knob and then close it again.  We have a commercial style oven.  The knobs are a simple, non-intrusive baby proofing tool well worth the investment.	
1. 	Our son has bad congestion and it takes a lot of work for him to eat. Switching up to a level 3 has been great for him in terms of being able to take in more forumla.  He was eating anywhere from 30 to 120 cc before, now he is eating 150+ because he isn't expending all his energy trying to breathe and suck at the same time.  It's also cut down on the amount of time it takes to feed him.  Have not noticed more spit up or gas with the level 3 compared with the level 1.  Wish I had started using these earlier but all the nurses and doctors recommended using the Preemie nipple!	
- 1	I got this attacher today and was pretty disappointed in it. It's not worth paying even the 5 bucks but then tack on the 5 dollar shipping as well that they charged me and it's definitely not worth the price. It's a piece of ribbon attached to a clip. Not all that complicated. I would NOT buy this again for myself or a friend. I got a bink link off of amazon.com and at least it's got some style for the price. Don't waste you moolah on this one!	
1. 	Love these bibs. They clean up so easily. They are great for first foods when it's pretty liquid and just slides down the front of the bib. Our baby loves to suck his food off of the bib. It's a really nice texture for babies. I always just wash it off, wring it out, and strap it onto the high chair to dry out. Works great and is always dry by the next time we need it.	
- 1	This is a nice product, but the compartments are very tiny. Barely holds enough snacks for my 21 month old. Great concept, just wish the compartments were a little bigger.	
1. 	I recently purchased 4 Haba toys for my 9 month old.  He seemed interested in Ballino the first day, but hasn't spent much time with it since.  His favorite is Trix which he plays with for a long time, taking it around the house, banging it on furniture and, of course, chewing on it.  He also really likes Flapsi because there are interesting things to look at, it makes a neat sound when he flaps it and he likes chewing on the head and tail.  He doesn't spend much time at all with Haba's Triangle, but obviously every child will have different preferences.  I am still very happy to have tried them all and hope that he will go through different stages when he will find them all interesting.  Right now he is mostly interested in inspecting EVERYTHING in the house which is why I purchased more toys!  But I think I'm just going to have to let him explore awhile!	
- 1	I must admit, this is the first potty seat that my son can sit on where the pee doesn't fly over the top the seat.  I was really happy with the seat up until I picked it up...The seat, unfortunately, catches all the pee on the underside, causing the toilet seat to be pee covered, the potty seat underside to be pee covered, and the seat to leak out pee once you pick the thing up.  While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat.In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though...UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet!  Just because of that, I would actually raise it a star for use, but it's a DIY star.  If you're willing to go that extra mile, this seat works great.	
1. 	I bought these to shake the bottles and to put on the bottle to prevent them leaking in the diaper bag. They never leak and they can be sterilized over and over. I use the Dr. Brown's steam sterilizer. Great product...worth every penny!	
1. 	This seat was wonderful!  There were many times that the only way my newborn would sleep at night was in this seat.  It has a vibrating seat option which my daughter was a huge fan of.  I was told that this is because it is a similar vibration from when she was in the womb.  It also has different sound options (ocean, music).  It was also the only way we could keep her occupied while we ate dinner.  What a hit!  I was sorry when she outgrew it.	
1. 	Even if the lids are a bit stiff, they stay on and do their job. Better than the cute Nuby one, sadly.	
1. 	My fourth child has suffered from congestion and a stuffy nose since birth. The traditional nasal aspirator did not work well for her, and seemed to cause more frustration than anything for both of us...These tweezers have been great. They just get the job done quickly and efficiently.	
1. 	We gave theCloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtleand heard that the parents like it as much as the baby.  It's not a soft toy, but a soothing light that is comforting.  Knowing that it turns off automatically is an asset, and hearing how it is soothing to watch, I'm tempted to buy one for us, too.  I guess this is as good as they say.	
1. 	Got it for my wife who is a side sleeper and was having a hard time sleeping due to pregnant tummy. She is very happy with this pillow and says it provides plenty of support.	
1. 	these are much better than the 2 piece shields that came with my medela pump, they are easy to wash and very easy to use.	
- 1	I bought these because of the price, but it doesnt worth it, the product dont stick to the corner of the desk very well, keeps falling apart, and my baby is only 10 months old but strong enough to pull it down, I had to tape it to the desk and doesnt look neat.	
- 1	I have the fleece early walker and bought this for summer. I knew it was mesh, but did not expect it to be so thin.  It is so thin it provides no warmth whatsoever, really not different from without one. I've had these for a few months and only used it twice, and both times my toddler felt really cold in the middle of the night.  In summer nights my house runs about 73-75.I should've just got the lightweight cotton one.	
- 1	Though this product worked perfectly for about a week, after that it became the bane of my existence.  At risk of sounding repetitive, the thing leaks.  It leaks when just sitting on the table.  It leaks if full or if only half filled.  It leaks even if you check it for leaks at the sink, see that nothing is dripping, and then hand it to your toddler.  Guaranteed, 5 minutes later, it's going to leak.  It leaks from the straw, it leaks from the threads (despite being threaded correctly) and I'm convinced it leaks from its very pores.There's quite a few other one star reviews telling exactly what happens (there's some kind of pressure buildup happening inside, no matter what liquid is in it, that causes the liquid to come back up out of the straw and drip everywhere) and there's even a video.  Watch that, and then avoid this cup like the plague. Really.	
1. 	It's been awhile since the last review so I thought I'd share my opinion. While some hospitals may (did) give you some of the items in the kit, it's not a guarantee that they will and there's nothing wrong with  having a backup. I actually have 2 of these kits, one for the house and one for the diaper bag.	
- 1	This thing rattled from the moment I moved the car, even if leaving the driveway at 2 mph.  Drove me crazy.  Found this is a common problem when I searched the reviews for 'shakes' and synonyms like 'vibrate', 'rattle', 'wobble', etc.  Also heard that the mirror can pop out of the ball-bearing joint in a crash.  I returned mine.  Same issue with the similar Britax model.	
- 1	This mirror does not work with my Britax Roundabout 55 rear facing car seat because of the way that it needs to be tethered to the anchor, so I've put it in the seat next to it, and I can still kind of see my child.  It is HUGE!  There is no way that I would put this on the headrest.  It would completely block my vision.  It's cute, though, and the mirror image is really clear.  I wish I hadn't bought it.  I did post a picture of the different ways you can anchor the mirror.	
- 1	I agree with the previous reviewer from a few days ago. I have many Green Sprouts products and like them, but these are poorly designed and unhealthy. At first, they seem great, but moisture gets between where the silicone spoon attaches to the plastic handle and can't escape, so mold grows. Very poor construction. REALLY disgusting. Trying to return, but seems ridiculous that I need to send moldy spoons through the mail.	
- 1	I had five different bouncy seats with my twins and this was not my favorite. It was okay but took up so much room. You can get a smaller FP one with a light up activity bar with music for the same price. I would recommend the lighter smaller FP monkey seat.	
1. 	The size is perfect for our bathroom (which has about 4x4' of walking floor space), and the shape is great. It has a nice &#34;splash guard&#34; on the front, so I'm not worried about the little man peeing over the top. He has yet to use it successfully, but he has been interested in it since the day it arrived! Training techniques aside, it's a solid little training seat.	
1. 	More milk for half the time! This pump truly is wonderful...don't give up until you've taken this pump for a test ride!	
1. 	I don't give 5* 'cause when my 17 mo eats his breakfast (oatmeal that I prepare with soy milk) he spills it  and  goes to the bib's pocket (as expected) then the pocket sticks to the bib (oatmeal is very sticky) so the rest of the oats spills outside and makes a mess on his pajamas. Other kind of food is not a problem: fruits, meats, vegetables. I wash them by hand easily and let them dry hanging. I been using them for 2 months and they look like new still!I definitely recommend it!	
1. 	These aren't bad. A little awkward to use the clipper lever - it is very small even for my small hands and tends to slip. But I'm guessing this is just the case with all baby clippers. It's fairly easy to see what you're about to clip and you don't need to press very hard to cut the nail. My handle was green, unlike the white in the photo.	
1. 	I bought the cherry version of this bed for my granddaughter who is now three and using it in its toddle form, so I made this second purchase for the next granddaughter, with complete confidence. The crib is strong, looks good, takes some perseverance to put together, but is well worth it.	
1. 	These bibs are nice! We have the On The Go & Guppies prints. They are eco-friendly, a decent size for my 20 month old and dry so quickly! We can use it for breakfast, completely soak it clean, and it is always dry by lunch or snack time. I like that they can be machine washed. The pocket does not snap apart and that would be nice at times to get crumbs out of the tiny crevices, but I guess that is what the machine washing is supposed to accomplish.The only flaw I have found thus far is that for some reason I thought that they were made in the USA, but they're not.	
1. 	These travel caps are great, I usually fill up all of my son's bottles with filtered water at the beginning of the day and cap them, leaving the other assembled accessories next to them for a quick bottle prep.  These are the only caps that will tightly seal the bottle, I've used the medela caps on those bottles and every single time I am mixing formula in the bottle they leak.  These caps are made for the dr. brown's bottles so definitely get them, if you like to secure the bottles with liquid or make formula in them.  This way you can ensure no leaks.	
1. 	We like this and have used it often. However, only seven of the eight utensils will fit with the lid on the case. This didn't matter much for us, though - we just leave a spoon at home! Also, the fork tips are rounded, so our son has a little trouble spearing things with it. He is old enough (fifteen months) to be able to use a pointier fork, so I will be checking soon to see if one of our sharper forks will fit in the case.And, as it says in the title, colors can vary. Ours is orange and yellow, which I like better than the pink in the picture since it's more gender neutral.	
- 1	I use this item daily to dry my bottles, but that's about it.  Bottle storage.It's super flimsy and even with the plastic bottles it knocks around easily.  Also, the spin part of it, well, I just don't really call that spinning.  It's easier just to pick it up and turn it IMPO.This is one of the few items I will probably toss out after my son is out of bottle and just get something better next child.	
1. 	I don't take food out and about yet for my son - he is only 7 months old right now.  But we do use these at home to mix up foods for him and heat or keep fresh in the fridge.  The sizes are really convenient!  And, they are great for taking stuff to work!!  I use these for salsas and dressings, toppings, etc., for my lunches for work!  I love them!  They are dishwasher and microwave safe - can't beat them.  I am so glad I bought these.  I know we will use them more and more often as time goes on!	
1. 	This is the ONLY small portable pump on the planet for me.  Works GREAT.  Quick, comfortable, compact.  Worth EVERY penny.  If you have others to choose from, don't pick another.  There is a reason no one has rated less than 5 stars!!!  I would actually consider using this as a daily pump at work!  I like it that much!!!	
- 1	This item cost me $10.00 I wish I would have been able to try it before buying it. Very disappointed with the product, It actually had some good reviews so I was very excited to buy it and hopefully make bath time more fun (by keeping the water out of my child's face) and unfortunately this product does not do that.	
- 1	Friends warned me against purchasing this product, and as a new mom, I didn't listen.  I am glad it wasn't very expensive, because after a few failed attempts to use it to suction my new baby's nose, I tossed it in the trash can.	
- 1	I have a 2 month old and I just do not feel comfortable using this carrier.  I bought it because it was cheaper than baby bjorn and I thought that it would be the same, but I just do not feel that it is that sturdy.  My baby is 14 pounds now and I just cannot use it, he does not like it, and I feel like it is going to rip or I will hurt my back using it.	
- 1	We have use this a few times and it really doesn't hold up the baby well. Babies move around a lot and this thing always looks like it is about to collapse. It bends if she leans to the side. I bought it to avoid the yucky ones in restaurants but I find that I don't really want to take this with us most of the time. My baby is on the heavy side so maybe it works better with lighter weight babies. I feel like I wasted money on this and I wished I spent a few more bucks for a better one. You get what you pay for.	
1. 	My little guy was getting too big for the normal plastic baby tub and I am not quite ready to have him be on his own in the tub right now.  I like that I can &#34;be in control&#34; a little bit more with this bath tub.I really wish that I would have gotten this when he was 4-5 months old when he could sit upright by himself.I make sure that I rinse it out and hang it up immediately so that it can start drying out.  So far, I have not noticed any musty smell.What I also like about this is my son burnt his foot and we were having to elevate it and keep it out of the water for awhile.  This tub was perfect.  Since the sides are soft (think bean bag chair) we propped his foot up on the side and he left it there because it was cushiony.  I also like that I can lay him down to rinse out his hair and he is comfortable and doesn't fight it like he did in the plastic tub.You can't go wrong with this purchase!	
1. 	I wish I had gotten these sooner! I have 2 children both under age 3 and these have been wonderful! I ended up spending lots of time and money trying to clean my fabric seats. Between bottles and sippys leaking or being dropped and snacks being lost I had my work cut out for me. Since installing these under the carseats clean up has been quick and easy. They also protect my seats from the indents caused by carseats. The pockets on the front have come in handy for storing smaller items that we carry in the car, like kleenex packs and headphones.These are well worth the money spent.	
- 1	Maybe I'm just new to this parent game and haven't built up my tolerance for things to be difficult/annoying but... the adapters (yes, I have them installed correctly) are a really awkward fit between my Maxi Cosi Mico and my Cameleon stroller. Like, I can't really get the seat OFF the stroller base by myself.So, I'm faced with 2 options:1. Not leaving the house without my husband. This has been my strategy for 3 weeks, leaving me bored enough to write this review.2. Buying a different car seat and hoping it fits better with the stroller since it is the less expensive of the 2 itemsVery confusing that these adapters are considered a solution to my situation (quote from the FAQ section of the Bugaboo website, pretty accurate)Update: after thinking maybe our carseat model was too old we went to Babies R Us to try the adapters with the newest model seat but alas, same terrible fit. I gave up and bought the Graco adapters on here and a Graco carseat used and the fit is INCREDIBLE comparatively. The 2 remaining stars are because Diapers.com was great about letting me return these Maxi Cosi adapters.	
1. 	My neice is having her first baby and I wanted to get her something to match the blanket that I knitted for the babyand this is perfect.  I hope she enjoys using it.	
1. 	I wanted leak proof cups for my toddler who goes to bed with a sippy of water. He often wakes in the middle of the night and wants a drink of water. With this being right next to him, he can get a drink himself. I like the larger size of this cup (9oz) and I also like that it keeps his water cold. And leakproof, yes, 100% leakproof! I tested it myself to see how hard it is to get water out of this cup. You have to suck, but nothing that would be too difficult for a toddler. When this cup gets knocked over in bed or on the living room floor, not a drop of water comes out.I'm very happy with my purchase. I would buy these again.	
1. 	very mild incline, and comfortable.  worked nicely, and easy to insert. we were overall happy with this. Just the right firmness, I think	
1. 	I bought this set before my son was born and couldn't wait to show him all of the bright, colorful toys.  When he was a few weeks old, we held the rattles in front of him, and he stared at them in amazement.  Eventually he learned to hold and shake them on his own, and then he discovered the other toys.  He fell in love with the yellow and purple jingle ball, and he would have lots of fun shaking it and rolling it across the floor.  The teethers are nicely textured, and the linking letters are fun to dangle from an activity gym.  Also, my son loves the little yellow rubber ducky and the purple octopus.  I squirt him with them during bath time, and he laughs and squeals.  Of all the toys we now own, many of his favorites are from the original Sassy set.  This toy set has been wonderful, and I would highly recommend it to other parents.  Not only are the toys designed with bright, high-contrast patterns to please young infants, but also they are varied and durable enough to please older babies.  This truly is a great assortment of baby toys.	
1. 	Nice design. Goes well with everything ( except bright red ). There are more cool additions for it in your local baby's r us.If the sheet they included was 100% cotton, it would have been 5 stars.	
1. 	Babies are used to being 'swaddled' in the womb so why wouldn't they want to be when they are born? And, you just can't swaddle the baby like the nurses do at the hospital with just a little blanket. This takes the brains out of everything with easy to place velcro. One thing I recommend is to by them new. I bought a few off of ebay used and the velcro needs to be sticky. They lose their stickiness over time. They are awesome!!!	
1. 	I love this tub. The sling makes giving my month old daughter a bath very easy. At first I filled it up full enough to touch her back but found that when she would slide herself down a little it would get to close to her mouth so I drained it a little and it works great. I love that is has the holder at the end as well. I put everything I need in it so I never forget anything.	
- 1	This is an awesome idea.  It needs to just be a lid you put on over your existing toilet.  The adult portion feels like you are sitting on the rim, it's horribly uncomfortable.  The toddler portion doesn't stay up, so you have to go with it leaning on your back.  The adult portion, doesn't stay up at all, so my husband can't use it.  It's such a great thing, it just needs to be improved.	
- 1	The knob is constantly coming apart from the scrubber.  Next time I would just purchase the regular brush.  It's very inconvenient to clean Dr. Brown bottles to begin with - this brush just makes the process way more annoying!	
- 1	Set this up, and it literally spun around one time, and then quit.  There wasn't enough air blowing to even make a bubble anyways.  Bad product - save your money and time and pass on this product.	
1. 	This works well with the contour changing pad.  It fits a little snugly, so the corners of the pad don't exactly stay as pointy as they were when it was new, but it works very well.  It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad.  You're right there with baby, anyway.	
- 1	I fell in love with this little rinser because our nursery was beach themed. At first, we just used a small squirt bottle for baby when she started having full immersion baths. But as she grew, we were having to refill the bottle just to rinse her off. So we finally got this off our registry because it was bigger than the squirt bottle and cuter than a plain cup. It was the perfect size when it arrived, but all the water rushed out the first time we poured it over her. There was no good way to see how close the water level was to the lip edge in order to control a slower pour. Even after we figured out how to control the speed of the pour, the rounded pelican mouth prevents controlling the volume of water poured. if it had just a slight point, it would be much easier to aim. Since we spent the money on it, we use it to rinse her back and we'll try to rinse her head with it again once she gets a little older. But so far this is ending up to be a major inconvenience and disappointment. Also, I have NOT noticed any scum/mold like some other reviewers.	
1. 	Seat comes off the plastic handle-and-holder. Colors are nice and seat is soft and easy to clean. It is light and my 18-month-old can lift and place it (albeit not always with the right fit) on the toilet seat. Guard is useless in my mind since my LO can't climb over it, but otherwise a steal and saved me the trouble of getting a potty.	
1. 	I exclusively breast fed the first 16 weeks of my son's life and then unfortunately my supply dropped when I went back to work.  He's nearly 5 months and we're now on formula 100% of the time.  I bought this b/c of the reviews and the price and I'd have to say it's one of the best baby purchases I have made.  It's a no brainer get one - I might even get another one so when I'm washing this one I have a back up.	
- 1	This is shit!! I return it. It doesn't fit my spout at all. Way way too small. I found no way to put it into my spout. Return it and I need to pay for the shipping. Regret x 10000000.	
1. 	We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!	
1. 	My first child, I LOVED these. They were wonderful, and I stocked up on them. He never spilled his food with these, and I didn't have to worry about him spilling cheerios, cereals, crackers, etc. everywhere. I had read someone's reviews after that complaining about their kids pulling the top off, I rolled my eyes because my kid never did it! Well, along came baby #2. From when I first gave them to him (at 10 months old) he would use his teeth to pull the top off, defeating the whole purpose. So now, that child which is now 18m can't use them as he makes a mess... my 4 year old still uses these, and still has yet to try to take the top off, so I love them for him.EDIT: I did try other brands I found in chain stores, and of the few I tried, Munchkins are the best for little hands IMO. The rubber is soft and pliable, while still doing the job. Another brand makes sharp hard plastic points to get into, and I threw those away.	
- 1	I've read these bottles are made in England so I thought that the quality will be superior but how wrong I was. It started to leak after 2 months of use. I liked that bottle cuz it was pretty small and comfortable for my child to grip, but leaking takes all good away. Be wise, don't buy it!	
1. 	we swaddled our baby for almost 3 months and rotated between two of these every night... it really is awesome and works much better than other blankets I tried... don't waste time or money trying anything else - this was really the best solution!!!	
- 1	We were not even thinking about getting a video monitor for our second baby after having just a simple audio monitor with our first because of the price of all of them.  But then we found this one.  It got pretty good reviews... and was only a little bit more money than any decent audio monitors.  We have been using it for a couple weeks now and are not that impressed. It is nice to be able to see our almost 2 year old while she is sleeping (or not sleeping) in her crib.  It has decent night vision set up so we can still see her in the dark. However, the parent unit does not keep a charge for long at all! We keep it charged for all of the day except for her nap, which is maybe up to 3 hours.  It doesn't even usually last that whole time. The other complaint we have is that it interferes with our internet connection randomly.  My hubby started complaining about that part a week or so ago and I thought he was crazy until it started happening to me over the last couple of days.  Overall, I probably wouldn't buy it again, but will keep it because it's too much of a pain to send it back at this point.Update: 12/28/12This is definitely not worth the money I paid, and I am already wishing I spent a little more money in the first place to get a nicer monitor.  The antenna's cheap plastic has broken off and now the monitor is useless.  It doesn't have any signal.  I have ordered a much nicer Motorola monitor to replace this. I would definitely NOT recommend buying this, but do plenty of research and spend the extra money!	
- 1	I have looked through a few reviews and while many people said it's long when folded, I didn't see one that actually said HOW long. I took my tape measure to Target and it is approximately 51 when folded. It (barely) fits in the back of my Highlander but that is why I measured it first and that was the only possible drawback I had to it.PROS:**I find the stroller to be pretty light (considering it's a DOUBLE STROLLER).**It folds MUCH more easily than our first nightmare Graco single stroller, which was abandoned in the parking lot of a local children's museum when my husband finally got so frustrated with the opening and closing mechanism and couldn't fold it to get it into the SUV (he didn't use it much by himself so he didn't know all the silly little tricks I had up my sleeve to close it up).**I didn't find the brake to be problematic at all. I am 5'1 and my husband is 6', and neither of us even got close to kicking the brake pedal and stopping the stroller mid-stride unless we did some silly gazelle-like running through the store.**I LOVE that the front snack tray opens up - on either side! - so that toddler can just climb right into the stroller himself instead of me picking him up and putting him in it.CONS:**Update: I took my toddler to Target to see how he fits and rides in this stroller. I had seen a couple of other reviews saying that the front seat is too shallow for a child over 18 months or so.. Totally correct!! I have NO idea why Graco made this seat so shallow, and couldn't even have angled it down just an inch or two so that it's more like a bucket seat and less like he's going to slide right out of the stroller! Even the crotch part of the 5-point harness is installed so far back in the seat, it's like 5 of room for the kid's body. The seat is just OK for him right now, but I can't imagine it being comfortable much longer. I'm not spending $200 on something that will last us less than 6 months. If you have the money to waste, knock yourself out, but we buy things to last!This issue was a dealbreaker. We'll have to find another stroller.	
1. 	This is a great pail. It doesn't hold a ton, but it doesn't smell bad and the top easily pops open when you push the foot pedal. Is not unattractive in the nursery either.	
- 1	We loved this spoon set when it was new, but after a few uses and contact with hot food, it's melted and deformed a little.I think it'll be great for salad, fruit and ice cream, definitely not for hot food.	
- 1	Got one as a gift and now have to return it.  It is not as universal as it states.  The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly.  It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
1. 	I got the snoogle when i was 4 months pregnant. I'm now 8 months pregnant and it has served me well for 4 months! I LOVE this pillow. It serves so many functions. I use it every single night to prop me up as I read in bed (you just fold it into a little ball or nest as they call it), and when I sleep, I lay on my left side with the snoogle under my large belly supporting it all through the night. I honestly don't move until I have to get up and go use the bathroom. Then I come back and get comfortable in a different position (facing the snoogle hugging it). It's so versatile and if I get sore hips, I just roll over onto the snoogle under my back and it takes pressure off my hips.I should also mention that since the age of 13, I've had a herniated disc in my lower back. Well, thanks to this pillow, I haven't had any problems with my lower back at ALL in this pregnancy. If you want to sleep through the night comfortably, I would recommend this pillow.The only negative thing I could think of to say is that sometimes it's difficult if I decide I want to roll over onto my other side. You have to shift and finagle your way around the snoogle. But other than that, it's been fantastic. I fully plan on taking the snoogle with me to the hospital!	
1. 	good thing i only bought one package because one pack had enough to cover all the outlets in my house.	
1. 	I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!	
- 1	My daughters are 2 and 4. We've had bath crayon's before so we know to try and keep them out of the water for the most part but lets be realistic. They are kids and the crayons get dropped in the water. They begin dissolving immediately. I doubt they will last more than 4 baths. These are junk in my opinion.	
- 1	I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say recline.  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the in-between stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position. ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat. ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them. - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base. - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.	
- 1	My husband and I both tried and tried - it was impossible.  Now it's become a chew toy without anything inside to chew.  Oh well.	
1. 	Nice cheap alternative for stars...(you can not see stars in city...:()I also enjoyed this with my baby...Some of the lights are not as bright as others...but still works.Also have moon in there :)Don't really give baby to play with it...Looking directly into hole is little painful as light is bright inside :D So we keep it away from baby.	
- 1	I was disappointed in these. Unfortunately after being used for a few months in a large rotation these started to tear and fall apart along the seams. I was disappointed because I had heard a lot of good things about FuzziBunz. This has made me hesitant to try their diapers.	
- 1	I was hoping this would clip onto the side of my pack and play but every time I attached the mobile it would fall over. Needless to say I returned this product.	
- 1	Everything by Fisher Price is craptastic.  This swing in no exception.Despite the cheap materials (plastic and polyester) we expected the motor to work.I tried the swing with an 8 pound weight and it worked weakly.  Ahen with a 16 pound weight and the swing barely budged.I phoned Fisher Price.  They told me if the product is in warranty, they can send a motor.  If not, I will have to pay $50 for one.I have combed through so many swing reviews on Amazon.  Crappy motors are very typical of Fisher Price.  Some people have gone through 3 or 4 motors in a year.How many of these throwaways end up in landfills every year?  Makes me think they make these lousy on purpose.  So you can never actually use a swing with more than one kid.This swing is crap and it is going back.Mamaroo here we come....	
- 1	This pad works well , but beware it has that California 117 flame retardant material that is in question.  I use it for my grandson when he comes to visit.	
1. 	This is suppose to latch onto your changing table.  Instead I use it as a car seat toy when we are sitting around or walking in the stroller.  We are not on the table long enough for them to enjoy it there.  Very nice no batteries needed but you do need to wind it up a bunch of times.  If you have a toddler in the house this is a great job for them.	
- 1	It collects water under the &#34;grass&#34;. It is also very prone to mildew. I would much rather see a small dish towel near my sink for drying bottles than this bulky piece of hard plastic.	
1. 	Actually, thank goodness for my mom, who bought this for us. She thought it had better features than the Baby Papasan, which we registered for (and someone else gave us). She was right. My 3 month old son does not like the papasan at all, but LOVES the massage bouncer. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. It's one of the few places he would sleep during the first several weeks. It's nice that the music, vibrator, and massage feature all have separate controls - so you can have one or all on at the same time. It also has a reset button to start the massage and music back up after the auto shutoff. The handle is great for carrying baby from room to room.A definite MUST-HAVE product!!	
- 1	I was very very excited about these bottles... however I soon grew to hate them and regret not buying more Avent. They leak like crazy... Its very annoying to have your baby crying and as soon as you give him the bottle, have the milk leak and have to take the bottle away and make her cry again while you put the milk in another bottle. I searched online and this happens to a lot of people, so its not just a bad batch that I got. I tried everything to make them work but nothing helped... and then, as soon as my daughter started having cereal in her milk, they became even more useless. Since the cereal makes the milk very thick, she has to suction very hard to get the milk out through both of the nipples. A bottle feeding of 5 minutes could easily take 45 minutes... and she eventually would get tired and give up and leave half of the milk in the bottle....not recommended.	
- 1	I keep tightening the umbrella, but it keeps moving and falling.  And it swings at the slightest breeze.  I stopped using it because i'm afraid it's going to fall into my daughters face.  It hooks onto the stoller just fine, that's not the issue... but once you get it in the right position and tighten it, it stays for a few minutes and then flops.  I even had my husband tighten it and it kept falling.  I wanted an umbrella that was cute and functional, but I now I have to look for something strictly functional.	
- 1	we bought as a wear house deal, came to us with the gate/hinge not working well... returned. Looked great but maybe just a fluke.	
1. 	I was hesitant to purchase this because it had so many bad reviews, but it was really the only one that would work for my needs. I had this on my baby registry and someone bought me a Diaper Genie instead and marked on my registry that they had bought this one. I returned the more expensive diaper genie because I didn't like the expensive refills on the special bags, and because I plan to use cloth diapers, it just didn't make sense to me. I bought this one and set it up today with a Planet Wise diaper bag. People mentioned in other reviews that if you did not use grocery bags, the lid did not open properly. So far I have had no problems getting the lid to open with the foot pedal despite the thicker bag. It is on the small side, but it fits perfectly next to my changing table against the wall.After I have used it for a while, I will update my review if necessary. So far though, I am glad I made this purchase. It did arrive new and not dirty or anything like that.	
- 1	My son can't keep this paci in his mouth.  He sucks on it if I hold it in his mouth, but he can't get enough suction to keep it there himself.  I bought it for him when he was about 3 months old, but I think he may have already been ready for a bigger size.  He loves his Nuk orthodontic paci, so we might just stick with those.	
- 1	I loved the pacifier pocket the first week. It was so convenient to have the pacifier on the outside of the diaper bag in an easy to find location. But the snap that secures the pocket stopped working and the pocket would constantly fall off. I returned the product!	
1. 	At first I was using the pillow upside down and I wasn't totally crazy about it, but once I flipped it I can't sleep without it.  This is a very, very comfortable, versatile, pillow.  This is my third pregnancy and I wish I had found this sooner!I sleep with the the smaller (more curved) end under my head and the wider (less curved) part in between my legs and under my belly.  The long straight part goes along my back to provide support when I sleep on my side or even if I want to turn so I'm sleeping slightly on my back.  This is a big plus for a pregnant lady, not having to sleep directly on my left side all of the time.  Having the pillow behind your back and neck keeps you from being flat on your back, which can be uncomfortable and is not recommended because it can put pressure on the vena cava.  I also sometimes sleep with my belly facing the straight/long part of the pillow.  The lower end wraps in between my legs far enough to provide back support in this position.The head part of the pillow is a good height, so you won't need an additional pillow for your head.  The curve provides a nice space for your shoulder when you're sleeping on your side.  I am 5'7&#34; and the pillow is long enough to support my head and then wrap all the way around, in between my legs and up under my belly.  I have a queen-size bed and my husband and my BFF pillow and I all fit fine in it.I have also found this pillow useful when sitting up in bed - you can curl it up behind you or wrap it around your waist (with an additional pillow behind your head) to provide support for your arms if you are reading, typing, etc.I will probably continue to use this after I have the baby.  It may prove to be useful for breastfeeding, although it is not as portable as a Boppy-style pillow.	
- 1	These worked fine until the handle broke off after three weeks of use.  I do not recommend these nipple brushes.	
- 1	My baby hated this from the beginning. I couldn't find a position where she wasn't curled up with her head pushed towards her belly and she didn't like being carried in that position. I figured maybe she was too small as a newborn (under 6 lbs.), so I waited until she was 10 lbs. but she still hates it because now it scrunches her up even more. The sling is hard to adjust, too, I could never figure out how tight or loose it's supposed to be. Frustratingly, the instruction booklet that comes with it is for the NON-ADJUSTABLE version of the sling. Why even bother then? There are no instructions for the adjustable sling. I'd give it one star, but I have hopes that I can use it as a sling-seat when the kid's big enough to be held on the hip, so I may edit my review when that time comes.	
1. 	My baby had a lot problems with the flow of milk which caused a lot of colic and sleepless nights.  I decided to try playtex drop in and all my problems seized.	
1. 	I just received this item in the mail. I purchsed the toddler size in the color stealth. I originally wanted the color ice but, I m glad I got Black instead. Especially since the cost for the color stealth was 13.00 cheaper than the ice color. ( I hate when that happens, its a color!! ) The product was very easy to add to my stroller. I have an Uppababy Vista. I had tried to read some previously written reviews to inquire some information about the fit because I was so worried that the bundle me wouldn't fit my stroller but IT FITS GREAT. It doesn't have a slot for the seat recline handle bar, but you can still recline the seat by using the handle bar with the bundle me over the handle. NO BIG DEAL. Uppa baby has their own version but its double the price. The bundle me is very soft, seems like it will wash well. Overall using this will benefit both me my son. Me, because I wont go nuts trying to keep a blanket on him. I dont have to worry about his blanket falling on the floor and getting dirty and wet in NYC slush ice or worst respending money on lost blankets. My son is guaranteed to be warm and dry. I definitely recommend.	
- 1	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.	
1. 	My daughter has the purple Twilight Turtle.  It is VERY cute.  She cuddles it during the day and has tea parties with it, and at night she puts it back on her dresser for bed.  It has three different color options for the stars on her ceiling, and I can set the timer to make sure it stays on long enough for her to fall asleep but not drain the batteries.  The stars and moon displayed are a muted, soothing tone, giving just enough light to soothe to sleep.  We go about three months on one set of batteries, and we use the turtle almost nightly.With the hard shell, it's a good toy to have on a dresser - it's not soft enough to snuggle in bed, but if set near the bed it projects stars across the entire ceiling. I also like that the buttons are big and spaced enough apart that they are easy for a child to operate and pick their own colors at night.This is not a light to leave on for the entire night, but it does a great job at soothing and I'm glad we have one!	
1. 	We've been using this (and several other Mustela products) on our twins since they were born and never had any reaction to it (they're 18 months). A little goes a long way. It's mild and i have never been bothered by the scent.	
- 1	If you're a first time mom you're probably going to want a bottle sterilizer.  They're suppose to be fast and convenient as opposed to the tedious process of boiling your baby's bottles and pacifiers in water for five minutes.  The reality is, a sterilizer really isn't necessary.  It can be nice to have one, but you don't NEED it.If you do decide that you want a sterilizer, I would not recommend this one.  For one, it's a pricey sterilizer which you will have to store somewhere.  I find the contraption to be rather bulky.  Even with ample countertop space in my kitchen, I'm not willing to sacrifice the amount of space that this sterilizer takes up.  As big as this sterilizer is, you can only fit a maximum of six Avent bottles, nipples, collars and caps in this device at one time.  If you have more than six bottles to run through this you'll have to do more than one cycle of sterilizing plus you'll have to wait for the heating element to cool before you can use it again.The sterilizer does complete the cycle in approximately seven minutes as promised.  That certainly is quicker than waiting for a big pot of water to boil on the stove, but it's not any more impressive than the microwave bottle sterilizers.Personally, I think Avent should stay away from electronic devices that heat things up.  Their bottle warmer performs badly, and this sterilizer worked for me one, and only one time.  I had to call customer service after the device died after the first use.  Fortunately, their customer service is great and they offered to send a new sterilizer out to me within 7-10 business days.  I'm still waiting on the replacement, but I don't have high expectations that the new one will be any better.If you are serious about getting a sterilizer, I'd strongly suggest you buy the Avent microwave sterilizer instead.  I happen to have one of those and I can fit just as many bottles in the microwave version as I can in the electric one.  Also, I can sterilize bottles in the microwave one in less time than the electric one requires.  And let's not forget that the microwave sterilizer costs considerably less money and takes up less space.Overall, I would not recommend the 4 in 1 electric steam sterilizer.  It's simply not worth the cost or the hassle of dealing with a poorly designed device.	
1. 	I was worried about buying this pillow as I have heard it's on the large side.  When I took it out of the box I was surprised at how large it was, but it doesn't take up a lot of space on our queen size bed with me laying with it. I am finding I fall asleep much faster with the pillow than I did without it.  I love being able to lean slightly so it feels like I'm laying on my back while I'm still mostly on my side.  It has take some of the pressure off of my hips while I sleep.  I love laying facing the long part of the pillow and away from it.  I have even caught my husband using it when I'm not! I can't wait to get the pillow broken in just a little more.  I look forward to using it with the different layouts they gave with the pillow!	
1. 	I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words Extra Soft on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.	
1. 	Really, it's quite simple.  Put it under your baby's crib sheet to elevate his/her head if he/she has a cough.  I do notice it helps quite a bit.  Combined with a little Baby Vicks on the feet, and the cough is well controlled!	
- 1	I got Philips Avent bottles for my newborn, so what is better than using the Philips Avent bottle brush to clean them? Right? Wrong!This brush is so inconvenient, and not practical.Save your money and just buy the good old fashioned bottle brush.	
1. 	My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!	
1. 	We love those bibs, use them daily, saves a lot of laundry/ stain treatments. We have two per kid so that we can clean it and hang it dry (dries fast) but still have one in reserve if it gets too messy and not dry in time ... also they are perfectly wipeable. The pack easily and fold together small so you can stack on in the diaper bag.I used to have to buy them individually at BabiesRus, the price here on amazon is so much better, you basically get one free. I have given them as gifts and everybody loves them. Was sad to see on the newest ones I ordered though that they are not made in the US anymore ...	
- 1	Pros: has a straw so that kids can drink while sitting up, even if they haven't mastered tipping the cup waaaaay back to let gravity do its thing.Cons: *takes a deep breath* Here we go...Leaks - These things leak. That's the one thing they're supposed to prevent, and they fail. They leak out the straw. They leak out the seal. They just leak.Liquid squirts - They don't have a air pressure relief hole, so as the contents of the cup warm up to room temp, expanding air pressure forces liquid back through the straw and out onto your coffee table. If you're unlucky enough to have closed the straw lid before the cup warmed up and then you flip the straw back into ready position, you get a nice 2-3 foot jet of whatever was in the cup. Awesome science lesson (Boyle's law)!Straw length - Too short. Lots of liquid remains in the bottom. If that's milk, then you throw away lots of sour milk remnants. It also insures that rather than drinking the cup dry, your child will have plenty of liquid to drizzle around the house, see above.I would really love these if they worked, but sadly they don't. I'm about to throw away two because I spend a huge part of my day mopping up milk dots from all over the house.	
- 1	The first one arrived damaged .. NOT damaged in the shipping ... obviously damaged and sent from the factory in an unsatisfactory condition. Amazon replaced it immediately! I love my Prime membership! The 2 table still has a couple of less than perfect spots but for the price I guess it's ok. Probably wouldn't but Graco again tho.	
- 1	I use Dr. Brown's Pacifiers without the ring on it so this clip does not work.  I will have to save it for another baby shower to re gift...	
1. 	We weren't sure what to expect with these but were pleasantly surprised. They are a bit bulky and take a big of getting used to, but our daughter won't be turning on the gas knobs on anytime soon!If you have a gas stove, buy these.	
1. 	I have used this product nearly every other day for over three months and it works well. I have not had a problem with it smelling or becoming moldy and I live in a very hot and humid climate. My only complaint is that I wish the part for my child's head was elevated a little more so water would not get in her ears. I could put less water in the tub but then she gets too cold too quickly.	
- 1	These burp cloths are very thick and soft, two layers of good terry cloth bound together by the print fabric trim. But unfortunately, the seams tore apart after one wash. So far, I've bought 4 products from Bebe au Lait - 2 packages of these burp cloths, one of theSimple by Bebe Au Lait Organic Burp Cloth Set 3-Pack, and theBebe au Lait Hooded Towel. Every single product had the seams tearing after one wash.Amazon's been great about refund/replacement, but still, what a hassle! If it happened once, or even twice, I might consider that a fluke. But all four products tore along the seams after the first wash. (One of the towels was torn out of the box.) In fact, Amazon.com sent me a replacement for the burp cloths, and that one tore, also.When it comes to sewing bindings onto terry cloth, this brand definitely has quality control problems. Other than the constant ripping, these are actually very nice - soft, thick, and the print fabrics are cute. My only other complaint would be that they are a little on the narrow side.* Edited to add: I recently bought another set of burp cloths from Bebe au Lait. There was a discount on a cute print, and I was wondering if maybe I just got a bad batch before. And guess what? One of the cloths ripped again in the first wash. This never happens to anything else I own, so I don't think there's a problem with my washer.So that's 5 terry cloth products I received so far from Bebe au Lait, and all 5 have ripped in the wash. It's downright comical.	
1. 	I have a 2.5 yr old and a 2m old. Wanted a better way of bathing my kids together without breaking my back of the baby in the bathtub. I LOVE THIS TUB! Its plastic so you can dry it off, nothing to get moldy. Easy to clean. My son also loves it. He is 3 1/2 months now and about 14lbs and we are still using it. Must have, esp if you have more than one child to bathe.	
1. 	This boppy is a must have for breastfeeding and tummy time! Highly recommend it!	
1. 	This changing pad is very soft. My baby boy has tinkled on it and it just beads up because of the kind of material, makes for easy clean up.	
- 1	These membranes do not stay flush enough against the valve to keep the seal, which means the pump won't work. I tried several of them, and only 1 consistently worked.  Buy the name brand version instead.	
- 1	I spent the extra money on this because I had the coordinating bed skirt, blanket, & pillow and I wanted my son's room to look nice and put-together. This dead way too loose on our standard-sized changing pad, though, and didn't look good at all. I returned it & got a Carter's cover in sage that coordinates well enough and looks much better overall.	
1. 	This was perfect for our needs. We needed something small and light-weight for quick trips to the store, restaurants and travel.If your baby falls asleep and you need to run an errand, no problem! Now that our son is too big for this I dread having to go to a store that isn't walking distance near nap time.If you want to go out to dinner and eat with two hands, just put your baby in this thing. Even if he's awake you can still talk to him and engage him.And for those airplane trips to introduce him to the family, you can use the stroller to carry the carseat and your baby through the airport.  (I would recommend making sure you have read the directions and done a trial run of using your carseat without the base before you go.)	
1. 	I live in a larger two-storey house, and with the birth of our first baby, I quickly got tired of running upstairs (where both laundry and nursery are located) to bring up every pice of soiled clothing or spit-up rag throughout the day. We converted a small room on the main floor for baby usage, and have a changing table, etc., located there (more convenient). I wanted a hamper to use so I wasn't constantly running upstairs, or worse- leaving a pile of dirty clothing etc. on the stairs waiting to go up to the laundry. I found this, was very happy with the price, and was surprised how quickly it arrived. It is super light-weight, so I can scoop up any baby items on the main floor and bring them upstairs when I clean up for the night, and then toss it over our balcony back to the main floor. It washes well in my opinion - I throw it in the load once a week - and it air dries well. I plan to use it for extra toy storage once we move past the soil-everything-you-wear stage, but our baby is still on 4 1/2 months old, and so between spit up, drool, and parental lack-of-skill with diaper changes this is quite useful as a hamper for us for now.	
1. 	As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face.	
1. 	We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag). We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags. It's a deal and works great. I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.	
1. 	I bought this for my 6-month-old daughter (she is in the 50th percentile for height and weight). The chair came in a HUGE box and was very easy to assemble--it was basically 3 pieces you insert one into the other and then attach 8 bolts. It took me less than 10 minutes by myself. I am 5'7 and it comes almost high enough that I could stand and feed her comfortably (but not quite...I wish it came up another 6 inches but then it'd probably be unstable). I have Pergo floors and was able to roll it around easily. I didn't expect the brake to work after reading all the other reviews, maybe they've fixed it because it doesn't budge when the brake is engaged, even when my daughter rocks around. I went with the orange seat pad after reading about spaghetti and carrot stains, so far it still looks new. I highly recommend the orange! The pneumatic lift is fun, it does make the chair heavy but I don't plan on lifting it. The tray snaps in and out with one hand easily (they must have updated this since the older reviews too). It is smaller than other high chairs but seems big enough so far. The plastic covers are great--one is covered with a huge sticker when it arrives, and doesn't come off easily. I used a blow drier, though, and it came off without leaving residue. Boon should really think about doing something other than a sticker there...we already bought the chair, we don't need the advertising! The reason I give it 4 stars is the harness system doesn't fit my daughter well. I made it as tight as it could go, but it's still VERY loose over her shoulders. However, this isn't a carseat, it's a highchair. Maybe it doesn't have to be so snug. It would make me feel better though. Once the tray is in I don't see how she could fall out. Finally, the chair looks great in our house and we get compliments on it. I'm actually proud of the high chair! I love that it will hold her up to 50lbs and is so easy to clean. I would recommend this to my friends.	
1. 	we actually use this to barricade our entertainment center. theres lots of expensive things make it up and my 1 year old seems to be attacted to that. this playard works perfectly.	
1. 	I purchased this pump before I had my duaghter. It was great, expect you have to lean forward in order for the milk to collect in the bottles, otherwise is just flows down you chest. But I'm sure other pumps have this same problem. Otherwise it was very comfortable and easy to use. I purchased the soft cups off the website, which are more comfortable han the hard plastic dups that come with the machine.	
- 1	Bought these because my boy has acid reflux and is supposed to eat upright.  I was hopful they would work well.  However they leak.  No matter what I tried they leaked.  Had others try them for me, they leaked for them.  They are not worth the money, I won't even attempt to sell them at a yard sale because I dont want to burden anyone with the frustration of a leaky bottle.  DO NOT BUY.	
- 1	I was very excited to give this product a try but it arrived damaged. The plastic clip was broken. The box it arrived in was in perfect condition so it must have been damaged prior to packaging... I did re-order but I hope this isn't a sign of being made out of cheap material!	
1. 	I was so happy that there were smaller size breastshields out there. I am on the smaller end (A cup before pregnancy), and the pictures in the Medela instruction booklet seemed to indicate that the included medium breastshields with my pump were too big for me. I was getting decent output, but thought it was worth the 12 bucks to try a smaller breastshield for comfort. Have used these smaller shields ever since I received them. They are very comfortable and I've had no problem with output either. No problem with fit with the connectors that came with my PISA. Just ordered another set as a spare. Concur with an earlier review that the shipping isn't lightning fast, but it does arrive within the time window promised. Put in the order soon if you are in a time crunch with pumping - it's worth a shot.	
- 1	The other plastic Madela products that I own (breast pump attachments and bottles) use a # 5 plastic but these bottles use #7, which has been identified as potentially harmful.  The Natural Resources Defense Council and other organizations recommend avoiding using plastic bottles labeled with 3, 6, and 7 ([...] I ended up getting rid of these bottles after using them.	
- 1	We bought it for our newborn, and love it! We know that the water temperature is good for him, know that it's the same as the last time he had bath. Recently he discovered this cute toy, so he is playing with it while bathing. The only problem I have with it is that often it wouldn't turn off automatically when I pull it out of water. It takes a fair amount of shaking and then waiting for a few minutes (as long as 10 once!) for it to turn off! If not for this complaint this thermometer turtle would've gotten 5 stars.UPDATE: about 7 months of regular use, now the thermometer stopped showing some of the digits, so it is pretty useless. It always collected quite a bt of water and had issues with turning itself off. Not sure if we got a lemon, or they are not good quality. We are getting a different product now	
1. 	We got an X-Large for our 10-month, and he is kind of swimming it, but that's not a problem, for it's like a blanket.  Our little guy likes to pull his socks off, and he likes to kick his covers off.  This remedies both, yet he can still move all around in his crib.  These are perfect.  So glad we got them!	
1. 	I wish I had bought this much sooner, but once I finally caved, I definitely think it helped my son gain the confidence to walk independently. It was barely used, though, so we're returning it. One thing to note: it's pretty small. We used it when my son was 16 months and it didn't quite fit around the chest (the buckles helped), and he's pretty average in size. I think this is a great product for a baby or toddler who is almost walking (cruising and using push toys) but not quite ready to be on their own. The only thing is that it helps so much you won't get much use out of it!	
1. 	We love this gate and have been using it for nearly 2 years now.  Exactly what we were looking for and blends in with our decor perfectly.	
1. 	This is a nice option for those without electricity or if you want a silent pump. It took me 30 mins to pump 3 oz. With the electric version it takes me 15 mins. Would definitely recommend to all if you are looking for a hand pump.	
- 1	I LOVED this product, while it worked. After a few months, the projection on the ceiling stopped working and another month later t he noise started making weird sounds. So I got maybe 3.5 months use out of it. Not worth the money for that short of a period.	
1. 	I am happy to report that after a year of use, these sheets have not frayed, lost any elasticity, shrunk, or faded.  They're very soft and fit our Sealy Ultra Rest mattress perfectly.  Just ordered a couple more colors and could not be happier.	
1. 	This turtle has been a lifesaver! I was trying to break my 18-month-old of her pacifier, and nights were not going well at all. After a couple of rough nights I showed her this thing, and she has been attached ever since. She was immediately entranced by the stars, and she snuggled with it right up against her nose so she could get a close look. She was in the middle of learning her colors so she likes to switch the colors and tell me what they are. She ends up putting the turtle in the corner of her crib and looking up at the stars until she falls asleep. No more crying for Pa-Pa (her pacifier). Now all she cares about it Kur-kle (turtle). So glad I got this thing!	
1. 	This was the first sippy cup we bought for our baby a few months ago. He figured it out pretty quickly. It's the only one he consistently DRINKS out of (as opposed to just playing with). He does get a lot of joy banging it on the high chair too!	
1. 	Maybe this will be better come warmer weather but the plush sheet set we got for the co sleeper is much nicer so we use that much more often.  Nothing wrong with this and I imagine in the summer this will be used much more but compared to the plush it is just sort of &#34;bleh&#34;	
1. 	I like these sheets a lot, even though I'm giving them only 4 stars.  I'd give another half-star if that were an option.  The reason I took away a star is that when washed and dried or slept on, these sheets look like paper that you've wadded up and then tried to flatten out by hand.  In other words, they really need to be ironed in order to look their best.  Nothing wrong with that, but the simple fact that I'm buying toddler sheets suggests that I don't have time to wield an iron if I don't have to.  That isn't being a Mommy Martyr.  It's just stating a fact.  I'm not wasting time ironing sheets when I can spend it playing with the toddler who uses these sheets.  Also, the pillow case is more like a sham-pillow case (you put the pillow in through the back instead of the top).  No turning the pillow over for the cool side.  Maybe toddlers don't do that, anyway.  That's just a mention.  That wasn't enough to dock a star.Now on to what makes these sheets pretty darned awesome: there's the bottom sheet that's fitted, which is expected.  But then, the TOP SHEET has a fitted pocket, so you don't have to do hospital corners!  That's a HUGE deal when you're dealing with a toddler bed that has rails or bars on two of the three sides down at the foot.  That genius pocket keeps the top sheet right the heck in place, no matter how thrashy my daughter is in her sleep!Where do I have to go to get that fitted pocket on top sheets in twin and big-people bed sizes?  It's just brilliant, and makes this sheet set worth it!	
1. 	I purchased this monitor after my safety 1st monitor stopped working (after using it since 2000).  This monitor does the job that it's suppose to do.  I love the light feature better than anything else.  It let's me know if my baby is crying without having to turn the volume up all the way.  That's a great feature to have.  I have not had a static problem and haven't had to switch the channels very often.	
1. 	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!	
- 1	I didn't particularly like this carrier and returned it. It's rather complicated to use and once I would figure it out and place my son in it, I didn't feel very confidant that he was secure. Reading other reviews however it seems like many people love it so perhaps it has to do something with my large boobs at the moment? I'm currently a 38F due to breast feeding. I got a Baby Bjorn instead and absolutely love it.	
1. 	I was worried about buying this pillow as I have heard it's on the large side.  When I took it out of the box I was surprised at how large it was, but it doesn't take up a lot of space on our queen size bed with me laying with it. I am finding I fall asleep much faster with the pillow than I did without it.  I love being able to lean slightly so it feels like I'm laying on my back while I'm still mostly on my side.  It has take some of the pressure off of my hips while I sleep.  I love laying facing the long part of the pillow and away from it.  I have even caught my husband using it when I'm not! I can't wait to get the pillow broken in just a little more.  I look forward to using it with the different layouts they gave with the pillow!	
- 1	Fits but too hard.	
1. 	This has held up to two kids over three years time, and it works just fine.  The kids loved playing in it. Lots of lights and toys to distract them.  Over time, I've added some more toys to it to get some more playtime so I have a few moments to myself to have some coffee!	
1. 	Thanks to other reviewers posting tips on how to get the best results this kit is great! Tried the given instructions' way and the results weren't so great. I'm no chemist so I don't know if it has anything to do with temperature or altitude. However, following users tips fixed the problem.For us the biggest issue was water. One reviewer suggested using half the water indicated. We had to use about 3/4 for optimal results. Also like suggested, keep stirring when water rises to the top during multiple handprint attempts. This helps keep the consistency right and make followup attempts easier.	
1. 	We just purchased this gate to restrict our dog to the kitchen while we are out.  We had hesitated to buy a gate because gates wide enough for our opening are not cheap, but from what I can tell about the quality of this gate, we should get our moneys worth.  The gate feels like it is good quality and looks nice enough.  It was easy to install, my husband's assistance made it easier but it can be done with one person.  I like that it can be left open so that we (and the dog) can move freely between the rooms when we don't need to restrict her.  The latch requires two steps to open it - pull to the side and then lift a lever up.  This can be done with one hand, although you need a strong hand.  The latch is the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5.  You can just not use the pull to the side part of the latch - therefore, you just lift up the lever to open and close the gate.  This is great for our current use of the gate, but when our baby gets older, we are probably going to need it to be a little more secure than that.  This just adds another step to opening and closing the gate - pull the latch to the side before opening, and press the lever down firmly after closing.  It is not a big deal, but I can imagine it would be easy to forget when chasing after a toddler.  The other gate we own self-latches, which is convenient.  This gate also only opens one direction.It is worth mentioning that our 55 lb dog does not attempt to jump over, push over, or otherwise get through either gate, so the strength of the latches have not really been tested.  To the user who commented that a strong toddler could pull the gate over, it does come with cups to install the gate to the wall.  I have not tried them but they may be worth trying to help with that problem.	
1. 	These are great to have at work or on the go when you can't wash the pump parts right away! That's what they're for and they have given us no problems.	
1. 	This is a great product for helping infants to sleep in cool/cold weather! I like the fleece ones since they aren't as stretchy (and escapable) as the knit swaddlers and they are toasty warm. We used one of these fleece swaddlers almost nightly from month 2-month 4 to help our daughter sleep.	
- 1	This didnt last two weeks and it scratched my bottles which I was so upset I threw it out! Very poorly made and poor quality	
1. 	This allowed me to forget about having to buy a big winter snowsuit for a new baby.  It was easy to wash, easy to attach to the infant carrier, and warm enough for the baby.  The only downfall is that it should have fabric that can wrap around the top and cover the top of the baby's head for added protection from the elements.  A great invention!	
- 1	The nipple pours too fast for my 2 month old. I should have researched to see if these bottles had slow flow nipples before buying, however, I found that the Tommy Tippee website doesn't have any information about the flow of their nipples or if they even offer a slow flow.  Very disappointed as now I cannot return the bottles since I've used one of them.	
- 1	Didn't work as I expected. It it similar to the Moby wrap (in style) but only half as wide. I used it twice. The material is also like old gym uniform, that shiny stuff.	
1. 	These things hold up well and never seem to cause my wife any discomfort.  The biggest complaint we have with these are they they diappear like socks would.  I highly recommend getting more than you think you will need so that when they 'go missing' you still have a pair or two handy.  I recently found some stuck to the inside of one of my shirts, and another hidden in some boxers after being laundered.  Blame static, but, its hard to find them when you really need them.  Prepare accordingly!	
1. 	I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well.  My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again.  They are large with good cushion and will do its job.  The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months, they are still there on all three corners.  I would recommend but of course, if your child is persistent, I am sure he/she would get it off eventually. So far, so good.	
1. 	We love this whole kit. It has everything. When my son takes night time baths we use the lavender soap and boy is he ready for bed when we get him out. The carry case is also a great. We take it on trips with us and we carry his basic shampoo that came with the kit, toys, towels, washcloths and such and there is still room for more!!! The lotion is great and very thick which helps keep babies skin ever so soft after bath time, and the moisturizing stick is fantastic for getting a dry patch here and there. We keep it in the diaper bag. Great set for any parent, a must have for first time parents.update: my son is now 9.5 mths old and we have yet to even finish  our second bottle of wash. Everything except the lotion and 1.5 bottles of baby wash we still have plenty of. This gift set is fantastic, talk about the gift that keeps giving. At this rate we will not need to buy shampoo/body wash until after his first birthday!!	
- 1	Save yourself the $4 for this product and buy the version that has the flexible strap.  This one has a hard/non bending strap between the 2 sticky parts that connect to either side of your appliance door.  The strap only comes out of the lock by pulling it out.  This works fine when you are holding it.  When you actually attach it to an appliance, put the strap in the lock and then hold the unlock button while opening the door, the strap forcefully flies out, but works.  The issue really comes when you try to close the appliance door and put the strap back in the lock area.  You cannot get the strap in since it does not have any bend to it and you cannot move the strap side of the latch away from the lock side of the latch since they are both stationary stuck to the appliance.  I took it right off before it really adhered and threw it out.  Waste of money.  I will try out the flexible strap version of this instead and hope it works -( [...] ).	
1. 	When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off.	
1. 	My son needed more freedom but our living room was not baby friendly.  I had two choices - get rid of my glass top tables and take everything down or buy this gate...I went with the gate!  I purchased this as well as the extension.  I did move the coffee table and setup it up in the middle of the room.  My son was so happy!  He had his own space with his own toys and could be around everyone else without getting in trouble.  It was easy to setup (already comes assembled) and the extensions attached without a headache.  It is very durable, very sturdy, and kid friendly.  We are using it now to protect the Christmas tree since our son is old enough to walk and move around the house on his own so it has continued use after your child outgrows it.	
- 1	I purchased this on Amazon and it broke with the first use. The center piece that combines the red part broke and ended up in the shape of a circle rather than a figure 8. My child had little or no interest in this toy.	
- 1	I bought these and I was actually disapointed because I love ergo...I thought there were going to be something really cool and that wouldnt get wet...pretty much all this is a  shoulder strap pad...save your self $10 and go buy some car seat shoulder strap pads from walmart.	
1. 	We bought these for the play room - and we're now buying more for the rest of the house.  I'm way too forgetful of a person to always plug those plastic ones back into the outlet after using it - so then that means there's not only an open outlet, but something that my son is immediately interested in chewing.  I only wish I could find this product in a quad option!!!  We have 2 of those in the playroom...it would be so much nicer to just have these on there!!	
1. 	These blocks are well made and beautiful.  They're a nice size for my 8 month old to be able to grab and play with.  They're a very simple toy but they can be used in so many ways.  I think I have as much fun with them as my daughter!	
- 1	My daughter was small, but this really seemed very cumbersome to use.  Didn't really see the need for this-a much better buy that my mother insisted on was the harness pillow for support.	
1. 	These are perfect for the job.  Highly absorbent and prevents &#34;leak through.&#34;  Also better for the breast since some silicone pads just occlude the breast and have been linked with increased instances of mastitis.  Keeping is simple over here with these cotton nursing pads.	
1. 	I used this in conjunction with the CARES harness for my 3 year old to be able to sleep in comfort on a flight from the US to Asia.  It worked wonders; with the head support, he was able to take multiple naps on the 18+ hour journey each way, and my husband and I got some rest.  Unlike most head/neck pillows, this one has no bulk behind the neck, so the head isn't pushed forward in an uncomfortable way.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	We gave these to our 9-month-old twins as their first utensil, and were very disappointed in the results.  Whatever food you are serving has to be JUST the right consistency - too thin and it just slides off the dipper, too thick and it won't stick to it.  Our kids did like to mimic Mommy and Daddy using utensils, and they would practice eating with these, but they could have done just as well with a regular baby spoon.  Wouldn't waste your money on this intro utensil.  Really likeBoon Benders - Adaptable Utensils in Orange/Blueas introductory spoon and fork.	
1. 	Had this thing for a few years and it still works great.  My 5 year old won't go to bed without it on.  This literally saved bedtime.  She doesn't get up 4-5 times every night before she goes to sleep now.	
- 1	It's a good sippy cup, but you really have to bite down on the straw good to get any liquid out.But, at the same rate, that's it's job, so I guess it isn't all bad.	
- 1	I love love love the huge basket on my stroller... and hate hate hate all the leaves and dirt that fall into it when I stroll!  I walk the dog daily so this stroller sees the outdoors A LOT.  And I hate how leaves and debris fly and drop into the basket.  I'm OCD and would prefer the basket to be clean!  Since this was the only option available... and I am thankful that Baby Jogger even created it... I bought it but it definitely needs improvement!1. the clasps... they come off easily!  One in particular... is like too tight or something because it will snap off as soon as I clip it on.  SOOOO ANNOYING.  I have been meaning to contact Baby Jogger for a replacement... but with a baby... who has the time?  I am finally sitting down to write a bunch of Amazon reviews now!  The two on the very front tend to come off when I fold the stroller up.  So, if I want to go somewhere and put the stroller in my car, I have to take the entire cover off first (because it will come off anyways).  Another major annoyance.2. there are 6 clasps.  2 in the very front, 2 on the sides and 2 in the back.  The 2 on the sides are attached very low on the bar.  This creates a sagging mid-section.  I really wished they had 4 clasps on the sides and put the other 2 higher up (close to where you would attach the seat).  Because of the sag that the material creates, leaves and debris will just sit in the middle of the canopy.  How ugly, dirty and gross!3. I think instead of clasps, it would be great if they could create some sort of zipper attachment to attach it to the frame.  This way, it would be completely enclosing the basket and would allow you to access the basket a whole lot easier.  Perhaps 2-3 zippers?  One in the back, side and front to allow you to access the basket from all sides.  Accessing anything inside the basket via undoing a clasp is VERY ANNOYING because you have to fumble and feel for the clasp and fumble with snapping it back on (and back on again and again) because they pop off so easily.4. I do like how CHEAP it is since Baby Jogger sells their other accessories at ridiculously HIGH prices! =)Because it is so annoying to access stuff inside the basket with the cover on, I mainly use this to keep the basket clean when I'm strolling outdoors with the dog.  If I plan on going somewhere with the baby, I leave the cover off since I need to put the diaper bag, etc. in there.I hope Baby Jogger reads these reviews and will listen to customer feedback and update their design!	
- 1	The light doesn't fit well in the socket, it lists outward and feels loose. There is nearly no light from it at all.  You assume the light blue center would glow, otherwise, where would the light come from?  but it doesn't, at all.	
1. 	We use this on all of our outings with our 18 month old.  I love the no spill an ease of use for my little one.	
1. 	Oh my God! I love these. My baby is almost 8 months and I still use them. I have been pulling buggers out of his nose with these since he has a newborn. Definitely a great buy!	
1. 	Revived this has a gift for our daughter, loved them so much, I purchased sets for two other people.  Both sides are cloth with the plastic in the middle	
- 1	Well these clips are way to hard to undo and cause much fuss. Also the glue on these are just faulty! Once my son figured out that if he just grabs the straps and pulls down he pulls it right off the drawers and it's rendered useless! Great Idea poor craftsmanship	
1. 	If I had known I would've just used this instead of a high chair because this is all plastic and it's easy to clean. I used it since he could sit up and he's 28 months now and he's still using it.	
- 1	I don't really like these dishwasher baskets. I also have the munchkin brand, and it is much sturdier. The Lion baskets are not as sturdy, they are flimsy and don't close easily due to the flimsy quality. I don't even use these anymore because the munchkin is so much better.	
1. 	While fussy to install, this product has stuck to the windows flawlessly for the past year.  It has stood up to the occasional accidental rolling down of the window without a hitch.  It is relatively dark, and increases a little one's comfort in all but direct sun.	
- 1	Unfortunately this bowl never worked for us.  I purchased it with the matching bendy fork/ spoon duo and was super excited to have a cute set for my little guy.  The suction definitely did not stick and the lip to catch stray food annoyed my little guy more than anything.  We've probably used this bowl less than 5 times since it has not worked for us ... a better suction alternative has been the Lil 'Diner suction device.  I would highly recommend that product.  The suction is not 100% kid proof but it comes pretty close.  I often have to tug and tug to get it undone :)	
- 1	I prefer the gates that have those handles which go under the mattress rather than straps.  The straps were difficult to keep in place while putting the mattress back on box spring.  Also, it's extremely difficult to take down.  Perhaps mine is stuck.  Have no been able to take the side down so it remains up and it looks sloppy.  It also doesn't stay up straight.  One side bends inward and takes up sleeping space for my child.	
1. 	Bought this for my daughter's first birthday.  Nice educational toy and good for her Physical and occupational therapy as well.  I recommend to others.  Everything fits nicely inside the cake.  My only surprise was how small it is.  It's smaller than I had assumed it was.	
1. 	I love that this is a simple visual mobile, no noise, no nothing. I hung it using an eye hook in the ceiling above the crib - had to add a chain to make it hang low enough.	
1. 	These are the same as the ones that came with my pump in style pump.  The shipping took a bit longer than I thought, but the product is fine.	
- 1	The tray was hard to get lined up and it did not work well to feed my kids with.  I ended up selling it at a garage sale	
- 1	I bought this for my eight month old who was just starting to resist bedtime in hopes it would help.  The first time we used it she was mesmerized and it worked like a charm.  Second time it semi captured her attention with a little help from mommy.  By the third time the moving frog had begun to squeak so that wasn't exactly soothing and my baby was bored with it.  Gave it one more try just in case and the squeaking was still there.  Needless to say I returned it.  Also, the light was pretty bright.  When I would first turn it on, my baby would squint from the light.  And the timer is not 18 minutes!  It's more like 5-6 minutes like other reviews said.  Not worth the forty dollars in my opinion.	
- 1	I ordered these as my nipples were sore and I wanted a soft breast pad.  After washing, these are not soft.  I prefer my cotton breast pads.  Also, the care for these involve many steps and not worth the effort.  I bought more cotton pads to replace these.  They also can stick to your nipple if your nipple is slightly damp and can leave fuzz.	
- 1	This cover is an oversized piece of thick plastic that you have to wrap like a present around your mattress with two ends of weak tape. It is hard to get tight and doesn't overlap for a firm fit. It makes me more nervous than it's claims to prevent SIDS and has been very frustrating. It makes it difficult to change the sheets, etc. I would not recommend this cover nor would i purchase one again.	
- 1	Firstly, the 2 stars is for good use of it while it lasted as well as just the general look of the thing.So we got this before my baby was born in October but didn't have a need for it right away so it just sat there save for a few uses here and there. She enjoyed cooler bottles just after she was born anyway.I found it fast enough to suit my needs, it's straight forward, simple, stylish... and when I'm exhausted in the middle of the night, it's so much more convenient to just pop the bottle in, turn the timer on and relax with the fussy baby while it warms. Those were the good things.After we moved last month, we started using it all the time because of how much colder it was out here. The warm bottles helped to keep her whole body warm and so I loved this warmer just for that. Unfortunately, after just over ONE MONTH of use, it's shot. The timer just doesn't work anymore. I can turn the dial and it will fill and warm, but will just stay that way indefinitely... not ticking, no anything. Maybe a new knob would fix it (if it was the knob then I'd be looking at one more month of use before that one dies too?), but after this I'd rather just find another warmer. I was using it multiple times a day (formula fed baby with pre-made bottles from the fridge), but I'd think that something made to warm bottles would have more stamina than this, not to mention the price. You'd think for the price, it'd be a lot better quality but I just haven't found that to be the case. We've stopped using it as it may as well just be a bowl of water.If you just use a warmer every now and then, then this would still be an alright choice... but not for me, not anymore.	
1. 	Fall and spring are wet weather months for outdoor sports, and this blanket has kept us dry in downpours and snow/icy weather during many, many soccer games.  We sit on it, or layer it as a protective shield when there is heavy precipitation. Most recently the little siblings forgot their jacket during an especially windy and cold playoff game, so we built a fortress of blankets, and huddled together under this... almost forgot it was cold out!	
- 1	I have tried 4 other brands and these are the worst. I haven't had any problems with leakage (with this or any other brand) but after 3-4 washes the Medela pads are so wrinkled and have lost their shape that I can't wear them with anything without them showing through. I would not recommend these unless you were going to hand wash them - but who has time with a new babe! Especially, when the other brands are holding up just fine after the same number of washes.	
1. 	So easy to use and not as much clean-up afterward. Just pop liner in the bottle, add water and powdered formula, shake and you are good to go.	
1. 	Product seems to be good for now, but already seems to be losing air. Doesn't seem like it will hold up to multiple children, but wouldnt hesitate to buy another one for second child.	
- 1	It is both too long, too bulky, and too filled. I hated and could not get comfortable on this. Would not recommend	
1. 	I love this seat - I was looking for a booster that was soft to replace the hard plastic booster we had been using (but my toddler ultimately rejected).  That booster was strapped onto the chair, so I was concerned about the safety of a seat that was not secured with straps.  This seat grips the chair really well, and has only tipped once or twice as my daughter is climbing in.  Both times she didn't have far to fall, and has learned to grab the back of the chair and the table when climbing up instead of the booster.  She also likes sitting in it because it is comfortable and the color is fun.  We've been using it since before my toddler turned 2, and she is nearly 3 now.Many reviewers have mentioned the difficulty of cleaning this seat.  Yes, it is difficult to wipe clean.  Maybe impossible.  But it's really easy to clean up if you take it over to the sink and use a little dish soap and water to scrub the seat and sides.  It did stain (a little) from some spaghetti sauce, which will never come out, but overall it still looks really nice in the kitchen.  The foam has not started to disintegrate a year later and the color has not faded.  Great product!	
- 1	I actually like the materials of this product and the fact that the cap is attached.  However, because of the prduct design, they waste at least an ounce (of the 4 total it will hold) is left in the pouch.  The fill opening in the top of the pouch is made of a solid material and does not allow for the food to be sqeezed out.  Even my 3-year-old can't suck hard enough to get all of the food out of it.  It ends up wasting about a fourth of what you put in.	
- 1	This was by far the worst purchase I have made. These are not balls, a ball has bounce and these do not bounce at all. When you throw them they just fall flat and their only purpose is texture. Its better to buy a textured book instead. My kids don't even bother with these balls because they do not bounce. I don't recommend these products.	
- 1	I am sure many people may like this item but I didn't like it. I didn't feel secure with my baby in it and it was a pain to put together. I didn't give it much time or effort though so it may work for some. I prefer a front baby carrier instead.	
- 1	I bought these for my 2 month old to try. She didn't seem very thrilled with them. As a matter of fact, she hardly noticed them. I was not thrilled because they didn't fit very well. They were tight on the elastic ankle part but were very loose on her foot.	
- 1	Was sent in the wrong color. Was an orange background with green eggs and ham print on it, but not as cute as the green one pictured. It also stated lead safe vs. lead free. When I checked the bumkins website, the current bibs for sale say lead free which makes me think this is an older model and that it may not be to the most updated safety standards despite and another reviewer stating that the lead safe were the newer ones.	
1. 	I use these bags and until now have not had any problems... they store the milk very well and do not spill nor open in the freezer. The only thing i would change is that they do not measure the amount of milk well, so instead of pumping directly to the bags i prefer to pump into the bottles and then pour to the bags so that i can see in the bottles how much i am pumping and storing in each bag.  The measurement in the bag is always off even when you expand it and place it upwards on a flat surface.	
1. 	These Medela Quick clean wipes are so wonderful for pumping on the road! I can use them to clean up all my parts if no water is available, and I can use them to wash my hands before pumping if I need to, also. They have come in really handy!	
1. 	I have been practicing EC with me 2 month old, and she went on this the first time I tried! Its easy to dump it into the toilet and rinse in the bathroom sink (the one we don't use, hah). Great little potty for introducing the concept of going potty outside a diaper early on. It's small because it's meant for early use.	
- 1	I always felt like the &#34;bad mom&#34; for only having an audio baby monitor (yes, I'm being a bit dramatic) and I did see a lot of benefit in having a video system.  So my husband hooked up a basic security camera to connect to the computers and voila!His redneck system is superior to this.  For despite the attractive camera and handheld monitor this is less than decent and drowning in its perk of dual-system viewing.  So I can watch Baby on the monitor and/or my phone.  I'd trade in one or the other for better quality.I was excited to get this all set up. I tore open the box, plugged in the parts, and went to the Google store to download... an app that was rated with 2 stars.  Hmm.  I began to panic, then thought &#34;people can be harsh critics.&#34;  I continued with set-up.  Connecting to the internet took forever and the connection, perfectly fine on all other household devices, was shaky at best.Okay, so the viewing app wasn't all it's cracked up to be with its bad imaging and whatnot.  What about the monitor it came with?  Surely that will work.  No, I wasn't impressed.  Horrible imaging and there always seemed to be a delay.I was happy sticking with the sound only.  Video-wise, no matter the device, I found myself frustrated and fiddling much too hard with the system.It's an attractive-looking system and the internet plus monitor option seems handy, but do you really need both?  Here, the idea fails.	
- 1	After reading all the reviews, I decided to try the product anyway. The sound of the beep doesn't bother me at all, but then again my bedroom is fairly removed from the kitchen. The problem I have with this product is that it really overheats the bottle! Even though I followed the guidelines and instructions, the milk was always waaay too hot, and I ended up needing to cool it on ice.  In other words, it would have taken just as much time to just float the bottle in a thermos of hot water. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.	
- 1	My one year old had no trouble figuring it out. It's neither sturdy nor intelligent in its design. I could not recommend it for the purpose it's being sold.	
- 1	I was so excited to see this product, as it's a better option than the disposable placemats for us.  However, I've probably tried to use them 10 times and they have only stuck to the table or counter 1-2 times.  In the times they do stick, the suction cups often pop off after a while, and certainly can't hold up to our kids pulling on them.  They also have creases on each side and on the top, and the placemat often rolls in on itself while using.  The reason I even gave them two stars is that I still find it somewhat better than the disposable option and there just isn't really anything else out there that we've found.  Great idea, poor suction cups.	
1. 	The cap does what it should, but it took a very long time to get here.  I'm a little spoiled by Prime, but it took well over a week.	
- 1	These are pretty overpriced for the amount that you get.  If you are looking to avoid chemicals in your baby wipes, Whole Foods' 365 Brand wipes are a much better bet.  Also these smell kind of weird.	
- 1	DISCLAIMER: my review is based on being a cloth diaper user, which means it can't possibly get a good rating on the mere fact that it simply cannot even be used with cloth diapers. it may however be amazing for disposable diapers.most sites and all the best reviews seem to turn up this old model of the diaper champ as the best pail out there, so of course i got it and was super excited, but cloth diaperers beware: this pail WILL NOT work for cloth, as it gets stuck in the mechanism when you flip it. no matter how hard i tried and how strategic i balled up that diaper, it would not fall through into the bucket and got stuck every single time. i was extremely disappointed. NOTE: i'm a two-system pre-fold cloth diaperer, not an all-in-one one-system user, meaning the cloth piece is separate from the cover, and therefore cannot be taped closed, since it's just a loose piece of fabric. if you're an AIO'er (ie g-diaper, etc), then you can absolutely still use this pail since the cover stays on the cloth and can therefore wrap up the fabric piece and seal shut before throwing in.so a bit of extra help to you cloth diaperers out there, don't want to leave you hanging.... after figuring that out, i was back on the hunt and the diaper dekor seems to be the closest second for cloth diaper users. may even be better... the design makes that pail hold a much higher capacity than this diaper champ, and most others i've seen out there, without making the actual size of the pail larger (if that makes sense). basically, there isn't a bulky mechanism that takes up space inside, leaving there more room for diapers. with this diaper champ, the flip mechanism takes up a SIGNIFICANT amount of space on the inside, leaving there very little room for diapers (which i guess if you're a disposable diaperer, is not a big deal because you're changing out the bag very frequently, but for a cloth diaperer using a weekly service [i'm a new yorker and don't have my own washer/dryer], there's absolutely no way a weeks' worth of diapers would fit in this diaper champ). i do agree that not having to use a special bag for this pail is a huge bonus, but that perk also exists for the dekor (and bonus: the dekor's design allows you to cut the bag to whatever size you'd like, making it that much more economical, even with the made-for liners if you do choose to use them. i'm going to use a hamper liner though, which fits perfectly).last note, to the it smells complainers: non-breastmilk poop smells, period. it's a diaper pail, not a miracle can. plus, human waste is illegal to dispose of, so you should be dumping solid poops into the toilet in the first place, regardless that you're using disposable diapers, then you won't be dealing with such ferocious smells in the second place.	
1. 	Great start up set. This very clever design addresses the problems associated with improper feeding techniques. Of course, some babies are just more sensitive and will suffer symptoms even with proper techniques when an inferior bottle designs is used. This bottle is going to make life alot easier for Parents and baby. Thank you Playtex for going the extra mile.	
1. 	My husband is not a big fan of putting together furniture, but this crib was very easy to assemble :-) And it looks gorgeous, we get so many compliments! The best: this crib is toxin-free!!! So far this crib was the only one with a finish that didn't have any toxins in it.	
1. 	Nice piece of equipment. Make the pumping experience way better. Mobility means a lot when you need to pump regularly but don't want to stay home all the time.	
1. 	I really like this stuff BUT my husband has had issues with the bottles leaking, the nipples get tweaked to one side a bit while feeding and then spill out all over the place. So be careful and make sure it's centered perfectly the more you use it. However, everything is easy to wash by hand AND everything is dishwasher safe. The bags are great and super easy to use, and great for freezing milk. Plus everything shows measurements clearly so it's nice to know how much you're pumping/producing. I used it early on to tell how much milk I was producing and make it so that I didn't have to breast feed in public and it was super nice. The bottles are a great size for going out somewhere for the day, and fit comfortably and easily in the diaper bags I've used.	
- 1	so pissed. my son will be here in a few weeks and my hubby was putting it together and two of the bars are messed up . now we need to contact graco to get two new ones so we can set it up. paid over 100 and it comes broken. thank you!	
1. 	I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all.	
- 1	I love the Halo sleep sacks and we also had a Summer Infant sleep sack that we loved. I bought this for a friend and was disappointed that it was one piece. It can only be used with the swaddle part and it's a half sack for just the lower part of the body, so if your baby ends up not wanting to be swaddled (like mine), you won't be able to use this sleep sack.Spend the money on a Halo sleep sack with the removable swaddle!	
- 1	This the teether is cute but too big! I bought these for my three month old son who started to teething at 2 months in hopes these keys would help him ease his pain.  He hates them.  He loves toys but this one totally unintrests him. He gets mad if I try to show him that he can put the Keys in his mouth.  The fews times he has tried he looks uncomfortable because of the large size and drops them to move on to another toy.  Maybe better for a bigger baby?	
- 1	I was so excited to get this because of the great reviews. After trying it out and on the changing table, I quickly realized that there was no way I was going to keep it. The first thing I noticed was that newborn diapers do not fit in the holder. It is made to hold full size bigger diapers. Then I realized that since I am left-handed, I wanted this to be on the left side of the changing table. Well that doesn't work, because the dispenser opening to get the diapers would then be in the back! So I tried it on the other side to see if that could work. In doing so, I realized that the plastic had left 2 scratch marks on the pretty cherry wood of my changing table!! The plastic is sharp and scratched my changing table on both sides as I was trying to figure out how to make it work. I considered using a cloth or something soft to protect the wood from the plastic, but quickly decided it's not worth it -- not only will it not work with newborn diapers, but it is also not left-handed friendly, and really does not give much storage space. Returning it right away. I would have given it 1 star but &#34;hate&#34; is too strong of a word. I simply do not like it :)	
1. 	I've been using this since my baby was a week old. It works very well on cutting his tiny nails. My only complain is it's too expensive!	
- 1	Read the great reviews, but very disappointed with this cup.  The lid has so many grooves and crevices, which makes it impossible to clean well.  Its difficult to control the amount of water coming out, and a pain to get it just right.	
1. 	I purchased this set predominately for the pump parts so I wouldnt have to contstantly clean and pack and unpack and clean the one set I had between work and home.  I like the fact that the 'cone' section is not a separate piece... one less thing to take apart and clean.  The extra 4 bottles are good to have and I look forward to using the steam bags when I am on the run or traveling (havent used them yet).  The price cant be beat... so much cheaper than buying individual pieces.	
1. 	If you follow the instructions, these are pretty much trouble free.  The baby loves them and that's what really matters.  As with most products there are minor issues if you try to take short-cuts in assembly or preparation.  In the long term, a great product.	
- 1	The bottom part takes up way too much space! It's unnecessary and we ended up just using the top cover. I could have easily found something else at the dollar store.The bottom part doesn't fit Medela bags!	
1. 	After my first ride in the car with my son, I found him with his head in a very weird position due to lack of head control.  The poor thing looked so uncomfortable and I swear I thought the jiggling had snapped his little neck!  So I ran out and bought these head supporters.  I have to say, they were helpful.  I put the larger one in the swing and left the smaller one in the car seat.  They did seem to help control the head bobbing until he was old enough to hold up his own head.The cons:1.  the headrest does not really snap in to the seat anywhere, so basically you're just placing it in the seat (similar to what you'd do with a rolled up towel).2.  when we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected, they didn't like the head rest placed in the car seat because it didn't fit securely (i.e. wasn't secured to the fabric) and because the seat had not been crash tested with the headrest in place.  The alternatives they recommended were either to contact the manuafacterer and buy a head rest that HAD been crash tested in our particular seat model, or to just use rolled up towels.  (I'm not sure what difference a towel would make in a crash, but I'm just repeating what they said)In the end, we disregarded what the police had recomended and just used the headrest until our son no longer needed them (which really wasn't all that long).  The product worked fine and luckily we didn't need to test out the whole crash test theory.Having said that, would I buy this again?  Probably not.  Like I said, the product worked well and I gave it 4 stars because we really didn't have any problems with it, but all things considered, why not just roll up a couple of towels?	
- 1	At 5 mos 2 weeks old, my son has no real interest in these toys. They also don't fit around his wrists great (he's not a chubby baby) and they fall off his legs/feet because they are too big. They also have a very faint rattle sound, no squeak, no real crinkle sound either. Boring.	
- 1	I bought these because my son can pull out the plug kind. Sadly, while installing these, they either don't or just barely cover the cut out holes where the outlets are placed. They also only screw into the middle switch plate hole so he tries to pry them off the wall that way.	
1. 	I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol. But they are not too bad, so no complaints.	
1. 	The Playtex Nurser bottles are not the first bottles I tried with my baby.  I honestly had no problems with the Avent bottles I had been using, but it was a pain to wash them constantly and sterilize them.  So I decided to give these a try because the liners are pre sterilized and I could use the bottle a few times before I actually washed it.The liners fit nicely into the bottle and then I pour the milk from my pump right in the bag.  I do not recommend using the bags for storage because they are not as strong as true milk storage bags.  I have had leakages with these in the refrigerator and I did not try to freeze milk in them.As the baby drinks, the bag prevents air from being released through the nipple and to the baby.  It makes sense when you see how it works, it does not allow any air out. I rarely get a burp out of her after I use these bottles, and she has not had any issues with gas.  The box the bottles came in actually state two different trials in which this type of bottle system significantly reduced colic.  If I have a colicky baby, I will definitely be using these bottles.The negatives-You have to buy the bags.  However, they come in boxes of 100 for less than 10 dollars which is enough to last 2-3 weeks if you use them at every feeding (less for newborns).Like I mentioned earlier, the bags are not great for storage.Overall, a great choice for new moms.	
1. 	I had the same for my first kid and i am buying another one since it is super comfortable to breastfeed and safe to put baby ,the strap is lil big for newborn but will be good after a while	
- 1	I returned this product because the label says that it I made of non-breathable fabric. You can also smell the chemicals from which it was made. I bought it primarily to use during our frequent trips to Miami. However, I didn't want to further restrict the air flow in the stroller. I did not even unfold the thing, so I can't comment on the ease of attachment. I ended up using a towel for additional protection and it worked fine and maintained a good airflow. I'm still looking for something that doesn't smell like it has been dipped in a chemical bath and has more breathabilty.  This should not be used in temperatures above 75 especially with humidity. I could have kept it to se at home in Maine, but we can get by here without out.	
1. 	Finally I found a potty insert to fit our smallish round toilet lid. Other inserts that claimed they were for a standard size were just too big. It came with a simple peel & stick hanger that makes storage convenient. It is nice & cushy for our skinny 2 year olds bottom & there is no fear of him falling through. Wish it was not made in China that is my only negative comment. For that reason I only gave this product 4 stars.	
- 1	We loved our monkey, despite the loud ticking sound he makes, until winter came along. Now that it stays dark late, my daughter can't see whether monkey's eyes are opened or closed (his little night light only stays on for about 30 seconds after pushing the button, and if we let her get close enough to push the button, she'll just go ahead and push the button that opens his eyes as well). As a result, she wakes up a 4 a.m., AND EITHER TURNS ON THE LIGHT in her room in order to see whether his eyes are open or COMES OUT TO WAKE US UP AND ASK WHETHER HIS EYES ARE OPEN. I'm trying a different model and suggest that you do too.	
1. 	I have been using nothing but these bottles for the first 6 months of my baby's life. Yes they WILL LEAK if you don't pull the nipple all the way through. But that is an easy fix! I never had an issue with my baby falling asleep during a feeding or the flow being too fast. And colic has never been a problem here either.I breastfeed and pump for my baby and I found that she went easily from bottle to breast as early as 2 weeks old. I attribute it to the unique design of the nipple which encourages her to open her mouth wide instead of tucking her lip in to suck on a smaller nipple.Also these can be converted to sippy cups. They are very durable as well and so easy to clean. I threw all the other bottles I got as a shower gift right out in the trash - my baby will not drink from them.	
- 1	I am 5'8 and it just does not work well. If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled.  I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great. I had high hopes for this but just not long enough.  I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding.	
1. 	We decided to purchase this sleepsack since we did not want our little one to have a bunch of covers with him in the crib at night and he would always kick them off anyway. This sack is very warm and now we dont have to set our thermostat to 71 degrees Fahrenheit anymore just to make sure he is warm at nights.	
- 1	I first heard of the boppy pillow when a friend of mine had a baby.  She allowed me to use it to hold her baby without straining my arms.  I thought it was the greatest thing.  I had never had a baby before and never held one and I thought there would be no way I could breastfeed without it.  Little did I know at the time I was pregnant.  I registered for a pillow and didn't get one, so I paid the outragous price and shipping because I thought I wouldn't be able to live without it.  Pre-pregnancy I was a size 1-5 or extra small.  I gained probably 60 lbs.  When I brought my baby home, the pillow would not even fit around the fat left over from pregnancy.  Once my uteros (sp?) did go down quite a bit, it fit a little better (it still doesn't fit quite right) and I could try to use it.  I have large breasts (about DD) and I still had to prop a blanket under my baby's head to reach my breast.  She would fall into the gap left in the stomach area all the time because it didn't fit right.  I eventually just set the pillow aside and do not use it.  She is now a little over a month old and it is really easy to set her in my lap and she reaches the breast on her own.  Do not be fooled that you will get your money's worth out of it.  I'm really dissapointed a read so many good reviews and turned out I wasted money that I could really use for other things like DIAPERS!  I would have given zero stars if there was the option.	
1. 	does everything it says and the solid colors are great for matching every outfit.  Although it says not to tumble dry, I throw them in the dryer anyway.  They withstand washing and drying very well.  My son is the king of all droolers and we have to change his bibs at least 5x a day, but because of the waterproof feature of these bibs, we never need to change his clothes.	
1. 	Purchased these for my little one's mini convertible co-sleeper, but I was worried that they wouldn't be high enough to reach a good height next to my raised tempurpedic mattress.  Worry not, they fit perfectly and make reaching your baby in the middle of the night easy and comfortable.  Would definitely buy these if what is provided in your kit doesn't work for your mattress height.As a side note, I bought the black because they were the only ones that shipped with prime even though my co-sleeper is natural colored.  You never notice the color difference.  And I have had  NO stability issues.	
1. 	If you are looking for that perfect baby gift-look no further this is it.  This is the one item I didn't receive during all the baby showers and gifts I received while waiting for our newest addition.  I never thought at my age that I would have a little one in my house again as my other children are now grown.  Of all the swings, seats and play mats, this is the seat that my now 4 month old loves.  He sits in it for very long periods at a time, completely at ease and entertained with the vibration on.  Day-care also has these seats and they have told me that he loves it.  The colors are bright and eye catching, the toys are placed where they can easily be seen and grabbed at when he reaches that stage.Assembly was very easy.  All that is needed is a Philips head screw driver and a little time.  Instructions are easy to follow but I didn't need them.  There are just a few parts to put together and you can see from the picture on the box where each piece goes.  The cover is easy to put on and remove in order to clean.  The batteries are under the cover, closed with a screw to keep little fingers and mouths out of danger.  It keeps him happy and entertained while I am working around the house and that makes me happy.  I would rate it more than 5 stars if allowed.	
1. 	We switched to using almost allPlaytex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottles 9-Ounce, 3 Pack (Colors Vary)as our main bottle. The nipple ring is tight and the nipple is stiff, the bottle design prevents nipple collapse and makes airflow work in the perfect combo so that he never got a gassy tummy again. Spend the money, buy the good stuff.  My choice for standard nipples is Playtex ventaire nipples too. Since we began using those nipples NO LEAKS. The only problem is they are hard to find. These bottles are hard to find too, Amazon actually has the best prices so go ahead and buy here you've nothing to loose with free two day shipping ( www.amazon.com/mom) The nipples if you don't want to order online can be found at Target. They have the best price for stage two nipples, since they are not offered here on Amazon unfortunately.Good luck, hope this helps. We Love these.	
- 1	The individual wipes are way too big for what you need, and you end up going through a whole pack rather quickly. The price is definitely too high for what you get. Save yourself some money and use pacifier wipes instead. They're smaller, cheaper, and last a lot longer!	
1. 	Everyone should have at least one sleeved bib for messy meals. This one worked great and seemed well made. Fit nice and I liked the tie back	
- 1	My hubby asked me why we needed to buy baby wash clothes instead of just using our own and I told him it was because they were supposed to be much softer on baby's delicate skin. These do not fit the bill. They are rough and super thin. I would've been fine just using our own which are nicer. Shouldn't have bothered with these.	
- 1	The bowl is ok, quite big, but the suction cup doesn't stick to the bowl much... My 1yo removes it so easily and i end up with food all over! I like the other munchkin suction bowls much better.	
- 1	I'm sure this is a great baby monitor but it wouldn't turn on for us at all because our router interfered with it. Out of Signal Coverage is all we saw so we have to sell it since we are outside of the return range. Before you buy, confirm your router is not performing at the same ghz level. Customer service called  us back within 24 hours and was very helpful in letting us know the problem though.	
1. 	By reading the other reviews, I wonder.... To me this is the ONLY thing I could use.  I hate the idea of the baby soaking in the same water I used to washed her.  We have a pot with warm water next to me and sat the baby bather on my bathroom sink.  I closed the door and kept the bathroom warm until we were done.  We have a big bathroom and I dressed her on the ocuntertop.Now she is 6 months and I still sit her on it.  Now I use an inflatable tub underneath it.  still the water runs out into the sink, but the countertop is too hard so we take her into the room to dress her.  For me, this is a great product!AHH! when we know we will be outdoors, we use it as our baby's chair.  since it is meshy, it helps her stay cool.  She is a summer baby.	
1. 	I love my daughter and was very surprised to find out she could have stinky breath.  My beautiful little angel had bad breath?  What?  Well, that was when I knew that I needed to be better about brushing her emerging teeth.  Wiping them with a clean washcloth was difficult, and I would 'forget' to do it all the time.  This toothbrush filled the need perfectly, without requiring a lot of effort on my part (I'm not lazy, but let's be honest - there's a lot to do when you have an infant!) and took care of her stinky breath.  Which led me to believe that her teeth were also getting clean.She also loved chewing on it, and I think it helped with her teething.  Especially when she started to cut molars - that brush could angle towards the back and she could chew away!  We have 2, and I would recommend them highly!	
- 1	Could work for some, but my baby will not put these in her mouth.  She does like the Soothie brand.	
1. 	I know these are supposed to be milk bibs, but we have been using them for food bibs for our (admittedly not very messy) little gourmand, despite the fact that they're a bit small for him now. They have remained waterproof for over a year's worth of washes. The colors are vibrant and pleasant, and the bibs are soft and comfy, making these the only bibs my son will currently accept. The velcro is strong and so I highly recommend closing these securely before washing them so that they don't snag knit garments (I learned that lesson the hard way).	
1. 	This product is well made and does a great job of painting stars all over a dark room for a child's security at night.  My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the idea of starting the turtle before she climbed into bed.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was some way to plug it in and leave the thing on all night.  the timer is great for those who don't want to use it as a permanent night light but for me, it was the only negative.	
1. 	I used to wash bibs constantly, now I just have this one bib that is perfect.  I always wash it off right away when my son is done with it and hang it on the high chair so that it dries for next time and is always clean and available.  The velcro tie in the back is nice and fast, and my son loves it because it is trucks.  Worth paying a little more for this print if you have a boy!	
1. 	These are ok, thick glass so thats great but its so hard to read the side. I think if they redid their molding it might be a little nicer to read. Other then that they serve their purpose. I purchased this so that the breastmilk could sit in the fridge a couple of days. Mine was getting an odor from the plastic bottles. Problem solved with glass. So I pump into the plastic so I can easily see a measurement then I transfer it into here.	
- 1	product leaks... first time i used it i was shocked... as soon as it tips it drips every where.. i was super excited to use it and im now sad i spent $15 all together getting one.. waste of money for sure	
- 1	This was great, until we put it in the dishwasher.  It says top shelf dishwasher safe, but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place.  One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water.  This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged.  We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store.  Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose.	
1. 	My husband bought this.  He loved the idea of putting the baby's picture next to her foot and hand print.  He thought that it would be really neat for her to look back at the picture of her at 6 weeks and see how small she was and how tiny her little feet and hands were.  It was so easy to to do.  The material is really easy to work with.  It is so easy to get baby's foot and hand in it.  It isn't goopy so you can bring the material to the baby instead of trying to do the balancing act of getting the baby positioned over the material and then trying to hold her still while you put her into the stuff.  This package you just grabbed the appendage you wanted to imprint, put the material to the foot/hand and pressed gently in.  The frame was easy to put together after the caste was all dry.  The set has the background pink on one side and blue on the other.  It really doesn't get any easier and it is really attractive once put together.  The only problem I did have was that my caste cracked when drying.  Not very much, but just enough to be noticeable.  (This was because my husband didn't lay it exactly flat to dry, this was not any fault of the product)  However, I just filled the crack with caulk.  It worked great.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a special keepsake for their child and anyone buying a gift for an expectant parent.	
1. 	We love this swaddle and now buy it for everyone we know having a baby!!	
- 1	I was hoping this would help protect my Boppy pillow but it doesn't. My baby spits up a lot and it goes right through this protector. It's water resistant but not waterproof which is no help.	
1. 	I have fallen in love with the Medela pumps. I initially purchased the Avent pump since it fit our Avent Natural bottles, but was able to use a Medela Symphony to pump with at work and just loved it. This kit perfectly with the pump and the pieces really held up the during the repeated use.	
- 1	I was so excited for this sheet because I LOVE all aden & anais products. Not this one. It pills, those little balls form. I didn't dry it & washed it in the gentle cycle. Very disappointed.	
1. 	I quite enjoied these cups. we got them for my son when he was 4 months old but he had no intrest in them. As time went on he started trying to get liquid from them and had quite a bit of sucess. He still uses the cups now at 11 months but Im starting to hate them. The valves have started leaking and it seems like all my playex cups leak after a few hand washes. I love the cups and so does my son but ill have to buy new valves often.	
1. 	This bag is okay. It is a little bigger than I planned, but it will do the trick.  It fits all that one would need for a day.  It is perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.	
- 1	This is much better in the fact that if you touch it, it seems like skin. But the flow is way to fast and in turn made baby eat to fast and made our LO vomit every time we used it. Sham that we bought 5 of them, they are not cheep. Not worth the money and loss of bm, Liquid gold is way to important to give baby in these bottles just to have them vomit everything up.	
- 1	If it wasn't for the fact this stroller has nice padding for the child and the handles, a nice cargo basket and a cup holder, this would be getting 0 stars.  I purchased this stroller for obvious functional reasons but a main selling factor for me was the color.  I hate the strollers that are all one color but this one is not mint.  Don't be fooled.  It's more like nasty seaweed green.  The color up top is not a pinkish peachy tone, it's a dreary tan.  The brown is dark chocolate brown.  In other words, it's ugly to say the least and I checked the color on multiple monitors just on the chance my monitor was off and they all looked the same.  To make matters worse when you put the seat section down so your child can drop their legs down, it doesn't even go back far enough to allow the child to put their feet on the cross belt which is the whole purpose of the cross belt.  The seat itself has no support.  Basically it would be no different than your child sitting on a hammock.  Sure there's bars a couple inches down lower but like I said, sagging under the tush is bound to occur.  I don't want to know how much stitching will pull away when the child weighs more and puts more pressure on the seat.  And yes the strap for the crotch is super short.  This will never work for an older or bigger child.	
1. 	I got these for my son when he first started with sippy cups. They worked perfect! I let him use the seal for  a while but then took it out because it is better for children's teeth to not suck hard on the sippy cup. Even then they leaked minimally (only because the seal that made it leak proof was out). With the seal in we had no leaks. They are BPA free which is a huge plus!! It fit in my son's hand easily as well and washed up nice in the dishwasher. The spout is a harder plastic that withstands teeth and the roughness of toddler's but doesn't hurt the teeth or make it hard to drink.	
1. 	I really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging/plugging the electronics.  It is very hard however for me to open it, but I guess that's the point.	
1. 	I love this sling. My husband and I used a wrap carrier when our daughter was tiny, and he tends to use a structured carrier when he wears her. She's fine with that, but if I use the structure carrier she gets really cranky and cries. I think it's because she wants to nurse and she's shoved into my chest. This sling is fantastic because I can wear her on my hip or even tummy to tummy without her getting cranky. The padded rails are awesome because her little legs aren't dented too badly after wear, and the padded shoulder feels great. My daughter is still only 15 lbs, but it's incredibly comfy to wear her in this sling. I think I'll start baby-wearing more often because this sling is a great fit for us.	
- 1	This item came apart at the seams after a gentle wash cycle. I wasn't sure if this was an isolated event until I read the other reviews of it happening to others as well. It's a pretty sheet and it actually fits the bassinet unlike other brands but it is frustrating that the item failed quality control. Back to the drawing board in finding a decent bassinet sheet.	
1. 	This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live.	
1. 	So easy to use, it's the only one I ever used!	
1. 	This is a great product.  We use the Avent Bottles &amp; Avent Isis Breast Pump and they are made to fit into this sterilizer.  However, it works just as well on other stuff.  (You don't have to use their configurations to get good results.)  It's so much easier than boiling.  You just pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes and everything is sterilized.  We love it.	
1. 	I have used First years take and toss sippers and bowls since the birth of my nieces. Now I am using them for my son and they do not disappoint. I have absolutely no complains about it. Great product great price.	
- 1	I got this and no matter what temperature the water is, the word HOT shows up and doesn't go away.	
- 1	No grip on the bottom. Slides everywhere. Dangerous!!! I have one that has a rubber backing that is a lot safer. Buy in the store so you can see.	
- 1	The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.	
1. 	This is an awesome sleep sack! No worries about loose blankets in the crib or baby being too cold. I put this on my five month old son over his footed pajamas and it works great to keep him warm and comfortable at night. It is very well made, and so soft. My son loves it!	
1. 	My daughter had the munchkin duck tub for awhile until it broke. Well...she is almost two and I was thinking of getting another one or bath mats. Our tub is very slippery. So I found this one and the age limit was past 2years old so I thought I would try it out. I really think it is a good transition to the tub. It is not real deep and she has lots of room but it still makes her feel safe and secure.	
1. 	I was so hoping this would work with the drop ins bottles so I could pump right into the drop ins, but no.  It was a waste of money for me but I'm sure a dandy product.	
1. 	When I bought the carrier I wasn't concerned about drool- my newborn never drooled.  Now my 4 month old sucks on the front of the carrier and it's kind of gross, not to mention obvious to all by the 3 inches of darkened fabric.  I tried sticking a burp cloth there but it wasn't really helping, slipping out of place, falling, and still getting the carrier wet.  We bought these and are quite happy to say we stopped washing the carrier after every outing.  ;-pThey have:a water-proof barrier,are easy to pop on,stay in place,look good,and yet still seem tasty enough to gum and suck on.We are very happy and will buy another set of 2 for vacationing.	
- 1	This was one baby gift I wish we would've returned before using - a recieving blanket works much better. I recommend waiting to see if your little one wiggles out of the blanket and needs this before buying.	
1. 	This is so much easier, and smaller, than purchasing a high chair. Also great for traveling. Once my little one grew out of his bumbo chair he was ready for this one. I use a plastic mat underneath the chair to keep things clean.	
- 1	the zipper broke on both bags pretty fast, and the elastic doesn't adjust to fit into a diaper can. I won't buy it again. Blueberry makes a much better one.	
1. 	These make baby happy so momma's happy. My 8 month old likes to chew on them in the bath and LOVES that they squirt. It makes bathing quick and easy when he's happily occupied.	
- 1	The monitors advertise a 2000 foot range.  We do a lot of camping, so I thought these would be great to use while my child slept in the camp trailer.  However, even while standing directly outside the trailer with the door open the signal drops off.  I can't even use these at home outside of her bedroom window. Worst monitor ever!	
- 1	These work OK, thr top that you put the food in does not stay closed very well though. The disposable ones work better.	
1. 	as all other Mustela products that we use.this one goes well after bath and for daily massage.very gentle, makes the skin soft and silky.	
1. 	I'd seen this swaddleme before, but didn't think it was that good! It is soft and the baby looks cute too. It is warm and my daughther (NB) stays really nice swaddled. The small one is a bit too big for a newborn, but we manage to use it well, and they grow fast, so I will still use it a lot.	
- 1	How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??!  This pillow reeks with fumes, I think from both the plastic packaging and the foam in the pillow itself.  Please do not buy this pillow for use near your baby.	
- 1	This toy has a good concept. It has a suction cup base and the toy spins and plays music. I bought it for a trip via airplane and it worked well during the flight. But then we loaded into the rental car and this thing played its music every time we hit a bump or turned a corner. It is extremely sensitive and I eventually gave it away because it was driving me nuts. If you can handle the constant music, it&#8217;s a good toy but I got sick of it.	
1. 	After recently having a baby after waiting 13 years between this one and my next youngest child I was just like a brand new parent all over again. These bottles were great to have. The cap fits snuggly on the bottle so there is not spillage in the diaper bag and the design is great for both baby and the person feeding.	
1. 	My son has enjoyed these stacking cups since age 6 months and still at 1 year they are one of his favorites! They are so simple but he loves them!	
- 1	I wanted to love this product but I couldn't. It's bulky since the ice pack is built into the cooler. Like other reviewer says, you have to put this whole thing in the freeze. So, it's big and cumbersome (can not fit into a diaper bag really) and holds very little. Good concept since it does stay cold for a long time but just not efficient.	
1. 	My &#34;baby&#34; is now 14 months and yet, the pillow has never left my bed. I love that it's the only pillow that I did. One for my head, one to hold and on between my legs --- this does it all. Not pregnant, I used to wake up with pain in my lower back and legs. I have dealt with slipped discs, sciatic nerve pain and general back pain. While it's not totally perfect, this pillow relieves the majority of that.What I don't like about it is that the pillow case is difficult. You can't wash the pillow itself, but the case isn't too terrible to get off; it's getting it back on that's time consuming.I also think that $50 for a pillow is steep. But then again, you'll never buy another pillow, so the jury is out on that for me.	
1. 	My baby says they feel just like the real deal. He enjoys them almost as much as the real ones. He would definitely recommend them. They have great flow that doesnt leak yet the baby doesnt collapse the nipple from extreme suckling.	
1. 	I'm a first time mom and am fairly modest so breastfeeding in public is a bit of a challenge. This cover does the job and allows me to walk around in public or a store while nursing or while sitting.PROS:-fairly large and I never feel exposed-adequate coverage-I like the rigid top that allows you to check in and look at baby-the &#34;clean up&#34; corners that are lined with a towel like fabric are nice but these often touch dirty surfaces so I never use it to wipe baby's mouth.CONS:-it looks like an apron and it is always obvious that you are nursing so not too discrete-it gets hot	
1. 	My son loved this swing. He preferred the cradle motion for the first 2 months, then preferred the front to back motion. He used it all the way up to his 5th month. He was captivated by the overhead lights and mobile. After he hit 5 months, he just didn't want to be confined.	
1. 	They really don't spill when dropped, unless you lose the plastic insert. Then they spill EVERYWHERE... I wish they sent an extra plastic piece with the set.	
1. 	I'm glad I bought these and it would be really helpful if the hubs would actually read the labels so I wouldn't have to reorganize every week...	
1. 	Compared to the fuzzibunz wipes I have these are very thin; when wet they are very similar to disposable wipes. They clean well and get the job done. My only concern is that the stitching around the edges seems to be coming undone a little, so we will see how they hold up in the long run. For the price you can't go wrong.	
- 1	These bottles are ok, but they really don't do anything to reduce colic, and the nipples left blisters on my baby's upper lip.  I really like the drop-in concept, but these did not work for us.  I sold them on eBay after just a few uses.	
- 1	Nothing fits this stupid stand.  We bought it because we wanted a place for baby to sleep in the living room.  Actually I kind of just wanted infinite baby sleeping options.He sleeps in the swing just fine.  The swing is totally worth the investment.  This, on the other hand, is relatively affordable but is now taking up valuable real estate in our apartment.  Buy a swing, or a bouncer - skip this one.	
1. 	The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.	
1. 	It's all been said I think - these work amazingly well and I haven't second guessed this purchase once for use in our baby's room.  The ONLY annoyance I have with them is the power indicator light which is pretty bright.  We just taped over it and problem solved.	
- 1	We bought this for trips to the zoo and parks. The stroller itself is nicely made, it's easy to fold and it stands up when folded which is a nice feature. However, we had to return it. It was good for a few days but the wheels wore out quickly. I can't imagine the issue not occurring with a replacement so we switched to a completely different stroller and have had better luck.	
1. 	In what ended up being one of the best decisions we made in terms of product purchases since becoming parents, my wife and I discovered the glory of the HALO SleepSacks when we bought the newborn sized ones with the built in velcro swaddle. The swaddlers sleepsacks took the headache, hassle, and difficulty out of swaddling. We were sold and have been buying SleepSack products in larger and larger sizes as our son grows up.He has slept in a HALO SleepSack product every single cool or cold night since the day he was born. They are extremely high quality, they hold up perfectly wash after wash. He looks comfortable and sleeps soundly while wearing this sleepsack. We have this micro-fleece version for the coldest nights, and the thinner cotton versions for the more mild nights. The design of these SleepSacks is incredible. The SleepSacks zip from the top on down, keeping the zipper at the bottom of the SleepSack where your child cannot easily find it and unzip it, and it also won't be a bother for children who sleep on their stomachs. And it's nice knowing that this product is much safer and provides way more peace of mind than putting a blanket in the crib.This particular one now marks the sixth HALO product we have purchased in the first 14 months of our sons life. We will no doubt be purchasing the larger sizes as he grows, and are sold for life.	
1. 	I purchased this to replace a Sassy dispenser when it broke. I am happy with the Munckin brand. The spout is slightly angled, making it easier to dispense that before. Three sections is fine, each can hold 8oz of formula (I usually only put 6oz in each) and I have never been gone long enough to need more than 3 bottles at a time. I use it for formula now, but have also used it for baby cereal, snacks, etc. It is much easier to dispense Cheerios out of one of these on the go than a regular tupperware container!	
1. 	Cleans easy, vents great, works perfect for newborns.  These bottles also fit into standard size heating element.  Easy to fit into the mouth as well.  Lovely new invention!	
1. 	I really like this potty seat. My cousin gave me 2 and I bought a third one for Grandmas house. It is soft & folds up into its own carrying bag for travel. Easy to clean as well. My only complaint is that its a bit floppy. What I mean is that sometimes when my daughter places it on the toilet it folds in and falls into the potty. We try to just keep it in place so that don't happen. But the fact that it fits easily in my diaper bag for &#34;outings&#34; is the main reason I like it so much.	
- 1	Nowhere on the actual label attached to the toy does it say organic cotton.  What it does say is, Content consisting of PLA-polylactide fibers and Made in China.  Make your own conclusions as to whether or not you should trust this company.	
1. 	Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!	
- 1	This cup leaks unbelievably. It's almost impossible to stop it. I've tried tightening it as hard as I could and barely tightening it at all and everywhere between. At best, the lid drips slowly. At worst water comes out like there's no lid at all. My wife heard great things about this cup and insisted upon getting it. After reading the reviews I insisted we get this and the Lansinoh cup. We're both very happy we bought the other one. The Lansinoh cup is more round than we'd like, but it seals great and I really have no complaints. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the weight at the bottom of the straw is well designed and allows you to get all the liquid inside.	
- 1	I ordered Active and Miracle to compare.  Active doesn't have nearly as much back support as Miracle does.  Returned Active and kept Miracle.  I was able to use Miracle up until my baby was 20 pounds, probably can still use it but he's getting too tall.	
1. 	This is a great safety item for any home with small children!  It is both functional and, dare I say, attractive with the right color/brick combo.  It provides a great peace of mind that a slip near the hearth won't turn into an ER visit with x-rays and stitches.It is held onto the hearth with double-sided tape and I have read on other sites that reviewers have listed this as a major drawback.  And I must admit that my 4 year old can pull it off if he tries.  The simple solution there is, of course, to teach him not to do it!  Even my 16 month old has figured out that it is a no-no.  So, I do not consider it a con at all.	
- 1	I have the glass bottles, all i need is the top EVENFLOW PLEASE SELL TOPS ALONE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY WHOLE SET!	
- 1	These wipes are soft, absorbent, and perfectly sized BUT...the beautiful rainbow colored threading began to unravel with the very first wash. So if you're getting them for the lovely color, think twice. Without the threads, you can probably get a cheaper flannel wipe that is just as good.Too bad.  I would have bought more.	
- 1	Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.	
1. 	I am happy with the total package.  There are a number of things that go with the various stages of our baby's development, and overall I beleive the price works out more economical than purchasing individual toys.	
- 1	Initially I thought this was a good deal.  Although the color and the material wasn't ideal, it stayed put and provided adequate support for my 20lb baby.  Unfortunately, it broke after just two months of use.  I'd like to replace it but &#34;broke after use&#34; isn't an option in the Amazon drop down menu.	
- 1	I thought these were the drop in liners that hold there shape but they are NOT, they are just a thin liner....my mistake.  Overall, even if they were what I wanted I feel like they are not very good quality and annoying to but on the bottle.	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable tub tatoos!  I have both the fish and the turtle - both are cute and my kids like them.  Unfortunately, they are so small that the do not do a very good job to prevent slipping in the tub (even with two packages of them in the tub).	
1. 	Works great with my Maclaren stroller, brown color matches nicely, and it is a nice size, so it keeps sun out and baby happy, easy to put on, but i do have to take it off to take baby out or fold the stroller. Overall amazing product with great function, glad I bough full size, it covers my baby completely as of right now	
- 1	I thought this would be great to bring along to restaurants etc. but the suction only really works on completely smooth surfaces (like a mirror) and not any restaurant table I've tried so far. and because it is so top heavy it ends up on the floor in about 30 seconds.	
- 1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.	
1. 	I use this with my now 9 week old daughter and really like it. I was able to fit it in my kitchen sink and use it easily, before the cord fell off for sponge baths, because you let it absorb the water and they lay on it. We were given a baby bath and I tried using that a few times but I have to say, all I need is this sponge. She is so comfortable on it, unlike the other baby bathtub, with a sling insert. This is easy to use, makes her the most happy during bath time, and is easy to dry. For now its all we need.	
- 1	I'm so disappointed with this product! I bought three of these and they all ended up leaking within several weeks. Worse yet when my son is drinking from them the nipple will pop out spilling sometimes 8 oz. of milk. Very disappointed.	
- 1	Great idea, but very poor execution.  The case isn't air tight, and the wipes dry up after only a few days.  OXO typically makes excellent products, so I'm surprised that they put out such an inferior product.	
- 1	The idea is great, the product is not so great. We have the same reviews as everyone else. The bottles (we use VentAir) do not touch the on sensor, and it takes more than 30 minutes to warm our 8 oz bottles. Our son will not take them luke warm, he likes them very warm.How we made it work for us:Clothes pin that we just clip on over the sensor to turn the warmer on.And one hour before our son's feeding time we start warming the bottle.Very slow process, I wish I would have done more research upon buying this warmer.	
- 1	It is nearly impossible for the liquid to come out of the top of these cups. I even contacted the company and they sent me a new valve. I was excited to get it but it didn't improve anything. I am extremely disappointed.	
1. 	As most of the other reviews said, this is a great tub.  Only thing I have to add is that you should also buy a tub thermometer.  The rubber stopper on the tub is supposed to change color if the water is too hot for baby-but the water has to be way too hot before it changes noticeably (it does change slightly, but you can't tell through the water).  Otherwise, this tub has been perfect for us.	
- 1	I bought this because I had to go back to school after my baby was born. I found that pumping with this pump significantly reduced my milk supply. It takes a long time to get the milk I need, it has no quick cycle in the beginning to induce letdown, and I'm going back to using my manual pump which is a pain but it works much better than this pump. I'll be saving up to buy one that actually works.	
- 1	This monitor worked great for the first week. Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks.	
- 1	Ok, I'm editing this review because after a few months they all started to leak a lot, almost at the same time. Really annoying when you have two hungry babies to feed or when they try to feed themselves and you have milk dripping all over the place.They work great with the medela pump. I used to get 9oz on each breast in the mornings and these bottles did the trick. Just get a lid and put it in the fridge. For feeding though,  I would say that for short term use, such as traveling or to put in the diaper bag they are ok. But if you are planning on using them all the time then get a better bottle.This was my first review:-These bottles are great. They are really basic. I like the shape, tall and thin, which makes it easier to put in a diaper bag. We have the Avent, Evenflo (glass), and Tommy Tipee. Avent and these are by far our favorites. The price makes the product a fantastic purchase. We are soon going to grandma's for a short trip and I ordered a set so we don't have to bring bottles with us. If they weren't so cheap we probably wouldn't do that.	
1. 	i thought it was not that worthwhile. didnt order it until my little one wanted to drink cups at 18 month. i use it for every meal now. bye bye to other bibs!	
- 1	The case seemed durable but after a couple of weeks of use the red cap broke off and the case would not stay closed.	
1. 	Of all things related to babies and toddlers etc, this one by far is THE absolute best invention by Fisher Price! With so many 4+ star reviews already, you know you got yourself a winner with this product.The durability, convenience, portability and overall use of this booster seat will end up being your best purchase ever. There's many imitators out there but the one by Fisher Price is the one you want in the end. Because the item breaks down into a neat little package, it saves space (especially if you live in a place where storage is limited) and makes it extremely easy to take with you to restaurants, events where eating is involved and even as a high chair rather than wasting twice (if not more) moo-la for a high chair that is bulky and can't go anywhere beyond your dinner table. It's dishwasher safe so you can easily break it down into the parts shown and add it with the rest of your dish load. The plastic is made of super durable and strong material so you don't have to worry about it cracking, breaking or warping. It comes with adjustable straps so it allows you to control the fit for your child when it's used, providing security from any tipping or accidental slide outs.And as always, Amazon offered the best price than anyone else (believe me, I checked!!!). Great functionality, great price, great use - what more can you ask for? &lt;(^.^)>	
- 1	save your money. this brush scratched all my bottles and sprayed water all over me when i used it. i'm better off using a soft sponge and a spoon to use as a handle to swirl the sponge around	
- 1	Poor raw material. The locker system tires the bag straps and it isn't simple to be adjusted in strollers for example.	
1. 	I purchased this after holding a family member's hostage for some time.It's great for travel. You can fold it up and put it in the car. It adjusts well in different spaces.Ie. We use it to cover the stairs in some places, we use it to cover the fireplace at home, I've used it to cover the bookcase.... It created a nice little cage for my kids.I have never used it closed... My kids would probably just drag it around if they were stuck in it. But I have used it to keep them out of things they shouldn't get into. I tuck the ends away to prevent it from falling over and keep a zigzag pattern going to keep it sturdy.I ended up purchasing the 6 panel item with the door as well because I didn't enjoy stepping and hurdling over this one every few moments while trying to cook/serve dinner. I was told by the company that they did not advise linking the two gates together because it would make them less sturdy. Thus, I did not.	
1. 	Great delivery time! I choose this pillow over boppy every time because of the straps it has for baby to be secure, it's multifunctional.	
1. 	I love this thing! It holds lots of toys and very easy to put up! Also got it for a great price on here!!!	
1. 	I think they work great to mask some of the smell of the nasty diapers.  My husband doesn't like the scent... but he never likes any scents. Fits well in our Safety First simple diaper pail.	
- 1	If you want your 15m old to walk around the house and create milk puddles everywhere then this is the bottle for you!  I've never had a bottle/sippy leak sooo bad.  We've always been a klean kanteen family so I'm going to stick with those bottles with a MAM nipple.  The only thing that the Pura bottle has going for it is the cool factor, and forget about those silicone grip covers, they are impossible to get on and off!	
1. 	Works well, and you can't beat the price... Would have been better if they came with some kind of storage container, but really can't complain.	
1. 	I whip one of these out every time our baby has a number 2. I put the used wipes into the soiled diaper, roll it into a ball, secure the diaper with the tabs and toss the diaper bomb into the bag. I put a good knot on that bad boy and into the diaper pail it goes. It stays there for several days without funking up the room. My little guy is breast fed and gets changed 8 times a day. Once we start solids I expect we'll take the bombs out more often. We're in a size 2 disposable but there is a TON of room in that bag. Rolling a diaper bomb is key to lower odor and maximum space.The little guy has been home for almost 4 months and I'm still on my first box. Just ordered the second today to be sure I don't run out!My only complaint is that they are a bit hard to pull out of the box one at a time. When you are in a hurry to get your hands on one of these that does get a bit frustrating. I've been meaning to make a little dispenser and put them in one at a time when I'm not panicked. It hasn't been a big enough deal for me to bother doing though.	
1. 	I have a 7 month old that before this product lean forward in her bath hitting her head on the faucet. Luckily she didn't hurt herself to badly but immediately after I jumped online to find a product that was safe in case that happened again. I love this product. It's pretty big and fit onto our faucet easily. My only complaint is that the bubble bath soap dispenser slowly leaks which can be pretty annoying.	
- 1	These breast pads contain any leaks.  However, the sticky tabs do not hold them into the bra.  In addition, they appear lumpy in an unpadded bra.	
1. 	I really like this product. It is well constructed. The only thing I ran into problems with was that is was hard to get the breastmilk cubes out when they were fully frozen, but I just kept the lid on and ran the bottom of the tray under warm water for a few seconds and then they popped right out. I would definatly order these again!! I love it that they have lids as well.	
- 1	Why bother?!  Elastic came off of these things numerous times, and some of the inserts arrived with dirt marks.  Flip covers have too many large, hard snaps that can press against baby's skin.  Sizing is limited for thick prefold diapers (mine were organic unbleached) because it only works as a small and medium cover; legs openings are too tight with prefold diapers.  Shape has a large waist and narrow hips - bizarre.  Cover is thick polyester and not breathable, so it overheats.  The inserts were thick with a synthetic side and worthless - resembles a thick feminine menstrual pad in which poo could slide off once you pick it up.  Elastic is only on back, so the stiff cover (which doesn't stretch much) on the front will not expand or stretch when baby is sitting.  This would be funny if it were a movie, but it's really a Flippin' nightmare!	
- 1	I purchased this product while I was pregnant.... But the time my baby grew into it, I tried to put it on her and the rise snap doesn't work. The diaper is completely useless now. Obviously they don't inspect their products before they send them out,	
1. 	great value. i bought them for replacement nipples for the gerber essential bottles and they fit perfectly,, no leaks nice flow.. would recommend them for new borns.. great quality and durability!! perfect	
- 1	We loved these while they were in the tub, but they can get moldy if you don't pull them up and let them air out once in a while. Well, the first time I tried to remove them from the sides of the tub, one of the suction cups ripped right out of the side, so of course it won't inflate with a gaping hole in the side. I'll return them, but am really bummed. We all really liked those bumpers.	
1. 	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).  This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.  For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.	
- 1	these cups are terrible.  They are heavy and extremely bulky.  Very difficult for our toddler to handle.  Don't like them at all!	
1. 	We live in a tiny apartment and have a tiny bathroom.  At first we put the toys and bath books in the seat we never used while bathing our baby but after tripping over it one too many times, I tried the frog pod and love it.I know folks are stating that it doesn't stay put but so far so good.  We use the suctions even though the recommendation is to use the anchors.We called customer service the night we brought it home because we couldn't find the suction plate.  The rep was very helpful and told us the suctions and tape are not recommended but should hold up to 6 months as long as it doesn't fall between the grout lines on your tile.She sent us the suction plate and we received in the very next day!  Talk about service.I love that I can put her shampoo and conditioner and vitamins on the shelf behind the head and dangle some of her toys on the fingers.  So far it's filled to the brim and holding strong.Plus, it makes me smile in the morning when I take a shower.  It's just such a cute and odd thing to see in the morning.We'll keep you posted on how it holds up.6 month follow up: Like the rep said, the frog fell down and let me tell you I nearly called the police.  It scared the bejesus out of me.  We tried to attach it but the suctions aren't as strong, weakened by time and soap and dirt.  We tried the adhesive but ran across the same issues others have reported.  It just won't hold our frog up.It's a shame as I really love the frog.  It's cute and holds tons of toys and doesn't get mildewy.  Alas, our frog is leaning against our bathroom wall as a storage after the toys are dry.	
- 1	This holds about two pacifiers but you really have to squish them together and hope the container doesn't pop open as there isn't really a 'lock' to it. It's cute and convenient but was so not worth the money. Use a plastic bag instead, or make your own out of fabric!	
1. 	My little one has yet to master feeding himself with utensils but we bring these along to feed him when we're out of the house.  He also like to hold them while he eats.  The forks work ok when I'm the one who's spearing the food but I don't know how well they work if he were to do it himself.  I like how the back of the handles are curved/hollow so that they lay flat against each other - perfect for traveling.  At first I thought it would be uncomfortable to use because of this but they aren't.	
- 1	Ok I know this is only $10, but a step stool like this should be priced no higher.  It's cute...except for the super huge hard to remove sticker on the side of it!  Usually companies use an easy to remove sticker.  I had to soak this in the sink and scrub it with a steel pad leaving scratches all over the side of it (because it was so darn hard to get off!).  I can't believe this wasn't in any reviews.  Total pain, had I known I would have definitely ordered a different one!!!!	
- 1	I find that this gate with the extra small step at the bottom may make it even more unsafe than not having a gate at all especially if you are carrying your baby and use it at the top of the stairs.  I also did not like the latch design.One of the best looking gates on the market, so probably ok if you don't use it for top of the stairs.	
1. 	It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl, I like it! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it.	
1. 	Mine came with a gift and it was: socks. I have used the shampoo, the cleansing, lotion and the diaper rash cream so far and they are really nice product, My newborn doesn't dislike the smell, and the cleansing is really really good for those first few weeks that you have a newborn and can't actually bath him.  The smell is very subtle and it just leaves your baby smelling clean and not smelling of something in specific, which I really like, also since you use little portions, it will last a long time, excellent purchase for moms!	
1. 	i bought this when my twin sons were 4 months old, and they're still using it at 8 months.  i'm not sure what the other reviewer said about dye leaking, they have thoroughly chewed everything they could reach and we have not encountered that problem.  we tried to get away with just one exersaucer, but they both loved it so much we broke down and bought another.  it's provided hours of entertainment, and ranks up there with the kick n'play bouncer in terms of usefulness.  the only drawback is that although every square inch is crammed with toys for my little ones, the exersaucer came fully disassembled, and my poor husband spent almost 3 hours putting the two together.***UPDATE***my sons loved this exersaucer until they were 11mos old.  then they started walking and no longer like it, but looking back this has been the most worthwhile investment of all the various infant toys.  when your kid (in my case twins) outgrows toys every month or two, you really appreciate the staying power of a toy that can last 6 months!	
1. 	We have been storing my 20 month daughter's toys in an open box in the living room since she was born. I finally got sick of looking at them at night and wanted something that I could close after she had gone to bed. This fits the bill perfectly. My daughter likes to climb and she likes to climb into the toy box. So I like that the box is soft. I also like that it has an organizing compartment that I can put all of the little plastic random toys that we seem to accumulate. It has a side compartment to put books or puzzles and a fold down playmat that we don't use, but I think I would have when she was younger. But the best part- it closes! So my living room looks much neater at night or when we have company. My husband always complains when I buy things that he feels are unnecessary, I thought he would complain about this purchase, since we already had a toy box. But even he likes it and feels it is much better than what we had before. I highly recommend this toy box.	
- 1	I needed a lunch bag for my wife. This one turned out to be a kid's lunch bag or just a similar size... No compartments, no nothing. Returned this bag and got something that suits her better.	
1. 	PERFECT fit! Thick, elastic goes around the entire pad, with a deep fit, and it's soft to the touch! Fits my Delta mini-crib perfectly. Very happy with this purchase... it was even 4 dollars cheaper than current eBay sellers. :-) Love Amazon!	
1. 	fits on my pack and play and just holds the junk you know,  dont think i could live without this item. and i use the diaper storage as back up when my dh uses last diaper and i and elbow deep in poop, this is a life saver	
- 1	The design of this cosleeper is ideal for anybody who wants to cosleep and is afraid of crushing the child, does not have room in the bed, or wants a system that will make it easy to wean the kid off the bed in small steps.The problem is the implementation is so cheap and shoddy, it is not worth it.The structure is rickety at best--and this without using those wobbly leg extensions other people have complained about. The cosleeper is too low for my bed as well, so I have to break my back and arms to get the kid out at night. I won't risk making the cosleeper even MORE rickety by using those cheap plastic extensions.What is with the metal bars? the metal bar on the side that you can collapse is low enough that the kid can eventually bang his head on it--and it is barely covered with the thin fabric with which you cover the entire structure to keep it together.The mattress IS very hard, as other people commented. My problem with it is not that it is so hard but that its waterproof cover is so unpleasant and squeaky even with the sheet on that my child hates being on it. Cannot blame him. I have put more than one sheet on the mattress so it does not make that nasty plastic sound or has that plastic feel.And yes, the ridiculous sheet that comes with it! It is so scratchy you could sand your house with it. But that is not the worst--it does shrink so badly when you wash it that it won't fit on the mattress--it will squish the mattress both at the head and the foot of the bed leaving gaps of over one inch at each end. THis is ridiculous and unsafe and so easy to fix.All in all, it is clear that this brand, in spite of charging a hefty amount for Ikea quality stuff (bunch of metal poles and fabric with velcro, is all you're buying) does not hesitate to save an extra cent by giving you scratcy shrinky sheets that will make the crib unsafe for your child.As I said, great idea, terrible implementation. Get something else if you find it.	
1. 	i bought this item to separate the kitchen from the den, so i could keep my pets separate from the child and dirtying up the house while they ate.  it has been one of the best things we purchased.  love the clear view to see my child if im cooking and shes on the other side making faces at me, or checking out what the pets are doing.	
1. 	Very easy to use, combined with almost nothing to clean. The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience.	
- 1	I followed the washing instructions to a T and it shrunk. I had tried it on before washing and it was perfect. But after washing the material became softer and stretchier feeling and it is literally pulling up from all sides. I called Amazon and they sent me a replacement. I hand washed it cold and let it air dry and same thing - it shrunk! Other than that it is the right size for a 18x36 cradle mattress 3 inches thick. I am keeping the 2nd one bc it was cheap and nothing not sure if anything else on the market would be any better.	
- 1	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.	
1. 	Completely worth the money! Not only is it adorable but the mirror is very large and I can keep a close eye on my little girl.	
- 1	I've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you can't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it. My son recently had a dirty (poop) diaper leak (not a big leak, like a drop or two), and I don't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again. I don't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym, swing, and bouncer for times I need to put him down. I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles. He's 7 weeks old. I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove.	
1. 	This nursing stool drastically improved the usefulness of my old-fashioned rocking chair as a place to nurse my newborn. Prior to the stool my lap was slanted in a way that made it difficult to position baby and my back was leaned too far back to be useful. The stool converted my lap into a flat horizontal stretch that could support my baby and improved my posture so I didn't end my sessions with a backache. However, I also found it useful while nursing on the couch or other armchairs (same benefits) and my husband loves to use it when he is getting baby dressed after a bath as it helps him keep his lap horizontal as well. An added bonus is that it is incredibly easy to put together (5-10 minutes tops) and comes with it's own allen wrench tool.	
- 1	I saw this in the store when i was buying DD new bottles and got super exited cause it said i didn't need to scrub anything just soak it. Loaded our bathroom sink up like i normally do added the three pumps, Probably a bit much for the size of since we have waited probably 5 minute since i needed to change to DD came back rinsed and found that they still needed to be scrubbed. Doesn't work any better then normal dish soap other then the fact it's sent free. Still kinda has a smell to it though after washing kinda dusty smell. Over priced would save your money and just buy a non scented dish soap.	
1. 	Thanks to other reviewers posting tips on how to get the best results this kit is great! Tried the given instructions' way and the results weren't so great. I'm no chemist so I don't know if it has anything to do with temperature or altitude. However, following users tips fixed the problem.For us the biggest issue was water. One reviewer suggested using half the water indicated. We had to use about 3/4 for optimal results. Also like suggested, keep stirring when water rises to the top during multiple handprint attempts. This helps keep the consistency right and make followup attempts easier.	
1. 	If you have a small room then this is a must have. Very sturdy, doesn't take much space but has a lot of room for the baby.	
1. 	We were using a high chair for some time, but when our toddler graduated to a booster seat we put our high chair in storage.  We do not use the tray attachment, but rather pull him up to the dining table with us.  Perfect for meal time or activity time, he loves it so much he even points to it to let us know its time to climb on in. Attaches to the chair in seconds with two simple snaps for the chair seat and chair back, makes removal for cleaning a snap.  The only draw back is that it has a non-slip butt portion which can be hard to clean.	
1. 	I like this bib better than the Baby Bjorn one because it's not rigid and has sleeves.  At first I didn't like that you had to tie it in the back and wish it had velcro straps, but it does make it harder for baby to take off.  Easy to wash and dries quickly.	
1. 	Great item.  Covers clothing adequately.  Washes well in washing machine. Good buy. Only wish they had more patterns to choose from.	
1. 	I have an average sized mattress and this fits perfectly!  It is super easy to install!  If it &quot;bunches up&quot; like some others suggest, it is because it isn't put on the mattress correctly.  A little tug, and it goes right in place... kind of like a normal bed sheet, know what I mean?After washing, many lint balls pile up, but it is durable in the fact that it isn't falling apart!  Just because it collects lint balls doesn't make it any less durable in my honest opinion.I recommend at least two of these!	
- 1	I'm sure this is a great baby monitor but it wouldn't turn on for us at all because our router interfered with it. Out of Signal Coverage is all we saw so we have to sell it since we are outside of the return range. Before you buy, confirm your router is not performing at the same ghz level. Customer service called  us back within 24 hours and was very helpful in letting us know the problem though.	
- 1	When I got these I was a little disappointed that they were so small and thin. I ended up not really using them. If I balled one of them up it would be the size of a golf ball. Not really a good size to use as a wash cloth. As I mentioned they are really thin as well. I felt like if I put it up to the light I could see right through them. Just not really what was expected.	
1. 	Meh, does what it's suppose to. Probably the best option for spindles with it's protective rubber. No scratches on spindles at all.	
1. 	We've taken the booster seat to restaurants, to visit family & friends and even camping -- it fits great in those diverse environments and different bases.  It also helped to keep him in a secure spot as we set up and prepared meals when camping.  Plus, it sets up quickly and easily cleaned, which is very helpful since he's not the neatest eater.  The product was exactly as advertised and was delivered quickly with good packing.  I'm a satisfied customer!	
- 1	These are not made for toddlers who like to throw stuff on the floor...the day I bought this, my daughter dropped it from her chair and it broke into pieces..not kid friendly...1 star for cute design	
- 1	This is cute to look at, but that's about all. It does not function at all in my car. At first I had my carseat behind the passenger seat, and I couldn't fit it around my back seat's headrest at all. I recently moved the carseat to the middle where it's safest. And the middle seat does not have a headrest and it is impossible to attach it to any part of the seat. My car is a 2010 so you would think this mirror would be compatable with newer cars...but it's not at all. I can't imagine this working in anyone's car, no matter what the year or model. Don't waste your money!	
- 1	I have been using Dr Browns ever since my son was born at the recommendation of his pediatrician.. Started off colicky and then Acid Reflux.. I ordered this set from Amazon recently as we needed extra bottles to juggle between home and daycare. THESE LEAK..and guess what - the bottle cover and cap do not fit snugly into the Dr Browns dishwasher basket I have from BRU... imitation bottles,,hmm thats a first!	
1. 	At first I had to play around with them to get them fitted correctly, but pretty easy and self explanatory.	
- 1	Great idea, it is a must have for newborns and especialy  for new moms who are nerveous with the first baths- as I was. I had this sponge and the frog shaped green sponge ( don't remember who's the manufator). Although this one is bigger - and that's an advantage, it got black disoloration (nothing spilled on it and it is not mold) after only a few times we used it. It didn't come off  in the wash and although it didn't smell or anything I didn't want to use something that looked dirty for my daughter's baths. It did not happen to the green sponge, which I would reccomend.	
1. 	My 2 1/2 year olds highchair was terrible, so I threw it out on his first b-day. This chair is great, but I dont see anything miraculous going on.PROS-* Very comfortable, my son always says everything should be like cooshie* All one solid piece of foam, bo creveces to get food stuck in* It doesnt slip due to the material, a plus for a wiggly toddler* Sits him up high enough to eat* Can be easily taken off, no straps and all that stuff* Cute color, not bright and pastely* Very light weightCONS-* Is not at all portable, I dont know about you but I wouldnt want to travel with something the size of a large platter everywhere!* The carry case is cheap and really the size of a diaper bag... uhh sorry I already have one of those* leaves his feat dangling, although this is a problem occuring in MANY booster seatsThis is just a booster. I like it and I am glad I chose it but I dont really understand the amazing changes in children with a booster (not that I am denying the fact that those reviews are true) I just dont see how this cooshie could do it. My son is still fussy, and will get down when he feels like it, this comfortable booster doesnt stop him. He loves his booster and loves being a big bow v.s sitting in a highchair like his little brother	
- 1	The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...but I think they need to redesign the shower handle.  It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray.  Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down.  The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot.  I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well.  A cup or washcloth will do the trick.	
1. 	I read other reviews where the changing table cover is thin. And, it is on the thin side. I put it over another cover and it fits very well and looks very good. It also holds up in the wash well.	
- 1	I started out my son with elimination communication (EC aka early start potty training, of which Amazon carries great books by 3 different offers on the subject) when he was 6 wks old.  We kept it up until he was 4 months old and then I stopped because my mother-in-law thought it was weird - I tried to start again when he was 6 months but he was already attached to his diapers.  I could really kick myself now that he's 2 and many many poop diapers later!  Anyhow we had the smaller version of the Baby Bjorn potty when we were doing EC and it worked great cuz we could manuver him and pee him sitting down.  The pee gaurd is in the opinion of more than just our family, TERRIBLE for toddlers!  After he bumped it sitting down I couldn't get him near the potty for weeks.  I am not usually into frills and over the top plastic toys but I love the fisher price potty we got him instead.  I didn't put batteries in it - too much for me.  I love it.  My son actually uses it.  It has a REMOVABLE splash gaurd.  Our boy pees standing up anyhow - just like Papa! It looks more like a grown up potty except it has a cartoon smiley face.  I thought the smiley face silly at first but since it makes my son like it more it kinda makes me happy now.  And the potty seat removes so you can put it on your toiletseat for easing toddlers nerves when moving onto to toilet training.  Not as simple-looking as the Baby Bjorn but a much better potty in many many ways.	
- 1	The previous reviewer is correct. For $15 you get ONE box of bags. They also don't fit right. I made them work because I had too, but I won't buy these again.	
- 1	Do NOT be fooled by them selling this claiming its organic! It is 65% polyester and 35% Cotton, I'm immediatly sending this back for a full refund. LIES!	
1. 	We've been using this giraffe for over6 months now with no problems at all.I'd say that we turn the noise makerpart on about 6-10 times a day, every day.The giraffe is super soft, buttons areeasy to reach and I like the variety ofsounds that can fit just about any timeof day whether playing or sleeping.  Evenwith this much use, we've only had toreplace the batteries once.	
- 1	I bought this gate to use at my mom's house for my 14-month old daughter. It was simple to assemble, but completely insecure when installed. I installed it according to the directions, tightening the pieces that suspend it against the wall until they were tight. The gate wouldn't open. I unscrewed them until the gate would just open. Unfortunately, when it was just loose enough to open the gate, I could easily pull the gate off the wall. If you are buying this gate to use as a suspension only gate, buy something else! The product information says it can be used as a suspension or a screw-mounted gate; this is definitely not the case. The gate is also really flimsy feeling. I'm now willing to pay more for a higher quality gate.	
1. 	I shopped around for quite a while and I finally settled on this crib.  It was a more reasonably priced crib that I found.  It arrived within 2 days and was in perfect condition.  The wood is beautiful (we bought the espresso finish).  It wasn't too bad to put together either, might have taken an hour.  I can already tell that the finish will be sensitive to scratching and dings.  A light finish may be less obvious to any blemishes.  Otherwise it is very sturdy and fits a standard crib mattress.  We got the Colgate Classica I and it is a perfect fit!  We also bought the matching changer.  I would recommend this product!	
- 1	i didn't use these very long. they slid all around and didn't catch no poop for me. i don't even think i got to flush one down the toilet.	
1. 	I keep these in my diaper bag wherever I go.  These are small enough to stuff anywhere in case you need to throw a smelly diaper away!	
- 1	I bought this because I had read in a book that it was great for bath time but when I went to use it, the temperature indicator always looked the same. It looks as though it always says hot even when it's not in water. So I've resorted to using it as an expensive bath toy.	
1. 	Halo's cotton sleep sacks are perfect for that transition from winter coolness to springtime temps. I have tried other brands of sleep sacks but keep coming back to Halo. The fit is excellent- the arms holes are snug but not tight and the zipper starts at the top/closes at the bottom so little fingers can't reach the zipper to take it off. There is still some give so that restless sleepers don't twist it. Get two! When one is in the wash, you'll have the other.	
1. 	These have a baby powder scent to them and work fantastic in holding #2 diapers! They are a great deal for 200 count (you can compare them to others that come in a roll and these are by far much, much better). I would only use these when baby had a soiled diaper, but am now learning that they can hold 4-5 diapers at once, so I dispose of #1 diapers in these as well then tie up the sack and throw it in the garbage. I can really tell a difference with the way the bathroom smells now! For getting so much use out of each one, I think the price is unbeatable. I keep a stash of these in the diaper bag as well for use on the go :) So glad I found these on Amazon! I would definitely recommend them.	
1. 	This is definitely a nice-to-have baby item, not a must-have. Though all families are different, we have gotten good use out of our Diaper Genie II. We only use it for dirty diapers, as we throw plain wet ones out with the regular trash. It contains the smell (except for a momentary whiff when you open the lid) and isn't an eyesore. Since we only use it for the dirty diapers, it doesn't fill up as quickly as it would if we used it for all diapers. The benefit to this practice is also that the liners last a LONG TIME.The lid took me awhile to get used to doing 1-handed. At first I had to use both hands, but I've finally figured out where the sweet spot is to push when I open it. Also, you really need to be sure to empty it before it overfills- or you will be squeezing everything to get the next diaper in, and may end up with a mess... if you know what I mean.All in all, I do recommend this product to new moms. I'm not sure if the new version, the Diaper Genie Elite II (with the foot pedal to open the lid) is any good, but I can vouch for this product!	
- 1	One star mainly because my baby doesn't want to have anything to do with it. Normally, she likes to put everything in her mouth or at least plays with it. She doesn't even want to hold it. It's a waste of money and I can't even pass it on to someone else.	
1. 	I didn't even know this existed for my first baby and thankfully i received this as a gift for my second baby. wish i had it sooner!  we're in nyc frequently and it's great to be able to strap this on with my baby and still have 2 hands free for my toddler.  i think this is much more comfortable for my baby than keeping her in the stroller with the cover.  it is definitely wind resistant and light rain resistant.  not for heavy rain.  keeps her very warm and comfy.	
- 1	This is a MUCH smaller seat than most I have seen out there for toddlers.  There is no back to the seat, and no straps so it really is a booster seat only.  However my three-year-old daughter, who is average size, barely fits in and it actually HATES it because it is so small.  For the price, you're much better getting a baby-to-toddler seat with tray and straps than this one.  It'll probably work if you have a very small child and small chairs, but my average-sized dining table and chairs are too big for it.	
- 1	I wouldn't call this much of a safety product. The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs aren't that hard to open. I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a safety item. It's fine as a deterrent, but nothing I would waste money on again.	
1. 	I have really liked this pak n play mattress cover.  They are so darn hard...this softened it up a bit without having to worry about being too fluffy for the baby's safety.  They wash and dry nicely too.	
- 1	Bought and had to return this for 2 reasons:1.  Sizing was wrong, making the coverage area for the breasts a bit weird2.  Skin was irritated after wearing it.	
1. 	I bought this product to serve two purposes. To reduce sliding of the the carseat on my leather seats and to protect my leather seat from the car seat. It has done both! Plan on buying one for our other truck.	
1. 	I bought these mirrors for my twins, and I have to say they were great.  I had only one switched on to play music and lights as trying to listen to both of them out of sync can drive a person nuts.  My twins really liked these mirror not only so that they could see me, but also so they could see themselves.  I loved having the remote which allowed me to switch them on and off without having to reach the mirror.	
1. 	The size seems right - my 22 month old son holds it, and is able to put it in his mouth, but the bristles seem to be spraying out a bit from the limited use already, so I'm not sure how much longer it'll hold up. Seems well designed though, with a thicker handle. It's good that you get two - I pretend to use one while he uses the other since he has to have exactly what I have. Ofcouse, he ends up holding both at the same time as well.	
- 1	This infant insert is basically a mini comforter.  My son hates it, he sweats and gets heat rash - you absolutely cannot use it in warm weather.  I wrote to Ergo and their response was - your son is probably big enough to not have to use it anymore (he was 3 months at the time).  Well that's great, but what about the first three months of not being able to carry him in this carrier.  We opted to not buy another carrier because we spent so much on the Ergo. I would go with a different newborn carrier and possibly buy the Ergo when the baby is bigger if I had to do it again.  Hopefully he will like the Ergo now without it.	
- 1	The price on these were quite reasonable, so I figured I would give them a try.  The first month or so that we used these bottles they worked great - so we ordered a ton of them.  Shortly after we started to have a terrible time with them leaking, despite the &#34;SmartClose&#34; feature.  They would leak in between the nipple and the nipple ring.  After we stopped using them I noticed that my infant's gas dramatically decreased after we stopped using these.  We never used the &#34;EasyMix&#34; mixing paddles, either, since they were just more parts to clean.We ended up switching back to the Playtex Ventaire bottles from our first child and couldn't be happier.	
- 1	Smells Horrible - Rubber smell is overwhelming even after washing it.  We got this thinking it was going to be similar to the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, sold on Amazon, but it s not. It is thicker, more rubbery sounding (squish squish) and tastes and smells horrible.  We are going to buy more of the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, it has a vanilla smell and is all natural rubber as well, much softer in texture and makes no squishing sounds.	
1. 	My son is just about 8 months old now and I figured I would jump online and start reviewing some of the products I have used. When I was pregnant, I found the reviews helpful, so I thought I would add to the feedback....Although I have not tried the more up-to-date pumps, I bought this one because it was more affordable and it has worked just fine for me. I have not had to replace any of the attachments, they have all held up just fine and at 8 months.... its still doing just fine. I'm hoping it will last me for my 2nd baby, seems like it will make it!! Good quality for the price.	
1. 	I had a hard time picking a bed rail since reviews seemed all over the place on all the ones I looked at. Ended up with this one, and am happy with my decision. I am using it for co-sleeping, which they tell you not to do, but it's really only insurance in case my little one does a crazy fast barrel roll and I don't catch her in time:) It took me about 1/2 an hour to put together and install, not too bad, but being a single mom I put together stuff all alone constantly. Pretty easy to hide under the mattress, but in order to do that I have to drag the nightstand way out of the way, so it just stays up most the time. It's reallllly long, which I like for safety, but dislike when I am getting in and out of bed. I sometimes try to go over it, but I'm pretty short so can't do that gracefully. I think for just under 30 bucks and free shipping this was a great deal.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this cart/high chair cover. I love the Skip Hop brand. The pattern is really cute and it has toy loops, which are great. Unfortunately, the material is SO slippery that it won't stay put on any high chair or cart. I will be returning immediately.	
- 1	My son doesn't enjoy this toy...the arms are hard for him to get to make noises...so he gets bored and moves on...it's very soft and cute...great for babies to look at but he doesn't enjoy playing with it at all....even I sometimes can't get it to make the sounds...they should have made it more baby friendly..very disappointed	
- 1	This would be a great product if it actually worked - the features are fantastic - it has a great look - and is compact - long battery life - sensitivity setting etc.  But it simple wont work - range is terrible - cant even go 30ft in our apt.  - also says its in range and then for no apparent reason goes out of range and beeps loudly.  Wanted to love - but now I hate this product - do not waste your money	
1. 	My son zoomed all around the house in this. Great walker! I only hate I didn't find it sooner. It works great on tile and hardwood floors but I'm not sure how it works on carpet.	
1. 	I was looking for a diaper organizer/caddy for my changing station. I have an Ikea baby changing station and I needed an organizer that would hang from it, because I can't velcro something through it. That is exactly why I bought this diaper depot and I love it! Do pay attention to how wide your changing station's side is, it needs to be equal to or less than ~1.25 inches; otherwise, this diaper depot won't fit.I am able to fit some diapers in the middle compartment, place my wipes on top, and keep a few handy things in the side compartments. This allows me to use the entire space of the changing pad for my baby. Otherwise, I'd use some of the space to keep my wipes and diaper on the pad while I'm changing my baby. As she's growing, I need to be able to use the entire space for her and diaper depot helps me do just that. Love it.	
1. 	This is the second potty that I purchased for my son.  The first one, was one that goes on the floor. His bum bum was too big for it, so we went with this one.  He enjoys climbing up the step and sitting on the real toilet like a big boy.  Potty training is a job in itself, but he doesn't shy away from this and fits perfectly on it, even for a bigger bum bum.	
- 1	After reading so many great reviews this was THE one thing I really wanted off my registry. However, I don't see what everyone is so enthralled about. When we brought him home, I felt like he was too tiny for this thing. He ended up sleeping in my arms for the first month because he wouldn't really sleep in it, which I truthfully didn't mind. I wanted him in the same room as us. Once he kind of started sleeping in it, he started breathing really funny in his deep sleep stage. Then one night he literally was gasping for air the way he was positioned (properly I mind you). That was when I decided to start the crib and he has NO breathing issues. Now I know why the doctors recommend sleeping FLAT on their backs.	
1. 	This hamper matches my daughter's room perfectly and she loves helping me do her laundry.  It's short enough she can put the clothes in it herself.  I don't let her play with it though. Not quite sturdy enough when she trys to lay on it.  It serves it's purpose of looking good in the room, while being a functional.	
1. 	This product makes sleeping possible when your body is sore and sleeping on your side feel awkward and uncomfortable.  I highly recommend it!  My husband thought this was a silly and unnecessary way to spend money, and now he agrees with me that it was a necessity.  You will not regret Snoogle Loop!	
- 1	A regular kids  tooth brush worked better for both my kids. My kids just tossed this massagers aside. Not saying it is a bad product,my kids just didn't like it much.	
- 1	UPDATE:  After three months, one of the parent units stopped working.  All the lights came on and no sound registered.  When I contacted the customer service, I was told that the unit was defective and to contact the store from which it was purchased for a refund/exchange.  After six months, I am fed up with this monitor.  The blue light is very bright.  We have to hide the parent unit under the bed, and it still lights up the room.  The parent and child unit seem to lose connection quite frequently, resulting in either no sound received from the child's room or a loud beep until you turn the unit off and on again to reset.  A frequent clicking sound also grates.  After nine months, the other parent unit went kaput.  I definitely do NOT recommend this monitor.Initial review:  We've been using the monitor for about a month now, and it seems to work well.  We haven't noticed any interference.  Our old Sony monitor had channels, which this one does not have, but it doesn't seem to need them.  We've even used the parent unit in the same room as the old Sony parent unit without a problem(one monitor in each child's bedroom).  The parent units are nice and slim with a handy clip.  The monitor does have a bright blue light that blinks when the parent unit is not turned on, which seems a little annoying for the child, so the monitor is better placed out of sight in the child's room.  Also, when you turn the child unit off, the parent units beep if they are on.  The feature is intended to help you find the parent unit, but it has the unintended effect of encouraging you to leave the child unit on at all times and waste electricity.  When the battery runs out of charge on the parent units, the only indicator is a light that turns red, so if the battery runs out in the middle of the night, you would never know.  My old Sony monitor made a beeping sound when the battery was running out.  While it was annoying to be awoken by the beeping noise, at least we knew when the monitor was about to stop working. It doesn't seem to pick up sound quite as well as our old unit in which we could hear baby breathing from several feet away.  With first child, I wanted to hear every breath.  With second child, I can appreciate NOT hearing every breath as long as I hear stirring and sounds occasionally, which the monitor definitely picks up.  The two parent units is very nice because I'm not always backtracking to find the unit before bed--I can leave one downstairs and one upstairs.	
- 1	We try to buy as much made in the USA products as we can for the baby. Though Amazon has labeled these spoons as made in the USA, the packaging clearly states they are made in China. It's too bad.Munchkin, if you're paying attention, I'd pay at least $10 for a set like this made right here at home.	
- 1	We got 8 months out of this. To be fare, we use it constantly. We almost always have it plugged in, but the battery on the receiver barely holds a charge now anyway. Also, the bottom half of the screen is dead, rendering the whole screen useless as well as the special features like vibrate because we cant read the screen to set them.I think I would have rather spent a bit more to have one that lasted.	
- 1	I have used these bottles for my three kids and love them! The problem: these are not the same bottle as pictured! Playtex is redesigning these and sending out the new design instead if the one pictured. The ones in the picture are awe-some! The ones they sent bend halfway to help feeding while sitting up, which isn't a concern I have. The lid rings have a new locking mechanism and are next to impossible to get off, especially with one hand or when hands are wet. The lids that cover the nipples don't stay on worth crap, they don't snap on tight and slip right off. I will be contacting Playtex to see if they will replace them, since I have opened and used them so I can't return them.	
- 1	Our first one came and the light burnt our after 5 minutes of use. Amazon replaced it with this one, which has worked perfectly until now (almost 3 months). The sound and projector light still work but it will not rotate. Looking at other reviews its obvious this is a common flaw with this product. I'm giving it two stars because I really wanted a product that would fully work for a good length of time and did not get that.	
1. 	I have a portable crib mattress that measures 38 1/2 L x 24 W x 3 D (thick) and I wasn't sure if this was going to fit. I just received it and tried it on my mattress and it fits perfectly. If the mattress were bigger in any way it would be too small. I know some people with 5 inch width/thick mattresses have said that this will fit but I have to say I can't see how it would. I wouldn't order it for a mattress bigger than I have stated above. As for quality, it seems fine. My baby hasn't arrived yet so I cannot attest to its efficiency only its size.	
1. 	This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure. It also covered as well as the other plugs :) Easy to use and sturdy.	
- 1	these bottles are not worth the money.. they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles &#62; they are definitely the best on the market.	
- 1	I love Playtex and liners but the 4 OZ ones are just too small.  You can't actually get a full four ounces in these once they are wrapped around the bottle neck.	
1. 	I bought this shopping cart cover because it was cheaper than the other name brands out there that was $45!  It works just as well.  The only little complaint is that the sides are not elastic or secure onto the shopping cart so sometimes it flips up.  Often times it's just fine and works very well!  There's two little side pockets, but don't expect to put too much in it.  It will only fit a small bottle.	
- 1	what a waste of my money! this cup holder would not fit my stroller (Britax B-Agrile) and now im stuck with it! buy this only if you have a tiny framed stroller!	
- 1	Ended up returning this product without using it because it ended up being 'deeper' than I thought it would be. Thought it would hold diapers a different way but the way it's designed didn't allow me to put it where I intended. I'm sure it's a great product ... but I would recommend looking at the dimensions before ordering.	
1. 	Better safe than sorry. Easy to install. Totally toddler proof.	
1. 	So far these are the best I have found. Though they do have one downfall. After weeks or so of abuse from 4 boys ranging  from 1-5 they eventually start to leak. I do wash them in the dishwasher and my kids are in no way easy on them. But they leak proof for a while which is the best yet. We have tried over 10 different brands and so far these are passing. I would give them a 5 star rating except that I cannot find anywhere to buy just lids!!! The cups are insulated and so cute. We have all of the different themes... boy related anyways... no princess stuff here!	
- 1	I am not new to baby carriers... since my daughter was born in July I have owned 2 Moby wraps (which are GREAT), 2 slings and 2 different Infantino's.  I got this one at Babies R Us when my daughter was about 4 or 5 months old.  I loved it.  I only used it in the front and it was fine for a while.  However, she was too tall for it from the beginning and her arms had to go over the straps.  Not very safe, but since she was facing me and didn't move too much, it was fine.My daughter is now 8 months old and just under 20lbs and I think my back is going to break.  She also pushes to see all around which worries me that her arms don't fit in the straps.  I have to make sure to keep a hand on her.  Yesterday I tried to wear her on my back, thinking it would take some of the pressure off, and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out.  You really need a partner to help you.  I even put her on like I normally do and tried to slide her to my back and it worked, but took a lot of time.  Once there, I didn't feel like she was secure enough.  I watched a few videos on YouTube on how to do it and it just wasn't working.  I just ordered an Ergo and I'm really hoping for better results.	
1. 	This pad helps the carseat stay in place/not slide on the leather seats.  It also protects my seat from the inevitable crumbs that fall so they are not rubbing on my seats.Easy to install.I do not use the toy pocket--they are small and hard to get something in/out of--but not needed either, so I didn't mark my score down.	
1. 	I am breastfeeding but feel the need to have a back up plan in case I need to leave so I tried the Avent bottles on the recommendation of my sister.  My 5-month old daughter took right to them.  No nipple confusion!  They are the best!  Now I can be assured that she will be able to eat without me there!	
- 1	These were different than what came with my bottle starter package and I hate these. The sponge comes off after first use. I bought them twice thinking maybe the first one was defective but had same problem.	
1. 	These trays are great for making and freezing your own baby food and freezing breast milk. I also use them to freeze extra chicken broth, tomato paste, or whatever else I want to freeze for later. They wash great in the dishwasher.	
1. 	&#8226;POLYelast TPE/Thermoplastic Elastomer&#8226;Easy to clean -- simply rinse off under running water.&#8226;Food remains in the spill pocket, even if your child moves around a lot.&#8226;Adjustable neckband to fit your growing child.	
1. 	I have four different gates in my house, and this, by far, is the most secure and stable. Therefore, it's at the top of my stairs... the most important place. I feel like I could even sit on that gate, and it's no going to budge.When we have guests over, they have trouble opening it, because you have to squeeze really hard, but I like that I have to squeeze really hard... it keeps my child who is now a clever 3.5 year old from being able to open it do this day.	
1. 	Got a bunch of these to secure some overhead cabinets that have some pretty heavy potential projectiles inside. This is half because we're expecting and half because we live in earthquake country. I know these locks are marketed as being for keeping babies out, but they seem just as fine at keeping things in. When installed properly they definitely stop the door from being opened completely, and though they at first seem a bit flimsy the plastic arms are pretty tough.As an added plus, the arms can be rotated if you want to disable the locks, and they can be positioned in quite a few ways. Just from playing around with these, I'm pretty sure they'll work with most cabinets and drawers. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:1. You do need to drill holes and put screws in. If your cabinet doors are really thin, this could be an issue. If they're made of something other than wood, it probably isn't a good idea.2. Due to the fact they're designed to fit a wide range of furniture, there's no real 'guide' for how to install it. You pretty much have to hold them in place and eyeball the angle and positioning, bearing in mind that you do need space to drill holes and screw it in. I found this was easier said than done and ended up having to move the first set more than once.3. The plastic seems to 'settle' a bit after a while. It's not much, but I noticed with one set that I had installed them so they could close without pushing the arms in. A few days later, they couldn't anymore- the arms seem to have moved.4. There is little margin for error in positioning. The stops are pretty shallow, and you need to position the arms so they will impact the rear of the stop but slide off the front. You have perhaps a quarter of an inch of leeway in either direction. When tied in with #2 this makes proper installation pretty difficult.5. There's no spare parts. Lose or strip a screw, you'll need to go get a new one. Additionally, the screw heads seem a tad narrow for the plastic molds, if you screw them in too hard they'll actually embed in the plastic.Despite these issues I like these locks- they function properly and were inexpensive. Installation was a bit of a pain, but it's not like I'm going to be doing this every day. They're pretty easy to get used to as far as everyday functionality, and if you can't stand them for some reason you can always disable them.	
- 1	Bought it for a trip with our 6 mo to England during winter. Ended not using it because it is just a termo, a very heavy one and does not keep water very hot... Boiled water would stay warm for about 4 h inside the diaper bag. And that's mainly indoors. Better off buying a regular termo or coffee mug that is lighter.	
1. 	Santa bring this turtle on Christmas to my son, he is 5 years old and he love it. Now he has his own sky with stars in the room.	
- 1	I have a 15 month old daughter that has started talking in her sleep so my husband and I decided we needed to buy a video monitor to make sure she was awake before we went into her room because we have accidently woken her up going into her room to check on her after we have heard her start stirring. I started researching video monitors and found the Levana brand had 4+ start reviews on Amazon. (Note: I am an Amazon Prime member and a frequent reader of reviews before I decided to buy an item.) I liked the price of this video monitor compared to the prices of the ones made by Motorola and Summer Infant. It seemed very reasonable and the online reviews of this item were very good. The reviews specifically said the day time color picture was very clear and bright and the night vision worked very well. I did not find either of these to be true with my experience.We set this new monitor up on a Friday night so we were not able to test the color picture on the first day of use. The night vision worked, but did not have a great picture (certain items were very bright and others were blurry). On Saturday late morning when we put our daughter down for a nap, we tested the color picture. The colors on the monitor were completely off and the room has to be extremely well lit for the color picture to even work. When we went to bed Saturday night, the night vision was still working, but by Sunday morning, we woke up to a black and blurry screen. It appears that the night vision LEDs had gone out. I called customer service for Levana on Sunday morning, per the instructions in the manual for the monitor, only to find out you could not talk to anyone until business hours Monday-Friday. The customer service line then walks you through a few trouble shooting measures to try and get the monitor to start working again (i.e. turn the monitor on and off, check the light in the room, etc.). I found this to be completely unacceptable. This is a product that sells items for baby safety. How many working parents are able to call about a defective baby monitor from their office? My husband and I returned this monitor to Amazon and ended up buying a much more, expensive but nicer monitor manufacturer by Motorola from another retailer.if I could give this monitor and Levana zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product as well as the lack of service provided by Levana.	
- 1	I've tried a bunch of different bags. The Nuk bags are ok. Out of the 50 count I had three bags that had holes in the side. So I lost part of my milk as I filled the bag. This is a big deal to me since I don't produce a whole lot of breast milk. Each ounce is precious and losing any is a stress!! I will be switching back to the Lansinoh bags.	
1. 	A friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and I wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top. This was the perfect solution. Looks sturdy and I think it will really meet our needs! :)Here's a link to the changing tray:[...]	
1. 	I still supervise my toddler closely by the fireplace, but this foam gives me a little piece of mind.  If she falls, I know that I've softened the edge of my brick hearth to prevent a trip to the ER.  I have never had problems with her pulling it off (she knows she is not supposed to play with it), and I have removed it and moved to a  new house, and it still sticks just as well to the new hearth.  I'm very happy with this product.	
- 1	this tub says for up to ywo years, we got it for our 8 month old and he is already to big for it, I am not inpressed.  I can only see it being usefull if you travel allot and maybe only have access to a shower.	
1. 	We received this product in a timely manner. Husband put it together rather quickly. Only issue would be that the top drawer on a rare occasion doesn't close properly but it's not a big deal at all. It's very spacious and has a wonderful look. I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby already or one coming.Feb 2013 update: The piece is very easily scratched. We had to move it up an inch and the piece just about fell apart. I am now searching for something more sturdy as I am afraid that even with a wall mount it may decide to fall apart.	
- 1	Thankfully my 2yr daughter hasn't had many accidents, but the one time it happened on the Kiddopotamus, the PiddlePad did not do its job to retain the water and keep the car seat dry.  I suppose it could have been worse, but it was like we didn't use the PiddlePad given how wet the car seat got.  Needless to say I had to remove the car seat cover to clean it.  I don't know if there are any other similar type products but I do not recommend this.	
1. 	We have two of these bibs and use them daily. They are great because they have no cloth parts to get gummed up with food and yucky over time. You can just rinse them off after the meal. The pocket does a good job of catching stray food bits (much better than I expected!), and the bib itself has good coverage for our 13-month-old. We've been using these since our son was 6 months old, and they are holding up very well. The only thing I might change (and this is a small thing) is to offer more adjustability with the Velcro closure, especially at younger ages. Sometimes the neck opening is too big and leaves a gap under the chin where food can escape under the bib and onto clothing, etc. But this is just a quibble. Overall, this is our go-to bib for everyday use! We love it!	
- 1	We have had this for just a few weeks, and it is now totally useless. The screws holding the battery door are a problem. One of them was stripped when we got it, and the door broke as I was trying to get it open to put the batteries into it. No problem, the other screw wasn't stripped so I got that one out and it held on for a few weeks. The door completely broke off last night as my son was turning it on, though, and now the batteries won't stay in to make the thing operational. Since my son likes it so much, I will probably try to rig it with some tape. I wouldn't recommend actually buying it, though.	
- 1	Unfortunately I believed a previous review that this item fits the Baby Bjorn Crib Light 2 and upon checking out when Amazon said the Baby Bjorn is often purchased with the American Baby Waterproof Quilted Crib cover and the fitted sheet - I purchased both.  NEITHER FITS so listen to Baby Bjorn when they say ONLY Baby Bjorn sheets fit our Baby Bjorn crib light 2!	
- 1	I got this thinking that my son would love it and have easy time holding on since it has that loop on the top. My son doesn't like it maybe played with it couple times since I've had it. I don't know how to clean it to get the rubbery smell off. I tried wiping it and running it under the water (covering the hole where it squeaks) but it still smells pretty rubbery. I say try a friends out first before investing in this toy. Your baby will either love it or not care about it.	
1. 	she loves massaging her gum with this all the time. wished it was more pink than purple.	
1. 	Add me to the huge list of fans! We bought one about a year ago, wanting to use it for... I don't even remember. But since then, we've used it for naps, for &#34;campouts&#34; in the living room, for time out spots since we have two toddlers and putting both in one room is just.. not wise, and it's been fantastic.It has survived a potty training toddler, two toddlers sleeping on it (not sure how...) and many many spills.It did not, however, survive daddy sitting on it. It got awfully bent. Still usable, but not pretty.I love that it's so lightweight, and easily folds away. It's also easy to put out in the yard and spray down with a hose after a potty training accident.I do not love that it doesn't support more weight, but mostly because I'm jealous.	
- 1	It just wouldn't fit in our living room because the screws don't extent out long enough to deal with baseboards. I consider that a serious design flaw. we returned it for that reason. it also didn't strike me as totally sturdy compared to a more expensive Kidco gate that we settled on.	
1. 	It's beautiful, more sturdy than it looks and is so easy to put together. It took about 20 mins to assemble. Be careful with the metal corners when you put them on, they will scratch the wood if you scrape it by accident while trying to line up the holes. Comes with teething rails, which was a nice surprise. Baby is on the way, can't wait to see how she fits in it. The mattress it comes with is nothing more than a thin plastic pad, so purchase a good one! The frame alone is worth every penny =)	
- 1	The ear muffs only work if the baby's head does not rest on anything.  While holding or nursing my three-month old son, the ear muffs would move around and scrunch up his ears.  Perhaps they would work better on a six month plus child?  But they did look very cute.  Would not buy again.	
1. 	Thanks to finding the right shield size, I now produce more milk per pumping.  I highly recommend finding the right size for you.	
1. 	My son zoomed all around the house in this. Great walker! I only hate I didn't find it sooner. It works great on tile and hardwood floors but I'm not sure how it works on carpet.	
- 1	I got this as a gift for someone and I was embarrassed to give it.  The frame is cheap and the material for the prints isn't great either.  I found a similar product at the discovery store that was way better.  It is not worth the money.	
1. 	great with bananas. haven't tried it with apples or pears yet. But granddaughter loves it. It is convenient for the mother as well and you can take it anywhere with you	
- 1	Reviews were great so I bought it. Waste of money. Doesn't recline enough for them to even call it a &#34;reclining&#34; stroller. Feels super cheap and rickety. Very bumpy ride. My daughter couldn't begin to nap in this - and she naps anywhere. Regret the purchase. Spend the extra money and get an uppababy g-lite or something. Wish I had.	
- 1	I loved this hamper initially as the fabric portion is well made, vibrantly colored, very functional and adorable. I love that the middle net portion comes out easily to take to the laundromat. After a couple weeks of use though the wooden support became very wobbly and the bottom bar fell out. I reinserted the bar for a couple more weeks of use but the support is now officially broken after 7 weeks of use. If I thought I could find a new support frame, I wouldn't be so upset since I love the rest of the hamper, but I don't know if that is going to happen so it may be useless now and it cost too much to only get 7 weeks of use out of it.	
- 1	This cup is hard to drink from - couldn't get my 2 year old son to learn to use it. Don't waste your $$.	
- 1	There are several things I like about this toothbrush, such as the length of the handle, the comfortable grip, and the bright colors.  However, on every toothbrush we've used the bristles have fallen out after just a couple months of use.  When it first happened, I thought it was a fluke.  I threw away the second toothbrush in the pack (mine was a multi-pack) as a precaution and purchased a second toothbrush from a pack of one.  After a couple of weeks, this toothbrush lost another bristle from the head!  This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed, and I no longer feel safe cleaning my baby's teeth with brushes from this company.	
1. 	This seat is fantastic for people who have a small dining area and already trip over two decent-sized dogs.  It attaches to a kitchen chair and is at exactly the right height for my very large five-month-old to sit at the table - although we prefer to use the tray, since it is easier to clean.  This makes feeding a snap, and the seat fits in our sedan's trunk easily for road trips.  It's not as adjustable as a high chair, particularly height-wise, but it will adjust for girth.  Overall, we're very pleased.	
1. 	I love this, but its big...real big. I love it, my son loves it and it keeps him and his stuff contained. I have told many people about this item. i would say it should be left up and not taken up and down all the time. I could see how other reviews had brake issues with the play yard, however I have not had any and i think its because I leave it up in one area.	
- 1	If you have a shorter faucet, don't buy this item. It won't work properly, and the water will just spew out the side of it all over the floor.	
- 1	The old lids were good the new lids don't let enough air back into the cup so after child has sucked for a few seconds the spout inverts back into the cup.  You have to remove the lid, allow air back into the cup and the spout to return to normal position and then put the lid back on.  I have no idea why the company would change this.  I compared the old with the new and it is different.  They also drip so if they are not sitting upright, they will leak water.  The good is they are BPA free and easy to hold but I would look for another brand.	
- 1	If you don't care that a device looks like it was poorly manufacturer and might be aesthetically lacking, then this might be a good chair. But I wanted to bring your attention to the very poor construction, or quality control of this product.Before purchasing it, look at some of the USER uploaded photographs where you can clearly see the eating tray. In the MANUFACTURER photos, this tray looks very smooth, like you would expect. No crevices, just a smooth plastic surface where the baby will eat. Now if you look at some of the user pictures, you'll start to notice crevices and lines that go all over the device - like dents - and not very subtle they are obvious enough to be noticeable in a picture. In person, these are much worse.So while the functionality may be fine, and I should probably rate this product 3 stars, the amount of positive review without a single mention of this issue is puzzling to me. Even users who have uploaded pictures where you can see the issue, don't even mention it in their review. Maybe I have higher expectations of how plastics are made.The crevices/dents are directly related to how it's built underneath. Anywhere there are lines underneath, you see the crevices above. When I first got my order, I figured I had just gotten a defective product, since it is not mentioned here. So I got a replacement. The first thing I did was check the tray, and here it was again, the exact same issue. The same crevices, in the same locations, directly linked to the manufacturing of it. So now I am left to wonder: was there a bad batch? Are all these chairs like this? Did I get two defective products in a row?Then I started looking at the pictures users uploaded and I started seeing the issues there, so now I know it's a more widespread issue.Again - if you don't care about how it looks, then this chair will do fine. I hadn't seen this poorly constructed plastic items in a loooong time.If you have questions, or if you purchased the device and it doesn't have those crevices on the eating tray, do let me know in the comments.Thank you.	
1. 	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.	
1. 	This organic cotton stuffed carrot is a really cute toy for a baby.  My son isn't overly enthused about it, but makes a really neat set along with the other stuffed veggies by Under the Nile.  The carrot in particular isn't real soft, and the outer fabric is similar to t-shirt fabric, unlike the mushroom that is more soft and cushy with a terry-cloth outer fabric.  So far I just purchased the mushroom and carrot, because I didn't want to spend the money on the entire set with the wooden bin before knowing if my son would be interested in it.  I'm not going to purchase the other veggies because he is 9 months old didn't find these to be very entertaining.  The Under the Nile organic veggies would make a great gift for a younger infant.	
- 1	I bought this based on the - mostly good reviews- however, I am giving a warning.. read the bad reviews and take them to heart.. everything stated... Stiff material that hurts then, sticks in their throat, velrco easily undone.. its all true! beware! this will be like throwing your 12.00 OUT OF THE WINDOW.	
- 1	I thought this diaper cover was going to be more like the FLIP diaper cover brand. I read all the reviews and it seemed like this was going to be a good bargain. I was thoroughly disappointed. Every time my son went to the bathroom it leaked through the diaper cover, it was basically just like wearing a cloth diaper with no cover at all. We ended up throwing this out, it was a waste of money.	
- 1	I have several of these, as my baby is a &#34;happy spitter&#34; with frequent spit up episodes. We go through 6-10 bibs a day.  We own the first generation of these, where the Velcro was abrasive,they stayed on better but left friction marks on my babies neck,then we bought these, the second generation and the Velcro is much softer but stops sticking /working after a few washes, now I can't keep the bibs on her during the feeds, she's just tugs them off at 5 months.Bottom line, I would buys dozens of these if they snapped. The thick rim around neck is super helpful in keeping sneaky spit up off the clothes, but with the Velcro issues, they are worthless. I will be buy the Aden and anis snap bibs instead going forward.	
- 1	I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good...  I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little, and we LOVED it.  It was much softer, and much larger.  It was completely round along the sides, without this weird S-shape, and it definitely caught more food.The newer models aren't as soft.  The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby's hair caught in it (ouch!), and worst of all, the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib, and not in the bib pocket where it should go.  All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side, these bibs do wash really well.  I've even stuck them in the dishwasher, and they came out just fine.So here's my plea to Baby Bjorn: RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK, PLEASE.  They used to be much much better.	
1. 	These are the best bibs I've found.  Convenient pouches, machine washable, and cute patterns.  Also, they hold up pretty well.  Recommended.	
1. 	I love these bottles though a little more timely to clean they really help with gas. I have used the natural shape nipple  as a transition between breast and bottle because it most resembled my nipple shape and my son did great.	
1. 	We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.	
1. 	Baby is breastfed. These work well for childcare providers to transfer warmed milk into.Great price and easy to use. Shipped very fast!	
- 1	It is both too long, too bulky, and too filled. I hated and could not get comfortable on this. Would not recommend	
- 1	These pads are too small and too thick. They fall right out of your bra when you go to nurse your baby. They also look very unflattering under clothing. I like the Lansinoh pads much better as they are thin and large which means they can be folded over when you open the bra flap to nurse. Don't waste your money on Avent pads!	
- 1	We used these bibs several times and they did pretty well in the washing machine (we didn't dry them, per the instructions). The snap closure on one bib broke after about a month of use. Not the best product...very cute but not durable.	
- 1	We had a regular spring mattress but it sagged in the middle. Since our baby loved sleeping on our foam mattress, I thought we'd get a foam core mattress for her crib.  We didn't expect the vinyl cover to be so hard.  For a bed that was so hard, it still sagged in the middle where we needed to put a piece of plywood under the mattress to keep her from rolling face down into the middle. It's a chore to get her to sleep in her own crib, no matter how many crib covers we put on it. We've had to resort to getting a foam overlay which seems to make her a little happier.  Even I thought this bed is too plastic with no give. I wouldn't recommend this mattress to a friend.  For our next crib for our second child, we're not making the same mistake again.	
1. 	My baby sleeps in a HALO SleepSack for every nap.  I love that it keeps him snuggled and safe without a blanket.  He can sleep with his arms up, down, or outside the swaddle part, so he can be comfortable.  This is also much easier to put him in than swaddling him in a blanket.	
- 1	Your baby has to love that kind of paci, which mine dont. You cannot attach a different kind of paci to this, it just has that one paci on it. Which also means it cannot be removed and steralized.	
1. 	I bought this bottles for my newborn daugther, and at first we were amaze because she never had colic or gas (just minimun). But now, 3 months later, she still doesnt have any gas or colic, so its the same if she drinks from dr brown or avent. So now I change to avent, because they are easier to clean, bigger, the caps are better and all the avent products grow with your baby, so now I am an extrictly avent mom.	
1. 	This base fit perfectly with our car seat model. It definitely did the job.HOWEVER, before purchasing, definitely look into which models fit with this base.	
1. 	great toy, works well on place flights.  occupies child and keeps them happy.	
- 1	We bought one of the starter sets and two fo the 4 packs and have been really disappointed.  We installed the two from the starter set first.  One was broken and wouldn't latch and the other had such a sensitive magnet in it the nails in our cabinet door caused the latch to be permanetly down so it wouldn't lock.  We are not happy with these and will be returning the rest of them.	
1. 	This blanket is so soft and keeps my baby feeling secure. Only one is necessary because it adjusts with your baby's growth. My baby is 6 months old and we are still using it just to swaddle her bottom part. (Her arms stay out because she is so long) My baby has always been in the 90th percentile for her weight and off the charts on her heighth and the blanket still worked great for her. I will mention that I've recently noticed a little hole where the wraps are, but it's nothing we can't fix by sewing.	
- 1	I totally understand that crib mattresses need to be firm in order to be safe, but seriously, this thing is much harder than is necessary to be considered safe.  We purchased the Nook pebble mattress for my 1st born (which I LOVE,) but during my 2nd pregnancy when we found out we were having twins, I went hunting for more affordable options.  We decided on the Colgate Classica I based on the review in the Baby Bargains book. I wish I would have spent just a little more $$ or maybe just tested a few more mattresses out before buying 2 of these concrete slabs. The girls refuse to sleep on these.  My son just transitioned into a twin bed, so we gave one of the girls his Nook mattress, but now I've got to look for a mattress topper for the other baby.On a positive note, this mattress is constructed well and is super light which makes for changing the sheets very easy.	
- 1	I tried it on my umbrella stroller and the cover looked hideous. It looked like I was pushing a big, grey, box. The fit was very poor and there wasn't much ventilation.Unable to refund this junk since I removed the blue film on the plastic panels.Waste of 50$	
1. 	I use these whenever I need to pump, and I don't have access to a sink (e.g. in my car). I actually had half a pack left from pumping for my daughter that sat in a bag until I started pumping for my son; they were still moist. I used them for pumping with my first two, and I am now using them with my third. A must have for a mom who has to pump in random locations.	
1. 	We registered for this diaper pail after a lot of research online. Now that our son is 8 weeks old, we've loved it so much we purchased another one so we have one on both floors of the house. It's very easy to use - just flip the handle - and allows absolutely no odor to escape. It's very easy to empty and change the bag. What I love is it uses regular trash bags so there's no expensive refills to keep purchasing. This is what I'm going to buy for every baby shower I go to from now on!	
- 1	This highchair ticks me off to no end! I want to buy different one, but feel stupid to throw this one away after paying so much for it.Pros:-Reclines, we used this feature a lot in the beginning.-Supposedly easy to pull up to the table. We haven't tried this yet.-AttractiveCons:-The worst thing is that it's a nightmare to get the tray on. It slides on from the front and the baby kicks it and brings her knees up blocking it. On other highchairs the tray often comes down onto the arms. You have to hold the tray just right and put your foot on the bottom bar to keep the whole thing from sliding back and it still often takes several attempts to get it on. I should have known when I saw the floor sample at a store and the arms were completely torn up from people trying to work the tray. The problem is that the arms just don't line up properly. They need to be pushed together just a little bit. It helps to push them together while putting on the tray, but that takes 4 hands.-Crevices everywhere that food gets stuck in, also gets between the two pads, the tray and the tray cover, and in the buckle.-There is no reason to have such a large and awkward tray-The wheels always get locked by mistake. Don't know how it happens. I'm afraid I'm going to scuff up my floor moving it and not realizing the wheels are locked.-Huge pain to adjust the belt for a 6 month old. You have to take it apart to get the belt small enough. Now that she's 9 months, I need to take it apart again to make bigger.	
1. 	I don't take food out and about yet for my son - he is only 7 months old right now.  But we do use these at home to mix up foods for him and heat or keep fresh in the fridge.  The sizes are really convenient!  And, they are great for taking stuff to work!!  I use these for salsas and dressings, toppings, etc., for my lunches for work!  I love them!  They are dishwasher and microwave safe - can't beat them.  I am so glad I bought these.  I know we will use them more and more often as time goes on!	
- 1	I bought this Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD seat seat for my 26 month-old daughter, who now wants to eat right up at the table like mom and dad instead of from her high chair tray.  Her Boon Flair high chair has a removable tray, but the seat is incompatible with tables (like ours) that have a lip or skirt around the edge.  The BoosterPOD has pretty low sides and a deep seat, so my daughter's legs could easily fit between the seat and the bottom of my table lip without squeezing.But honestly, that's the only reason I didn't give this booster seat 1 star.  One of the main reasons I purchased the BoosterPOD is that Prince Lionheart claims that it's non-toxic.  Our family tries to avoid synthetic materials and suspicious chemicals whenever possible, especially in items that our daughter eats or sleeps on, so obviously, the manufacturer's description of this item as non-toxic, BPA-free and phthalate-free was a big draw.  However, when I first opened the box and took the BoosterPOD out, I immediately noticed a strong chemical smell, especially coming from the underside of the chair.  My daughter was so excited to try out her new booster seat that I let her eat breakfast on it despite my misgivings, but I noticed that she didn't eat nearly as much as she usually does.  I can't help but wonder if she was as bothered by the chemical smell of the BoosterPOD as I was.  In any event, for quite awhile after she got up from her meal, her clothes still had a chemical smell from the BoosterPOD seat.  Needless to say, this chair is being returned.Grade: D	
- 1	Too expensive for what it's worth.Easily breaks (little plastic already broke even before using it).The inconvenience of it is that when you switch the bugaboo cameleon handle to the other side, everything in the cup holder will spill out due to the angle of the installation.I also find myself hitting the cup holder to walls, myself, etc. because it just sticks out to the side too much.	
1. 	It doesn't get any easier than this product.  Boy, am I glad that I got this at my shower.  I have never used anything more in my entire life than I have this guy.  It sterilizes my Avent breast pump as well.  As an aside, don't just rely on your dishwasher to sterilize your bottles and your breast pump.  For some reason, I never felt comfortable anyway just depending on it and put the bottles from the dishwasher into this sterilizer.  Well, I found out later that it was a great thing I was doing that because our dishwasher was not heating the water the way it was supposed to and nothing had been sterilized!  You can't always depend on one thing to do the job and since it's your baby's health involved here, take the extra step and make sure with this item.  I'm glad I did!  Plus, it's just so very easy to use.	
- 1	I haven't opened the packaging so cannot comment on the functionality as I will be returning these spoons.  I did not realize that these were disposable spoons - I found that description in the very small print at the bottom of the item page.  Very disappointing. I already create enough waste to not add these spoons to it.UPDATEIt was more trouble than it was worth to send back the spoons so I have been using them, or that should be I used them.  Once.  The plastic is scratchy around the spoon (you can see the seam) and I was not comfortable scraping the excess food off of my 6 month old baby's face with them as they looked very uncomfortable on her skin.  I think I was lucky not to actually scratch her delicate skin.  I will still pay the $7 odd to get the OXO spoons which I love, though whilst I only get 2 for $7 compared to the 10 for $8, I will be happier with them and I won't have to throw them away as they break down.	
1. 	It's stylish! That's all we carry when we're out. But I wish the pad is a bit longer. At 6 month, my baby's bum is now at the edge of the pad, so I don't know how much longer we could use it. It would be better if the plastic wipes container has a dispensing slot like those in the wipes's tub. But overall, we're very happy with it.	
1. 	Holds all of his baby food jars..EARTH'S BEST ORGANICS HAVE BPA..Just something I recently discovered.This thing is awesome, holds all of his foods and it looks really cute.I keep it fully stocked, and it holds all of his munchkin spoons on the top.One negative star because if you turn it the wrong way by the shelf it falls down.. LOL.That could be a messy expensive mistake so I'm really careful with it.Enjoy yours, you'll love it too!!! &lt;3	
- 1	I ordered this at the same time as the Kidsme feeder and never ended up using this. It's awkwardly made and way too big for our teething baby who was about 5 months when I ordered and is now 9 months but still would not use it. You can not easily stick food or anything in it because of a stick that goes up through the middle. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can't figure out how this thing would be good. As others have said it just doesn't fit much food either.	
1. 	I purchased this pump before I had my duaghter. It was great, expect you have to lean forward in order for the milk to collect in the bottles, otherwise is just flows down you chest. But I'm sure other pumps have this same problem. Otherwise it was very comfortable and easy to use. I purchased the soft cups off the website, which are more comfortable han the hard plastic dups that come with the machine.	
- 1	This is awful. The small holes around the caterpillar and plastic circle that goes around the ball makes the holes underneath very small. It was truly upsetting to have to jump out of the shower because my screaming 9 month old had her finger stuck in one of the holes. I threw it in the trash.	
- 1	This book sucks and I'm so disappointed that I even wrote in it because now it's just garbage. There's a lot of room for photos, but there's NO special sections for major milestones like first tooth, first roll over, and it's only one year and my others are 5 year books. This is just a big time disappointment. Family tree pages, a whole page of weight and length, baby shower info, cost and leaders at time of birth and first birthday- I feel like that's not even the important stuff that your kids want to know when they're older...	
- 1	This sippy cup is so close to being perfect.  My son is 1 and really likes straw cups.  We live in Phoenix and really need an insulated cup for outings.  Finding a good insulated straw cup has proven to be impossible.  This cup does have a lot of great features: removable handles, cover, and stainless steel with a rubber sleeve make it awesome for little hands and keeping beverages cold.  However there is one huge downfall.  The valve you use for the straw attachment is NOT leak proof.  The straw valve is completely open and only serves to attach the straw to the top of the cup.  If the cup gets tossed, like ours do frequently, the straw will leak lots of fluid.  This cup would be perfect if the straw was able to attach to the sippy valve (which is leak proof, unless shaken upside down) AND to the open straw valve.  It would then be the perfect cup for all ages.  Leak proof sippy with some fluid restriction for younger kids(if your kid is like mine, if he gets too much in his mouth, like he does with this cup with the straw valve, anything extra gets spit out.  Which equals spit out milk all over the place.)  For older kids the wide open straw valve is perfect - wide open straw cup with out any fluid restrictions for those that know not to throw the cup :)  I really really hope they make a spill proof valve for the straw.  Regardless my son totally loves this cup - even in sippy mode since we're not at the point of using the straw without it leaking like crazy.UPDATE:  At first I thought the sippy valve was leak proof.  Wrong.  We used it in the stroller the other day and it wasn't upright the entire time - it spent some time on its side - and we ended up with wet pants and a wet stroller.  So disappointed! It seems that if the cup is on it's side that any tiny movement will case drops of liquid to come out.  A few drops I wouldn't have a problem with.  But this leaked so bad our stroller was totally wet and my sons pants were soaked.  At this point I'm going to stick with playtex insulated straw cups.  While they are plastic and don't keep beverages as cold they don't leak for us EVER.  I'd rather bring a little cooler pack than deal with milk all over my son, car, stroller, etc.	
1. 	My wife love this botles.Is for a better way of feeding our new born.I cant wait to use them.	
- 1	I love the cute sayings on these, and that's about as far as it goes. They are so thin they couldn't possibly absorb much after bath time. Very VERY thin.. I got the same style of towels through SpaSilk and they are at least 100% thicker & softer. I suppose you get what you pay for..	
1. 	My son spits up after he is fed and he is a heavy drooler. I was using terry cloth bibs and they worked, but would soaked after a few minutes and then it would soak into his clothes. I was changing his bib and cloths about every 30 minutes to prevent a rash. I bought these hoping they would help and they do! My son will spit up or drool all over these and his clothes stay dry. I still have to change the bib after about an hour, but that's far better than having to change his clothes too. Plus he stays dry so I don't have to worry about a rash.The velcro is a little rough, and I'll never understand why a manufacturer would make the roughest (hook) side face the skin, but you can always just put the bib on backwards so the loop side is facing the baby's skin. That way if it's not completely covered it will not rub the roughest part on their skin.I do wish the terry cloth part of this was a little thicker, but otherwise I love these and have purchased 2 sets.	
1. 	Not sure why this is listed as a toy; i rated this as functional dinnerware/cups not a toy.I purchased the original First Years cup set with the sippy cup style and moved on to the straw set when my toddler was ready. They are just as sturdy with a non-flexible straw. The colors are very vibrant with matching tops and straws.The only suggestion I have is insert the straw AFTER you have placed liquid inside and capped it. Otherwise the liquid will squirt right out.The cups wash up really well in the dishwasher. The straws fall through my utensil container so i do have to hand wash those, but that is the only hassel.Overall the cups are great for toddlers. My daughter can drop it and as long as it does not land on the top side it rarely leaks.	
1. 	This is the best of the diaper trash systems. No special bags to buy -- completly contains the smells - easy to use.  This is one baby gadget you'll be really glad you bought.	
- 1	I was looking for a spoon for our little one and I thought these would be amazing, and I was extremely disappointed.The rubber that was attached to the spoon was coming apart. When we got them I washed them and after I washed them I inspected them and noticed that the rubber on one was already peeling back from the metal. I did not even use these. I didn't feel that they were safe for a baby; if the rubber was already peeling back and they hadn't even been used yet, what was going to happen after these spoons are used all the time? I didn't think they were a safe purchase.Instead I went with another plastic spoon; not what I was looking for but a safer option.	
1. 	These bottles are absolutely fantastic! They are so easy to use and they cut down on gas wonderfully. I just cannot say enough good about them - well, here's an idea. I have 8 of them! The nipples can be a little pricey at times but check out the stores and babies rus - they're on sale at different times in the year and you can save about 15-20% on them. I wouldn't use anything else.  Target puts them on sale as well.  The silicone nipples are so much nicer than the rubber ones on regular bottles, and if you nurse and use bottles as a supplement, these are the more like yourself so the baby has an easier taking it.  The bottles withstand hundreds of washings in a dishwasher without the markings being washed off.  By far, the best bottle on the market in my humble opinion.  I received one in a gift set and my husband immediately ran out and bought a week's worth - they're just so much easier to use and they fit so well on the fridge shelves, plus those huge plastic caps that fit over the nipples are easy to remove and makes you feel like everything is cleaner.  Highly recommend!	
1. 	After debating over a few brands and reading many reviews we decides to go to babies'r'us and give our top picks a test drive through the store. This stroller won me over even after reading the complaints people had about it. We found that it's easy to push, the handles are nice and comfy, not to mention high enough so that you don't have to hunch over to push the stroller, even my husband is comfy pushing it. It comes with an awesome rain/weather cover(that we have already used and love! My son is very comfy in it and I love that it reclines!!! Someone said the reclining feature is bad and it's hard to recline a sleeping baby..this is so far from true, it is so easy to recline and you can do it as slow and smooth as you like. I have no problem reclining it with out waking my son.In comparing it to the Maclaren Triumph... the handles were higher, the seat reclines more and much easier, the umbrella has a pocket on the back (it's were I stick all my things, like my phone and keys), it has a foot rest that can be put up for sleeping babies(the Maclaren dosn't) and it was easier to fold up.I've had no problem's with the back like other people, the basket is small but it's an umbrella stroller! If your looking for something that holds a diaper bag, a purse and your groceries you should be looking for a full size stroller or a small SUV. It's  nice and small and doesn't take up the entire trunk like our travel system stroller did. I put a diaper,wipes,a bottle, the rain cover and a burp rag in the basket and we're good to go!I bought a cup holder to attach to the handle or I sometimes just put my drink in the hood pocket or the basket. My husband wasn't happy with the $80 price tag, but after checking it out at the store he gave in! =) It's the pefect umbrella stroller, we love love love it!!!	
1. 	I have a hard to entertain baby and this toy is great.  In the beginning the musical star startled him and we left it off.  He loved the mirror the best.  Now, at 4 months, the star is his all time favorite.  We have added pictures of smiling babies and cute animals to the picture holder and I change the picture everyday.  It helps to rearrange everything often.  He loves the teather ring.  We've also added some chimes (from another gym) that he thinks are great.  I don't know how long he'll be entertained by this now that he is crawling around some, but so far it's his favorite toy and allows me a good 20 minutes of free time - which for him is amazing!	
1. 	This tub was a great purchase!! I wanted a simple tub that I didnt need a users manual to figure out how it works and didn't have mechanical parts that could get waterlogged and broken. This tub does not disappoint! The design is sleek and simple, fitting perfectly into the sink. My baby has always been long so would stick his spindly little legs out of the sling, but it definitely served its purpose until he got to big. Now he lounges in the tub itself and loves his tubby time! You still need to tip it over to get every last bit of water out but that's really no big deal. I also love the convenient place to put shampoo etc! Great little tub!	
1. 	My baby loved a tight swaddle - something I could never do with a blanket.  This made it so easy, especially after middle of the night diaper changes.  It's very soft and easy to wash.  Makes so much sense!	
1. 	My son has taken to this just fine when going potty in stores, etc.  It is a very good price for the product.  It takes a minute to figure out the first time you use it, then very, very easy.  I like the bag it comes with for storage, though just a simple plastic bag.  I do worry sometimes that it might collapse, though, which is why I only give 4 stars!	
- 1	nipples leak ugh... but it if your gonna just use the bottle only. the bottle is large so its good for hungry babies	
- 1	This product will ruin any veneer finish you put it on.  We used it for the coffee table, and then threw out the coffee table because it was ruined.Also, at 6 months our son could easily rip this off anyway.  Pointless product	
- 1	i bought this product expecting that it would have an option to keep the gate open when you go in and out of a room quickly, instead it swings shut immediately and you have to use both hands to open the gate again. for that reason i wouldn't buy this product again.	
- 1	The fabric is great but this is best for a toddler of 2 years or more as it is way too big in size for a baby.	
- 1	The spoon always tips and falls out of the baby's bowl...food goes everywhere. Opt for something with a lighter handle.	
- 1	The idea is good but unfortunately the toys don't close very well.  It take a lot of adult effort to put the toys together and when they are together they don't suck in much water.  My kids just use these toys as cups but at least they dry fully.	
1. 	I use this when I am pumping on the road, or those really bad nights when you just pump and go right back to sleep.  Seems to do the job, my baby is still alive and kicking so it must be cleaning it well enough that I havent given her spoiled milk or whatever.  Like I said I use it for a quick clean when I dont have access to water.	
- 1	This pillow sounded like the best thing in the world. I got it out to try it and immediately found that I was too tall for this pillow, unless I slept in a curled position (I am 6ft tall). You have to use the dedicated head part for this which seemed like a rock and the material was not soft. For the money this should have been the best thing ever. I was so bummed, I really thought this was going to be great. So I went and found a 10 dollar body pillow and a 10 soft cover. I also get to use my own head pillows. Wish I could have gave this a better review!	
1. 	These are great in the bath.  They float, stick and are great for my 8 mo old to suck on (his favorite hobby these days).  My only complaint is that there is only 1 of each letter (I should have paid closer attention to the number of pieces when ordering).  Not a huge deal, but we can't spell my son's name out, (we need 2 R's).  Oh well, they do their job otherwise.	
1. 	LOVE this brand, really the whole line is great- the style is so refreshing no goofy cartoony stuff! Quality, softness, size, style are all A+ in my book.  These receiving blankets are also swaddles, and can triple as a lightweight stroller blanket, many uses for them- I have 4 different colors!	
1. 	This is a great product. When my son was born he slept in the bed next to me in this. I loved it because I felt better knowing he was right there next to me. I could check on him in the middle of the night (10xs a night if I wanted to) without have to get up out of bed. I didn't worry about rolling over him either because of the hard top and sides on this sleeper. My only complaint would be that my son out grow this fairly quickly. It was just too short; I wished that they designed this to fit longer babies, and for that I took off 1 star. Other than that I would recommend this product.	
1. 	I have (soon to be) 7 daughters. The youngest are age 3 and 17 months (and I'm due again in 2 months). This stroller is great. It gives my independent 3 year old the option to sit or stand and she loves it. She likes riding on the grocery cart the same way so this stroller seemed to be perfect. We liked it so much that I purchased the triple stroller from E bay (used). I'm sure we will get tons of use out of it as well. I like that it holds the carseat with no fuss and another child can still ride comfortably. I will definitely recommend this stroller to anyone with more than one child under the age of 5/6 and the triple if you have a litter like I do! It is well worth the price.	
1. 	This is a lot bigger than I anticipated. I know it says jumbo, but I just didn't realize how jumbo it would be. It works great though and holds a lot of stuffed animals!	
1. 	This product is NOT a waste at all....You just have to read the directions! IT says right in the booklet that after you put the wipes in the warmer you have to add a 1/2 a cup of water  over the top of the wipes and turn on the light and wait for it to warm the wipes. (If you put the water at the bottom of the machine and turn it on then the top wipes dry out and the bottom wipes are saturated). The wipes do cool however a few seconds after pulling it out of the machine..but then again how long are you planning to hold the wipe in your hand? Pull out the wipe and wipe the baby's tushy and throw the wipe away and pull out a new one. Make sure that you close the top of the machine when you are not using the warmer to keep the most recent wipe warm and moist. Register for the item, if you like it then great, if you don't you don't lose anything....	
- 1	I had thought by reading the reviews that this would be a good mirror for our little one in the back seat.  I was pretty disappointed to see that it distorts the reflection quite a bit so you have to have it perfectly angled so that the babies head isn't looking 12 inches longer than normal.  It also is very sensitive to movement and I'm finding myself constantly adjusting it.  I unfortunately purchased this months in advance so it'll have to work.	
1. 	My baby is almost 3 months old now, and we bought this swing when she was about 3 weeks old.  I like that it's small and doesn't take up much room in our small apartment.But my baby has never been that impressed with it.  She doesn't seem interested in the toys or the music, so when we put her in it awake, she will usually cry to get back out within 10 minutes.  She has recently started checking herself out in the mirror, though, so maybe she'll learn to like it still.However, I still love it for napping.  She sleeps in it quite comfortably for her morning nap every day.	
1. 	I bought these with high hopes of using them with my son. I honestly never remembered I had them on the shelf and hardly used them. My friends love them and got a lot of use out of them.	
1. 	I love using the Playtex Nurser and all of the supplies for the nursers.  I used these bottles when I had my sons forty years ago. My boys had less gas and now I am using these for my grandchild.  I was upset  when I could not find these in stores anywhere. I was greatful when a friend of mind suggested I look on line.That's where I found them.Why are these not sold in stores anymore?  You need to get these back on selves in the stores. It's easier to go to a store to buy them, then wait for the bottles or supplies to be delivered.  I bought $125.00 worth of these bottles with nipples, inserts, tops and bottles, plus the starter kits.Please bring back to stores.Thank you for a great bottle which may I add is the closest thing to a mothers breast.Please again, bring them back to stores.I am a true beliver that this is the greatest bottle ever made.	
- 1	I got this pillow for my 22 mo old son when we transitioned him into his toddler bed.  The pillow comes with its own satin pillowcase which is GREAT for curly or dy hair like his BUT the pillow isn't flat at all. Toddler pillows should be flatish.  Needless to say my son doesn't use his pillow.	
- 1	My baby likes this but I have to watch him because he easily makes himself gag with it. The disc should be higher or adjustable	
1. 	We got this wipe warmer from my aunt for a shower gift. We had a different warmer on our registry. I read all the reviews for this warmer and returned the one we wanted originally. I couldn't be happier with this warmer. Yes, water does gather on the lid, but runs down the inside of the warmer, thus rewetting the pad in the bottom of the warmer that keeps the wipes from drying out. Zac doesn't get a surprise with a cold wipe and we don't get a surprise from, well, those surprises boys &quot;spring&quot;  on you! This is a must have and I recommeded it to many expectant mothers I know!	
- 1	Useless for New England weather or any other area where it is actually cold and windy.The wind comes into the warmers easily as it has an OPEN gap in the fingers area, you need to wear gloves underneath these, which I tried to do, but it is almost impossible to get your hands in bc of the material inside the warmersWhat's the point of having these if you need your gloves? A waste of money. Don't buy.I'll post some pictures (if allowed).	
1. 	We've been using this since our baby was a week old, and he's really starting to enjoy it.  For the first couple of weeks we just used the vibrations to help him sleep, but he's now (at a month old) starting to watch the lights and bubbles.  A great buy, and I love having somewhere for him to nap in our living area.There are 2 battery compartments: one (takes 1 D-cell) for the vibrations and one (takes 3 D-cells) for the toy bar.  The battery lasts a surprisingly long time for vibrations-only, but the toy bar drains them within a couple of days (when using 1-2 hours a day) so get 2 sets of rechargeables!The only thing I really don't like is the design of the battery compartment.  You can't change the batteries while the baby's in the seat: you have to unbuckle the cover from underneath, and use a Philips screwdriver to open the hatches.  But apart from that, it's been a sanity-saver!	
- 1	cheapest made rack in the history of all racks.  It was difficult to even connect it because for some reason the customer has to assemble this tiny rack from 6 pieces it arrives in  (?!) and the parts didn't fit quite well.  A very disappointing product for this brand.	
1. 	These wall hanging are well made and are so light weight you can put them up with a tack. Very cute!	
- 1	Not so fun for my 7month old, for some reason she has not pay too much attention to this specific toy	
- 1	Well, where do i start. The front wheel is not as smooth in turning as the old 2012 version. Once my baby is sleeping inside, I can not change the incline so smoothly. Infact I have to play around by pushing it upwards and then downwards. I highly suggest to everyone to buy the old version. Another point it the recall for this new version, so I feel Britax has not done a perfect job.	
1. 	I really like this carrier. I'm on the east coast and my baby was born in late fall so it got cold quick so I haven't used it outdoors yet. But even within the apartment building - checking mail, taking out trash, doing laundry, it comes in handy. I also use it at home while cleaning or getting things done. My son enjoys it. Haven't used it front facing yet.	
- 1	I've never had a problem cutting my baby's nails with other nail clippers but I thought the magnifying glass would make it easier. I actually cut her finger trying to use the magnifying glass. It's difficult to use and pretty useless. I won't be using it again.	
- 1	I bought this seat for my 2 year old son who is just beginning to potty train. I already had a Baby Bjorn toilet seat but he didn't seem to like it. I thought this one might be better since it seems like it would be a little more enclosed around his body and maybe make him feel more secure while sitting up high on the toilet.TO use this seat you have to lift up the regular toilet seat and position this one the rim of the toilet, then lower the toilet seat back down over it. Not difficult but you have to be careful not to let it slide down into the toilet bowl. This also means that to take it off you have to do the same thing. A lot more work than my Baby Bjorn where you just lift it right off.On our toilet, the seat shifted a lot. There isn't any way to secure it to the toilet like there is with the Baby Bjorn. The only thing holding it on is the actual toilet seat itself so there is no way to stop the shifting.Another thing I found out was that my son couldn't get onto this seat alone. Because of the high pee guard on the front, he has to be lifted up onto the seat. If you want your child to be able to use the seat by himself, this one probably won't work.Now that my son has more confidence on the potty we are using the Baby Bjorn again...it's a much better seat and well worth the extra money!FYI:  This seat WILL NOT work on a ROUND toilet bowl. It has to be an ELONGATED bowl.I didn't like this seat and we don't use it anymore. I recommend putting your money into the Baby Bjorn seat.	
1. 	I was surprised by the number of mediocre to negative reviews of these after I sent a friend here to buy them for her grandson. I get what people are saying and why they wrote negative reviews, but they did however, work for us and I will buy more now that my daughter can reach the knobs.First off, regarding melting, presently we have a range - nothing below to generate heat, so no issue there. However we did have a freestanding stove and didn't have a melting problem probably because of both the angle of our control panel and the fact that we have small children and we would never leave our oven open, even cracked.Yes, my son eventually learned how to open these up once he was tall enough to see what he was doing. Prior to this we never gave him a chance to learn how to open them up - if he was fiddling around with them at the stove he was told no and removed.My knobs don't easily come off, so the whole thing coming off wasn't an issue for us. Removing the knobs is a great option - if you don't have a husband like mine who would never ever remember where I put them. ;-)I liked these if anything, for me. On two occasions I came in and dropped loads of groceries on every surface - including the stovetop - and bumped a knob and accidentally turned a burner on. (I won't have that problem now with my gas range.) But it was enough to make me think about buying knob covers for my clumsiness.	
1. 	This has to be one of the best purchases we made for the new baby.  We bought 2, one for the living room and one for our bedroom.  You can stick odor controllers in the top, the top seals on real tight, and most of all - you don't need to be special trash bags, you can just use grocery bags to line them.  This is a must-have for any new mom who doesn't want their entire house smelling like baby poo.	
1. 	I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!	
- 1	Why did you choose this rating?Not fill my expectations.What did you like or dislike ?You do not have enough pressure and grip needed to express milk . I do not served .Who would you recommend this product to ?Would not recommend . Not this brand.	
- 1	I bought two. Threw them both away after cutting the pacifier off. So I got a pacifier for 12 bucks	
- 1	These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash!  Pathetic.  The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off.  Plus the velcro tab is really small so they don't adjust much, making a gap between my baby's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway.  Seriously, if you want throw away bibs, these are for you.  If you want something that is going to last, look elsewhere.	
1. 	Forget to see the model, it can only be used for 3 months. But it is still very useful.It is very soft.	
1. 	I love this, but its big...real big. I love it, my son loves it and it keeps him and his stuff contained. I have told many people about this item. i would say it should be left up and not taken up and down all the time. I could see how other reviews had brake issues with the play yard, however I have not had any and i think its because I leave it up in one area.	
- 1	The other reviews talk about ease of assembly. Well, mine must have been defective.Nothing fit together easily, and once together did not line up to attach. After this, realized one tower piece was missing. Took apart, placed back in box and returned. I don't have time for this nonsense. I assemble everything I buy myself, from furniture to toys. You usually can tell if something is well made and worth it, this was not. Waste of time and energy!	
1. 	I did a lot of research before purchasing this car seat.  I have a 20 month old and a 5 month old.  We just purchased a new vehicle which has side curtain airbags.  I wasn't so worried about a side impact crash since your much more likely to hit head on or be rear-ended.  My main concern was when the side air bags deployed would the Alpha Omega my toddler was in withstand that kind of blow, probably not, especially since I could never get that seat good and snug.  The wings on the boulevard look like they would protect your child's head from a side curtain airbag. (Airbags can cause a lot of facial damage) I was worried the wings would be too big that my kids couldn't see out the window, but she can.  I love this car seat, I purchased 2, one for each of my girls.  [...]  It took me more time to take out the Alpha Omega than it did putting the Boulevard in forward facing.  I just attached all 3 latches, sat on the seat and pulled each of the lower LATCH anchors at the same time.  It is so tight!  It doesn't budge.  Plus it's so easy to remove the LATCH as well. Just remember that when your child hits 48 lbs to anchor the seat with the seat belt and not LATCH. It sits up a lot higher than the alpha too, which is good if God forbid you did get hit from the side, the car seat would be higher than the on-coming cars bumper.  I also like that you don't have to take the seat out to raise the shoulder belt height, super convenient for growing infants. The wings are also nice headrests for a sleeping child.  On the alpha omega my toddlers head would always flop down in an unnatural uncomfortable position. I really like the Hugs system which prevents children from pulling the chest clip down.  On the Alpha Omega my toddler was able to push the chest clip down to the buckle and pull her arms out of the straps!  I haven't yet installed the other one for my infant, still using the peg infant carrier.  I will review it again as rear facing.  These seats are pricey but I will pay anything to make my girls as safe as possible.  If you have a toddler and are thinking of this seat the Wizard is the same, it just doesn't have the infant body pillow, plus it's much cheaper.  I would have gotten one for my toddler but it didn't come in the onyx color, just blue or navy.  I could not imagine ever purchasing a different seat and urge you to get this seat for the safety of your children.	
1. 	We put the changing table in our bedroom because baby is still sleeping in bassinet - SHE loves this mobile. We put it on the side of the changing table and at 5 weeks was staring and smiling looking at it. I wish I got it earlier (e.g. before baby so she could have it day one). Since she needed to be stimulated this worked as I didn't want to put decals on my bedroom walls, the changing table is moving once she's in her own room. HIGHLY recommend.	
1. 	Wonderful cover up if you are thinking about nursing in public.  It takes a little getting used to in the beginning, but is a must if you are out and about!	
- 1	Everyone should research the problems that front carriers place on baby and mom. They do not distribute babies weight properly and I can guarantee you that this carrier will hurt your back sooner than a boboa or ergo. It's obvious just by looking at the comparison of how baby sits in an ergo vs this carrier...it's disturbing.	
- 1	I'd give it zero stars-but not an option and I'd return it, but I guess the return window is really small.  This thing is a random number generator.  It gives a different reading every time and there's a big difference every time.  Does not match any other readings with any other type of thermometer.  I loved the idea, not the product.	
1. 	great changing pad cover, washes clean after accidents and it's nice and soft.  I have this in blue and sage, the blue is very pretty, the sage isn't quite what i expected and isn't that pretty of a color, but I'm more concerned with function anyway so it doesn't bother me much.	
- 1	This holder is cute and worked great for about 2 and a half weeks before the clip stopped holding and then broke entirely. This product is not worth the money.	
1. 	This mixer is great. I used it with my daughter who is 4 and just bought another one for my son. I dont like shaking bottles cause it makes them foamy and I inevitably get formula on me. Also when your done mixing bottles it is great for chocolate milk and grown up drink mixes.	
1. 	Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!	
- 1	I absolutely love the idea of a duffle type diaper bag for cloth diapers. However this one is entirely too small. It is not a deluxe. The material is great but it only holds 4 diapers at max. Also I would prefer it came in other colors than white.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this product - it's super easy to swaddle the baby in this product compared to other swaddle blankets, but my son (at 6.5 pounds) was able to get his arm out of the top every time.	
- 1	Update: Changed my rating from a four to a two. My baby just outgrew these at a measly 12 lbs. By that I mean that I cannot snappi them using the jelly roll fold anymore--they are shrinking with every wash, so I would have to trifold them and lay them in the cover, which isn't ideal because my baby is still quite young and exclusively breastfed. This means I'd have poop exploding everywhere, and I cannot keep changing covers constantly. I'd say just go for cheap but durable SIZED prefolds from cottonbabies, diaper-rite or green mountain diapers. These covers are still great, though, even for smaller babies, so spring for some used ones.Ignore everything the tag says and wash these at least 10 times (with regular laundry, if you want to save water) before using and they are the SOFTEST prefolds. They do NOT fit newborns, however, since they are ridiculously large. I started using them comfortably after my skinny kid hit 9lbs. There is still a lot of bulk/folding down in the front/back. The covers are of extremely cheap quality, but they do the job. Double leg gussets would have helped, but they keep clothes dry, so that's all I care about. I bought four of these trial packs, as another reviewer suggested, and they are serving me well.	
1. 	Actually is better than the automatic one, plus, you can take it anywhere with you.ah....Great Price too. Absolutely recommend it.	
- 1	The &#34;lock&#34; isn't a lock at all.  It is just a handle for you to pop out to make removing of this plug guard easier.  However, I and my 9 month old were both able to easily pull this rounded cover from the socket without even using the pop out handle.  Not child safe at all.  I returned them.	
- 1	Pro:-Spongy holding around your baby to create more safety if bathing baby in ceramic sink.Con:-Always need 2 adult to bath your baby. One holding baby's head up so water won't get into baby's ears, and the other person give the actual bath to the baby.-The mildew smell(I try to hang it dry over night in the bathroom cause it soaks lots of water and keep dripping. Than remove to somewhere under the sunlight during the day time, to get it complete dry out for next bath. However, without drying under the sunlight(when its cloudy day....it has mildew smell)After 3 month usage, the spongy getting flat...and the whole thing keeps sinking(the head part used to be higher...but now about 2 inches flatter)...my husband now has to hold the baby's head plus holding up the hook towards outside the sink... it's totally useless now and I'll have to buy something else...	
1. 	I have two of these, I really love it. He can occupy himself for a few minutes now that he's about 4 months. When he was about 2 months it was great for naps. I'm interested in seeing how this thing grows with him.	
- 1	These tubes cause WAY more condensation to form inside them than the official Medela ones. I have to keep my pump running for minutes on end after I'm done just to get rid of that condensation and make sure no mold grows in them. I don't quite understand how the different material can cause more condensation, but it does. Next time I'll get official Medela tubes.	
1. 	We have a small kitchen, so a booster seat was a better option for us than a stand-alone highchair.  We had a fabric one before that clipped to the table, but it didn't work on all tables and the soft fabric seat was a nightmare to clean.  The molded plastic seat on this has no crevices, so there's no worrying about food getting stuck down in it.  I just wipe it clean with a wet cloth after mealtime.  We use it both with the tray and just up next to the table and it works well both ways. It's easy to strap to any standard chair and comes off really fast if we need the chair.The two cons: My baby very quickly figured out that he could pry the white liner away from the tray and drop it on the floor, food and all, so we just stopped using it. We put the food directly on the beige part of the tray and just wash it by hand (though I would think it could also go in the dishwasher if you wanted).  Also, when we use it without the tray and have him at the table, he can reach the safety straps and has gotten food all over them.  Unlike the seat, the straps are not easy to clean!  A wet cloth has not done the trick and they are stained and kind of gross.  With the tray snapped on he can't reach the straps, so it's only because we used it without that this happened.  I still love the seat and would recommend it to anyone.  Wonderful product for the price-- don't waste your money on a stand-alone high chair!	
1. 	I had extremely sore nipples even with a proper latch and my lactation consultant in the hospital suggested pumping.  She told me don't even bother with an electric pump if I had this one.  I was skeptical and bought a playtex embrace as well just in case.  Weelllllll, this pump works 100% better!!!  Just this morning I pumped over 7 oz for my 2 and a half week old (almost 3 feedings!!!).  With the embrace I was only getting maybe 4 oz.  Even though it didn't take as long because it is a duel one.  I'd rather pump a lil longer and get more!  Also the isis pump doesn't hurt as much as the embrace does.  However, I did have to take the massaging let down cushion out of the isis because i wasnt getting much with it and my nipples are too large for it.  The best thing about this pump is despite all the articles saying I wouldnt be able to feed him breastmilk for every feeding I'm able to and I'm also able to freeze half of what I pump every day since I pump way more than enough!!! My milk supply has even gone way up since my milk first came in just by using this pump.  I can't say enough good things about it!!!I havent had any problems with the pump losing its suction or anything breaking.  It's easy to clean...if you wash it in warm soapy water after every use you wont have any problems with the silicone parts wearing down or turning colors.  I dont wash my baby items in the dishwasher.  I trust my hands more.Like I said I use only this pump full time 10-12 times a day and have never had any problems!!!	
- 1	I gave birth in July and I live in the South, so it is unbearable hot to wear this, add the wrapping technique and you get a very very very frustrated and sweaty me (I don't sweat almost at all). My daughter hated being in the Moby wrap. Thanks to a friend of mine who gave me Over the Shoulder Baby Holder I get to carry my baby around other wise I wouldn't have. I hope I can sell it to at least make something out of it, I have worn it maybe 5 times in 3mo :( I know it works for some people but not me...	
1. 	It's hard to go anywhere without this.  Our daughter loves it.  It twists, shakes and has several different textures for a baby to enjoy	
1. 	Easy to twist and use for formula or snacks. Make sure it snaps all the way shut, so formula doesn't go into the next compartment.	
- 1	I bought this bouncer and was totally disappointed. I will first say that the look of the bouncer is cute and the cover is sooo  easy to remove for washing. The toy bar is cute and the toys are just fine.  you can add your own if you like because there is a Velcro loop that toys attach to.  I don't know how strong they hold up because I wasn't actually able to use this bouncer.  The model I bought only had vibrate no music. When I put it together I thought something must be wrong.  The angle  of this thing was pratically dumping the baby out. I took it apart 3 times a rechecked everything, because it definitely was not the angle the picture on the box was proposing and from other reviews i had read they said the baby lays back good. Well not with mine. I had to hold my baby with one hand so he didn't slide out of the bouncer and try to snap the waist restraint with my free hand. Now i may be blonde , but I am very capable of putting a frame together and do have experience with baby products as i run a home day care and this bouncer was purchased for my second child. If the bouncer would have had a more laid back angle I would have kept it and for the money not a bad product, but the one i purchased I must say was dangerous. If this is the way they are being produced now i would not recommend for safety reasons. My husband also felt the same way he commented on the angle of it and said he didn't want our child in that because i looked like he would fall out.	
- 1	My personal feeling on nursing pillows is....they are a waste of money. I've tried three and I felt all of them were cumbersome. Of course, you won't know if you feel that way about nursing pillows unless you try for yourself and you may end up finding it to be a necessary component to your nursing success. My recommendation is to only try one...and the one I'd recommend that is a better option than this one is by Luna Lullaby (Bosom Baby). Out of the three I tried, that one was the most comfortable and took the least amount of time to get situated on me and then get the baby situated. I felt this one, the My Brest Friend, was uncomfortable with that piece going around your back and up against the chair you're in....AND it is made entirely of foam and has a VERY strong chemical smell to it...not something I was comfortable with my child laying against and breathing in the fumes. And even though nursing pillows were not something that worked for me, the Bosom Baby can be used for other purposes for years to come...and the My Brest Friend cannot due to it's construction. Just my opinion!	
- 1	Bought these for the inside of our diaper pail. What a waste of money; they don't help at all. No fresh scent, no masking stinky scents; absolutely no difference at all. Very disappointing. Don't waste your $ on these.	
1. 	My daughter has been on formula since she was two months old. We have tried all different types of formula dispensers but this one has become our favorite. The tight fit of the lid, the spout to pour, and the amount it holds is perfect. We have since gotten rid of all other brands and have two of these that we use all the time. Highly recommend this product!	
1. 	The price is great and kept my daughter entertained for short periods of time. Easy to buy and change out the little attached toys those are kinda expensive thou. loves to jump in it even at 17 months. easy to clean but hard to take any other place because of its large size.	
1. 	This device keeps the oven shut despite my toddler hanging off the oven handle (fortunately, phew!).  I tried a different lock prior to this one, which I returned as the lock kept flopping down inside the oven whenever open.  This one does NOT have that problem.  It is easy to install, and works in areas with tight clearance too.	
1. 	My daughter has had this turtle for 2.5 years now. It has been durable and reliable the whole time. It is adorable and she still loves it!  Worth the price, you will get a lot of use out of it. The best part is this thing is rough and rugged and takes a lot of abuse (and sometimes love) from little kids.	
1. 	I decided to get this seat over the cooshie, and I'm very happy with it so far.  I love the bright orange color.  My son loves it and takes it with him to sit on the hard floor as well.  I like that it's removable and not strapped down to the chair.  Cleanup has been easy with the exception of smushed blueberries, which left a slight discoloration on the seat.  I could try something a little harsher to get it out, but I'd rather not make it worse.  I know some reviews said the seat rips eventually, if mine does that I will post an update!	
1. 	These are a great product. My daughter has used them from about 10 months, but I would purchase them around 7 months -- think they would work well from that age. And well beyond. Great for the car or when you are at someone else's house and don't want to make a mess. Easy for her to use.	
1. 	Fits our toilet seat very without sliding and no space left on sides. Does not wiggle when set correctly. Suitable for boy or girl. Classy, not gaudy, if you can say that of a toilet seat.	
- 1	My now 2 month old was able to wiggle her arms out of both the bottom and the top of this every night because the material is so stretchy and does not do a good job holding her arms down. One time when she wiggled her arms out of the bottom opening, the small velcro tabs got pushed up to her chin/jaw line since she was bringing her hands to face and she got scratched pretty badly from turning her head side to side and rubbing on rough velcro! I wish I could upload the picture! Not a happy mom when I saw that in the morning!!	
- 1	These cups are made of polycarbonate plastic, which is a known toxic plastic, especially unsafe in food/drink storage. Nuby makes other two handled sippy cups that are made of safe polypropylene plastic. Cups made of unsafe PC plastic are usually clear and hard, while cups made of safe PP plastic are softer and clouded plastic.	
1. 	I like the suction cup base.I've ordered this 2 times now, colors may vary.I've gotten pink both times (I was hoping for blue).But these are disposable, so it wasnt a biggie.	
- 1	This cup broke within 2 weeks of ownership. Thats all I needed to know to not buy another. I did like the attached cap it has to cover the straw , but its simply wasnt spil proff and it broke so I'll pass.	
- 1	This is the 3rd type of carrier that I've bought - I was really happy with it until my daughter got to be over 10 lbs. She's 6 months old, 13 lbs. (which is really small for her age) and it gave me severe back pain to carry her less than 1 mile. The ErgoBaby is designed to spread the weight evenly and I'm now going to spend another fortune for the Ergo. Advice to all expecting parents: DO NOT get the Bjorn. Get a Moby or other wrap for the newborn and then get the Ergo.	
- 1	This temperature reading on this camera is about 3 to 4 degrees higher than the temperature actually is in the room.	
1. 	We have now bought 3, count them 3, different potty scenarios for our 2-year-old, and this is by far the best.  Stays on snugly, prevents leaks well, easy to clean.	
1. 	Nothing fancy or special here but they get the job done. If you have little ones and aren't trying to spend a fortune on outlet covers then look no further. They stay put and aren't a nightmare to pull out when you need to plug something in. Most importantly my kids haven't figured out how to get them out (knock on wood).	
- 1	I didn't like them.... They are too small and very thick, they show thru your clothes. I use instead the evenflow, they are very thin and larger than this.	
- 1	I bought this when I was shopping for my unborn baby. He is almost 10 months and I can honestly tell you that I tried to use this product, but it was unnecessary for me and my husband. The concept is great, to electronically time all of these various things (naps, feedings, diaper changes, etc), but it is not as efficient as it seems.Firstly, the battery life is not good. It just eats batteries, even when it is doing nothing. Secondly, even if your newborn has ate just an hour ago and has napped long before that time, it does not mean that your baby is not hungry. This concept applies to diaper changes, feedings, naps, etc.) The only real indicator is your baby... and believe me when I tell you that your newborn will find a way to tell you what he or she wants. Also, since you haven't recorded how long it has been that your baby last slept or how much your baby has last ate (particularly if you are using formula or bottled breast milk), this product really falls short.Honestly, I wanted to love this and use this like some other parents say they had, but it was one of those completely unnecessary purchases we made hoping to make life with a baby easier. This product was frustrating.Me and my husband found that it was easier and more efficient to simply use a notepad. We wear watches, so we just recorded the time of each activity (i.e. what time baby went to sleep and how long he slept , what time baby ate and how much he ate). This product doesn't have a log, so you couldn't possibly look back on the activity throughout the day or week and measure how much baby has been eating and sleeping. It is just a set of different timers.I would not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to anyone. I think the standard notepad is the best option.Also, another option that I think would be great for this purpose is an iphone/ipod/ Smartphone APP called the Similac Smartmoms Baby Journal. It is completely free to download onto any device that reads APPS. It has all the same functions of this device but includes pictures as well as a chance to mark how full baby's diaper was at his last change. Also, it keeps a log of all these activities for a very long time and greats graphs to determine trends. Technology is so great these days. Go on similac.com/app to check it out. I only found out about this app when my son was already 6 months old and I don't really use it, but I think it would be great for new parents and especially better than the Itzbeen Baby Care Timer. Good Luck and Congrats to all you new parents!	
- 1	There is a hook at the foot of the base of this seat, that makes it feel dangerous to get the seat in and out of it. I only leave this seat in the care because of it.	
- 1	I needed a gate for the top of the stairs, and searched Amazon for baby gate top of stairs.  This gate is the second item returned.  Nowhere in the description does it say that this gate should not be used at the top of the stairs.  Of course as soon as we opened the box the instructions clearly say DO NOT USE AT THE TOP OF STAIRS.  The gate works great in the upstairs hallway, but we'll still need to buy a different gate at some point if we want the baby to have access to our room.	
- 1	I wish these worked, but they don't seem to hide the smell any better than other products I've tried.  I'm still looking for a miracle!	
1. 	I haven't had this blanket long, but have already used it a couple of times.  The size is nice for 2 adults and 1 little one to use.  It folds up and packs very nicely.  I wouldn't pay a lot for it (since my closet is full of other blankets), but think it is worth the price that I paid.	
1. 	i purchased this exersaucer for my 4 month old daughter and she absolutely loves it! It has different height adjustments which is a must since she is already 25 inches. She is very comfortable in this exersaucer. After doing extensive research I originally was going to buy a different model but I took my daughter to the store and she hated my 1st choice.  This one she started playing with right away.  It took me about 30 minutes to assemble the directions were easy to read and assembly wasn't hard at all.  Money well spent!!!!!!	
- 1	I bought this in hopes that I could convince my son to stop running the water in the tub non stop.  The spray actually went up pretty high and I was quite pleased with it on day 1.  Day 2 comes and all of a sudden, it doesn't work anymore.  I tried holding the button and nothing happened.  Really a great concept, but it died after 1 use!	
1. 	Wanted a cute, warm hat for winter - this is it!  It's a little big now but by the time it gets really cold, it should be perfect!  Great price too!	
1. 	They definately need to go back to the old model.  My son turns it on and off all morning and LOVES to watch the bubbles.  I believe the new one has lots of issues, but if you can find the old one, BUY IT!	
- 1	I would rate this seat at 5 stars IF it would have fit all the seats in my house.  Luckily, the most important seat we needed this for it fits perfectly.  We have twin girls and needed two.  Both are made the same, however out of three toilets we've put these on, only ONE works with this seat.  :(  The holes on the toilet seat are too small for the rim for the seat to sit on.  Not sure why this seat isn't universal!	
- 1	I was looking for a bottle that my son could use when I wasn't around to breastfeed. He didn't even get to use this once. He fussed as soon as we tried it. It was way too much effort for him. Total failure!	
1. 	I love this wipes warmer! The 1st one I broke (because I never wiped it dry after refilling water, so it was rusted at the back of the unit where the connector was), so I went ahead and bought my 2nd one!	
- 1	I bought this and sterilized it once and already the top half won't fit with into the bottom half. Somehow the plastic shrink after the steam sterilization and won't click back together no matter how hard I tried. Needless to say I didn't even get a chance to use it. Unless...	
1. 	We have two of these and my toddler totes them all over the house to climb up on things. Very sturdy, we are happy with the stools	
- 1	I ordered this mirror thinking I could use it with a rear view mirror to see my son while driving in the car, but it's not a real mirror... it's like a fun house mirror in a haunted house or something. It's actually a bit scary for him because nothing is recognizable. Also, the stand is flimsy, and the straps are too, making it hard to even use it if you wanted to. I'm returning it.	
- 1	Milk spouts back up through the straw ALL THE TIME and has left milk stains all over the place. I thought maybe I had a faulty one, but I bought two, and both cups leak through the straw. It is highly inconvenient! My daughter likes it and it's easy to clean, but I've also got this one:[...]which is much better if you're looking for a sippy cup with straw.	
1. 	We've gone thru 4 seats, mini infant tubs etc for our (now 7 mo) old over the past 5 mo and nothing seems to be comfortable for him. He loves to splash and play and it was so dangerous in the seats and/or plastic tubs. I have watched this item on amazon and finally bit the bullet (it's only $13 after all). We are in night four and he LOVES it! It's a safe small space for him to splash and play and easy for us to control him w out filling up the entire tub. I recommend for all!!	
1. 	Fits well, relatively easy to get on. Washes up nicely too. My little guy looks very cute in it and works perfectly for messy meals!	
1. 	Fit my Medela PISA parts perfectly.  Wish they had come with membranes/valves though.  Over all, I guess I can't complain since it didn't promise that.  It was just kind of annoying that it didn't come as a set.	
- 1	I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already.  However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones.  My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore.  The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.	
1. 	We've had this turtle for four years and it's still working, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of similar products we've tried. I love everything about it: the design, the true-to-sky constellations, the three light choices, the auto off feature. Perfect for a nursery or an older child who's afraid of the dark!Update: We let a battery leak and it killed our turtle :(It was only 5 years old and I know it could have lasted much longer!We got the ladybug version for our LO and love it as much as the turtle!The colors are different than the turtle. It lights red, purple and green (the turtle had orange, blue and green lights).The light seems to be much brighter, but it could just be that the batteries are new.We'll be sure to check them regularly to make sure they don't leak.	
1. 	Great cups, last a while and last through many dishwasher runs.  However, it's so strange that the tops come in colors that are different from the cups.  When you have a picky toddler who simply MUST have the green cup with the green top, that makes life tough as you try to explain there simply is no green top.	
- 1	my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).  The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.  Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.  I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.  Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.  I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?  Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.	
1. 	We Just Bought this travel swing-because the baby will spend sometime with us we thought we could use a small swing, not some big Swing (like you could travel with that!) the pad seem comfy for baby! like anything makes a baby happy! we have a EB playpen! and this swing! that basicually what we need and we got huggies gift pack for our house! about bats! why dont you go out and buy some when you need some! its alot cheaper!  anyways both EB and Swing was easy set up, and we havent taken them down,as far as we know this play yard and swing will suit us just fine! i hope you read the manual! to make sure all parts there!! best swing and play yard!! ;) we love them so FAR! the best thing about the travel yard and travel swing is perfect for us! specially in the first few years! i always had hand-me down swings and play yards! but this is a great buy! we got these cheaper at toy r us!! on sale! 100.00 bucks for EB and i think about 30 bucks for the travel swing! oh yeah by the way the people that does not think to set up a travel yard isnt easy YOU just have to make sure its locked!  we also bought the link-a-doos at target for 12 dollars...good luck! my nephew loves this swing and he'll sit in it  at 11months old and baby #2 is due in aug!! so we'll be using this swing again for granny's house!	
- 1	I have great difficulty fitting bottle nips into the basket, and it does not hold much overall, and hence, I continue to wash my baby's bottles by hand.	
1. 	This is a good swing, I like the two different swinging modes, front to back and side to side.  The only problem I had was that the music quit working after 2 weeks.  I did not want to disassemble the whole thing and lug it back to the store and I did not want to ship it back to FP and wait for 3-6 weeks for a replacement.  We didn't need the music anyway, so we just used the other features, my son is now 8 months old and is still under the weight limit and he enjoys the swing once in awhile, though now that he is mobile, he wants to be on the floor, crawling around.  My son was quite fussy and the swing often helped to soothe him, a few nights he actually slept in it for 5 hours straight, if he took him out he woke up and cried and cried!	
1. 	This is a great product and I highly recommend it.  The best sterilizing option since I don't have enough dishes to bother using the dishwasher more than once every two days.  Even if you just want to clean one pacifier, it uses less water and energy than boiling on the stove and it's quicker too.  It saves my skin from hand washing in scorching hot water  (but I still give things a quick rince in warm soapy water before tossing them in the sterilizer).  It is a lifesaver when pumping and bottle feeding.The only drawback is the space that it takes up - it is about 12 inches in diameter and 6 inhes tall.  But I use mine so much, I just keep it in the microwave when I'm not using it!	
1. 	We use these for all of our diapers... we don't have a disposal system. We just throw the diapers in 'em, tie them up and throw them in larger garbage bag every few days. I can fit 3 size 2-3 diapers in them. They are great on the go as well especially if you don't want to smell up people's trash cans when you are at their house.	
1. 	On second week of use and love it. I did not want a huge pail or genie that held a month's worth of dirty diapers. This holds about 4 days worth, and is sealed tightly enough that I do not smell anything when it is full. The little lid has a compartment for a deodorizer. I use the nursery Arm and Hammer ones and I think it gives it enough weight to shut tightly so no odor escapes. I use medium trash bags (8 gallon) and they fit perfectly. For the price and size, you cannot beat this. If odor ever becomes a problem I plan on throwing a scented fabric softer sheet on the bottom of the pail. So far, a great purchase.	
1. 	These rock. The designs are cute and they fit my 18 month old well, and will fit for awhile. I love them, easy to clean, quick to dry. I wish I started using these months ago!	
1. 	I love these, they're easy, light, and I don't feel guilty throwing them away if they get yucky. Totally worth it.	
- 1	Yes, I read all the reviews saying that these are impossible to clean.  I thought: oh I'm not some OCD clean freak; plus I'll clean it right after use, unlike all those OTHER people.  Silly me!  Everyone was right.  You know how they sell those bottle brushes, complete with nipple brush?  That's because we don't want bacteria in our babies' foods, right?  Since they don't sell a brush in the world that could clean this thing, there is really no way to get it clean.  And I don't want my sweet boy ingesting some banana from last week.  It was fun for a one-off experiment! But we like to be more sustainable than one-off excursions into plastic.  Oops.  Humble pie is mine.	
- 1	I am not a fan of this bottle warmer.  I bought it because it was cute, would fit a wide-neck bottle, and because there were no bottle warmers in my price range that were rated as truly outstanding.  Once I started putting it to use to warm breast milk bottles, I learned it was not for us.  First, as I guess is the case with many warmers, you have to measure out what seems like an arbitrary amount of fluid specific to the amount of milk you are heating using a little beaker that is stored on the warmer.  The difference between the various measured amounts is very little, and you can imagine how difficult it is to get an exact measurement wit ha screaming baby in your arms waiting for his bottle!  Not good.  However, when we filled it correctly it seemed to warm the milk well for the first few days.  After a few days, it started to take twice as long to warm bottles!  It overheated my precious breast milk to the point where it was scalding!! Not only can I not feed this to my baby, but it actually decreases the nutritional value of my milk, which is sad.  Also dangerous if you come to trust the warmer - though you should always check the temperature before feeding baby.  I think this product could definitely be improved upon.  Luckily Amazon gave me a full refund and I exchanged it for the Dr. Brown's bottle warmer, which we have been happy with so far.	
- 1	I had this for a few months and all of the sudden, the turning part of the projection quit working. The actual projection works, but the images don't turn. Not worth the $26.	
1. 	A must have for park outings with the kids.  Cute design and waterproof lining keeps the mat dry from damp grass.  Easy fold up and carry.  Just about every stain wipes off clean.  However, it is not a blanket fabric, more like a mat I'd say which works fine for my purpose.  But you'll be disappointed if expecting blanket feel.	
- 1	So, the dimensions say it is 24&#34; X 38&#34; X 5&#34; ... my portable playard mattress is 24x38x3... This sheet is WAY TOO SMALL!!! It does not even fit the mat that comes with the playard!! I am sticking with the graco sheets. Cost a few extra bucks but they fit!	
1. 	So I bought these covers when I noticed our twins were starting to gnaw on the crib railings, thank gosh for prime! They arrived and I washed and dried them and stuck them on. They helped deter and stop the actual damage to the crib. The chewing still happened, we even had some blood on one, but it washed out ok. Now probably 7 months later the Velcro still sticks really good, but my boys peel them on the crib in less than 30 seconds. The are a bit short length wise for our railings, but that never was a problem. I would recommend.	
- 1	I would only buy this is I knew the baby I was putting it on was a light wetter.  IT LEAKS ALL THE TIME	
1. 	Much needed for our stroller since it did not come with a cup holder.Sturdy construction, adjustable clamp, and fits most size cups.	
1. 	I ordered this play yard with the rainbow 5/8 play mat for my 5 month old son.  This play yard (in the hexagon shape) fits perfectly on the mat and I even have 6 puzzle pieces left over.  The only thing is the yard does slide a bit on the mats.  The walls of the yard are a little hard to get apart and together but not impossible.  Once together you just snap around the walls at the angle you need.  The instructions only recommend having the yard in a square or hexagon shape.  I was a little disappointed but it makes sense - any other configuration and the yard may become unsteady and easily tip over if not properly secured.  I'm also a little concerned about the diamond griding of the yard walls - hopefully my son does not try to climb up them when he's older.  It also hard to see out when in the play yard - the fine mesh of our pack n play is much easier to see in/out of.  I noticed this because when I call his name he has a hard time finding me, but in the pack n play he finds me right away.  I guess maybe bars would be better for both these reasons (can't climb and easier to see) but the ones I've seen are pricey.  Overall I give the yard 4 stars.  It's just what I expected and works well for us.	
1. 	Excellent gym mat for the little one! Lots of extra items to change around. Colorful, musical, and easy to setup.The 2 downfalls I've encountered are (1) it requires 3 C batteries (they are located under the giraffe) and (2) the music doesn't have an option to continually stay on until you turn it off. Unfortunately, with children under 3 months of age, they don't have the ability to touch anything yet to keep the machine music playing. Consequently, someone has to hit the top object to get the music to stay on and coincide with the lights.However, the mat is great and very useful!	
1. 	I have had two kids use my Evenflo carseat.  I HATED it. It was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked.  I finally got so sick of it when my 2nd child was 4 months old that I ordered a Babytrend Flexloc.  At first I was seduced by the high safety ratings, but even after that Consumer Reports article was rescinded, I still liked a lot of the features.Pros:-very comfy seat, good padding-the canopy is twice as long as my Evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely- the canopy stays in place; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind the seat- the tightening mechanism under the baby's feet is easy to reach and VERY easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing- the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust (the shoulder strap height). My Evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible.  The Flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn--it's a breeze.- The seat can be transfered between cars without the base.  It can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the LATCH system if your car has it.- the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position- this carseat is lighter than my Evenflo- The cloth is very wipeable, not as absorbant of spills and stains as my EvenfloCons:I found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat, and one that might (depending on how I can resolve it once I contact Babytrend).- The release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat.  It's a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing.- As others have said, the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff, but not horribly so.  I was prepared for them to be way worse.- The handle is thinner and doesn't FEEL as sturdy as my Evenflo when carrying baby around, but it hasn't had any problems-This is the one BIG one that I have to check with Babytrend on:  Twice when I have turned a corner sharply, the carseat has tipped to a 45 degree angle!  I have tightened down the seatbelt as much as I could, putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism.  But maybe I'm still not doing it right.  The base is narrower than my Evenflo's was, so maybe that's why?  So I need to contact Babytrend and see if they have any suggestions.  Until then, I guess I'll take the corners slower!Overall, I have felt like this seat was a MAJOR improvement over my Evenflo and even over the Graco Snugrides I checked out at the store.  It was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows. I would recommend it for sure.  Just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the LATCH system if you have it.	
- 1	This cup is not meant for me, so I rated it on how my daughter respond to it. She almost hates the thing. I have tried multiple times to get her to drink both milk and water from it but after attempting to use it and sometimes just handling it, it is a) give back, b) dropped, c) thrown across the room.I like the designed but since I am not the one drinking from it, what I think does matter. She has the chewy top cups and hard cups like this and drinks from all of them. This thing, she won't even touch now after all my attempts.

1. 	We love our Zanzibar set and have received many compliments on it. We washed the bumper, curtains, drapes and sheets and all came out great. There are some 'extra' accessories to this set, not all are carried by in the store at Babies R Us or are on Amazon..items such as the switchplate, hamper, photo frame.. Check on line for these items. We are pleased overall with this set and recommend it!!	
1. 	It works well, is easy to install.  you can't roll the window down, obviously, while it's attached.  For the price, it's a nice option to have while driving on a sunny day.	
1. 	Max is not just the baby's favorite, he is the family's favorite! All the older kids love engaging their little brother with this toy. The colors are vibrant, and the clacking sounds are pleasant sounding when you shake it and/or pull on the wooden ring. We bought the blue polka dot clip to go with it, and clipped it on his car seat. Those bright colors keep him engaged and the sound is not annoying like so many other toys. I like being able to clip him anywhere without the worry that we'll lose our precious Haba toy. We love all the Haba toys we've bought so far, and this is one of the favorites in our growing collection.	
- 1	Overview:I bought one of these about a year ago and it's fine.  It included batteries and it really helped out when we needed to travel.  The current version is worse in many ways, and I do not recommend it.PROS:> It's a nice size, and easy to use.> It does what it says> It's fine if you have an outlet and your power never goes out.CONS:> The power cord is now PERMANENTLY attached and cannot be unplugged.> The battery compartment CANNOT BE USED.  That's right, YOU CANNOT USE BATTERIES WITH THIS UNIT.  If you want to travel, or if the power goes out, this machine is useless.  On the older version of this machine, if you unplug the power cord, the batteries can be used.  However, if the power goes out the batteries do NOT take over automatically.> This is noticeably quieter than our old version of this machine.  While the volume buttons both goes up the same number of times, our old sound machine feels like it has 2-3 louder levels.  This new machine stops getting loud at about half the volume of our old unit.  As a result, it is barely loud enough to drown out background noises in a house.> One oddity: There is a demo switch on the bottom, and when traveling it often gets hit, which causes this unit to turn off after a few minutes.  It's not a big deal, but it's a hassle.WOULD I BUY THIS AGAIN?> No, I would not recommend this item.----------------For what it's worth, the serial number on our old machine is 0409 and the new one is 1412.  Otherwise they appear identical.  I am disappointed that the new one falls short in so many ways.	
1. 	There is a reason why Medela is the leader in breast pumps and this is no exception. This is the best manual pump on the market. The two modes of pumping, let down mode and expression mode, make it unlike any other pump. It makes pumping quick and efficient. I could easily get 6-8 ounces in 20-30 minutes. The manual design also makes for discreet pumping that can be done anywhere. If you plan to pump full time, I would suggest an electric pump, such as the Medela Pump in Style Advanced. But for occasional pumping, this is a wonderful product. It is also one of the least expensive pumps you can buy. You are getting more than what you pay for.	
- 1	Very rough and dry--scratchyNever even used and the threads were unwinding when arrived.Thankfully I was able to return them.(We instead use the Gerber baby washcloths--good price and very soft and much better quality)	
- 1	This walker is cute but of poor quality.  We purchased it from Babies R Us and were disappointed when we discovered that the frame was damaged.  The plastic where you attach the back wheels had broken off, and you could see the orange shards of plastic at the bottom of the box.  I called up Kolcraft customer service and they agreed to send a replacement frame free of charge.  Great, problem solved, right?  WRONG!  First of all, they only sent the bottom orange piece, not the full frame.  So, I tried removing the orange part from the green part, and realized it's not made to come apart.  I ended up injuring my hand and had to wait for my husband to get home and deal with it.  He also injured himself, but succeeded in separating the two pieces.  Yay, everything's fixed, right?  WRONG again, chief.  The frame Kolcraft sent us didn't have any holes where the frame should snap together.  Weird.  And incredibly frustrating.  So, I made another call to customer service, sent them photos of the issue, and they made another promise to send the correct part.  New frame arrives, and again, it's the frame with no holes.  I call customer service again, send photos of the problem again, and they ship out a new piece again.  Third time's a charm, I guess, because this time they got it right.  This process took about a month.  Now my baby has a walker, and I'll admit, she does seem to enjoy it.  Another annoying thing about this walker is the way it adjusts... you pull a strap in the back to tighten up the fabric of the seat.  Strange.  You would think it would make more sense to have something that adjusts on the frame itself.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing another Kolcraft product, like ever.	
1. 	I am bewildered by all of the reviews claiming the Toddler Bundle Me is too small for their children. Maybe these people received the Infant version instead of the Toddler version? I have a 13-month-old daughter that is at the higher end of the growth percentiles, and she's got plenty of room in this thing. We received the Infant Bundle Me as a shower gift, so I was eager to jump to the Toddler version. It's warm, fits her Jeep stroller perfectly, and eliminates the need for many cumbersome layers. Very satisfied.	
1. 	I was looking for this to use for our camping trip. I have considered all the comments most esp its limitation that it will only clamp on 1-2 inches thick of tables. It was perfect. My daughter, 14 months old and is 22 lbs was so comfy on this chair that we were able to leave her on it while we were setting up our camp. She used it for all meals and she stayed in it the whole time. We had another friend who had a 1 yr old and my daughter and hers took turns using the chair. They all love it too that they are getting their own. Easy to put together, easy to pack. I don't need it to fit a backpack (and it would not), but it comes in a bag that works for me.	
1. 	I love how soft this changing pad cover is! It is a perfect fit on contoured changing table pads, and wipes clean easily for small messes.	
- 1	I was sick of the suction cup holder type toy holders always falling off the wall, so I was excited to find this cute pelican! Excited until we used it. The mesh does not stay in place (falls out when we try to get the toys out) and it is way to big for our normal size tub (The picture lis very misleading in showing the mesh not touching the ground)So bummed this didn't work, I would return it had I not already thrown out the box!	
- 1	This pump didn't make good suction for me. The most I got out of it was 20ml. Also, after about a week it started making loud squeaking noises. The only good thing I got out of it was the bottle. I wish I would have returned the pump but I didn't.	
1. 	I wanted a swing with a hood - and for some reason it has started squeaking after only a few months - but I do like the small size and that it is low to the ground.  I took all of the toys off.	
1. 	It's so nice and cute, and the baby loves it. It was real easy to wrap her up in, and it worked perfect	
1. 	My oldest is now 4 1/2, but we got all of his extra furniture(highchair, bouncer, jumperoo, swing, and mobile) from the Fisher-Price Precious Planet line. We were mostly satisfied with all of them. (We hated the swing...seemed like our little one was always about to fall out). The bouncer was well used by my first two, so it needed to be replaced with our third one on the way. That is mostly due to the fact that I tripped over that old one...while holding my newborn! Thankfully, my baby wasn't hurt, but it bruised me horribly. It hurt worse than one would imagine! It bent it to the point that it was a pain to use anymore. It was a HUGE tripping hazard, and I don't recommend it. THIS one(although a rocker and not a bouncer) is not the same tripping hazard, and I love it!It seems like bouncers are one of those things that are extremely useful, but not for long. Little ones seem to outgrow them so quickly. I adore the fact that this one converts to a toddler rocker, so we get longer use out of it. This is especially appealing since we are not having anymore. I think most of us will feel like we're getting our money's worth when our little one can use it longer! My 1 year old(almost 2) has already been sitting in it, and loves it. I'm trying not to let him use it too much, though, because it is baby brother's.Another feature I like is the kickstand It helps the rocker to lay flat. My first son slept in his bouncer for the first year and a half of his life(he was extremely premature and small). I like this kickstand feature, just in case our newest little one ends up sleeping any in this rocker. (I like having options when it comes to getting a bit of sleep).Overall, I have no reason to not recommend this rocker. We love it so far!	
1. 	After minimal use, my TT's lights went out. Probably some kind of short or something. I was pretty disappointed, and contacted Cloud B to let them know what happened. I have read other reviewers say that Cloud B didn't help them at all, but my communications with them were very helpful and friendly. I very nicely (get more bees with honey than vinegar, right?) informed them of my problem and asked what their recommendations were. After some emails back and forth to troubleshoot and verify authenticity, they emailed me a postage paid FedEx label to send the non-working turtle back. About two weeks later I received a brand new TT. I am very pleased! I will update later though, if this turtle has the same problems of the lights going out.	
- 1	These bags annoyed me until I finally took the scissors to the vent and cut it so that it would drain like the medela bags. I don't have 10 minutes or the patience to wait for the water to trickle out. I am an adult with a brain and I understand hot water pours out, I would like it to pour out quickly.	
1. 	This bib is super cute, and washes nice, but I really did notlike the velcro fastener.  My baby got a cut and a scratchedbeck of the neck from this velcro.  It is sharp and I was nothappy about that.  Make sure you secure the velcro overlappingit to prevent scratching.  I am not liking velcro bibs anymore.	
- 1	As with the last review, if you put anything too easy in it it will rip the material. It's a great idea but a bad design.	
1. 	These are quality made bottles and like most others stated, they don't leak.  They are easy to clean and BPA free.  Most babies are picky, so if it is your first child, you might have to experience to find the right one.  I recommend giving this one a try.	
1. 	My baby has loved this from the time she was about 6 six weeks and would lie underneath it and look at the toys and lights and listen to the music, to now when she is 6 months and likes to roll around under it, sit on the side and play with the giraffe and lie on her stomach and study the patterns. For me it has given me the opportunity to put her down, knowing she will be happy for around twenty minutes, and I'll have the chance to get something done. However, shop around. The price for this toy varies a lot!	
- 1	This is a great IDEA but ours grew mold almost immediately so I couldn't let our infant daughter use it.  She has developmental delays and never wanted to do tummy time so we wanted to see if this would interest her enough to lay on her belly.  Didn't get to use it long enough to see.  It was also very hard to inflate.	
1. 	When I had my son. We had two vibrating chairs and two swings. One a huge amazing one and one that matched his room decor and used batteries. Same with one of the vibrating chairs it was also the theme of his room hence is why we bought it. This chair we recieved for christmas he was a month old at the time. And we immediatly begain using this chair instead of our other one. Even though it doesnt bounce like an average vibrating chair it was still amazing. Our son spit up massive amounts of his bottles after eating, so this chair in the rocing position for perfect for us , because it helped him immesly. He no longer would choke on his spit up. Because it is wider so that older children can use it, I understand while people would say its not ok in rocker postion for babies, but we actually hadBrica Koosh'N Infant Neck and Head Support, Gray/Greenand when he was very littler we would use this help his head stay up and it worked like a charm. Once he had about an hour sitting up then we would lean it back and let him nap it in occasionaly but since he was very needy we never got use our chairs as much as most people I know seem to use theirs. He basically stayed in my arms for 3.5 months.Pros-EASY TO CLEAN!!! and colors stay amazing! I washed multiple times a week due to spit up or diaper mishaps and it still looks brand new.-Easy to adjust-Batteries last a long time-Vibrate is actually a very noticable vibrate unlike other that are more subtle this can be a pro or con to some people-toy bar comes off with ease-lay back feature is amazing-can grow with your child, but our son hates being strapped down and sitting still so we only got about.... 5 months use out of this until he became a pro at rolling so far out of it that the bottom would start coming up...- the two toys comes off the toy bar so they can play with themNegatives- the toy bar is so corny and does nothing- the music plays only for a few seconds and they are the most annoying songs I have ever heard-the fabric is not anything soft. Its more like smooth. Newborns seems to like soft and cozy so cover it with a soft and fuzzy blanket- You need to figure out a neck support option if your child has GERD or reflux when they are very little and cant hold their head up. But simple solutionBrica Koosh'N Infant Neck and Head Support, Gray/Greenwe used this and it worked like a charm-it wont bounce like other chairs when they kick their feet- You have to rock it yourself. Not really a problem but to some this might be an issue	
- 1	The product itself is good, so I hate to give it a less than stellar star rating but I want to advise this mattress doesn't fit the graco pack n play on the go portable crib like I had seen noted in some reviews. Maybe if you're fine with sticking a towel in between the gap you could get away with it, but it's about 2 inches too short width and length. I went with a little larger dream on me product. As I stated earlier, still a good product just didn't work for my graco portable crib like advertised.	
- 1	I got this because the price was better than theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Soft Bib, Greenand I thought it would be great to roll up for taking along in my diaper bag.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as good as I had hoped.Pros:- I like the rubber/silicone/whatever material.  My daughter, who has always loved just chewing on anything, likes to bite into this sometimes, so there's some satisfaction from her with this.- The catch tray at the bottom does its job pretty well and the form stays in place so food doesn't spill onto her lap.- Multiple holes for the attachment for the neck, so you can use the size you need.- I like the color selection.  I chose the boy colors so they would be more neutral.- Price, it was pretty good (I didn't buy on Amazon).- You can roll it up for storage and/or travel.Cons:- You can't see it in this product's page, but in the page forExplora Easi-Roll Bibs 2-Pack Pink & Orange, you can see the little hole about where the chin would rest for the baby.  I believe this is intended for the 'rolling' feature and to clasp the bib when rolled.  This little hole is a easy target.  It sits right below the baby's chin and food drops there a little too often.  Although the crumb tray is supposed to catch the food, this little whole has food drop from the baby's chin and through the bib onto the baby's clothes or skin a bit too often.- That same little hole promotes the bib to fold and dimple in towards the baby, because the structure isn't as stiff.  At least this is the case when I use it for my daughter on the smallest hole/setting.  This can end up irritating the baby's skin as it pokes into their chest.- Although another brand isn't better, it's still a little to narrow on the upper chest/shoulder area.  If your baby likes to look side-to-side while eating, it's very likely they're going to get food on their shoulders.- Although it rolls up, I do wish it would roll up a bit smaller.  But it's only a small con, considering the material and function, I wouldn't expect it to roll up and be all that small.I was a bit disappointed with this bib.  We still use it but I have to be mindful of that horribly placed hole to try to avoid getting any food caught there and pay attention so I'll be aware if it's irritating my daughter.	
- 1	I ordered these because I like my sons bib to match his outfit for the day and there just isnt a good enough selection of colors out there. They are way too thin and everything leaks through the bib and onto his shirt!	
- 1	I bought this toy with high expectations, but found it was overrated. It's very colorful and with all the typical Lamaze features. If you have one already, there's no need to get another one which is virtually the same. My baby looks at it some times, but not super interested. Maybe it's just her. Overall, I think this toy is just ok. I didn't find anything magic about it. We have another Lamaze toy, and this one isn't much different.	
- 1	We purchased the lotus and the baby bjorn for an upcoming trip across the country. For us it was a no-brainier, the baby bjorn won out. I found the fold to be slightly more complicated, the mattress to be thiner, and we preferred the solid strip of fabric that runs around the crib like a bumper on the bjorn. I also HATED the quilted sheet that I purchase for the lotus- it made the mattress curl up. Overall I think this is a good quality travel crib, but just not for us.	
1. 	With two boys 18 months apart we weren't ready for our 2 year old to move to just the chair now that our 6 month old is ready to eat solids.  I spent a lot of time looking for a booster without a tray for my two year old, but I just couldn't decide.  Instead I bought a second Fisher-Price Booster and we are very happy with it.	
1. 	These cover the whole outlet and are hard to remove, as expected. Can't beat the price for what you get!	
1. 	My second buy, I love Phillips Avent products, theare a great brand, I use bottles, nipples,  cups, pacifiers and more.This I have one for snacks and other for formula.	
- 1	Let me start by saying, I LOVE my Britax Car Seats and I suppose this cup holder is better than nothing.  However, I think it has several design flaws.  We have two Britax Marathon car seats side by side in the back seat of our Yukon.  The cup holder will not fit on the forward facing car seat by the door, or the door would not close.  So we had to put it on the side that is next to her sisters rear facing car seat.  It is literally wedged in there and leans forward.  Therefore half the time, my daughter cannot get her drink out b/c the cup holder is leaning too far forward out of her reach.  On the rear facing seat it works ok, but is still too far out of reach in my opinion.  It is more there for my convenience than hers.  My husband wants to know why in the world a car seat that is so expensive does not come with some sort of cup holder built in.  It seems like they could do a little better with theit cup holder design.	
1. 	It's hard to get excited about a potty seat, but my toddler loves this one. We keep the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer on a low hook next to the toilet for him to grab. He can carry it by the little rubber handle and (with some help) put it on the seat. I've already adjusted the potty seat to fit our elongated toilet. It fits nice and snug on top of the toilet seat with no rocking or tipping, and my son sits on it quite well with no danger of falling in or off it (he's almost 2 but he's big for his age). It fits round toilet seats too with just a turn of the dial, which makes it great for travel. I wish it came with a travel bag/carrier of some sort. (I'll have to make my own travel potty kit: an old duffel bag, flat-folding step stool, flushable wipes, disinfectant wipes, antibacterial hand gel, etc.) It's made of the same durable material as the seat that came with our white toilet so it matches perfectly, and it's easy to clean. I expect the guard in the front will keep things where they're supposed to go -- we haven't had a full event yet, but fingers crossed.	
- 1	This is the worst.  We suffered with the terrible static and screeching for five months.  Recently went out and bought the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor.  It isn't even in the same league.  With the voice activation feature you hear nothing, I repeat nothing, unless the sound registers over a certain decibel.  Amazing!!  It was definitely worth the $50.  Just wish we never registered for this product.	
1. 	We received this changing table as a gift. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. It fits everything we need to diaper on a daily basis.	
- 1	I ended up using this when I was at home but it looked too frumpy to wear out.  Made me look even bigger than I was after I have birth.  Not worth the price.	
1. 	Great for spare parts for vintage baby bottle collection.  These were purchased to complete nippleless bottles I got for my collection (hey, some folks collect fishing lures, salt/pepper shakers, rocks, shoes&#8230;. there are more bottle collectors than one might think !!). Playtex is a reliable brand, and latex is the authentic material for many bottles.	
1. 	I gave this 4 stars b/c it works for its intended use however, I prefer not to use a cushion b/c they get so dirty.  My little one is learning to feed herself and is very 'busy'in her chair.  The cushion constantly has food smeared on it.  After I realized she was fine in the chair without it (it was in the wash during a feeding time) I decided not to put it back on.  My personal preference.	
1. 	Good products, good looking and easy to fold and unfold. The only con is that I bought for my baby to play in it and the fabric is too slippery, she can't crawl or stand in it.	
- 1	I'd be okay with the fact that my child ripped these off the wall, but I didn't expect that at 6 months old she would be able to also rip the paint and chunks of the drywall off too!  I knew there was the risk of this happening, but didn't realize so much paint and drywall would come off.  While the cushions are great, the adhesive ruins them.  My advice?  If you need to soften your corners, use these cushions, but secure to the wall using small nails that your child can't pull out.  Repairing a few small holes would be much easier than what we need to do!	
1. 	When my baby was a born I used this pillow constantly! Since you can not take the cover off, I always put a blanket over it. I've spot cleaned it, but it does kinda suck that I can just put it in the wash every once in a while. I am not a crazy germaphobe and with the blanket over it, he never really spit up on it or anything. Before he was mobile he was always lying in his pillow. I will say it's not very good at propping my baby up as he is learning to sit up, he just tumbles over. So as of right now, I use it more as a back cushion. He still nurses but we never use it anymore for that.	
1. 	I like this product... we got it for my 16 month old at Christmas so he can get used to seeing the potty and sitting on it, even though we're not potty training yet. My only complaint is that I wish the pieces would clip in place so they weren't so easy to remove. My son has taken this whole &#34;getting used to the potty&#34; thing to heart and likes to take the potty apart. Not an issue now, but I'm sure it will be once he starts using it!I also like that it LOOKS enough like a toilet that he tries to &#34;rinse&#34; his cloth diapers in it... (like I said, he's a fan)	
1. 	I love long sleeved bibs.  The Bumkins ones hold up extremely well. We have some that are 4 years old and still look perfect.  I like that they tie behind the neck as our daughter pulls anything with velcro off.  These bibs have fantastic coverage and we always use them when we are out on the town as we know that we won't have to change clothes after the meal due to mess.	
1. 	Bought this for my girls (turtle for my son).  it is adorable even off.  The lights are great (although after 3 months of nightly use the green doesn't seem to work as well) and project onto the ceiling & walls.This does say not suitable for children under 3, but we put it in the middle of the room while the children are in cribs at night so age isn't an issue for us.The turtle by cloud b is also fantastic, my son loves it.i only wish they could stay on longer (after 45 minutes my son is still awake and we have to go and turn the turtle back on).This is a great gift and I look forward to buying more cloud b products for my family.	
1. 	I am currently using these for my 7 month old son, who has started on solids (purees). They are the perfect size & should last until he is at least 12 months old. I LOVE the bright colors & the fact that they are plain & don't have any cheesy sayings on them. They have terry cloth front & back with the water proof material in between. They have been through multiple cycles in the washer AND dryer and have held up nicely. I have not noticed any fading & although they are the boys version, I would use them for a girl as well. They did shrink a little. The best part is the price. I shopped for months online & at local stores and nothing was comparable. I would definitely recommend these bibs.	
- 1	Is too small, its not the same as the normal ones, i dont know if its original but its too small and can not be put in the crib because is too small.	
1. 	I bought these after my 14 month old got interested in our stove knobs and have been very happy with them so far. They're easy to put on (just pop the knobs off, put covers on, and replace knobs) and aren't visually offensive. They're effective too--no more risk of little fingers turning the gas on. Highly recommended.	
- 1	I loved the concept of this item and was looking for something that we could use on the high chair and at restaurants. However, we haven't gotten it to be of any practical use, and that makes me sad. First off, I can't, for the life of me, get the thing to actually stick to anything with the suction cup. It'll stick for like 2 minutes tops, and then fall off, and that's if you don't even touch it. Additionally, my little one pulls the entire thing off of it's base. It's not very sturdy. We've put it away.	
1. 	This blanket makes swaddling a snap and kept my daughter in a hug all night for her first 5 months of life. We already miss it desperately now that she can roll and is no longer being swaddled. With very regular use, this blanket developed a hole near one of the joints where the multiple wings met. The hole did not affect its usefulness, but I was disappointed. A little stretch would go a long way in this product.  We rotated 4 blankets but found that two of them were made of quite stiff cotton that became tougher to use as our daughter grew. All in all I recommend miracle blankets, but footnote the recommendation by saying they (1) don't hold up as well as I thought they would and (2) some patters are less durable than others (in my case, brown with blue polka dots and giraffe became stiff and shrunk quickly).	
1. 	We have this hanging on the baby's crib and it's very soothing for the baby.  One thing I did though was actually pulled the little speaker device out so it hangs outside of the bear's belly and it makes it nice and loud because it isn't being muffled from the inside stuffing of the bear.  PLUS, it's then much more sensitive to pick up sounds that will then, set it off again. I can be talking quietly in the room and it will set it off.The down-side to this product is if you do keep the little speaker tucked in and closed up inside the bear, it's a pain in the butt to turn the device on--it's not easy to get to the on button.  I suppose you could leave it on the entire time but there's times when you don't really want the thing on.	
1. 	Others complained about the smell; I think the baby-powder smell helps to offset other odors.	
- 1	This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says do not drill through the door, hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter	
1. 	simple seat for my daughter to take a bath in.  She is 4 months old and outgrew the small bath that we were using.  We wanted something that could be placed in the tub and still make sure she remained safe.  After about 5 or 6 baths we are very happy with it.  The quality could be a little better and it would be nice if it would be a little larger for longer use in the future but for the price I can't complain too much.	
- 1	Within one year, 3 out of 4 of these were broken. We are able to use the last one still but I am sure it is only a matter of time before the plastic band breaks on it too. Do not waste your money. At first they seem great but they will break!	
- 1	We bought this wipes warmer for our son's room and it was awful.  The wipes were always hard and brown at the bottom.  We wasted more money throwing ruined wipes away.  We returned it and bought the Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer.  We've had that one for 8 months now and never had a problem with burnt wipes.  I should have paid the money and bought that one in the first place.  Don't waste your money or time buying this wipes warmer- it is cheap and you will regret it.	
1. 	We have been using it for 6 months. It still looks great after many washes. And I love the fact that it's made of organic cotton grown in Texas.	
- 1	my 6 month old like to put everything in his mouth and is pleased that the mirror/music box hangs at just the right height for this.  the toy as a whole however is not great.  the mirror only plays one tune 90% of the time.  twice i have heard something different and wondered if it was a new song or the batteries dying.  the music lasts a very short period of time and is very hard to activate.  it has to be hit just right.  while i like the way the toy attaches, with two easy to use clamps, the joints, which make the toy angled, do not work well and the music isnt a great feature.  the mirror is low quality and images are very distorted. on a positive note, the bird has balls in its belly, which turns, and the fan works well with the pulling of the string.	
- 1	Even my preschooler seems to have more stuff to carry than this can fit.  It doesn't even fit a bath towel and a swim suit.	
- 1	The term 'blanket' is not an accurate description here.It's far too small to be used as a blanket - I use it as a burp cloth (just covers my shoulder).  It looks like a rushed-job from the creative department of someone's kitchen table. Neither plush or elegant. Missed opportunity!!	
- 1	I Read the reviews and decided to order the extra-base even with the issues people were having to make it work with the Snugride30 carseat. What a mistake, not only is there no level but there are no instructions on how to level it without one. Even using a household level you still need to know the proper incline (they don't just sit flat). We could have lived with being off a few degrees, but when we tested the seat in the base it wobbled... A LOT. Not something that is very comforting to put your little one in. To top it off, it kept getting stuck in the base when we tried to remove it, I can only imagine how frustrating that would have been if there was a baby in it and it wouldn't unlatch.None of these things are an issue when placed in the original base made specifically for the Snugride 30. It levels easily and properly, snaps in securely, and releases smoothly. Graco is out of their minds if they think that the Snugride 35 base is an acceptable option.On the postitive note, Amazon is AMAZING for hassle free returns and Graco was great about letting us order the original base for the Snugride30 as a replacement part. Sure I paid about $10 more ordering from them instead of off Amazon, but for the piece of mind and a properly fitting carseat it was money well spent.	
1. 	Last year when I was pregnant, I asked other moms which cups and bottles to use.  A few told me playtex, but most told me Avent bottles and sippy cups were the only way to go.  Well, I decided to go Avent, and here I am writing a review for a playtex sippy cup.  Avent sippy cups are hard to hold, difficult to drink from when the cup is not filled to capacity, a pain to clean, and worst of all they leak.  The spout leaks (nothing magic about those cups) and the collars can leak too.  I finally decided after 5 months of using Avent magic cups with little success, to give the &quot;hard to use&quot; (as one mom had classified) playtex cup a try.  The difference was astounding.  My daughter could easily drink from this cup on the first try.  The cup is easy to clean (its only 3 pieces as opposed to the 5 or 6(w/handles) pieces for the avent cup), assemble and use.  I'm sorry I didn't at least register for a pack of these when I was pregnant.  I should mention that I	
- 1	I bought this in hopes that it would hold all my sons bath toys...... But it didn't! It will not stay on the wall once the toys are added. And my son who is 2 has a hard time getting the toys out of the bag because everything gets caught in the netting. It now sits behind our toilet with a few toys in it that he never plays with.I gave it one extra star because if your just putting a few light weight toys in it like bath letters it is functional and doesn't take alot of room.	
- 1	To short for the baby to play with, and difficult to get to make noise. Not a good buy for us.	
- 1	Just bought these at Target.  First of all, the air freshener does not stay in the clip, it falls right out.  Second of all, the fragrance isn't strong enough to make a difference.  Right now I have it sitting on top of the diaper pail, just to see if I can smell it (I put it on the inside of the pail & it fell out) and I smell nothing.  These are going back to the store.	
- 1	I purchased this mattress because i wanted to avoid nasty flame retardants and the price, even though quite high, was still lower than most other organic crib mattresses. However, after 1 month of use we decided to return this product and amazon was great in refunding the full amount.Pros: fits well in the criborganic without natural flame retardant barrierCons: extremely heavy - my husband even had trouble changing the sheets since I couldn't do it at allvery soft - even though it says it is a firm mattress, it was giving in quite easily and. my 10lb baby made a dent in the middle  that wouldn't go away. After just one month!cover deformed - the waterproof cover seemed well made at first but after just one month use and the formation of the dent in the center the cover started to have folds(for lack of a better word)overall, I was very disappointed in this product. I am still looking for a reasonably priced mattress without FRs that will last. This is not it.	
1. 	We got this seat when our 14 1/2 month old daughter showed a real interest in potty training.  We had looked at potty units but they were awful pricy and seemed like they would be a total pain to keep clean.  We opted for one this seat and a step stool instead.The seat doesn't take up hardly any room in her bathroom.  Most times we just leave it on the seat for her.  It is easily cleaned with a bleach clean up wipe.  Plus it is very convenient and easy to use.  There isn't anything to empty or try to keep clean.  Plus this unit doesn't do any of the silly and destracting things like play music which some of the chiars did.She also likes the handles on the sides.  They give her something to hold on to as she still a bit unstable.  They also keep her hands off the toilet paper which she loves to unroll.  All in all, this has been an inexpensive and effective way to start potty training her.  At he rate she is going she should be completely done by mid-fall and I think it has alot to do with this seat.	
- 1	i like the idea of this - something soft and cushy for baby.  but it absorbs water, so after taking baby out&#8230;it weighs about 30 lbs. if you hung it on your shower head to dry&#8230;it would take the shower head down. so, i left it lying in the tub&#8230;and then it became mildewy.  i ended up throwing it away and getting the plastic version. disappointed.	
- 1	This product doesn't provide enough back support for carrying your baby for more than 15 minutes comfortable. The one things hyour do get with this carrier is that it gives your baby more freedom to move around. Other than that this carrier has low marks for functionality.If you'd like a full review of the best baby carriers, and what to look for, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com. in the Baby Gear section you'll find a stroller shopping guide, what you must have on your registry vs what you really can live without, and the best toys and games for baby stimulation by age range.	
- 1	Dangerous, turned around for a second to grab a book and my daughter was wrapped in it. She is a feisty little, but I can not see this being safe at all for anyone. She doesn't even roll over yet and still got wrapped in it. She did like looking at it from afar. She would stare at it from her sit me up frog and swing. So I give it 2 stars for visual stimulation purposes!	
- 1	We purchased this gate to replace the First Years Hands-Free Gate when the foot pedal broke after 1.5 years of heavy use, however, we quickly returned it and got another hands-free gate.1) The weight of the bars on the extra-tall felt flimsy when compared to the hands-free. It just didn't feel sturdy. My son would pull on it in an attempt to enter the kitchen and you can see the bars give a little.2) The self-closing feature sounds like a good idea, but it slams shut making a really loud noise and if you're trying to direct your child out of the room, you have to make sure you hold it open for them and it doesn't slam in their face when they decide to change directions.3) The latch on the gate we got was very sticky. It took two hands and quite some force before it would open. Upon investigation, we think the self-closing mechanism at the bottom of the gate caused this problem because it wouldn't let you lift it high enough to unlatch smoothly. It seemed as if it was in the way and prevented the gate from lifting. This was a problem since we used our gate between the kitchen and the living room so if we needed to rush in between either room, it was very frustrating trying to get the gate open.4) This gate did come with extensions so that is a deal if you need them to fit your doorway.In the end issues #2 and 3 was enough trouble to make us go back and buy the hands-free gate again.	
1. 	My 18 month old son enjoys sitting on his &#34;potty&#34;.  It seems very comfortable for him, and it is easy to clean.	
- 1	There is technically nothing terrible about this product but it sticks as poorly as any other product.  Get a regular $2 bowl at target and call it a day	
1. 	I like it, it kept him secure... except when the strap slid along the seatbelt and unfastned it. This is more a flaw with the design of airplane seatbelts then the vest though.	
1. 	We followed directions for installation and do not overload it. Holds 2 soaps/shampoos 2 wash rags and a few toys. No problems. Love it!	
- 1	UPDATE: After reading some other reviews here about getting parts replaced, I called about the warranty and received awful customer service! They told me that they can't do anything for me because I unscrewed the top off of it. The warranty on page 19 of the manual says nothing about voiding the warranty. She pointed me to page 3 where it warns not to open the unit, but it never says that this will void the warranty. All they offered me was a manual pump, when I paid almost $200 for a double electric because I need it and it failed from normal use after only 3 months.I asked what I was supposed to do in a situation where I rely on my pump to work, and all she could come up with was that I should have just left work then until they sent me a new one. I can't just stop working until they get me a new one! She also kept equating it to a television warranty, but obviously you can go longer without a tv than you can go without pumping. Considering that I know women who exclusively pump to feed their children, I am appalled that they make a product that people absolutely depend on, then claim they can't honor their warranty because I depended on it enough that I couldn't sit and wait. When I asked to escalate my complaint, SHE REFUSED. She told me she is the supervisor, and her boss doesn't handle these types of issues. What kind of customer service center has no path of escalating issues? Downgrading from 3 stars to 1 star over the horrible service.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using this twice a day at work for 3 months now, after using a hospital rental the first few weeks home with the baby. I love the features -- it is great to be able to completely customize the suction and speed each time. It's also so handy to have the button right in your hand to turn it on and off, with my hospital pump I was always messing around trying to get it turned off with my toe while I had the pumps in each hand. I also never had a problem with getting as much milk in as little time with this one as I did with the hospital pump.Unfortunately you can tell that this is among the cheaper double electric pumps. A gear inside keeps falling off of its post, at least once a week, and now my pump bag always includes a pen-sized screwdriver to get it back into place when it falls off. I don't know if a piece broke or what, because it looks like there's very little holding it onto the post. When I'm at work I hate that I am wasting time fiddling with the inner workings of my breast pump when I should be finishing up and getting back to work.In short, you can tell they put some effort into finding out what features would make it easier to use. I just wish they had made it with better standards for quality, I need to rely on this for at least another 7 months!	
- 1	It's hard to use, and then you finally do use it, it doesn't work. I suppose the plug on the bottom, designed to help you clean it, would be a useful feature if it were at all possible to get the thing dirty in the first place.Get the same one they gave you in the hospital, a basicBulb Syringe Aspirator, if you want something that actually works. You can also find them at some drug stores.	
1. 	Diaper Champ works great! You can use your regular garbarge bags with it. No need to buy re-fills.	
- 1	I was so excited to find a pail specifically for cloth diapers that I eagerly awaited it's arrival and as soon as I opened the box my heart sunk I was so disappointed and wanted to return it. The bin is so small and I felt not at all worth the price. However, after realizing the $12 shipping cost to me would come out of my pocket, as well as the cost to send it back, it felt like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place-either pay $25 to return a $38 bucket or just keep it, so it's now sitting in it's box in a corner of the nursery.I looked for cloth diaper pails everythwere (online, that is) and couldn't find another that was larger and sepcifically for cloth diapers. I would recommend someone get a simple plastic bin and stick the air fresheners/filters onto the inside of the lid, it would save significant $$ and I wish I had thought to do that instead.Currently, I have a nice big one from the gal who owns the diaper service we use (I didn't realize she was providing a pail when we ordered this one) I asked where she got it and how much it costs. Found out it comes from Canada and she can get one for about $40. I'm not sure of the brand or how she orders them but if I find out I'll add it to this review	
- 1	I wish I could give this less than 1 star. Just got off the phone with their customer service.I bought this product (the gray center and gray lid version) in the mid 2011 while expecting my first child. I ended up barely using it (only for steaming) because my child turned out to be very sensitive to texure and Brezza could not puree the food finely enough for her. It sat on the kitchen shelf until this year, when my youngest was ready to start solids. She is less finicky, so I was using Brezza a bit  more - maybe 2 to 3 times a week, I would not say that's heavy use by any measure. Three months later, the bowl broke (see my review below) and the shaft started falling out. There were no replacement bowls available on their web site, so I called customer service and was informed that this was their first model, which has been discontunued and there are no replacement parts anymore and the warranty is only 1 year from purchase! Mind that a lot of people get these as gifts on baby shower, so by the time the baby is old enought to start solids, the warranty has run out. What a waste of money! I am definitely not spending another $100 on a Brezza. This company obviously does not stand by their product, so I have no trust in them.I bought this product 3 years ago but used only for 3 months. So far worked as designed, I barely used with my fist child; now  with my second I make a batch of baby food 2-3 times a week. More frequent use caused some plastic parts on the bottom to break off so the drive shaft does not lock in anymore. Here comes the kicker: it is impossible to find a replacement bowl! The website lists a replacement bowl with an orange center for $24 which it states will not work with the gray one, but even that is not availlable. So, am I supposed to buy a whole new one for $80+? and trash the old one which still works?! If I were aware of that from the start I would have NOT purchased this product.	
- 1	I don't like it very bulky, also the fabric tear a part the very first day, and fabric also is like suede. I want to like it but nook!	
1. 	Our baby was born in December and we used the infant Bundleme from December until April, and it was a lifesaver in freezing Minnesota. He's now 11 months old and the infant version is too small, so we bought the toddler one for this winter. It's a different material than the infant sack, more velvety than woolly. It fits perfectly in my Uppababy Vista stroller and keeps him nice and warm up to his neck, unless he sticks his arms out. It's a bit of work to put this on the stroller and take it off every time you go out, so I just leave it on always and flip down the top part when we're indoors. The downside, though, is that since the material is really warm he gets heated just by sitting on the bottom half when we're indoors for a while.	
1. 	I love all avent products,so easy and wonderful cant go wrong with them.They are just the best.Highly recommend to all mommy out there	
1. 	We loved this for our small baby. He napped in it a lot and played in it a lot. I'm not sure how I feel about the Toddler Rocker feature.	
- 1	Our son was not a large baby, but he grew out of this tub within 3 months.  He also hated the sling that came with it.  The main problem we found was that our little guy was able to catapult himself upwards so easily when he would kick against the part of the tub that holds the washcloth/soap/etc.  This was not safe.  On top of that, he never seemed comfy.  We ended up buying the Primo Eurobath and it's perfect!  Bulky but a great tub.  I wish I'd registered for that one in the first place.  This Sure Comfort one was a waste of money, in my opinion.	
- 1	[...]I don't know how many times my fingers have gotten caught in the pack `n play when I am trying to break it down and unlock the sides. I thought this thing was suppose to be for convenience not butchering your fingers?! How many of you have gotten ouchies from a pack `n play ? I'm just glad little fingers are not strong enough to unlock the sides and get their fingers caught!	
1. 	Haven't used these yet because I haven't had the baby but looking forward to it!!! I can buy them cheaper somewhere else but still good product it seems like!!	
- 1	I thought this was useful until I discovered the BabyConnect app for iphone.  That is much more versatile and lets me keep track of only one device (my phone).	
- 1	Our 10 month does not like it at all. She prefers Razbaby RaZberry Teether(from 3 mo till now it's her fav.)Maybe later she will use this weird teether. I like the description of the product and unusual shape that's why I give it 2 stars. Btw I bought it for $15 on amazon.	
1. 	This is by far one of the best purchases I made for my baby. The rocking motion helps my baby sleep when nothing else could. He doesn't care much for the toys so we just take them off and use the rocker without them. The music isn't that great but it doesn't really bother my boy, so no biggie. He's just two months now but I expect he'll continue to love this rocker until he's 2 or 3.	
1. 	These are a must have for potty training mommies.  Keep them in your purse, glove box, change of clothes bag, desk drawer, etc.  They put your mind at ease when creating a germ-proof barrier between body and filthy toilet seats.  The four star rating is due to the difficulty in QUICKLY removing the adhesive strips. This takes some time which sometimes lead to accidents with an urgent toddler.P.S. Great for adults too...in case, one day you really need to sit! (smile)	
- 1	Pay attention to the style you order. I did not receive the style I ordered but kept the one I received. Not sure how that happened. The plastic smell is bothersome at first but goes away after a while. It is useful.	
- 1	This item is not at all what I thought it would be.  I bought it because it would be nice to be able to grab any shopping cart and not have to sort through 50 just to find one with a working belt.  When I got it, I realized it is only a straight (adjustable) belt with two ends that clip to the cart.  There is NO buckle in the middle.  Normally, shopping cart belts have two clips that hook to the cart side and a buckle in the middle to get your kid in and out easily.  This just has the clips which have a small plastic flap to hook over the bars.  I tucked it in the diaper bag anyway though I admit, I've never used this thing.  Then again, if it was different construction I probably would.  I vowed to make my own from supplies at Joann Fabrics and just haven't done it yet but this thing still sits unused in my diaper bag.*update 7/19/12: never used it.  Donated it.  Someone else may love it but I found the clips to be more hassle than the lack of a seatbelt on a grocery cart.  Too bad, I had good expectations of this thing.*	
- 1	When i discovered this product last year before my son  was born i thought that i would have all bases covered but he just does not like this at all. It could be that he never used a pacifier and this is in that shape but he wont stand for it at all.He is using the Zo-li for his molars and he can freely manipulate it and he loves it.See my review for that product	
- 1	I am very disappointed in these bottles. I only use Dr. Brown's and thought that the wide necks might be a good addition to our bottle supply-- however these bottles leak non-stop! I know it's not me since I don't have this problem with any of my other bottles. I would go to the regular size instead of these.	
1. 	I really wish I'd bought these before the birth. I got them a few months into breast feeding and loved them. They are really best for wearing in the privacy of your home as they will be visible unless you're wearing a bulky sweater. However if you are at all interested in reserving every last drop of precious breast milk you will appreciate these! Also, for soar nipples they provide a little relief.The fit in the bra and a hole around the nipple allows leakage to flow undaunted, I found that the fit was good and everything leaked in the reservoir as designed. Wearing them around during the day helped me collect an extra ounce and a half of milk (foremilk, but still good stuff - hydration is essential!) that would otherwise have been wasted into my clothing.	
- 1	I gave this to my toddler to help her transition into a big girl cup. She chews on most everything, and the products I purchase need to be able to hold up to the fact that she's hard on things. She was able to chew on the spout opening to the point where there was a big hole where the spout was within a day. In order to wash this cup, you need to remove the top silicon cover, which I found to be very thin, but it did wash okay. However, you need a back up cup while the other one dries. If you use this cup when it's not completely dry, the silicon cover leaks. Plus, my toddler can easily remove the spout on her own. I won't be buying this product again.I checked with my daughter's daycare, and they've experienced the same issues.	
- 1	I got this blanket today and it seemed small.  I measured it and end to end, including bindings, it was 25&#34; wide and 29.5&#34; high.  Certainly not 30&#34; x 40&#34; as stated.  If it shrinks even more when it washes, that's even worse.	
- 1	These were tearing up within a few days of getting them in the mail.  They did not hold up to a toddlers biting well at all.  Especially if your child has oral motor issues, go with something else.  Even for the average teether, go with something else.	
1. 	I was very confused to narrow down on a bath tub for my new born daughter initially, after reading the reviews for this bath tub, me and my wife decided to give it a try for my new born daughter. My baby absolutely loves to be bathed in this, she is so comfortable in this and the sling is perfect for the baby. It fits well in our bath tub, It is really a good bath tub and good value for money.	
1. 	These do just what they're supposed to: they fully close the Dr Browns bottles to be air tight. They're great for when I use the larger Dr Browns bottles for milk storage in the fridge. I also plan to use them to keep bottles fully closed when traveling. I'd highly recommend them.	
1. 	This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.	
- 1	This pitcher is very small, and feels cheaply made. I don't love it or use it. I feel like a rubbermaid pitcher would have been better plus it can be repurposed. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	Being a new mom after many years is a wonderful feeling! I love the ease of using these bottles. It is must better to just toss the liner when baby is done instead of cleaning bottles every night. It makes being a mom so much easier! I would highly recommend these to any new parents.	
- 1	I purchased these sheets to go on the Graco Pack & Play On the Go Travel Playard. After washing and drying the sheet on normal wash settings, the sheet barely fits on the provided mattress and the mattress begins to fold up under the tension of the sheet. I realize these sheets are advertised as fitting a &#34;mini-crib,&#34; however they are cross-referenced with the Graco Pack and Play (along with the American Baby portable/mini-crib mattress pad which also DOES NOT fit) and many people have suggested they fit the Graco Pack and Play. Maybe it's the specific Graco model that I have or maybe they have changed size recently, but they do not fit mine. Back to the drawing board for me.	
1. 	This mattress is just as advertised. It is a little hard but put the mattress pad on and it will be perfect!	
- 1	This monitor, at first, worked great but then  the range alarm started going off ALL the time and it clearly was not out of range given that our sons room is directly across from ours, this monitor drove us absolutely nuts! We would have to move it around all through out the night and get it in just the right spot for it to realize it was in range with the other unit, so enjoying ! Also the volume control is so poorly designed because if you barely touch it  it moves and there have been a few times where my husband or I unknowingly hit the volume control just while moving the unit around and we completely turned the volume off! Which was not good!  So anyways I would recommend that you spend your money on something else because I regret buying this and unfortunately I can no longer return it. Hope this helps :)	
1. 	nevermind if you have one or 4 children, this kit is essential for every mom who loves the life outdoors.	
1. 	I thought I would be getting a crispy, cheap sheet.  Was so very pleasantly surprised when I got a soft, washable sheet in a beautifully saturated color.  I got both the orange and turquoise color and they are spectacular.  I have a Dwell sheet that is not even as soft as these are.  I highly recommend these as there are enough colors to brighten up any nursery.	
- 1	We used these bibs several times and they did pretty well in the washing machine (we didn't dry them, per the instructions). The snap closure on one bib broke after about a month of use. Not the best product...very cute but not durable.	
1. 	I must say I'm guilty of purchasing anything that has &#34;Mozart&#34; in the name, since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer. But this is the best toy ever. When I bought it my baby was a newborn, so mostly I played with it. But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it. Whenever he is fussy, I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once. Best toy ever!	
- 1	I received the wrong color at first, but instead was offered to get a free color of my choice.  The pacifiers are really good, but the silicone nipple fell off really easily of two of the pacifiers.	
1. 	Looks good, feels fine and baby seems to like it. I see no reason in spending 4x as much money for the others when this one does the job just fine. I keep mine in my car for short pop-in situations that make taking the car seat to bulky. Takes no time to put it on, once you initially adjust the straps to what feels good, and no time to take it off. Putting baby in has even gotten easier (I had one 9yrs ago) now with the dual side entry buckles. I have no strap or back issues.**JMO - Adjust the straps so that baby sits as high up as possible. The baby should not hang (I hate to see people wearing their babies too low) then there's no issue with baby's legs hitting yours; unless of course your baby just has long legs :-)I recommend this carrier, over the more pricey ones.Oh yeah, the pocket in front came in very handy.	
1. 	I was going to buy a few Avent disposable bottles for travel, but having to buy separate nipples made it a waste of money.  Then Avent came out with these!I like how you can use the regular nipples and these are cheap enough you can just toss them (especially great when you find it two weeks later until the seat).  :c)Also get the extra refill pack.  You can use these all of the time.  I also have the regular bottles, too, for home.	
- 1	My husband and I bought 2 jumperoos - one by Baby Einstein and one called Luv U Zoo by Fisher-Price. We have about %95 of our baby's toys made by Fisher Price, so we thought we would for sure like it. We were wrong...The 2 good things about this jumperoo that Baby Einstein is lacking in, are these 2 features:1. The Fisher Price jumperoo has a motion activated music, with the option to leave the music playing for up to 20 minutes. Baby Einstein works only when pressed on the piano's keys (plays cute classic music but for only 10-15 seconds,or you can select it to say colors and shapes in 3 different languages)2. Fisher Price has a rest area for the arms on the swivel seat, which is great for younger babies.Although with the Baby Einstein's jumperoo the assembly took longer, the base was A LOT (!!!!!) more sturdy and didn't giggle from side to side at all. Fisher Price was so wobbly, it truly felt like a safety hazard to put our baby in it. The wobbly part was the 2 arms on the sides, it felt like it could snap off the base.This Fisher price jumperoo was so disappointing, we returned it the very next day.	
1. 	Okay, so I'm pretty sure that they could make breast shields out of rainbows and sunshine and I would still hate pumping.  That being said, I did find these shields more comfortable than the hard plastic shields.  I could create a better seal with it around my breast which led me to be able to pump a little more and a little more efficiently.  I was getting an extra ounce or so per pumping session (and considering I would get 2 oz or so with the other breast shields, was a HUGE improvement).  If you are having trouble, I would definitely say give these a try.	
1. 	just the perfect thing to  help tiny cloggy noses. my lil one screams at the site of it but it works!	
1. 	We picked this because it was lightweight and it is easy to change the sheets.  We really like it and it fits tightly in the crib.	
- 1	I was not a fan because the straps continue to loosen as you wear it, so you're constantly trying to find a way to tighten the straps without disturbing baby.  My baby was not a fan because no matter how I tied it around her, the straps dug into her back or legs and made her cry.  Overall, a bust.	
1. 	After lots of reviews I figured this was the best seat for our long toilet's (Kohler brand). While this doesn't 100% fit/lock in. It does stay in place and is very comfortable for my son. It made for an easy transition from potty chair to the bigger toilet.	
1. 	This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!	
1. 	My 24 month old daughter has only wet the bed a handful of times while this has been in use, and it has not leaked so I am pleased.It does not fit perfectly well onto her bed, despite the flaps, and needs to be tucked in again every so often. This, however, is a small inconvenience and my daughter likes it well. Its softness is a plus from her point of view, as she tends to put her whole body on it, including her face!	
1. 	Pros:  -they don't leak unless baby bangs it on something hard, even then only a few drops come out.  Even if you turn it upside down, it doesn't leak because of the valve.-Fairly easy to clean as long as you don't let it sit.-Nice looking, comes in a variety of colors...some gender neutral-You can buy extra valves on Amazon for just a few dollars.  I've had my cups for about a year and still don't need new valves.-You can remove the valve completely and use the bottle for an older child.-Baby sucks it like a straw almost, it doesn't just pour out like other cups.-Very durable, my daughter throws it around like a football and it's still in good shape.Cons:-Because of the way the inside of the lid is shaped (the valve takes some room in the lid) you will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS waste like a half an ounce of liquid.  It gets stuck in the lid and baby can't suck it out.  So that half an ounce of milk (or whatever baby is drinking) gets wasted.  But in the end this is needed so it can truly be leakproof.-There's no way to measure how many ounces you are filling in the cup, there are no measuring lines which is a little absurd.  This should be an easy fix for Playtex.  The cup is seven ounces, so minus one ounce that gets wasted, you are left with a six ounce cup (but still, it would be nice to be able to measure).Conclusion: It's a damn good cup, I've purchased several.	
- 1	Our six month old baby doesn't really like this toy.  I was hoping he would, but it doesn't hold his interest very much.  It seems well made and I have no complaints with the toy itself, only that my baby prefers other toys over this one.	
- 1	This are too small.  They leak!  No good....Do not waste your money!  I wish I had invest a little more for the better ones.	
- 1	These run really small. I definitely prefer my Green Mountain Diaper prefolds to these. They aren't very absorbent and are too small to snappi. I ordered the 6 pack and now I only use them tri-folded, and even then I don't use them often. There are better prefolds out there. I wouldn't recommend these.	
1. 	My son is 16 months and we have been using this stroller for nearly a year.  It has fit our needs very nicely and we are very happy with this purchase.Positives:1. It is very light weight and compact.  Fits easily in our car.2. I can fold/lock and unfold it quite easily with one hand -  with a toddler on one hip and a travel bag over my other shoulder.3. My son seems quite comfortable in it and my husband, parents and I all seem to have an easy time pushing it.4. I like the 5 point harness - especially since we started using it at 6 months of age.5. I love that it does not tip backwards (even when I take my son out) when I hang a bag or two over the handlebars. Very convenient!Negatives:1. It would be nice if it reclined more.2. The material is easy to wipe clean.  However, if it really gets soiled (we brought it to a very dusty third world country for a few weeks), it is difficult to more thoroughly clean.  The fabric says it is machine washable, but the instruction manual reports that the fabric is not removable.  The washing never would have been an issue with normal use.Overall, a recommended purchase.  A great step up from the basic cheap umbrella stroller without breaking the bank.	
- 1	I wanted to cut corners and get a much less expensive version of Sofie the Giraffe.  I was sorely disappointed.  This teether is fit for a dog, not a baby.  It smells awful, and the paint job appears to be done with a paint that I would compare to white-out.  It is lumpy and chipping off in places.  The picture makes this toy appear quite pretty, but in person, the face looks very poorly done, and the squeak is so so loud (just like a dog chew toy).  My suggestion is to spend the extra money and get the real thing.	
1. 	This lock is working well for me to keep my child from accidentally opening a basement door. There are some things to keep in mind, though.One, put this high. I just found out today that my two-year-old knows how to open it. I was holding him near the door to see if he could figure it out and he did. It's very easy to unlock this clasp, as you just have to push the plate slightly up while pulling it towards you. If a child can use a chair or something else to reach it, they could beat it. There's nothing he can move in my house that will let him even get close to reaching mine, though.Two, the screws that come with the product are junk, as has been stated. Even with little torque, mine both were eaten by the drill bit. I put two of my own in without a problem, though. Remember to keep the tiny little screw, though, if you ever want to permanently unlock the product. Me, I'll just remove it when it no longer serves a function, but it's good to have the option in case you need to leave it in place but don't want to bother with it all the time.Three, make your install easy. Close the door you're putting it on, hold it in place in the locked position, then open your door, put the lock up and screw it in. You'll want to actually see it in place before attaching it because if the plate can't lock into position, you'll have to take it down and screw it in all over again.So far, I'm glad I've gotten this rather than the plastic globes you put over doorknobs. When I first put this on, I forgot about it and tried opening the door and it stopped me. At that point, just to see, I tried opening it with more pressure and it held. Looks like it'll stop my kid even if he really tries to open the door.UPDATE April 12, 2012:I'm buying a second one tonight for my front door. This has worked out well for these past few months and kept the little one from being able to open the door to the basement, but he's now able to open the front door, so one is going there as well.	
1. 	easy to assemble.  The color is as expected.  I did not purchase the rails, but I do not plan to convert this to a full size bed.  The additional rail to make it a toddler day bed is great, but I had to find a place to store it.	
- 1	These were not worth the hours and frustration of putting them together. The fabric portion of the rails was not sturdy and the stitching ripped as I was sliding it onto the rails. The rails themselves were not as heavy as the replacements I bought a day later. After spending hours sweating and cursing putting them together, the guides bent and wouldn't even hide away between the mattress and boxspring.  I returned these as fast as possible and bought two single rails at my local WalMart that were much better quality and much easier to assemble. I'm much happier with the new set I got. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.	
1. 	It works well, but needs to have a few things to make it perfect.  My daughter is only 4 months old and can bust out of it like the Hulk in a styrofoam building.  I think the arm parts need something a little extra to keep the arms more down, maybe a button or a velcro connection.  At any rate, it does do it's job, but it's frustrating that she keeps getting out, lol!	
- 1	I ordered one and my daughter had no teeth yet, and it popped within days, so, I ordered another one because I thought it was a fluke and she loved the first one, and it popped within days as well, I sure hope the liquid inside is non toxic!!!!  What a waste of money!!!  It is  just plastic, probably was a dollar to manufacture, what a rip off!!!	
- 1	I tried this 3 times when my son woke with colic pain and each time my son screamed and tried pulling it off, thus making him wake up completely and it would take forever for me to get him back to sleep.  I have used Earth Mama Angle Baby's booby tubes with great success so I know he does not mind the warmth....I think it was the wrap all the way around him that bothered him.  Or maybe the smell because, I could not stand the smell myself.  I just returned this.	
1. 	The basic covers did not cut it. They are tough to remove, but that is the point. We feel much safer.	
1. 	I really like these blocks.  I bought them both as an eventual toy for as yet unborn child, but also to use as nursery decor in the meantime.  The design of the blocks is really great, colors are vibrant, designs are clear.  The packaging was very nice, it would make a really wonderful gift.  I really like knowing these were made in the USA and are completely non-toxic.	
1. 	Used this on a JEEP TWIN UMBRELLA stroller when we went to Disney World. When going to any theme park a sunshade on your stroller is a MUST. Now, because our double umbrella and many others does not have very sturdy canopies, there is really nothing for the sunshade to rest on across the top when you tie the ends down to the stroller. We actually placed the top middle part of the shade OVER the middle handle on the stroller (the jeep double umbrella has 3 handles to push with across the top). By using the center handle as a support this sunshade was awesome. If you have a different double umbrella with better shades (like the McClaren which I think is the one pictured), the shade will be supported by those smaller shades.	
1. 	We're expecting our first baby around Christmas and wanted a way to keep our expected little one out of the bathroom. Normally you could just shut the door, but we are also cat owners and they need access to the litter box. This is a great option if your situation is anything like ours. Our bathroom doorway is at 28 which is the minimum width of this gate and it fits perfectly with the pressure mount system. Its also easy to take down for my husband, who is in a wheelchair. Since the gate is secure enough to withstand our pulling on it we're really confident this will pass the baby test.	
- 1	I've had this cup for a month. I think it looks very cute and is easy for a baby to hold. The flow seems just right and they do not leak. However, the valve smells very very very strongly of awful chemicals, to the point where I felt like I was giving poison to my child. I have washed the valve over and over and the smell is always there. Is this BPA free? I'm looking for something else because I believe this cup could be detrimental to my child's health in the long run.	
1. 	Our 9 month old baby boy has many of the little toys, and this is one of his favorites.  He likes to hold it and shake it back and forth.  Haba toys are the best!	
1. 	I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all.	
- 1	I got this pump, because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night. At first the pump worked great... getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk.Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher, so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me).Then, my milk supply started to diminish, due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing, but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement. I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively, with no bottles, to stimulate my milk supply back, but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever.So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust, what a waist of $50.00.	
1. 	I'm pleased with this monitor.  I've had it for about 3 months and I haven't had any problems so far.Originally I had registered for a different monitor, but I had to make a change when I looked into the frequency of my wireless internet.  For those of you with wireless internet, apparently the 2.4 Ghz monitors can cause interference.  On the other hand though, I have had some interference with this monitor picking up some phone conversations in the neighborhood.  It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, I just change to the other channel and the problem goes away.The nice thing about the child unit is that it attaches to the crib-you just lock it onto the top bar and then unlock it when you need to take it off to recharge.  I find that I have no problem with the unit lasting through night (10-12 hours), but that I do need to recharge it during the day.The parent unit can easily clip onto your pants, or you can put it in your back or shirt pocket.  Kind of a nice feature when you're running around the house and you don't have time to put it down!The lights are nice too, although I like to have the volume on anyways so that I can monitor him better.  Nonetheless, it's a nice feature.Nice features, works well, and goes for a reasonable price.  I think this monitor is a pretty good bet!	
- 1	This thing made us crazy. Usually Nuby products are well-made and reliable. This one leaked everywhere, no matter how carefully we secured the lid and handles, and no matter how often we cleaned it, it smelled like sour milk. Even after being run through the dishwasher on the sterilize setting. I threw it out about three weeks after I got it, because Nuby makes much better sippy cups and bottles for less expense.	
- 1	I received this as a gift and I'm returning it. This is basically just a tv.... For a baby.... Insanity! This and products like it turn kids brains to mush. And personally I blame these kind of push a button and lights flash, loud toys are a huge factor to the incline of kids inability to focus, the need for instant gratification and the sense of entitlement. Chose your kids toys wisely.	
1. 	These bottles worked wonders for my son!  They are great for gassy and colicy babies!  And no matter what anyone says I have been using them for 16 months now and have never had a leak unless you don't pull the nipple in all the way, which any bottle will leak if you don't put the nipple in all the way.  Out of all the bottles I tried these are the best!  THEY ARE DEFINITELEY WORTH THE FEW EXTRA DOLLARS!	
- 1	Used this exactly twice in our Britax B-Safe infant seat, because it made the seat too cramped for our 9lb baby.  She hated being in her carseat until we removed this pad, then she was fine.	
1. 	Thin plastic outlet covers....they fit tight enough to prevent little fingers from removing.  Older little ones might be able to remove them.	
- 1	This was just too small and didn't seem stable enough. Plus the peepoo hole is too small! We returned it.	
1. 	I love the whole Playtex Nurser system.  I became incredibly prone to blocked ducts when pumping and feeding some bottles became a part of our routine.  I had tried other systems, and the Playtex one, by far, was the best.  These liners are thin enough to manipulate easily, but also durable.  We have never had one leak in the diaper bag!	
- 1	I should have got the pull up but right after birth I put it on and yes, I was still a bit chunky but the zipper popped off instantly which for this expensive girdle I would have thought it would have held up better. The material does seem good quality but for me, it was money down the drain.	
- 1	What I like:- Colorful- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining- SmallWhat I Don't like:- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max- Musical part was two 5 second tunes- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.- Pillow is so small its uselessThis will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child.	
1. 	This works great in my husbands car, all the other ones wouldn't fit right or you couldn't see the baby. This one is very flexible and easy to install.	
1. 	After reading other customer reviews, THANK YOU, decided to go with large size; my grandson is 13 months old, 27 lbs and 32 inches tall, Tiger fits him great now and should last him a few years!  The small size must really be for very tiny babies!?  Very well made and easy to navigate - runs well on carpets w/o thick padding, too!  Nice rounded handlebar instead of two sticks so baby is unlikely to hurt itself.  Sturdy and well balanced so it doesn't tip over easily; actually has to be pushed over on purpose.  I've been watching these Wheelies for some time now and am happy they're making better choices for boys, this Tiger is ADORABLE with his stripes, fuzzy tail and ears!	
1. 	This carrier saved me from going crazy!  My son, now 4 months old, HATES his carseat.  I couldn't take him out and have him in the infant carrier because he would just cry the whole time, no matter where we were.  The Bjorn was the perfect answer.  Even when he was only a few weeks old, he would happily ride in the front carrier for hours.  Facing in, it kept him close and kept his head steady when he couldn't do it on his own.  Now he rides facing out and loves watching people and watching what I'm doing.  Best of all, it's easy to get on and easy to get the baby settled into, even without any help.UPDATE: At 6 months and over 20 pounds, my son still loves the Bjorn and it's still totally comfortable to wear.  I only have one warning...be very aware of where your baby's hands are.  My son loves to grab things on grocery store shelves. :)Trust me....spend the extra money, you'll be happy in the long run.	
- 1	I bought four of these total, thinking the first two were just back QTs, but all four actually started to unravel at the ends.  I like that they just have a snap button and are safe for baby, however, the unraveling became dangerous because the threads soon came loose, thus making it a choking hazard for baby.  I recommend the Boogin sippy straps for toys as well (LOVE these! - bought many and they hold up very well).  You can use the velcro part to link the toy (where your kid would be holding the toy) and the neoprene part (which is intended to use to 'grip' the sippy) and use that end to attach to your car seat, stroller bar, etc, etc....  MUCH better quality.	
1. 	As a new mom - I stood in front of the diaper bags at Babies R Us forever trying to figure out which one I thought would be the best.  I decided on this one, and I'm glad I did.  I liked the black bag because I new my husband would carry it.  It also has tons of compartments, and a special zippered part with holders for diapers and wipes.  It also comes with a travel diaper changing pad - which is a Godsend in public places!  It has 2 thermal bottle compartments, and one completely zips closed - which is great for keeping bottles warm over time.  Another great feature is that the inside lining comes out for easy washing.  It also comes with some extra bags for messy diapers/clothes or for carrying anything you might need.I will admit, the inside is lacking a LITLE in space - but you will find that you don't need a ton of space on the inside because of all the extras it comes with.  I have plenty of room for my daughter's toys, extra stuff and an extra change of clothes.	
- 1	The holes fall out! You can't even move these one inch without the stupid middle holes falling out. Who invented these? They're just awful to use. I ended up duct-taping the circles into the squares. The playmat is super thin and I couldn't use it on a hardwood floor, it is barely soft enough on carpet.	
1. 	I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day.  She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago.  She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes.  This is her favorite toy.	
1. 	This has been a life saver with our newborn who is very specific about what kind of white noise she likes if she's fussy. We keep this larger one attached to her crib so that when we lay her down in the crib we can flick this on to one of the sound settings and let it play for 23 or 45 mins, we always leave it on 45 minutes to play the longest it can. Four sounds come with the giraffe (which looks so cute in her safari themed nursery).Sleep - sounds like rushing water.Relax - Bubbling stream with occasional quiet nature sounds like tweeting birds.Calm - Slightly louder nature sounds like insects, birds tweeting and an occasional growl over low quiet drum beats.Play - More rapid fun drum beat with some jazzy insect noises and a ribbiting frog.It's very cute and effective, we switch between sleep and relax when she's napping and I know as she gets older the Calm and Play sounds will be fun for her! I also love that it attaches securely to the outside of the crib with a very strong velcro strap!	
- 1	This cup leaks unbelievably. It's almost impossible to stop it. I've tried tightening it as hard as I could and barely tightening it at all and everywhere between. At best, the lid drips slowly. At worst water comes out like there's no lid at all. My wife heard great things about this cup and insisted upon getting it. After reading the reviews I insisted we get this and the Lansinoh cup. We're both very happy we bought the other one. The Lansinoh cup is more round than we'd like, but it seals great and I really have no complaints. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the weight at the bottom of the straw is well designed and allows you to get all the liquid inside.	
- 1	My daughter is exclusively breastfed and never takes any bottle. This is the only bottle she will take to drink her water. That's why I have 2 of these bottles.Cons:1.the strawd broke after used for a while2.the bottom part with handle of the bottle doesn not come off and clip back on easily, maybe you are not supposed to do so, but it gets mold and I wanna to clean up the mold.3. Some mold issue happen is the lid part.	
- 1	I purchased these sheets to go on the Graco Pack & Play On the Go Travel Playard. After washing and drying the sheet on normal wash settings, the sheet barely fits on the provided mattress and the mattress begins to fold up under the tension of the sheet. I realize these sheets are advertised as fitting a &#34;mini-crib,&#34; however they are cross-referenced with the Graco Pack and Play (along with the American Baby portable/mini-crib mattress pad which also DOES NOT fit) and many people have suggested they fit the Graco Pack and Play. Maybe it's the specific Graco model that I have or maybe they have changed size recently, but they do not fit mine. Back to the drawing board for me.	
- 1	We received this as a gift for my second child, but I can't imagine ever paying $20 for a stupid teether.  There is nothing special about it whatsoever.  I really don't understand what the hype is all about. It is soft, and cute and it squeaks, but there are other teethers that are soft and squeak. My son had no interest in it - he preferred chewing on his blankie or basically any teether we gave him. I gave Sophie to a friend and I don't think her daughter cared for it either. Save your money and just buy something else. Also, while my child never choked on the legs, I can see how that would be possible.	
- 1	I purchased this diaper for overnight wear due to some great reviews.I did use a diaper cover and an extra insert and my son was soaking wet by morning.	
- 1	We have used these bottles since our son was born- first the tiny four ounce ones and now the big nine ounce ones.  Our son likes them because they're wide enough that he can hold onto them himself.  I didn't notice any miracle cure for fussing or less gas or anything like that.  What I did notice is that the gasket that goes inside the ring that screws onto the bottle melts in the microwave sterilizer.  They got a little bumpy but were still usable.  Until one super late night feeding when my husband and baby got soaked when the gasket apparently just couldn't work anymore.  We still have almost a dozen of these bottles and they're not cheap so we threw out the gasket and just used the other bottles and parts.  Tonight when we ran the bottles through the microwave sterilizer, two of the rings melted and fused together.  Why would a company make a baby bottle with only certain parts that can withstand sterilizing? I plan to contact the company and complain, but of course they make it more difficult and only accept phone calls, not email complaints.	
1. 	This padding works great, and has a nice fit. The velcro that comes with it is poor. I had to use silicon caulk to keep it down because my 10 month old kept pulling it off. The silicon works well. She doesn't even try to pull it off anymore. It has definitely saved us from a few accidents though.	
1. 	My daughter is just starting out potty training and she like the step ladder, and it is easy to fold up. I was worried about this at first but am really happy with my purchase. The seat fits my toilet which is an old American Standard and there is no issue what so ever.	
- 1	I was so excited when I bought this but that excitement quickly fizzled away the first time I used this.  For newborns this is awful.  I could't keep her head and body up AND bathe her and getting her out of the bucket wasn't easily at all.  It's just too awkward.  Then when she was older I couldn't properly wash her because of the tub shape.  Getting my hands in there and washing was ridiculous.  It's a good soaker tub to let them soak and enjoy the warmth of the water surrounding them.  My daughter did enjoy that part.  As a bath tub, I give it two thumbs down.  I ended up going with the First Years infant/toddler tub.  It's so much easier to use than this bucket style and my daughter was just as happy in the traditional tub.	
1. 	I love these as cloth wipes! I pass up the others I have (Thirsties and homemade) if I see I have more stashed in the changing table. They are soft, simple and do the job!	
- 1	The primary reason I got this monitor is because of the advertised coverage.Primary cons:-It did not deliver AT ALL on coverage (I ended up ordering the Motorola and am pleased with it)-Graco plastic also feels a lot cheaper/light than the Motorola-Thought I could just prop the camera on the bookshelf but was hard to get a good angle so fact it doesn't mount ended up being a problem	
1. 	This bag is okay. It is a little bigger than I planned, but it will do the trick.  It fits all that one would need for a day.  It is perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.	
- 1	My little chunker does not fit in this well, despite being well within the weight limits for the product. It leaves big red gashes on her chunky little legs. I love the prints, and it seems to hold up to washing really well, but it's definitely not my first choice in diapers.	
1. 	We got one of these for my older daughters and I love the whole thing. The infant body support converts into a very good head support for older children, it's low to the seat so I can get them in and out easier with  other car seats and I can fit 2 Radians and a Graco Snugride 32 in the back of our little 2 door Sunfire.	
- 1	Got this for our first child (read: bought into the idea of buying the whole BabyBjorn potty training line to match).  It's only 6 inches tall so it's your basic step stool.  Obviously the product description already says that so that wasn't a suprise.  However, my son is 20 months, 95 percentile for height.  When the faucet in the bathroom is on full-blast, this stool only allows him to get the tips of his fingers wet so I still have to pick him up to wash his hands.  This doesn't allow him to get on the adult toilet by himself nor can his feet touch when he's sitting on the adult toilet (which: (a) is bad for assisting him w/ #2 since it's better for him to plant his feet and brace himself rather than dangling his legs; and (b) this requires me to hold him still while he's sitting on the potty so he doesn't fall backwards or forwards).If you want a basic step stool there are cheaper ones out there that are just as good.If you have a young child, this isn't the best option.  Try a 2-step stool, such as the rubbermaid version, instead.  For kids 4 and over this is probably fine, my nephew is close to 4 and this would probably work for him.	
- 1	This could MAYBE work for someone with a king bed. We have a queen and it was WAY to big to use, not to mention it's heavy and clunky, plus our son hated being laid down in it.  Not to mention that the legs are defective and  WILL NOT stay on. The snugglenest is a much better option. We are returning this.	
1. 	We have 2 twin boys who are 20 months old. They used to use an old wooden highchair at grandmas, but there was only one and it was falling apart. She bought these because they could work for my niece (3 years old) without the back and it could work with my 20 month olds as a highcahir. This chair is so convinent. The snap in tray is great, just like my Aquarium chair at home! It is also nice that it adjusts to the tray can rest on the table. I love that its VERY easy to fold and carry. My boys love sitting in it, and its SUPER easy to clean. We would buy one for restaurants, but we just use a floppy seat, less room and we need ALL the room with twins. I love this booster and its perfect for grandmas, houses with limited space, for going out to eat, or just instead of a highchair if you have multiple children! We love this chair, and would never use another one for grandmas.	
1. 	I have checked out many of the baby foot print frames and this one is by far the best quality and the easiest to use. The plaster is quick to set, easy to do and looks good in the finished product. The frame is high qulity and has great clean lines. This is a great product that has been hard to find in the stores. I have two! Love them! (I have even knocked one off the wall on accident and it didn't break - they are good quality, not cheap!)	
- 1	i can't say enough about what a waste of money this thing was. doesn't stay on a stroller. doesn't keep stuff cold.. isn't heavy enough for a paperweight.. so basically useless.	
1. 	We have a small kitchen, so a booster seat was a better option for us than a stand-alone highchair.  We had a fabric one before that clipped to the table, but it didn't work on all tables and the soft fabric seat was a nightmare to clean.  The molded plastic seat on this has no crevices, so there's no worrying about food getting stuck down in it.  I just wipe it clean with a wet cloth after mealtime.  We use it both with the tray and just up next to the table and it works well both ways. It's easy to strap to any standard chair and comes off really fast if we need the chair.The two cons: My baby very quickly figured out that he could pry the white liner away from the tray and drop it on the floor, food and all, so we just stopped using it. We put the food directly on the beige part of the tray and just wash it by hand (though I would think it could also go in the dishwasher if you wanted).  Also, when we use it without the tray and have him at the table, he can reach the safety straps and has gotten food all over them.  Unlike the seat, the straps are not easy to clean!  A wet cloth has not done the trick and they are stained and kind of gross.  With the tray snapped on he can't reach the straps, so it's only because we used it without that this happened.  I still love the seat and would recommend it to anyone.  Wonderful product for the price-- don't waste your money on a stand-alone high chair!	
1. 	We started using these when our daughter was 6 months old. It took her a bit to get used to them, but now at 10 months old she is a pro. They don't leak and they are easy for her to grab and hold on to. So far, so good!	
- 1	Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.	
1. 	Great bang for the buck.  Plenty absorbant, catches slop, and hold up well in the wash.  The velcro is the best I've had.  I just wish they were bigger for my 14 month old.  I wish I had them when she was just starting solids.	
1. 	These are way better than any diaper genie! We originally had the diaper genie, but turns out that thing is disgusting, so we just opted for these little bags. They are sented so it masks the horrible smells, so that we can just throw it in our regular trashcan that we empty daily.	
1. 	This is a great swing, it is very portable and light, it stores away nicely, and my daughter loves it. It has several speeds and the music lowers. If space is an issue...this is a great choice.	
- 1	My daughter has the tiniest nose you have ever seen, but this aspirator tip is so small there is no suction at all. it can't create any kind of a seal at the infant's nasal opening (nurses will say don't put it up the baby's nostrils). I threw it in the garbage. You are better off with the one they give away at the hospital. Save your money on this product.	
- 1	this stroller is cheap, flimsy, and the fabric on the seat started to rip within a couple weeks of use. The whole canopy bent and the wheels started to squeak within 2 months of use. I paid $51.00 for this stroller on clearance at a store and i paid too much! The only positive thing about this stroller is that it folds up very small	
1. 	My mom bought this for me when my daughter started liking sitting up. I couldn't hold her up as much as she wanted to sit up so we thought this would be a great idea. I wanted one without the seatbelt because it just gets in the way. I NEVER use the belt. The seatbelt is pointless and my daughter always sit on the buckle part. There is no way to get it out of the way. My daught is kind of a chunk and I can see that in a few more months she will not be able to sit in this any longer due to small leg holes. It's a good product but not the best.	
- 1	This would have been an ok teething necklace if it weren't for the Star bead. As another reviewer pointed out, if your child chews on the pointy edge of the star it can be very painful. I have thrown this necklace out after having to pull off the road last week when my child screamed suddenly in the back of the car and was then crying hysterically.	
- 1	The backing is very thin and not padded.  It didn't seem comfortable and squished him in the stroller.  My son was miserable.  We ended up getting the baby bee haven comfort cushion and supporting his body with rolled up burp cloths.  He was much more comfortable and happy.	
1. 	This is a great changing pad. I like the fact that it is four-sided. It also allows for my daughter's head to be slightly elevated if you put her near the edge of the changing pad (which i normally only do if i have someone else with me, to watch her), which seems to help with her reflux. She doesnt like being completely horizontal, she likes any sort of incline.If you are looking for a changing pad cover, I would recommend this one:Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/BrownThere is also one tip I want to give first time parents that I would have found useful when registering ...Register for disposable pee pads (dr. office calls them chux, or underpads, etc). Amazon sells a bunch at reasonable prices (brand: Dynarex). They use these at the hospital and dr.'s office. You put these little pee pads over changing tables and they absorb any accidents. It will save you a LOT of laundry!!! Yes, you can minimize the occurences of accidents by putting a new diaper under the old diaper and other tricks, but no matter what you do you WILL have pee/poop getting on your changing cover frequently!! Downside is you will have more trash than you would have normally, but trust me --- when you are sleep deprived, it is a LOT easier to just throw away a dirty pee pad and lay a fresh one down then to realize that you have to do a load of laundry in the middle of the night holding a crying baby! :)here is the one i buy, normally can be had for $13 for 100 count:Dynarex #1341 Underpads, 17x24 in. 22 gram, 100 ct	
- 1	I would not buy this swing...unless you use the carseat that fits into it. This swing has not been a hit with our son. We have tried it at different times from his birth to now - four months later. At no stage has he found this a place of comfort. We have used the sounds as a soothing device for him while he is in his room (not in the swing), which has been nice. It may be the angle of the seat or something else that doesn't suit our little man. He won't stay in it very long before throwing a fit even if we put him in there completely happy. However, when we use our Snugride 32 seat in the swing, it works like a charm. He has fallen asleep and stayed asleep in that combination for hours. We bought this swing over others for the interchanging of the seats. I would not make that mistake again.	
- 1	this didn't fit my sons car seat so its pointless. We have a diono radian rxt which admittedly is a monster of a seat height wise though.	
1. 	Very satisfied with this, my daughter drools a lot and this kept my Bjorn away from the white stains and kept her face from being wet from the drool.	
- 1	My daughter loved this toy... getting her out of the bathtub was difficult because she wanted to keep playing with it.  It even distracted her enough to let me wash her hair, which is usually a big ordeal in our house.Unfortunately, it lasted for three baths and then stopped working.  It was not handled roughly.  We were careful to not leave the motor running but it still just quit.  New batteries did not fix it.It was a waste of money and I recommend NOT purchasing this item unless you are comfortable spending around 20 bucks for a toy that will work 3 times.Note that although the product description states that it does not need batteries, it does.	
1. 	If your child is tall enough to reach them, it doesn't take much force to pry them from the Velcro, and totally defeat the system.  However, I got around this by tilting the lower window (of a double-hung) in, and applying the wedge to the outside.  Since I don't think our child knows how to tilt in the window, nor is strong enough to pull the catches, this solution should work.  You just need to be careful.  Defiantly not a useful option for any child over 5 or 6.  You'd probably need something requiring a key at that point.  (and of course, you'd need a key accessible in the event of an emergency)	
- 1	I bought these hoping to switch away from disposables but the second I leaked, it went directly through the pad to my shirt. No absorbancy at all. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	This product really works well for my 10 month old. It keeps her snacks inside without spilling out everywhere. She was a little confused on how to get her hand in and pull the snacks out, but once she realized there was food in it she caught on real quick. I'm satisfied with this purchase.	
1. 	We love these bags!  We didn't buy a diaper pail, but instead stuff as many diapers as we can in to each of these bags and then tie closed.  It keeps our son's nursery smell free!  He is 8 months old now and we can fit 4-5 diapers into the bag.	
- 1	I am so surprised that during the first and second wash, it piles badly, there are loose 'cotton balls' on the swaddle, and they fly all over the place in my laundry yard. I used a lint roller to manually remove the lint to wash a 3rd time and it is still piling, though not so bad anymore. I'snt it supposed to be pre-washed? I also noticed a chemical smell when it came in a box, it is also not as soft as I would expect it to be.This is an expensive item, for this price point, i expect much better quality.	
1. 	I think my title explains this product perfectly. My 2 month old has slept 8 hours during the night for the past 3 nights and he's been consistently at 6-7 hours before that. I had a size smaller first and then upgraded to the larger size. He easily sleeps in it in his crib with no issues. Occasionally, he'll pop an arm out, but it's usually b/c I didn't secure the flaps tight enough. GREAT!!!	
- 1	We ordered these when we had my daughter and they were great for maybe the first couple of uses. After that, the pull ties no longer worked so we could not tighten them and close them up. We basically had to twist the bag and fold it over hoping that the smell stayed in and nothing leaked out. We have made them work for the sake of not wanting to order more, but have recently ordered a couple others through Amazon now that we have 2 kids. Unfortunately, we'd never order these again.	
- 1	After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its flimsiness for myself at a local Babis R Us store), I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif.  I found several, but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy Twinkle Twinkle bedding set.  It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price, but good luck!  I was so excited when I found it!	
1. 	This is my first changing table, so I can't compare it to others.  I have a $9 Circo changing table pad on it, and keep a waterproof burp pad directly under the danger zone when I'm changing baby.She LOVES this.  It's literally her favorite place to hang out.  It is also the perfect size for my changing table (Delta Duval Changing Table)-it leaves enough space at the top for a supply of diapers and wipes, so I didn't need to figure out where to put all that stuff.The pad does have a stiff support on the bottom, so I can move it with baby laying on it (she's now 12 lbs).  I've moved it this way once or twice, but I'm sure it's not recommended.All and all I much more pleased with it than any of the others I saw at Babies R Us.UPDATE:  daughter is 2.5 years old now, and can climb the table herself.  Even though her legs hangs completely off the table, she often climbs up there to nap on this pad, so it's obviously comfy.  No tears or visible damage.	
- 1	I am going to compare this to 2 other options: Baby Kicks Baby Wipes and Gerber Baby Wash Cloths.I had recently started cloth diapering and received both the Babykicks and the Osocozy wipes as gifts. The Osocozy are so thin in comparison. They feel flimsy and if you are dealing with a poopy diaper they do nothing to help grab what's there. In comparison, the BabyKicks are thicker and sturdier and allow me to easily take care of messy diapers even though they are just as soft as the Osocozy wipes. I also picked up a pack of regular Gerber baby wash cloths and found them to be superior to the Osocozy as well! They are not as soft as the Baby Kicks, but they are certainly just as good at grabbing the poop off my little ones rear.UPDATE: I finally figured out why Osocozy wipes are a hit.  My product review was based on my experience with my 1 year old.  Now that I have a newborn, I am totally a fan of these Osocozy wipes.  They are all that's needed to clean a little one's bum when they aren't eating any solids and are still just having breastmilk.  The Babykicks and Gerber washcloths are a bit overkill for a newborn; too much bulk gets in the way when you are on diaper change duty.  This is not the case with Osocozy wipes.  They are just the right size and perfectly adequate for any newborn diaper change.	
1. 	I love this chair because we can just attach it to one of our dining room chairs, without the need for another chair that only the baby can use.  My little guy isn't fat, but I found that we've had to use the outermost setting for his table in order for him to comfortably sit in the chair without it pressing on his stomach.I think his favorite parts of the chair are the adjustment straps.  He always finds them and tries to chew on them.	
- 1	Yes, this record book is very simple and uncomplicated. However it is low quality for the price paid. It looks homemade. But then again the product pictures aren't high quality either. The pages do not turn easily and the first two pages of my book have already ripped.	
- 1	Well when I placed the order I did not realize that these were an older version of SG wipes... Ugh! These are horrible. They are dry, thin, not very absorbent and seem to have a rough texture. I have tried the new ones when I ran out of the Honest Co. wipes that are home delivered. The NEW SG wipes were good. These old SG wipes I ordered from Amazon were cheaper than Honest Co. for just wipes. Hence, why I bought these in bulk as my back up (remember, not knowing they were different than what I bought last week at my grocery store). Bad idea. I like the Honest Co. wipes better, and will just order more of them. These are so harsh, I may just donate these.	
- 1	It looks so nice, doesn't it? A cup designed to teach your toddler how to drink out of the edge of the cup, no? I mean, so wonderful, right?WRONG!In order for the mechanism to work properly, your child will have to shove his/her face against the lifted plate, allowing flow of liquid to the mouth. If, somehow, the lid has any pressure, IT WILL LEAK. I repeat, IT WILL LEAK. Or, IT WILL SPILL ALL OVER YOUR CHILD IN THE CAR.And, to make matters worse, cleaning it is a nuisance. For the price, this product is seriously a joke. Flawed in every way.You've been warned!	
1. 	This receiving blanket is just great - it's large, soft, comfortable and totally durable. We have been using it since our baby was born (for 2.5 months already) and it looks and feels like new. Unlike some cheaper receiving blankets, it's very thick and has a real soft touch.	
- 1	I had really high hopes for this gym. My son who just turned 6 months loves to kick and bang his hands so I thought this would be great for him but sadly it's not. Here is a list of our problems:1) The toys are rock hard and hang way too low, as in right in his face2) The piano has a switch to change the tune to either piano notes or music everytime you hit the keys but even on just the note setting as soon as you stop hitting the keys it plays a little jingle, really annoying3) The mat itself bunches up4) When the toy bar is down it exposes the two hard yellow dome shaped things which my son is constantly rolling ontop of and hurting himself5) When the toy bar is down the toys are pretty boring to my son lying on the floor and just get in the way more than anything6) The mat is really small and there is no room for my son who is 18 lbs and 24 inches to maneuver at allThere are only a couple reasons why I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 and that is because the toys can atleast be traded out for other ones, the piano will entertain my son for about 5 minutes maybe even 10 if I'm lucky but he has to be sat up at it and I think a child that is completely immobile ie. can't roll yet would still find this gym interesting.	
1. 	I tried every sleep sack / blanket out there.  Our daughter needed to be swaddled up through 4 months and she quickly outgrew the Miracle Blanket which was our favorite -- she wormed her arms right out of all other swaddles.  These fleece swaddle sacks worked great.  She was cozy and warm, her arms stayed put and we could still use it a bit longer even after we stopped swaddling and she liked having the flaps around her belly.	
1. 	These are great for cleaning pump parts for an on the go mom. I have used them at work when I am short on time and can not go clean all of the parts and I have used them on trips when I could not get to water.	
1. 	We love this bib. It catches all the messes that would otherwise fall on the high chair and makes cleaning so much easier.	
- 1	I've read the reviews and everyone who has used this says that it worked for atleast 2 weeks for them. all mine is doing is vibrating my nipple (i know it sounds funny haha). it doesnt suck. i dont know what is wrong with it. I used it for the first time right now and all it is doing is making loud vibrating noises and i can see that my nipple is just vibrating in the suction cone thingy. im really sad because im going back to school and ONLY breastfeed and wanted to use this because it is sooo convenient in size to carry around. i do have a madela double pump but it is 4 times bigger to carry around and spent 60 bucks hoping this would help me carry on breastfeeding when i go back. =( guess ill be lugging around my madela. haha	
1. 	Love this! It gives me much more peace of mind than throwing a blanket over the carseat. This keeps baby extremely warm, maybe too warm, baby only needs a few layers not a coat in this. I looked at other bundle me's but I loved this one bc it is waterproof - we had to go to his 2 month checkup and it was raining, the drops stayed on the fabric and didn't soak through. It fits good on our Graco Snugrider 32 carseat in Zurich.	
1. 	This net does what it says. I don't really like that you have to screw into the railing, but a child's safety is way more important. It was also a little wonky to size down the length. I wouldn't say it's too stylish either, but a person would be hard-pressed to find a stylish railing guard. At the end of the day, it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing.	
- 1	I have 2 of these diapers.  I also have BumGenius 4.0, Katydid (Oh Katy), Knickernappies, and GroBaby/GroVia (hybrid diaper).  This diaper is the one I like the LEAST out of all my pocket diapers.My daughter just turned 2 and is 28lbs and 36in tall.  Tall and slender, but in no way supertall.  This diaper BARELY fits her (honestly, I have compared it to the FuzziBunz Perfect Size in Small, and it is slightly larger than that one!).  It is super low rise, and I am on the widest snaps.  How a fatter/taller baby is supposed to fit in this diaper, I have no idea.  As a result of the low rise, she has leaked out the back of the diaper with only one insert.  I have to double stuff this diaper EVERY time to ensure that it doesn't leak, which creates a lot of bulk.  The inserts are completely soaked when I pull them out, even if she has only been wearing them for 2-3 hours (the same amount of time I keep her in a BumGenius).  I also hate the adjustable elastic leg gussets, because they are much more of a pain in the butt if you are using it between two babies (which I am, my other is 2m old).  Having adjustable rise snaps is much easier, even if it allows for less customizable rise options.  All of my other diapers have 3 snap rise options, which in my opinion, is enough.In comparison to BumGenius diapers (which most people do compare this diaper to), I find the Fuzzibunz to be:smaller (tighter and lower)harder to stuffless absorbentI think the Katydid/Oh Katy diapers are similar to the BG diapers, so they are the ones I like second best.  The Knickernappies to have a pretty high rise also, but it has the weird side snaps, which are not my favorite.  GroBaby/GroVia are a different kind of system, so I am not sure if it is a good comparison, but they have a low rise, which I don't find works well for my tall kids.	
1. 	I really like this CD player.  I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light.  It is a nightlite.  It is just fine.  I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine.  I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up.  It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out.  Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib.  No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***	
1. 	This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live.	
- 1	The idea behind these bags is great - you can pump straight into the bag and store them. The execution, however, is lousy. Using twisties to seal the bags is cumbersome and annoying.I prefer the Lansinoh bags with the double seal. Even though you can't pump straight into them, sealing them is quick and easy.	
- 1	I bought these bottles cause they're waaaaay cute and baby and I had problems with latching. I wanted her to use bottles in which she had to open her mouth wide. It did help with her practicing getting her mouth wide open...but her bouts with gas had increased when we switched from the Dr. Brown's to the Comotomo bottles. My mom and my hubby  knew how cute I thought the bottles were and how excited I was about getting them but they felt so sorry for the crying gassy baby that they waited till (or conspired while (depending on who's telling the story!)) I was asleep (in pain from breastfeeding challenges) to bring back out the Dr. Brown's bottles that I had neatly put away. I woke up to a much happier baby...and family. Again, these bottles are waaaaaay cute, fun and modern and may even help with latching. But if your baby is having problems with gas stick to Dr. Brown's or whatever has proven to work for your baby. In fact I thought the Dr Brown's wasn't working because our baby still had gas pains. But the crying increased when we stopped using the Dr. Brown's! Maybe I'll try the Comotomo again when baby is much older and over her gas pains.Oh! one other thing! They're kinda hard to clean. The milk sticks to the material. The product videos recommend that you clean with a cloth and probably users should stick to this advice because using a bottle brush alone would not suffice.	
1. 	This is a great little duckie .. no water can enter it and hence no mold issues ever, it is just perfect!	
1. 	We received the connectors in brand new packaging in a timely fashion.  By the way it comes in a 2 pk so no need to buy 2.	
1. 	My daughter loved this gym from about 6 weeks until 4 months. The toys are bright and colourful and the mat and toys all wash well. My only complaint is that the ladybug rattle is quite difficult to use for a small baby and that there are not enough rings included to make the toys low enough for a small baby. Overall a great way to give your baby some activity.	
- 1	I was looking for a basket to hold the diapers and such on the changing table.  it ended up not being the right size so I had to change plans,  and I was VERY disapointed that the divider sections were just fabric covered CARDBOARD. For the price they want, it could at least be plastic. or stiffened padded fabric.Over all I;ve been disapointed with the construction of most of the Trend Lab things.  No wonder I can't find it in stores.  If I had touched or looked at this thing before buying, I would have passed.	
1. 	As a new mom - I stood in front of the diaper bags at Babies R Us forever trying to figure out which one I thought would be the best.  I decided on this one, and I'm glad I did.  I liked the black bag because I new my husband would carry it.  It also has tons of compartments, and a special zippered part with holders for diapers and wipes.  It also comes with a travel diaper changing pad - which is a Godsend in public places!  It has 2 thermal bottle compartments, and one completely zips closed - which is great for keeping bottles warm over time.  Another great feature is that the inside lining comes out for easy washing.  It also comes with some extra bags for messy diapers/clothes or for carrying anything you might need.I will admit, the inside is lacking a LITLE in space - but you will find that you don't need a ton of space on the inside because of all the extras it comes with.  I have plenty of room for my daughter's toys, extra stuff and an extra change of clothes.	
1. 	I bought this mirror because it has a larger mirror area than other ones.  Sure, it doesn't have the colorful and fun designs, but to my daughter just seeing her reflexion is entertainment enough.  It installed easily and adjusts easily.  However, it does come loose occasionally, which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.  It is so soft and lightweight that times it has come loose and landed on my daughter she isn't fazed, and she just starts playing with it.  I am very happy with our decision to buy this mirror.	
1. 	My fourth child has suffered from congestion and a stuffy nose since birth. The traditional nasal aspirator did not work well for her, and seemed to cause more frustration than anything for both of us...These tweezers have been great. They just get the job done quickly and efficiently.	
1. 	I've used this chair since my little girl was 5 months old. I like it. It's been a space saver in our little kitchen. It's easy to clean. And it's a lot cheaper than comparable products. I don't have any complaints about it.	
1. 	We much prefer these over bags.  We have had several bags that have leaked on us, no matter how careful we are with closure, and never have these storage bottles leaked.  My husband has requested that the bags be sent to daycare and he keep the bottles!  He has mentioned that after defrosting, the transfer from bag to bottle is much less delicate and leads to more spillage.  I am about to order more of these bottles, so I can eliminate the use of bags entirely.  I also like that they are reusable and I'm not throwing away lots of plastic storage bags.  The small size is nice, and allows us to more precisely control our breast milk supply for less waste, which is nice because I am not a super-producer of milk.  Oh!  And I have an Ameda pump and while I mostly use the Ameda bottles with it, these fit on to my pump as well.	
1. 	fun toy	
1. 	this item is great for putting on tables at fast food restaurants.	
1. 	I love this tub. The insert was perfect when my daughter was just a few days and weeks old. Now I only clip the head rest part to it and my 4 month old leans against it while I wash her. The pieces that come with it are perfect for washing and also as toys to keep her attention. I especially love the drain in the bottom.	
1. 	Love this high chair!Pros:- Love the 3 layer tray.  The lid can cover the tray for easy storage of uneaten food.  It also has a drink holder.  It makes it easier for serving as well, since all I have to do is put over the main tray.- Great price (half the price of other booster high chairs)- Looks great in the chair and not out of place like a lot of high chairs. I love that it's nice neutral colors and not super bright kid colors.  I mean, it does sit in my kitchen, not the play room after all.Cons:- not good for babies who can't sit up well on there own (not a problem for my 7 month old).- It's kind of hard to snap the tray on and off.  Not a big deal, but just a slight hassle some times.	
1. 	My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.

1. 	Purchased for the upstairs nursery, it has saved me from stumbling downstairs to the kitchen for late night/early morning feedings. Fits the Avent as well as the thinner bottles. I recommend using the caps that come with your bottles when you warm up junior's food (repels the condensation).I'd give it five stars, but the beeps are a feature that I wish could be turned off by the user - note to Munchkin.Worth every penny.	
1. 	Love these tweezers!  Simple product that works great.  I can help my little one get rid of that clogged nose which makes it alot easier for her to breathe when she takes her bottle.	
1. 	I got this for my baby when she was just a few months old. I was a bit heavy for her at first, and she would bang herself on the head with it in the beginning, so I wouldn't recommend it for very little babies who don't have much control over their motor skills. Once she got more skilled at controlling her movements, however, she loved this toy. It's colorful and fun to bite and twist.	
- 1	This tub seemed like a no-brainer based on the many reviews, but I'm not thrilled.  Here's why:1) You only need the sling for about a week until the baby's cord falls off.  After that I find it far preferable to put the baby in the water because he is much warmer and happier.  Not worth buying this for the sling, just do sponge baths until cord falls off2) It's massive for a small baby.  There is a bumper to support their behind, but at 4-5 weeks the baby can arch his back and slide right over it.  I used a much smaller tub at my mom's, just a simple rectangular plastic thing that was just long enough for the baby to sit in with my support and he was much happier since he could push his legs against the end of the tub and not feel so out in the open.  With this thing his legs are everywhere3) Because it is massive, cleanup isn't fun.  Rinsing the whole thing out in a kitchen setting is awkward because it is huge. Would be OK in a big bathtub though.	
- 1	If your seat base is not flat and completely in line with the back of your chair, then the flap that drops down to hold the seat will not reach the base and so the roller wont work. It does work on our Brittax, but not our Diono	
1. 	I like this set. I got everything I needed in one set different colors too. It is a great product very much recommended.	
- 1	The pants are great to protect against leaks.However, the sizing is way off! I ordered the Gerber training pants in the same size (2) and they fit perfectly. The plastic pants are huge in a size 2.I would not purchase these again.	
1. 	LOVE this seat.  After buying it I decided I might want something that reclines so also bought another brand of seat as well.  Returned the reclining one since it wouldn't slide under the table so my dining chair had to sit out quite a ways from the table all the time.  Didn't like that.  The baby really didn't use a high chair until she could sit up anyway.  Prior to that we used the infant car seat.  I can see why the reclining ones would be handy if you didn't have an infant car seat or bouncer, but really for me was not necessary and this one is so much easier to use and tote around.  And on the lowest setting it slides right under the table while attached to the chair and no one even knows it's there.	
- 1	Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...	
- 1	This wetbag does not contain moisture. Countless times I have placed a used cloth diaper in it, only to have the contents of my diaper bag be dampened by the end of the day. I got it to replace another bag's broken zipper, and for the price I figured it couldn't hurt to try. It works in a pinch, but I'd recommend placing it inside a plastic bag or away from other things that can wick the moisture (which really defeats the whole purpose of reusable wet bag). I just use it for toys now. If you are looking to use this to hold wet or soiled cloth diapers, I recommend spending a little more on something else.	
- 1	It sure reads the temperature fast. THe down side is that it gives a completely wrong read. Sometimes my baby was clearly running a fever and the thermometer read a low temperature. When using another type of thermometer, I'd confirm the baby actually had a fever but this ear thermometer couldn't read it.
