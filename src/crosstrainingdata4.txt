- 1	These are indeed a very cute idea, but they don't really work.  Ideal if your baby sits perfectly still at a diaper change, but my baby never did!  (In fact, I don't know of any who do.)  I spent more time trying to keep this thing in place, and then the minute it slipped off, he peed anyway.  It's all part of the joy of having a baby boy!  Better just to work quickly, and you'll get quicker with practice.	
- 1	I used these brand new(only washed once and they were hung to dry) and they leaked. The moisture wicked to the outside of the cover and the fabric around the legs ended up soaked. I do change my baby frequently and I wouldn't consider him a heavy wetter so that definatley wasnot the problem. they are cute but not worth the money spent on them.	
- 1	It's soft and silky on the other side, a good size, and very cute.  I wish the baby liked it as much as I do; he just doesn't give it any attention.  One other note, the silky side has snagged as I've washed it.	
1. 	Our baby loves the feel of this.  It keeps her warm and the material feels really soft and doesnt irritate the baby.  We dont usually swaddle her with it but we use it for keeping her warm. We got the slightly larger size (size small) so we hope the baby will grow into it :)	
1. 	At first the seam was a bit tight but after about a week of using it I got used to it and the seam loosened up a bit.  It's amazing to not have to move your pillows every time you roll over.  I've had this since about 6 mos. pregnant and had tried lots of other pillows before that (snoogle, boppy, etc) and this is the WINNER.  I could NOT sleep without it!  I sleep soundly with the exception of having to get up and go to the bathroom.  I crave this pillow now.  I had to go away for a few nights and had a sub-standard boppy with me and suffered the whole time!  It is a large pillow but I have no issues with someone else in the bed (California King) and sleeping comfortably with it.  It's amazing for my back and hips.  I highly recommend you try this FIRST because it has all the components of a perfect pregnancy pillow.	
- 1	I actually purchased these in June, and wanted to try them for awhile before giving a review.  In the past couple months they have not been used heavily, and NOT handled by a wild little infant/toddler.  I was the one filling, cleaning, feeding it to him, etc.  Tonight, when I went to fill one of them, the ziploc pulled completely away from the pouch!  Not acceptable.  I&#34;ve contacted the company directly, and I hope there is some recourse for me.  Maybe it was a bad run, I don't know.  I just dread the time and effort that is going to be required to get replacement pouches, which may or may not work.  And then, I&#34;m reading all the reviews that say they're made in China....not happy...	
- 1	I returned this as it started to fall apart after the first wash. And thats without any use! I prewashed the cover when it arrived before using it on a cart, but right out of the wash the poly filling was coming out & the seam had come apart. For the price it should have held up to a single wash cycle.	
- 1	The item itself is very cute looking, the little figures squeek but the mirror looks very distorted definitely not like pictured where baby can see herself clearly. But I have noticed that with pretty much all baby mirror toys.It is definitely not as sturdy as I hoped it would be. Just a little fingerpush and it collapses. The straps to hold on a bedrail etc. could be a bit longer as well as it keeps coming off due to the pull on the velcro.I probably would not buy this again. My baby has not even shown any interest in it. And we have had this since she was about 6 months. (She now is almost 12 months)There are definitely better toys out there that entertain much better... But if you just want to buy it for looks, it is definitely worth the money - LOL	
- 1	For Day 1:  We loved it!  My son would hear the song and rush to the potty to go.  It was a great reminder when we were out running errands.  I had put it on his upper arm so it would be out of the way, because it's kind of big.  So I know it didn't get wet.Day 2:  Nope, nothing. It will not make a sound.  There is nothing on the screen.  HUNK OF JUNK.  We're using a plain old kitchen timer now.Thank goodness Amazon's customer service is always AMAZING.  I returned it for a full refund.	
- 1	This turned out to be a huge waste of money.  The parasol doesn't stay in one place and doesn't provide enough shade, so basically it doesn't do what it is supposed to.	
- 1	The toys are too hard and too heavy for my baby.  When my baby grab the toy and move it, it often hurts my baby face.	
1. 	My Situation:I was a new mom of a 1 and a half month old, desperate for ANYTHING to help my son start sleeping for longer increments.PROS:- Adorable product. It even matched my son's giraffe themed room. And even when you don't need it for the soothing sleep sounds, it is still a really cute stuffed animal.- Well made and SO SOFT.- Has a strap on the back of him so you can attach him to the side of your crib, or somewhere in a vehicle for travel.- Battery pack and all of the buttons for the different noises are on the back as well.- This has volume control and gets really loud.- Four different sounds: a silly little jungle song/beat, a waterfall that sounds more like white noise, a womb sound that sounds more like a distorted heartbeat, and a jungle sounds option with frogs chirping, etc. The sounds play for 45 minutes before automatically shutting off, which REALLY helps in getting your little one to sleep. We play the waterfall one on really low volume to help get our son to sleep.- It comes with a short story book about the giraffe itself. Nothing fancy, but a cool plus for your money.CONS:- Some of the sounds are silly and kind of pointless, but not a terrible con. Nothing else I dislike about this toy.Conclusion/How it Helped us:I give it 4 stars because I can't really say FOR SURE that this toy is the reason my son started sleeping through the night. We got this when my son was a month and a half old. A week later, he started sleeping through the night, and I mean 12+ hours at a time. To this day (5 months later) he sleeps for that long, and we actually have to wake him up to change his diaper and feed him so he doesnt wake up completely soiled and starving! lol. It could just be a coincidence with the purchase timing of this product, but I do believe that by playing the waterfall option on this right before I set my son down in his crib, it really helped him get to a deeper sleep before it shuts off. My son is now 6 months old next week, and on normal nights we no longer use this toy to assist in getting him to sleep, but he is teething right now and sometimes really resists us on naptime, so with the addition of a couple drops of tylenol, and a little baby orajel for his gums, we turn this on and he konks right out. Nonetheless, whether this was the reason or not for his awesome sleep habits, I don't regret this purchase. It was an adorable addition to his crib/room, and as he gets older, I anticipate him cuddling with it in his crib or playing with it.	
- 1	This container is extremely small. I'm sure if I'd read the fine print a little better I would have known that. However the opening to which the snacks come out is also very small. My son can't stick his hand inside to grab the snacks. He has to turn it over and dump it into his hand, and you know what that means! Food everywhere! I'm pretty bummed because it's cute and fits in my diaper bag well.	
1. 	Decent product for the price. I do notice the lids seem to lose their shape after they go through the diswasher a few times-they still work, it just takes a little extra effort to secure them to the bowl. Overall I'm pleased with the product.	
- 1	I purchased this bib after seeing my nephew with it.  He wasn't able to put it into his mouth like soft bibs.  However when I received it the bib wouldn't fit around my son's neck comfortably.  The string of balls that's suppose to wrap around and clip into 1 side wasn't long enough.  I don't understand how this is possible when my son is only 7 months and is lean and tall...not chubby.  I wish they made this bib in different sizes since it's wonderful in theory but just didn't fit.	
1. 	I have pumped exclusivly for two childeren now.  I bought these with my first and have used them for both.  They mold your frozen milk into a very easy to stack shape.  I put my fresh bags in these and then when they get full, I transfer them into a big plastic storage box.  They fit so much better in there frozen into these blocks than they do anyother way I have tried.  I love them!	
1. 	Our little one slept through the night at seven weeks thanks to the SwaddleMe.  We can change her diaper without unwrapping her arms, helping her stay relaxed and sleepy in the evenings.  The SwaddleMe wraps also wash very well.	
- 1	It claims it holds 5oz...however, when I went to pour 5oz of milk (per the Medela bottle) it overflowed! I was NOT happy. I returned these and purchased Nuk bags which work much better, are a lot cheaper and hold much more. Very disappointed in this product!	
1. 	Baby loves this and has used it every single day since birth till now (hes 8 months)	
- 1	These stink! The gap in the c shape is so large that using them to attach toys, etc doesn't work. If you link them together they'll disconnect after a minute or 2 of playing.	
1. 	These are cute and fun but I wished I could choose which one I got for my child. My only complaint is that I washed my a couple of times, and yes my little one sticks this in her mouth along with everything else, and the bells are starting to rust from the inside. But otherwise this is a nice toy/instrument.	
1. 	Great option for covering your outlets from little fingers. Easy to use and store away. Adjust to different lengths by pressing the buttons.	
- 1	Stopped after 4 seconds--straight out of the package.  I could not get it to go any longer without touching/tapping/pressing on it to nudge it more.  Then my 4 yr old tried to fix it and it went maybe 20 seconds, when perfectly balanced flat on counter top.  The arrow doesn't even line up with the &#34;0&#34; &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; marks.  Looks cute and simple, but SO disappointed, especially for the price!!!  I knew I was taking a risk based on prior reviews, but geez...next time I take a risk on such an inconsequential item, I'll make sure it doesn't cost so much.  Now, if this mom of 3 can find time, I'll see if there's a return policy.	
1. 	I purchased to use when we started solids with my son.  At 6 months this is still quite big for him.  Can't wait to use it when he gets a little bigger.  Love that it has long sleeves to protect his clothes.	
1. 	My daughter loves this bouncer. It is one of the only things that can keep her entertained for hours. I place her in the bathroom with me while I shower and can enjoy a little time to take a long shower if I want because she never gets disappointed. She has been in this since birth and has not tired of it. I love it, my daughter loves it, and so will anyone who purchases it!	
1. 	This is much better than the curved bottom munchkin formula dispenser we bought at the store.  This one has a more positive lock.  That being said it still isn't perfect at keeping the sections segregated.  It also can let a small amount out when tossed around in a diaper bag.  Overall though it functions pretty well.  The curve at the opening allows for the formula to dispense quite easily and the call had never came off accidentally even in the diaper bag.	
1. 	We bought this for my infant when she was 6mo old. She is now 2.5 and still likes to sit in it.  We've definitely gotten our moneys worth from it. I like that it converts and I also like that the bar comes off.  My only wish would be to have more than 1 song option. As much as that flower was pulled, the same song over and over started to wear on us!	
- 1	Was very small to begin with, then washed it as directed and shrunk a ton. Although indicated it would fit in the play yard mattress I bought, I was never able to use it!	
1. 	This tub is HUGE!!!  You need to measure because you will need to figure out where you will use it and store it.  My master bath only has a shower stall, so I use this in there when I bathe my 6 1/2 month old daughter. My shower has an extra long shower hose, so it is very convenient to fill the tub.  While there is a plug it doesn't really do a good jub of letting out the water while the baby is still in the tub.  I let it drain as best as it can and when she is done with her bath, I just turn the tub over and let the water out.  I store it in the shower stall when I am not using it.  I would have bought the white tub, but Amazon had it priced at $15.00 more than the blue tub, plus the blue tub was eligible for free shipping with my Amazon Prime account while the white tub was not.I had this same tub in white when my son was a baby.  He is now 4-years old and prefers to take showers.  He is a big kid and outgrew the baby bath tubs so very quickly.  It seemed like every couple of months we were buying new baby tubs and then I found this tub.  He used this tub until he was nearly three years old.  I preferred using this tub because for some reason, it seemed like it kept the water warmer than the big bath tub in our main bathroom.  Also, there is nowhere for him to hit his head, which he did on the regular bath tub.  This tub, does hold quite a bit of water, but it even if you fill it completely full, it will only use a fraction of the hot water that the main bath tub in your house will use, so it helps you save on water and water heater costs as well.My daughter is 25&#34; tall and just under 16 lbs and just outgrew the Puj tub that I was using in the bathroom sink.  Instead of buying a smaller baby bath tub, I opted to just buy this tub because I knew from personal experience that it would be the be all end all baby bath tub for me.  Little Miss likes to kick, so this tub is perfect for her.  The infant supports hold her very well.  I do not need to hold herThe infant supports	
1. 	I tried a few different brands to fit the Davinci Crescent Mini Crib mattress, and these are a PERFECT fit! The recommended American Baby ones are much too small, and a Carter's one I bought based on reviews was too large. These Luvable Friends sheets are the perfect size--even after washing--and are super soft. I haven't had them long, but they feel like they will hold up pretty well.My only complaint is that I wish there were more solid color options. I absolutely love the Geometric Neuter Print, but I also wish they carried more solid color options such as green and yellow. For neutral colored baby rooms, the blue and pink don't really work, and white is too much of a magnet for stains (and boring!).	
1. 	work great but a pain to clean. my daughter lovers them though	
- 1	We tried the Woombie once our daughter started growing out of her miracle blanket.  The miracle blanket was wonderful, but it only comes in newborn size.  The miracle blanket has two layers of restraint -- one to pin the arms down and then another to wrap around the body.  It worked amazingly well for us. In contrast, the Woombie is just a tight sack.  Our daughter was very frustrated by it.  She was able to move her arms, but she wasn't able to put her hands in her mouth and soothe herself.  Basically, it was the worst of both worlds.  Our daughter was able to move enough that she could startle herself, but she could not move enough to soothe herself by sucking on her hands.  Total waste of money for us.	
- 1	For some strange reason, I am having the hardest time finding a decent comb for my 20 month old. The price for this set can't be beat, but the product is pretty useless for anything other than a newborn. The usable part of the comb is about 4 inches long- completely useless for decent quality hair. The brush looked like a doll's accessory. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the price. If you are looking for a good brush/comb for a toddler or older- stay far, far away from this.	
1. 	Simple, great product and an affordable price. They are pretty difficult to remove from the socket if you're not an adult, so extra plus for when the kids get a little stronger!	
1. 	This is a lifesaver!  We first purchased a cheaper carrier but after a couple of uses decided it was worth it to spend the extra money for something more comfortable and easy to use.  Ever since my daughter was a few weeks old we've been using this on a daily basis.  She is  now 3 months old and loves to face forward!  She can fuss and fuss, but as soon as she goes in this she doesn't say a peep!  It's easy to put on and adjust and very comfortable for mom and baby!	
1. 	Purchased this item when I had my second child so that I could monitor them visually as well as audibly.  Also purchased an additional camera, so that I could monitor both of the children's rooms.  Product is great.  Battery lasts forever when off charger.  Able to see well at night too.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it would be nice to have a feature that allows the monitor to switch over to the room where noise is recognized.  As it is now, you have to switch the button back and forth between the two rooms to monitor children sleeping at the same time.  Otherwise, product is great.	
1. 	I love the Svan chair...and now that I have the cushion, my 6 mth old is as happy as can be. The cushion is quite thick and cushions her well. I haven't washed the cushion yet, but hopefully it will be easily washable.	
1. 	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!	
- 1	This product was well reviewed, so we tried it. There were 3 in the packet and the first one we tried did not even warm up, so I am not sure what happened. On top of that, it was impossible to fit over our Doc Brown's bottle. Granted, we use the larger  Doc Brown's bottle, but when doing our research, it said it would fit it.Unfortunately, even if we did received a def heat pack, the difficultly we had with putting it over the bottle is a deal breaker, so I would not recommend it	
- 1	These are ok but not great. They aren't soft enough and they stain easily. The size is fine, but overall disappointing.	
1. 	It really helps to have extra dome caps. I find when I run them through the dishwasher, inevitably at least one flips over and fills with dirty dishwater by the time the cycle is complete. If you have to rewash it, or if you simply misplace one, its great to have extra. Given that we always have lots of bottles in circulation, it pays to have a few extra.One trick to get them from flipping over in the dishwasher and collecting water is to place four of them together face down and pin them down by putting a bowl on the top of them to weigh them down. Do that and they'll always come out clean.	
1. 	We got this product as a gift.  It has been one of the most helpful baby products we own.  Our baby started using it as a newborn and used it for about 7 months, till he could get out of it on his own.  It is a soothing, calming chair that is especially good for babies with reflux to help them keep their tummies full.  If your baby spits up a lot, sometimes the upright position really helps.Our baby loved the soothing vibrations.  I must have changed the battery 10 times.  I would set him in the chair for naps and something about the angle of the chair and the vibrations just lulled him to sleep.It is an excellent product, and would make a wonderful gift.	
- 1	I read the reviews and still thought it might be okay.  I was wrong.  #1 - Save your money These are available at Wal-Mart for $5.97, so the price is high.  #2 - The blades rip off super easy.  When I say super easy I mean it!  We bought a water fan from Disney for $18, same type of blades and sprays water the blades were better attached and held together.  These blades ripped off from just regular use.  I'm typically pretty easy going on stuff but these were not worth it, so much so I threw them away in the park.	
- 1	Be sure to assist your little one, when using this product. Severe choking hazard as the product is made of flimsy plastic and if your infant/toddler has any teeth at all the little plastic brushes will come right off.	
1. 	We bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. We were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. This fits the table perfectly, and I love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. Many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. They all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. I also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. I also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. The only thing I didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. The pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once I had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. I would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. Overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon.	
- 1	Didn't fit my Mama and Papa's stroller :( I wish they would have listed the strollers this tray would fit. This way I wouldn't have wasted my time ordering it.	
- 1	This item did not work at all for me. I had my sis ter come over and follow the instructions be is was ineffective and not safe to carry a baby.	
1. 	Before my daughter was able to crawl, we would put her in this every day.  She was a ball of energy right from the beginning, and didn't want to lay on her playmat for more than a few minutes, but she LOVED bouncing in her jumper.  She'd often bounce for half an hour or more.  She seemed to really like the fact that while in the jumper she could see Mama and Daddy and feel like a part of the action.  And WE liked the fact that it tired her out a little, so she fell asleep more easily at naptime.Also, it's very light, and easy to put up and take down, so we took it with us everywhere.  It was wonderful for keeping her entertained when visiting friends or relatives.A couple of tips: It works best in a WIDE doorway.  Otherwise little fingers can easily get crushed.  Also, read the directions for adjusting the height.  There's a trick to it, but once you know it, you can use it even on very short doorways, or if your baby has very long legs.The only drawback was that once our daughter learned to crawl, she found it way too confining, so we were only able to use it for a pretty short time, but she loved it so much when she DID use it that I think it was WELL worth the money.	
1. 	My son (18 months) loves it; he rides him, feeds him (hahahaahahahahhaha) every day and plays and talk to him; it's adorable; recommend it 100 %	
- 1	I thought this was a good purchase but after three months of use it stopped working.  For some reason it would not stay on long enough to warm the bottle.  Prior to not working properly, when it would work it leak terribly.  It is a waste of money.	
- 1	The first pack I bought was great. The second pack was sewn oddly in more of an oval shape (rather than a circle). I didn't think much of it until I washed the second pack and there was an odd ridge/fold/crease on the fleece-side that goes right across the middle! I'm not sure if one of the sides shrank so the two layers aren't even now. It makes the pads nearly unusable because it puts odd pressure on your nipples [thinks of seam on a piece of clothing]. I don't know if I got an odd pack or what. Not sure whether I want to chance it with a third pack to see if the second was a fluke. The first pack is holding up decently, though using lanolin does make for some pilling of the fleece, but it is more of a cosmetic issue (which I don't care about). It doesn't make the pads uncomfortable.These pads do dry well in the dryer. Another brand of reusable pads (all cotton) never feel like they dry all the way.*** Update: These pads definitely are rough once you wash a few times and the fleece pills. :(	
1. 	Good price and good product. Fit well with the pack n play mattress.  Mattress cover is a must have when you have new baby.	
1. 	I knew my 3 month old would love this gym since he loves looking at any kind of light.  I purchased this for him and the first time he used it he laid under it for 30 minutes and just stared at the twinkling stars.  I like it because you can angle the piano part of it any way you want, so it's easy for a baby who is lying down to see the lights.  The toys that the baby bats at to get the music to play are really cute and the music starts with just the slightest tap, which is great for small babies who aren't very strong.  I did a lot of research on Amazon.com for a gym and since this one got such rave reviews I decided to buy it and I'm so glad I did!!	
- 1	Hard to get baby comfy in this wrap. Cut off my daughter's circulationIn her legs- started turning blue. Tried it several times at differentage ranges& never had success. It's a pretty design, cheap price but doesn't work!	
1. 	I absolutely love this product! My daughter is a very restless sleeper (9 weeks old) and tends to smack herself in the face, which of course wakes her up, unless her hands are swaddled down. I've tried blankets of all kinds, but she's always managed to get herself out of them. This product is great in that the microfleece is strong enough to keep her from unswaddling herself, while also being breathable. She sleeps so great in it that ever since I've used it (at about 6 weeks of age) she's slept through the night anywhere from 5 - 7 hours without waking me up for milk. I highly recommend this product!	
- 1	First of all I own three Thirsties Fab Fitted diapers and several Thirsties Duo wraps and have had no leaking problems with either. I purchased three of these pocket/all-in-ones in size medium for the babysitter to use. I washed and machine dried these diapers three times with my other diapers and covers (cold water prewash w/ vinegar, hot wash with All Free and Clear, super rinse) before I tried them out. I stuffed them with a hemp insert and a cotton gauze flat fold for nighttime. My poor little one woke up about five hours later in a puddle! The diaper had leaked out the back. I stuffed another diaper that same night and tried again. Another puddle :(. I proceeded to check the final diaper for repelling the next morning and it seemed to be doing it's job. I then checked the seams and made sure the diaper fit properly. I decided to do three more washes and see if that helped. I washed and machine dried three more times and tried again. This time during the day with no inserts. It was soaked after an hour! Maybe I had mineral/soap residue. I stripped the diapers by themselves using 1TBSP Dawn soap in a hot water wash with three HOT rinses. Machine dried. Stuffed for overnight and got to change the sheets.....I washed the diaper with my diapers as usual and it reeked of ammonia when I took it out. I have finally given up. My Fab fitted diapers are made of the same material and I have never had to strip them and have not experienced any lingering odors. It also wasn't my inserts as I have NEVER had to strip my flats or my hemp and they are very absorbant. I am so confused. Some of the other reviewers have had great success with the diaper and I am glad. It is a great (in theory) diaper for a great price.	
1. 	Good old, classic outlet plug. What's not to like? Cheap and easy way to keep kiddos at bay. Baby hasn't been able to remove them thus far so they're doing their job!	
1. 	I really like this potty and I'm glad we purchased it.  The seat seems to be comfortable and the handles are nice to have.  I love that the seat can be put on a regular toilet.  The one thing that I don't like is the fact that it seems to be a bit cheap in the way it is put together.  the blue seat part comes apart from the white frame that it is in fairly easily.  Hasn't been an issue yet at all but I just don't like it.  I do like the fact that it can be a stool as well.  All around, I like this potty a lot.  Just seems to be cheaply put together.	
- 1	Its hard to get food out of this, I tried it myself and I also have a hard time. i just use the cup without the cover ... My son is not too messy. This cup didn't work for us.	
- 1	I bought this in hopes that I could avoid standing over a pot of boiling water in the middle of the night to heat my newborn's bottle.  She is impatient when it comes to waiting so I thought this little unit would do the trick.  NO SUCH LUCK.  The product review says it's stylish but who cares?  What we really need is functionality and usability and this warmer is neither.  It claims to heat up the bottle in 4 minutes but the milk is unevenly heated, the top of the bottle is cold and the base is scalding.  The milk then needs to be shaken to even out the temperature...a real time sucker when you're in a hurry to feed a wailing baby.  I tried to vary the amount of water I poured into the heating base but this didn't help.  I'm lucky I didn't throw away my trusty little pot since I'm back to warming up the old fashioned way on the stove.	
1. 	This is an excellent product that works as advertised.  The bottles don't leak, they're easy to clean, and the nipple is much better than most other baby bottles.  They also have a nice shape and they look pretty nice too.My one major complaint is about the way the product comes packaged.  It does not include extra nipples.  Basically this product gives you three 9 ounce bottles for about $12 (current price).  For only $20, you can get thePlaytex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, which includes FIVE bottles, several extra nipples of different sizes, extra bottle caps, and extra vent disks.  The newborn starter kit is a much better value.  On the other hand, if you just want a few bottles plain and simple, this is definitely the product to buy.  Very pleased.	
- 1	I laughed out loud when I opened this. It is a small SMALL piece of fabric with some ties on it. It covers about 1/4 of the sheet. What are the chances that my son will wet/throw up./whatever perfectly in that spot? Some people say to get two, but why dont they just make it bigger and charge more? It seems silly to me. Not happy at all with this. Sending it back for sure!	
- 1	I love the look of this car seat and it's very comfortable for my son but it's also very hard to adjust the straps, almost impossible.  Even my husband is unable to.  Maybe we just got a malfunctioning car seat since it seems most people love this one.	
- 1	These run really small. I definitely prefer my Green Mountain Diaper prefolds to these. They aren't very absorbent and are too small to snappi. I ordered the 6 pack and now I only use them tri-folded, and even then I don't use them often. There are better prefolds out there. I wouldn't recommend these.	
1. 	I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.  My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.  I also needed a new infant tub.  I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).  It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.  This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.  I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.	
1. 	We have two of these and they are easy to use and the key to a good night's sleep for our baby. They're warm and wash well.	
- 1	I've tried many of aspirators and this one is the most terrible if all. No matter how gentle you suck the discharge will end up in your mouth. And yes, I put tissue inside. I also put a short piece of straw thinking it will direct discharge to the bottom of the bottle thus will mother in my mouth. Still no use. Dont buythis product unless you like to taste your baby' nasal discharge.	
- 1	I literally watch my son's saliva roll off this bib. I do not know why the material is slightly waterproof. This bib is useless! I thought it was because the material was new but there was no improvement after several washes.	
1. 	Like the options of on how to use it, as a stand-alone potty or over the toilet.  We are in the early stages of training, so we shall see how he prefers to use it most.  At least he seems interested and isn't intimidated by it.	
- 1	I too really wanted to like this chair, but it just isn't that functional, user friendly or well made. The problems with design that bother me are the way the seat belt goes through the infant insert and leaves this big holes perfectly placed for all of her food to accumulate beneath the seat. Then the seat is attached via some weak velcro, which is only getting weaker since you have to remove the seat after every meal to clean out the accumulated food. The tray has too much give or slide in it, ever after it has been 'locked' into position, and the 'clear protectant' tape that is suppose to keep the tray from getting chewed up when sliding in and out of the locking mechanism is already wearing off and the tray is showing wear from being slide in the locking part. Plus, you have to have two hands to release the locking mechanism when taking the tray off, which is lame when you are holding the baby and trying to get her in the chair for dinner. It is scratching and chipping off finish also, which I expected and don't care too much about, but overall we are disappointed. Did I mention that we have only been using it for about 2 months. Lame. If I didn't live in Alaska and there were better looking alternatives with more functionality, I'd return it. I am pretty much keeping it because from what I saw, it was the safest bet for something that coordinated with our dining room set and was wood. Pretty much form over function, and expensive at that.	
- 1	First, they leak.  They leak through the straw and they leak if the top isn't twisted perfectly closed using a zillion tons of force.But with that, I can deal.The deal breaker for me is that my cat chewed 2 straws in two days...and I cannot purchase replacements.  I simply can't find them anywhere online.  And I'm not going to drive all over town looking for them either.So while they worked well at keeping drinks cold, having to replace the entire bottle when all I need is a straw is annoying and costly.  So I'm moving on to another brand...if I can find one.	
1. 	Once your baby can sit up, it is the perfect tub. We were able to use it until our son turned about 10 1/2 months and was able to start climbing out. He loved it, and it kept him safe.	
1. 	I absolutely loved this cute little toy. As a first time mom it was hard to looks for toys that are durable, nice and worth having around. It is a perfect size for little hands and has the most vibrant colors. The noise when you shake it caught my little one's eyes and he absolutely loves to stare at it. It s a nice first essential toy for a baby and I believe it would make a great gift for a new mama.	
- 1	I bought two of these Summer placemats thinking they were identical to the Kiddopotamus product we mistakenly left at a restaurant. I was wrong. These are far less sturdy than the Kiddopotamus placemats, warp easily (in hot tap water), can't be put in the dishwasher (see warp easily) and are much more difficult to adhere to a table than the others. We'll keep using these as backup, but they are definitely an inferior product. Spend a few extra bucks and get the Kiddopotamus mat.	
1. 	I have nothing but great things to say about this wipe warmer. If my baby needs a midnight change he doesn't even notice that I am changing him because he doesn't feel a cold wipe on his bottom! I highly recommend!	
- 1	This toy is hard for little ones (even young toddlers) to push down on their own. Once it is pushed down (by me, since neither my baby or toddler can do it) it travels far, but my kids do not seem super excited about it. The main think that I don't like about this toy is that every time I push it down I feel like I am going to get pinched! My fingers just about got pinched one of the first times I tried it; I worry about little ones getting their fingers hurt! My husband thought the exact same thing. Definitely not my favorite toy.	
1. 	This is a super cute SleepSack and really keeps my 18mos warm.  Her room is so cold and this definitely takes the chill away!	
1. 	We liked the feel and the firmness of the mattress. Our baby sleeps well on it, so happy with the product so far.	
- 1	I recently purchased the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat (for $26 dollars from Amazon).  The same weekend, my mother purchased The First Years Deluxe Reclining Feeding Seat for $39.99 from Target.  This is my comparison of the two chairs.The Fisher-Price chair (I bought the red/white version) was VERY easy to assemble.  I didn't need to read directions.  I just put it together very quickly and logically.  (Whew, that was easy!) The straps came attached to the chair.  It seems secure and it is very easy to clean.  There are no nooks and crannies!  The tray has a lid, which is pretty cool.  You can actually take the food tray off, put the lid on it, and put it in the refrigerator! (Cool!) My 18 lb 7 month old seems to like the chair. Plus, the price was very nice!The First Years Deluxe Seat was not easy to put together.  I had to refer to the directions.  It took me a good 20 minutes.  The directions were a bit confusing too (and I like to think that I'm pretty smart!).  The straps had to be threaded through some little holes on the chair to attach them.  They didn't seem very secure.  A small child could easily remove them, maybe even a toddler.  After it was all together, it seemed like it was going to be ok.  It secured to the chair and seems pretty easy to clean (but not as easy as the Fisher-Price chair).  It does recline, but this isn't a feature that I need as my son sits up very well on his own and won't lay back in the chair.  He seems comfy in the chair.  It has a 5 point harness, but I felt like it was a bit of overkill.  I don't plan on leaving him in the chair unsupervised.For my use, the Fisher Price chair is a much better deal. It is easier to put together and clean and has some features that I like.	
- 1	This cup is easy for my 10 month old to hold, shake, and hold upside down.  It is very hard for him to drink out of.  It is also extremely drippy and leaves a puddle of water behind every time.	
- 1	I love Uppababy but I am very disappointed with this cup holder (as well as the previous model for how bad it looks). I can not believe that I have to remove the cup holder from the stroller every time I need to collapse it.  It is very inconvenient.  I ended up getting the Diono cupholder for my Vista.	
1. 	I love the Seuss motif, but more than that, the quality of the bib is great.  Resists stains, can be rinsed in between a few feedings (if they're not horrendously messy!) and washes nicely in the machine.  I hang dry mine to ensure they last longer, and they dry very quickly, but I'm sure you can still throw them in the dryer.  The Velcro seems sturdy and doesn't get all mangled and destroyed in the wash like some do.  My son likes to pull his bibs off, so we thought we had to stick with the fabric snap-on ones, but for some reason, he can't easily pull these off.  Nice!	
- 1	I loved the idea of this, but when we put it on, the bottom part of the gate still stuck up about half and inch over the trip guard, which might have been okay if we were using it on a level surface, but we used it on the bottom of a stair, and it still hurt like heck to step on it. It also stuck out past the bottom stair a bit.	
1. 	I like this, it's lightweight and easy to move around as needed, and also very sturdy.  We use it on the changing table and on the floor in the bathroom during bath time.  It provides a comfy safe place to do diaper changes, clothes changes, and lay baby down while toweling her dry.	
- 1	I like this product because it expands the use of my single stroller and makes it double which is a huge help and convenience when pushing around two babies.Likes: Can push two babies in one stroller, that is loads front and back and not side to side which makes it easier to maneuver in store aisles, easy to put on and take offDislikes: The babies end up being very close together, I am not sure how this would work with bigger kids as of right now I am putting to infants in the stroller, only fits on one way so the baby in the rumble seat has to face backwards which means they either look at the other baby or the back of the other seat.I have seen and used other friend's double strollers and think that this is still the better option. It is very similar to the City Select stroller that can also be converted into a double stroller I just liked the feel of the whole stroller better when I made my original selection on strollers.	
- 1	The print place isn't soft	
- 1	With a name like Medela Breastmilk Feeding and Storage Set, you would think this was a) well designed and b) designed with the thought of delivering (a precious and limited supply of) breast milk to a baby without deleterious effects.  Not in this case.Don't get me wrong, it has some definite positives.  It is BPA free (note: so is glass and glass tends to have fewer issues with residual mold release agent than any polymeric bottle).  The ink adheres well and the graduations are clear.  But it also has some needless negatives.  My biggest complaint is that it is stylishly designed to bow out below the nipple.  The practical implication of that is, when Dad is left with a limited amount of breast milk to dispense while Mom is out, a good ounce of it is inaccessible in this large belly -- unless you put baby on her back and hold the bottle vertical (which is warned against by the baby books as a horizontal baby is likely to get milk in its Eustachian tubes leading to ear infections).  Dad's next thought was to see if he could bend the nipple to get the bottle and baby more upright.  Bad idea: this nipple goes into free flow faster than old fashioned rubber nipples. These bottles are lighter and less likely to break if dropped than glass, but the old fashioned glass/rubber nipple system works better (and the glass bottles are included in the pack of premixed formula that you buy when you run out of breast milk).	
- 1	I registered and received this gift for my baby shower.  I put it on the car seat and was looking forward to bringing my baby home in it.  Fortunately, my hospital has a car seat safety inspection station and they told me to take the Bundle Me off immediately.  They say because the Bundle Me goes under the baby it interferes with the safety restraints.  The straps that go around the baby may appear to be tight, but the Bundle Me may actually bunched up under the straps and therefore the restraints aren't as tight as they should be.  Then God-forbid there was an accident, the force could cause the Bundle Me to shift-- loosening the restraints and baby could come lose.  Kinda defeats the purpose of a car seat if you ask me.  When there are so many safe covers (the ones that are elastic and go over the car seat, but not under the baby-- for example the Eddie Bauer Carrier Cover, which is what we ended up with), why take the chance?  I'd rather error on the side of safety.	
1. 	My son got this for his first Christmas. It's got a hard back shell which illuminates the walls and ceiling and plush turtle body parts. He learned how to change the colors a month after he got it, when he was 1 year old. It's a great way to have a night light while you're putting the little one to sleep and the colors are quite soothing. The light is very bright if you look straight into the shell so try to keep your baby from doing that.If you'd like other reviews on the best gifts for a one year old or on what to put on a baby registry, visit the website, AllMomsAerPerfect.com.

1. 	These are great to use for the powder enfamil. the colors are vibrent. price was a good price. yes will be telling friends and family.	
- 1	DISCLAIMER: my review is based on being a cloth diaper user, which means it can't possibly get a good rating on the mere fact that it simply cannot even be used with cloth diapers. it may however be amazing for disposable diapers.most sites and all the best reviews seem to turn up this old model of the diaper champ as the best pail out there, so of course i got it and was super excited, but cloth diaperers beware: this pail WILL NOT work for cloth, as it gets stuck in the mechanism when you flip it. no matter how hard i tried and how strategic i balled up that diaper, it would not fall through into the bucket and got stuck every single time. i was extremely disappointed. NOTE: i'm a two-system pre-fold cloth diaperer, not an all-in-one one-system user, meaning the cloth piece is separate from the cover, and therefore cannot be taped closed, since it's just a loose piece of fabric. if you're an AIO'er (ie g-diaper, etc), then you can absolutely still use this pail since the cover stays on the cloth and can therefore wrap up the fabric piece and seal shut before throwing in.so a bit of extra help to you cloth diaperers out there, don't want to leave you hanging.... after figuring that out, i was back on the hunt and the diaper dekor seems to be the closest second for cloth diaper users. may even be better... the design makes that pail hold a much higher capacity than this diaper champ, and most others i've seen out there, without making the actual size of the pail larger (if that makes sense). basically, there isn't a bulky mechanism that takes up space inside, leaving there more room for diapers. with this diaper champ, the flip mechanism takes up a SIGNIFICANT amount of space on the inside, leaving there very little room for diapers (which i guess if you're a disposable diaperer, is not a big deal because you're changing out the bag very frequently, but for a cloth diaperer using a weekly service [i'm a new yorker and don't have my own washer/dryer], there's absolutely no way a weeks' worth of diapers would fit in this diaper champ). i do agree that not having to use a special bag for this pail is a huge bonus, but that perk also exists for the dekor (and bonus: the dekor's design allows you to cut the bag to whatever size you'd like, making it that much more economical, even with the made-for liners if you do choose to use them. i'm going to use a hamper liner though, which fits perfectly).last note, to the it smells complainers: non-breastmilk poop smells, period. it's a diaper pail, not a miracle can. plus, human waste is illegal to dispose of, so you should be dumping solid poops into the toilet in the first place, regardless that you're using disposable diapers, then you won't be dealing with such ferocious smells in the second place.	
- 1	I don't understand how this could fit a 35lb child.  That is impossible.  It is a trim diaper but it's not ONE size like it says.  My child is only 21 lbs and this is almost at the limit of what the diaper can fit.  I don't understand how any parents could like this diaper.  I love BumGenius but FuzziBunz is crap.	
- 1	I purchased this product knowing I will be making my own baby food, and this should be of some assistance in the process. I loved it... it mashes fruits very well, is easy to serve from and clean with a brush. I was going to purchase another one and stumbled upon  the negative reviews. I was horrified when I found out this was made with #7 plastic, and the health risks it poses to my baby. I used it for over two months but have since stopped and WILL NOT be using this to crush my baby's food. I hope in that period of using it my baby wasn't exposed too much to the chemicals contained within to cause any permanent harm. I will rather be safe and use a fork or spoon to crush foods. It's really cute and eye-catching though... Don't be fooled.	
- 1	My daughter hated sleeping in this!  Being a new parent, I think it's best that a bassinet should be see through so you can check on your child without having to get up.  The hospital has newborns in a see through plastic container for them to sleep in.  I wish we had that!  Also, I find it a little flimsy and unstable.	
1. 	I would have given this product five stars, except it took almost a month to sort out a delivery snafu before we could actually get the crib together. This is the first time I've had a problem with an Amazon purchase and they weren't able to resolve it quickly (or technically, at all).The product itself seems great and it was top-rated on Consumer Reports (my main reason for ordering it). We noticed some issues with the (white) finish on one leg being scratched/stained, but since that bit faces the wall and it was such a great buy, it's not an issue for us. Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and didn't take long to put together.However, it was difficult and time-consuming to sort out problems with customer service, so I'm not 100% thrilled with the purchase.Initially, they only sent two legs (instead of four). When contacted, Amazon customer service told us we could either repack/return the entire crib (time-consuming & cumbersome) or request the missing parts from the manufacturer (Million Dollar Baby, MDB) directly.Unfortunately, Amazon had no contact details for MDB, so we had to track it down ourselves via the MDB website. Even then, the only available contact method was via email (no phone). Once MDB responded (about a week after my first email), it took over a week to resolve, and at least another week before the parts were actually delivered.I'd hesitate before ordering another one of these products, at least until MDB improves (or expand) its customer service department.	
- 1	I hated this tub, and returned it after attempting to use it twice. The newborn sling has no support, and kept my baby completely out of the water and he got freezing cold. I tried it without the sling, and the infant seat part also keeps your baby completely above the water, with just their butt covered. I also found that no matter how tightly I tried to screw on the legs that you have to attach, they were still loose and wobbly.	
- 1	Bought 6 of these so glad I didn't open all of them...washed 2 of the pouches, filled them with applesauce and the lid popped off and made a huge mess shortly after giving it to my 2 year old! Not happy to have wasted 8$ on 2 from Walmart but least at I can return the other 4	
- 1	The fibers in the brush shed more than my cat. Enough said. I mean, after using it, your baby will have more brush fibers on her head than actual hair.	
1. 	I'll start with the con---it's heavy and the parent organizer cost extra.  Now the positives are it fits my Chicco car-seat perfectly! It's great for my NB son and 2 1/2 year daughter. she sometimes sits and sometimes walks.  When she is to big to sit then I can still use the stroller. Not like the doubles that I would  be pushing a huge empty stroller around.  great for those with two young kids (just not twins).  I also like the material-durable feel and easy to wipe. Very little assembly required- I did it myself in 20 mins and no tools.  Ps- I was able to purchase this for 99$ from joovy website with free shipping.  So lookout for special offers. AND yes there is little room for child on bench when front seat reclined-but my DD doesn't seem to care and can still sit.  Maybe a chubby child would have difficulty.....	
- 1	These bags are very, very thin.  They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open.  The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties.  They are easy to use.	
1. 	How a parent doesn't own a box of these is beyond me!  So convenient and they really cover up that awful poopy smell!  Just fling them into the garage garbage and done!	
1. 	I wish I had bought this much sooner, but once I finally caved, I definitely think it helped my son gain the confidence to walk independently. It was barely used, though, so we're returning it. One thing to note: it's pretty small. We used it when my son was 16 months and it didn't quite fit around the chest (the buckles helped), and he's pretty average in size. I think this is a great product for a baby or toddler who is almost walking (cruising and using push toys) but not quite ready to be on their own. The only thing is that it helps so much you won't get much use out of it!	
1. 	My daughter has the kind that just plug in and you have to pry your fingernail down between the plug and the fixture to get the darned thing off.  I have soft fingernails so it's really hard for me to do that when I want to use and outlet at her house.  I got these for my house and they are much easier to use.  All you do is squeeze the sides and push the top button and they pull right out.  It's great because they stick out a little from the wall so you can get a much better grip on them and don't have to use your fingernails to pry them off.  However, it would be a challenge for a baby to get them off because he probably couldn't squeeze the sides and push the button at the same time. I'm happy with the purchase.  I am a 57 year old grandma and if I can do it anyone can.	
- 1	My husband and I purchased this bath at Target because it was on sale for $15. At first I was excited but after using it for a month I'm pretty disappointed. The wedge in the middle of the tub that is suppose to support the baby's bum makes washing my 3 and 1/2 month old son pretty difficult. His feet already reach the other side of the tub so I don't see us using it much longer. We never used the sling either because our son would have barely touched the water in it.UPDATE: I didn't like this bath before but now I hate it even more. It's been about a month since I reviewed this and my son is now 4 1/2 months old, about 16 pounds and 24 inches long. He has become too big for the infant side of the tube, his back and bum can't sit comfortably on the wedge/bump in the middle of the tub and he can't sit up yet so the todler side is a no go.	
1. 	My baby -newborn- loves when I brush her hair with this brush. She falls asleep. Wonderful purchase. I am very hapy with the quality and look of this item.	
1. 	This is a very nice potty chair.  It is a sleek, simple design, easy to clean, no annoying sounds or other bells/whistles.  I ordered it to get my child used to sitting on the potty (not starting training yet).  I have a small (18 pound) 1 year old and this seat was just a little bit too tall.  I ended up ordering the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty, which is a very similar design without the high back/sides, and it seems to be a much better size for my needs.  It appears that the bowls are interchangeable. I posted side-by-side photo of both of the potties for comparison purposes.	
- 1	This tray was way too big for my daughter's lap in the car. Had to return it right away and haven't found a replacement. Might be great for a taller kid. My daughter is 22 months and about 33&#34;.	
1. 	This gate has been fantastic.  We have been using it for 3 years now, and it has been so easy to use.  I admit the opening is too large, but safe enough for everyone to get through.  It's easy to modify to suit your needs.  I recommend these types of gates, which swing open, as I tripped over a tension gate (freestanding style) and broke my leg.  Be safe, not sorry.  This gate is WONDERFUL.	
- 1	Inside the cup, the straw can come apart and be put back together easily...however it falls apart easily too.  When my daughter drops the cup, the straw comes dislocated.  So the next time she goes to drink, she can't suck anything.  It took an entire day of noticing she didn't drink anything to find the problem.  My poor daughter was thirsty for a whole day because of this cup.  Not pleased at all.	
- 1	personally I havent used them so cant speak to how they work but just wanted to add this review to let other know that they are priced much less at marshalls or tj max.same with all the dr brown feeding bowls.but none of them are microwave safe beware	
1. 	gave as a baby gift. well received. really fun grouping. wish I had gotten one for my baby too! LOL	
- 1	It's simple - if you use any bottles that aren't wide mouth (AKA any bottles best for breast-feeding babies) then this is not the brush for you. I unfortunately found this out the hard way, as it was impossible to get into the bottle. I tried using it as a brush for other dishes, to feel like I hadn't completely wasted my money, but the microfiber pads get disgusting and look bacteria-filled within the first few uses. I put it in the dishwasher to clean, and it still didn't look clean enough for future uses, so I tossed it. I'm back to a Munchkin brand bottle brush and love it.	
- 1	I'm so disappointed in this pacifier.  I bought a two pack and both pacifiers deflated within 4 days.  I didn't even know this could happen.  It's like all the air was sucked out of the nipple part and my baby was just sucking on a piece of rubber.	
1. 	When we moved my daughter into a twin bed and out of the crib for the first time, I wanted to start her off with one long side of the bed along a wall.  I bought the Regalo for the open side of the bed.  Eventually I thought I'd move her bed to have both long sides exposed, and maybe purchase a second bed rail for the other side.  Once I got this and set it up, I realized that its probably not going to work to put a second rail up.  This thing is pretty bulky underneath the bed, and I'm not sure a second one would work.  It does work nicely with the bed up against the wall however, as the picture shows.When I first opened the box, there was the beginning of a tear in the fabric, where it attaches to the metal rail.  I didn't really want to go to the trouble of returning it and shipping it back and waiting for a new one, so I just lived with it.  But the material does seem a little flimsy, especially at the seams.Overall its a decent product, and well made.  My favorite thing about it is that its quite long, so fully protects my daughter along almost the entire length of the bed.  She's a very restless sleeper, so I like that she can thrash about without fear of falling out of the bed.	
- 1	I originally chose this spout cover over because it was cute and unique. However, after opening the package, I realized it is also very flimsy. It is made of a very light weight foam material, not plastic. I decided to give it a try anyway and now regret it. The first time my son pulled on it (and of course he is going to be curious, he is a one year old!), it began to rip along the top seam. I imagine it will soon be unusable. I was very disappointed because it looked so cute. The only way this would hold up is if your child never touches it, and anyone with a small child knows that is highly unlikely! Considering it was designed for a child's protection during bath time, I would have to say this is quite a failure.	
- 1	This is a COMPLETE waste of money.  I'm at 31 weeks and cannot here my child's heartbeat AT ALL.  A few times we thought was that it, and no it was not.  Not only does this device not work but also when you can actually hear some kind of noise, it gets interrupted by very loud static.  The only thing decent was the price I thought until I realized I'm donating $25 to GRACO.  I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY this product, it is a complete waste of money.  It's really disappointing when you are looking foward to sharing your baby's heartbeat with everyone and all you hear is static.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would've.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this but it just isn't going to work for me.  The concept is awesome and I wish there were alternatives but this one misses the mark.  The biggest issue, like others have previously pointed out, is that the lid is difficult to screw on.  The three cups easily disconnect and reconnect with each other but the lid takes effort if you want the threads to line up the right way (side note, the cups do unscrew pretty smoothly so now that I think about it maybe they would become less secure over time).  I don't have the time to worry about making sure the lid is screwed on properly every time I use it.  Not only does it increase the likelihood of spilled snacks but it also leads me to believe they would go stale quickly due to a poor seal.  I will continue to look for something similar that holds the same larger amount of snacks.	
1. 	I LOVE these sleepsacks!  My newborn twins sleep soundly in them and I don't have to worry about them getting out of them, which they do when I swaddle them with just about anything else.  They're nice and warm and have easy access for changing.	
- 1	I do not recommend this product. The sticky Velcro did not stay attached to my brick fireplace and my 8 month old son was easily able to pull it off. I threw this away about 2 days after I got it.	
- 1	There are no redeeming qualities of these. First - there's no double sided sticky tape on the back, so even if they did work, they wouldn't be very convenient. Second - they don't remove odors or even cover them up, not even a tiny bit. Want to know how effective they are? Take your $6.79 in cash and place it where you would place one of these. How did that work? Yup, pretty much the same, except you can now spend that cash elsewhere.	
1. 	This is the best of the diaper trash systems. No special bags to buy -- completly contains the smells - easy to use.  This is one baby gadget you'll be really glad you bought.	
- 1	i thought these looked pretty cool when i first saw them, but once i got them i realized not only are they lame, but they are annoying as well.  the only part that glows in the dark is the dinky little handle...on top of that, the shape of the pacifier makes it so they are only meant to go one direction, with the flat side up.  this is annoying, especially fumbling around and trying to get it back in the baby's mouth at night.  get the ones that aren't curved on the bottom so they work either direction.	
- 1	Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.	
1. 	Finally I found a potty insert to fit our smallish round toilet lid. Other inserts that claimed they were for a standard size were just too big. It came with a simple peel & stick hanger that makes storage convenient. It is nice & cushy for our skinny 2 year olds bottom & there is no fear of him falling through. Wish it was not made in China that is my only negative comment. For that reason I only gave this product 4 stars.	
- 1	I think that I've tried every bag that I have found and have been disappointed with all of them.  These were just about the worst!!  My daughter was born prematurely and never really got the hang of breastfeeding.  I wanted her to recieve all of the benefits of breastmilk so I pumped.  I have pumped everday since the day she was born btwn 5 and 8 times a day.  I went through ALOT of bags (I use bottles now) and these were a pain.  They were small, thin, punctured easily, and those twist ties (although pumping directly into the bag is a great concept) were just a pain in the butt.  I love Medela's pumps (I own the Pump in Style Advanced, a seperate manual pump, and used the Lactina hospital pump for 3 months), I like their storage bottles, I even like their nipple cream, but these bags need some more work put into them.	
1. 	Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.	
- 1	This cover is an oversized piece of thick plastic that you have to wrap like a present around your mattress with two ends of weak tape. It is hard to get tight and doesn't overlap for a firm fit. It makes me more nervous than it's claims to prevent SIDS and has been very frustrating. It makes it difficult to change the sheets, etc. I would not recommend this cover nor would i purchase one again.	
1. 	I received the halo sleepsack swaddle as a baby gift before my baby was born.  We started using it almost right away.  I felt it was very easy to use.  I was able to wrap the 'wings' around and secure them so that they stayed velcroed.  My family wasn't as good at that - they always had it too loose and it would come un-velcroed when the baby wiggled around a lot.  My baby slept so well when he was swaddled that we bought a second one so we could have one washing while he was sleeping.  When he outgrew them we bought two more in cotton (it was summer by then).  My baby slept in these for every nap and at night for 7 months before he outgrew them.  I recommend them to everyone.  Just make sure you figure out how to secure it properly.	
1. 	It's soft, and washable. When my baby makes a mess while I'm changing her, all I have to do is take this off and put it in the wash. It's easier than cleaning the changing pad itself.	
1. 	Debated purchasing these based on some of the reviews, so just to clarify some of the negative comments -1.  Yes, it's a piece of terry cloth.  If you can design it yourself you should, otherwise it fits perfect and does exactly what is needed2.  It has slots on each side, so it goes in between the clips when you put the bjorn on.  Obviously, when you unlatch it, it might fall off, but the point is that it's removable and easy to just put on, so this is not that big of an inconvenience.3.  Easy to wash and baby still likes to suck on this part of the bjorn.  Bibs did not work, as it didn't settle at the same height and she didn't like the fabric as much.Highly recommend, wish I would have purchased sooner to prevent the initial damage to the carrier.	
- 1	These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!	
- 1	I like the other green sprout rattles better then this one. This one moves and twists so much that it's harder for our daughter to hold and shake. I imagine she'll like it more when she is a few months older.	
- 1	My son received 6 of these cups for Christmas.  The size and shape of this cup is fantastic. I have never had the cup leak but the nipples constantly collapse on all of them, so he can't drink from it. My son is 20 months and he has to give it back to us to fix it once it caves in. We will not use this brand again.	
1. 	I was previously using the Boppy cuddle pillow, which I received as a gift.  The farther along in my pregnancy, it became more uncomfortable, because of how high it was.  I picked this up, around 34 weeks and have been sleeping much better.  Before, I would end up sleeping with my stomach flat on my bed, so my back was twisted and would hurt throughout the day.  Now I find it makes sleeping much easier.	
1. 	I chose this tub because of the number of great reviews. I agree. It is a great product and a great price. I love the seating for my 3 month old. I also like the drain at the bottom. Clever!	
1. 	This thing is a fabulous idea.  And it does work.  It's light and very easy to put on and off the big potty, and OMG is it nice when DS uses it to poop and I don't have to clean the little training potty (that thing grosses me out!!).  The only reason I didn't give this thing five stars is because it's so light, it kind of moves around and wiggles when DS climbs onto it.  So, he needs me to hold it steady while he gets on and off, which kind of defeats the purpose - I was hoping this would be a way for him to use the big potty by himself.  Still, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages (cleaning bodily fluids out of the little potty), so this is definitely worth four stars to me and I would buy it again in a heartbeat - I just wish my expectations had been a bit more realistic.UPDATE 11/12/2012 - I had to come back and update this to say that this has become my son's favorite potty accessory.  When we are traveling, he tells me he wants his potty ladder.  It's help up remarkably well, and DS has mastered it and can put it up himself, climb on himself, climb off and even remove it himself.  My earlier concerns were for naught!	
- 1	Thought this was cute at first but the opening is way too smaill for toddler hands!  My son struggles to pull his hand out with his snacks.	
- 1	My son hates how the nipple on these is so straight and pointed. He refuses to suck on them at all and prefers the MAM style over this.	
- 1	I didn't realize that those bibs are made of some plastic-like material when I purchased them; they look really cute, but I don't know if I can trust the material! It smells very strong.	
1. 	I use these to transport bottles so no leaking. Great buy! Use these with the old event rings on the new advent bottles and no leaking :)	
- 1	The first pack I bought was great. The second pack was sewn oddly in more of an oval shape (rather than a circle). I didn't think much of it until I washed the second pack and there was an odd ridge/fold/crease on the fleece-side that goes right across the middle! I'm not sure if one of the sides shrank so the two layers aren't even now. It makes the pads nearly unusable because it puts odd pressure on your nipples [thinks of seam on a piece of clothing]. I don't know if I got an odd pack or what. Not sure whether I want to chance it with a third pack to see if the second was a fluke. The first pack is holding up decently, though using lanolin does make for some pilling of the fleece, but it is more of a cosmetic issue (which I don't care about). It doesn't make the pads uncomfortable.These pads do dry well in the dryer. Another brand of reusable pads (all cotton) never feel like they dry all the way.*** Update: These pads definitely are rough once you wash a few times and the fleece pills. :(	
1. 	This changing pad fit my changing table perfectly.  My baby doesn't roll around and I feel he's really safe while I'm changing him.  You can also tell he really loves the comfort.  Easy to clean as well.	
- 1	It did not fit in the tub. I guess it is made for tile built in tubs, not for standard tubs. I don't have tile walls. It would drip and make puddles where it was not supposed to.	
- 1	I love the design, idea, and feel of this cup BUT.....it leaks like crazy!! My son 1 & 1/2 loves drinking out of a straw so when i found this I was excited to get it and it work for one day then the next day the fluid just keep leaking out of the straw even if the cup is sitting on the table. We found out that the air builds up and then it pushes the liquid out so you have to constantly release the air pressure in the straw and it's a pain to keep checking the cup to make sure it's not leaking so as we all know messy cups and not fun to keep cleaning up after! I would not recommend this cup!	
1. 	I bought this from Babies R'' Us when my son started putting everything in his mouth.  The teether has 4 soft rubber sections, each with different textures. It also rattles and can be bent in a number of different ways. The teether is easy for my son to grasp and twist. He enjoys chewing on the rubber sections and likes to throw it to hear rattle sounds. The teether is very easy to clean, just hand wash and air dry. It is small enough to throw in the diaper bag and entertaining enough to occupy my son during car rides, doctor's office visits, etc.	
- 1	I bought this because I thought it would be a wipes case that I could use one handed while changing diapers.  Not so much. Also, the red button doesn't click, so it doesn't really close/lock.  And then soon after it just fell off.	
- 1	Save your money and buy a better strap. This clip is super cheap and poorly made.  It will break very quickly.	
- 1	Thin fabric. Pain in the neck to keep in place. Have to reposition or replace every time you take the carrier off. Better just to use a burp cloth.	
1. 	This item was extremely helpful, especially with 3 adults sharing baby care responsibilities. My husband of mom didn't have to wake me up to ask when the baby had eaten or been changed. It helped me keep a written record to take to Dr appts so I had all the information they ask you for on hand already, and even helped me note and analyze baby's sleep patterns once he got a little older. Definitely a useful item to have.	
- 1	Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for these sheets. I like the fact that they are flannel to keep my toddler and baby warm. BUT they shed bad. I washed them for the first time and my dryer was full of white lint. I was extremely disappointed with that first off and then I noticed how warn down they looked because of the rest of the material had shed off. I really wanted to return because I bought three sets, but am just keeping the two I had washed and sending back third. Worth the money? Maybe, but I would have rather spent more and got long lasting flannel sheets, not these wash away disappointments.	
1. 	This is the best gym out there!  It has plenty for them to play with, but it also has the several modes for the lights and sounds.  We looked at them all and decided this was the best...and best for the money!	
- 1	When they say &#34;small&#34; it is truly small. I chose small because they suggest you select your size, but in the end the baby's size &#34;prevailed.&#34; Couldn't fit her in, it was very uncomfortable.	
- 1	Go get the ones from target instead these are too thin. They soak through too easily and are a little bit rough. Also they are mostly white and have a dated look to them. Buy something else.	
1. 	I love this gate!  It can be mounted into the wood or used held by pressure.  We use ours w/the pressure and it even stays in place with the door closed!  it's very easy to use and durable.  The cat hasn't tried to jump it & can't get thru it unless it's open and the 80lb dog hasn't tried to jump it either (which was very questionable).  I definitely recommend this gate!	
1. 	frame is cute.  it has real weight to it, so it doesn't feel or look cheap at all.  Note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle.	
1. 	Very soft, good amount of padding, fits great (even with the 2 1/2&#34; mattress we purchased extra), and has held up to washings on delicate cycle.  We also have the Carter's one, and this is much better quality.  Buy it - you won't regret it!	
1. 	I purchased this for my grandaughter's visits.  Crib was easy to put together, if you are careful it doesn't scratch.  Looks beautiful in the room, is very sturdy and my grandaughter sleeps great in it.  I like that the highest crib placement is very high and makes it very easy to put a sleeping child to bed in without waking her.  I would definately recommend this crib.	
1. 	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I was so happy that there were smaller size breastshields out there. I am on the smaller end (A cup before pregnancy), and the pictures in the Medela instruction booklet seemed to indicate that the included medium breastshields with my pump were too big for me. I was getting decent output, but thought it was worth the 12 bucks to try a smaller breastshield for comfort. Have used these smaller shields ever since I received them. They are very comfortable and I've had no problem with output either. No problem with fit with the connectors that came with my PISA. Just ordered another set as a spare. Concur with an earlier review that the shipping isn't lightning fast, but it does arrive within the time window promised. Put in the order soon if you are in a time crunch with pumping - it's worth a shot.	
1. 	This changing pad has been a wonderful addition to our little collection of baby gear.  We not only use it every day to change our son's diaper and to change his clothes, but we also take it with us when traveling and let him sleep on it at night.  With the curved sides, it prevents him from rolling off.  Great for up to around 5-6 months for this purpose; once the baby gets very mobile or wiggly, using this for sleeping may not be ideal.  For diaper changing alone, I would imagine that we would use this for quite a long time considering the larger size and 32-inch length.  We love it so much, that when we forgot ours at a hotel on vacation we just ordered a brand new one when we got home.  Definitely a must have for us!	
1. 	I bought this pillow shortly after I first found out I was pregnant, in anticipation of needing it later. I decided to try it out the first night and it seemed to fit well between my knees. And then, on a whim, I put the biggest part under my head, with the small tail curving towards me. It was amazing. I have always been a side sleeper, and this pillow is so much more comfortable than a regular pillow. The small tail is perfect as a natural arm rest and the pillow is not so thick as to create a crick in the neck. I have been sleeping with it for several days now and have never lost it over the side of the bed, and it is small enough that it doesn't crowd out my husband.I already have plans to buy a second one for the belly/legs later on when I need it. I've tried a full body pillow before, but I'm too hot natured. Even with a fan blowing on high and the temp set at 69, I would wake up burning up and sweating. I think the smaller size of this pillow will help with that and will provide the support I need without feeling like I'm pressed against a furnace at 3 in the morning!	
1. 	All I can say is that I would not have made it through my pregnancy without this pillow. Very early on in my pregnancy, my hips and back started hurting me during sleep. I bought this pillow pretty early on and it fixed those problems. I literally could not sleep without this pillow. When we went out of town for the weekend, I brought it with me. It's versatile: you can fold it into different shapes for various needs. It can help prop you up if you're having a particularly bad reflux night, you can use it under your legs for elevation after a long day at work, or the traditional flat shape to help you sleep at night.My husband also loved it. Every time I would get up to use the bathroom or get something, I would come back and he would be curled up in my snoogle!	
1. 	We have had this in Mommy's car since baby was born. We got a new car for Daddy that we intend to take on trips and since we got her a new carseat for Daddy's car we put Mommy's mirror in Daddy's car. He loves that with it in the middle seat he can see her in the rear view mirror without straining. He won't give it back so I am glad I found it here to get another one. The original was from Wal-Mart but they don't sell it anymore.	
1. 	I tried the orginal VentAires to help my baby with gas, but he didn't seem to like those nipples at all, so when I found these I bought them right away.  He loves these and does so much better with the nipples.  He also gets less gas.  I find them easier to put together and clean then the regular VentAires also.	
1. 	We use this not on our cribs, but on sharp corners on our built in cabinets in areas highly trafficked by our small kiddos. It does stay on-- or it did until our older child learned to peel it off. Buying more now to protect our littlest.	
- 1	While the sheet serves its purpose, it's rough material and I am concerned it may irritate my son's sensitive skin. I'll give it a few more washes to see if it softens up a bit. Very low priced so I guess I get what I paid for.	
- 1	I bought this bag after our last cooler was outgrown by our baby. I searched for a cooler that was sturdy and had enough space for at least two bottles and food jars. The only reason I am not giving it 1 star was because I was able to pack the above and then store the spoons in the front zippered pocket. After  a month and half of use the inside stitching came apart and the foam underneath became visible. Very poorly constructed. I have to say that my final decision fir purchase of this product was based on brand as Dr. Brown is known for quality products. I was very disappointed.As a side note, I did not buy this product through Amazon but through a large baby retail store.	
1. 	This works great keeping my 1 year old out of the toilet.  I have had a few adult visitors who couldn't figure out the system and were able to just remove the whole thing.  I'm not sure how they did it, and my kiddo can't, so I'm keeping it.  But keep in mind it is possible to remove without really meaning to.	
1. 	I have tried a few types of nursing pads, and these are the ones I personally prefer. they are thick, absorbent, and heavy duty. They last a lot longer than others that I have tried, and hold their shape in the wash unlike others that bunch and wrinkle up. Also, the washing bag that comes with the breast pads are great to use for baby's socks, hand mitts, etc. I don't use the bag for the breast pads, I just throw them in the wash by themselves and haven't lost any yet. I highly recommend these!	
1. 	This Play Yard is exactly what I was looking for to cordon off a large portion of a room as a play area for our crawling 7mo.  It's sturdy and colorful.  It's much larger than I anticipated, I ordered the extension with it and didn't end up needing it, but it's really the perfect size for a spoiled little rug rat.	
- 1	Unfortunately, this swing has been an absolute waste of money. Its very cute and the music is nice and I was really looking forward to it coming. But it does not work for us. The cloth seat doesn't support our 3 month old, the fabric is too tight behind his head and that leaves him nowhere for his head to rest, and the position he sits in makes his chin tuck into his chest. He looks uncomfortable and he cannot fall asleep in it. I've tried so hard to make adjustments, pillow behind his back, behind his head, under his butt, but nothing corrects the position the seat puts him in. He has a difficult time breathing when his chin is so tucked in. I'm actually surprised this would have passed any safety regulations (perhaps its not required to pass any tests). I really wanted this swing to work and i'm very sad that it doesn't. I would not recommend this swing to anyone. Also, I would have returned it but during the return process, I learned I had to pay shipping costs! My refund would have been what I paid minus the cost it took to ship the item via amazon's return shipping label (approx. 12 bucks). Would have cost even more to use USPS by myself. So I just kept it :( Major bummer.	
1. 	This things install quickly and easily if you're running standard cords (for lamps, etc.) though the holes.  If you want to run something thicker (like the wire on one of my power strips) I found I had to do a bit of modification to make it fit.  I ended up trimming the gap so it was larger on the backside plate and that did the trick.I think the ones I got are more than difficult enough to keep my son from opening them.  I'd consider them on the fence for an outlet that I'd want access to all the time, and someone with arthritis would probably want to stay away.	
- 1	Since I had already made the commitment to make homemade baby food for my little one, I figured why stop there. I began searching for what I thought would be the best reusable Baby Food Pouch, and came across these from Go Fresh Baby. I really liked how the zipper was on the side instead of the bottom and how the feeding tube was on the top instead if the side. I was so excited and placed my order fairly quickly. I really appreciated how the product came with easy to follow, step by step instructions. I followed the instructions so that I could wash the pouches for use this upcoming week. The zipper was extremely hard to open. In fact, on one of the pouches the zipper separated from the pouch. Now there is an opening to the pouch and the zipper remains sealed. This was disappointing because I haven't had this product very long at all. I'm hoping I'll be able to get this sorted out.	
1. 	I have owned several bottle brushes over the course of the last 4 years.  From the cheap 99 cent ones, to the relatively expensive Oxo Tot.  This has been the best of the bunch.The design is excellent for narrow neck bottle users.  Other bottle brushes have bristles all the way around the handle (360 degrees).  That seems very intuitive at first.  You probably think, like I did: more bristles means easier to use and gets the bottle cleaner.Unfortunately, the 360 design it presents several practical issues *if* you use narrow neck bottles, like me.  The bristles spray water everywhere each time you pull the brush out of the bottle - annoying.  Also, the friction of constantly stuffing the brush in and out of the narrow neck causes the bristles on the 360 degree brushes to become matted, because they are so wide with the bristles going all the way around.  This Avent brush is narrower by design, which prevents the spraying water and preserves the integrity of the bristles.I would say about 95% of the bristles are still in excellent, like new, shape after 6 months of daily use.  The other 5% are a little flattened (but not matted), but it doesn't affect its ability to get the bottles clean.Sure, you have to twist the brush around to get the entire inside of the bottle clean, but it's quick and easy to do.The nipple cleaner part is eh.  It's hard plastic, so I don't see how it can really clean the nipple.  I must prefer theBaby Simba Lion Bottle Nipple Brushes. BPA Free Holder w/ Sterling Silver base. Set of 2	
- 1	I got this pump when I had my fourth child. My insurance company let me choose from several options, and if was going to get the medela but after doing some research and reading reviews on the rumble tuff I decided to try this out. Unfortunately I am not so happy with it. I find that I just don't get as much milk as I should. My baby is young, I have a full and wonderful milk supply, and for some reason all I can get is 3 ounces in 10 minutes when I use this pump.  When I used my medela for my other babies i definitely got more.This pump has some advantages over the medela, in my opinion.  I find it more comfortable because of the silicone shields. And the tubing does not accumulate moisture like in the medela. I like the bottle stands so that the bottles don't tip over when you put them down. I liked the feature that it has that turns it into a manual pump but I never actually used it, so while it originally attracted me to this pump (I guess I thought I hate pumping, maybe I would like the manual pump better) I have never used it. There is also less to shlep around with this pump but that could just be because my medela came in a huge backpack. As another poster said, the carry bag for this pump is really a joke (no zipper even!) but it is easier to just stuff in a small bag and not lug around a giant backpack.The bottom line for me is, I am at home with my baby and use the pump so I can get the occasional evening away. For that purpose this pump is okay. But if I was working full time and relied on this pump there is no way I could produce enough for my baby with this. It simply does not empty me as much as the medela did.  (Not to mention the time involved - when I used to work and pumped with the medela all I had time for was a quick pumping session a few times a day. This pump takes me 10 minutes to get 3 ounces combined from both sides - I would need to use this for 20 minutes at a time to get a decent amount and I never had that kind of time to kill at work.)I am disappointed, and if I was doing it again I would choose the medela because it is stronger and I got a lot more milk.(And again, I am pretty certain this is not a milk supply issue. I seem to have an abundance of milk, I often feel very full, often milk leaks out, and sometimes if my baby comes off while nursing milk keeps spraying out at her anyway. She has doubled her birth weight in less than three months while exclusively nursing. So I am fairly certain the pump is simply not as strong as others.)	
- 1	We were never able to keep the crib liner stable in one position. Since this is made out of nylon/synthetic material, it doesnt stay at one place. It always slips down to the bottom.Didn't like it	
- 1	While the Constellation turtle is a cute idea, it is poorly made.  The white lights are useless, but the blue and green work great.  This is more of a night light, as the name states, not a learning toy, people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere.  Our turtle came unglued at the neck, around the plastic and the fabric and the stuffing started coming out.  This item is recommended for children age 3 and up, it falls apart and the stuffing falls out it can be a choking hazard!	
1. 	Super cute and soft. I am still pregnant but I am excited to use this for my LO. It get's a little chilly at night and these seems cozy enough to keep her warm.	
- 1	I thought this baby book was so adorable and I was excited to use it for my baby. I liked the fact that you could remove pages to customize what you want to include/exclude. I was disappointed when the product arrived. The cover was bent and misshapen and looked as though it had been crushed under the weight of something heavy. Normally I would have exchanged it, but I have another Pearhead photo album and the same thing happened. I believe it's a quality issue on how they are constructed and don't think the album offers the durability I need for this type of special  item. I ended up returning to Amazon with no issue.	
1. 	love this crib, perfect fit in our small room. the color is a bit different from ikea birch venier. but quality of wood is greater ))) its a wood not an ikea presswood. very easy to assemble, it takes less than 40 min for me. no help needed.	
1. 	This is a great product, just know its a little hard to get out of the outlet, so be careful when pulling out.	
1. 	This thing is a life saver for me! I don't have a huge car to store a bunch of &#34;On The Go&#34; extras in the trunk and usually just carry my baby in a Ergo carrier for errands (I live in a big city, so everything is relatively within walking distance) but sometimes I have to be out for a couple of hours (aka Christmas Shopping!:) and can't keep my baby in his carrier for that long. that's where this little handy stroller comes into play!It is very lightweight, yet sturdy and is impressively compact compared to a standard stroller. There is a one handed fold and unfold mechanism (I found it stuck a little when it was brand new, so I would have to jiggle it a little but this disappeared after a couple of uses) and a deep basket underneath for storage.  The &#34;snap&#34; part of this stroller doesn't not mean the actual car seat is &#34;snapped&#34; into the frame, it has two straps the come from the bottom and buckle (there's the &#34;snap&#34;) together on top of the car seat to keep it in place. When installed correctly (meaning buckled tightly) it feel very secure and safe. I was also impressed with its smooth ride and oscillating front wheels. :)One thing to Be Aware of: It is a little difficult to access the contents of the basket when car seat is in the frame. But this is only true if everything you need has been stuffed underneath in one big diaper bag. I found a bunch of cute smaller zipper pouches to hold various things - one for diapers and wipes, one for formula and bottles, one for extra clothes, that way I only have to retrieve a smaller pouch instead to trying to wrestle the diaper bag out and THEN rummage through that to find what I need! It just makes life easier for me :)	
- 1	This work ok... I didn't like how it fits and it should be included in the gate. Overall this gate wasn't a good one for me.. I was much happier with the Summer Extra Tall Gate	
- 1	The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped. It has several noises and I thought one of them would be similar to white noise which is what I use at night to help my baby sleep. Not crazy about the sounds.	
1. 	This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money!	
- 1	Not much annoys me more than a product that is made UGLY by the lawyers.  Except having the marketing people sell me a product based on a fraudulent photo that doesn't show the warning text.  The entire lower 30% of this bed rail is printed with dark black legal warning text.  Due to the way the supports are pinned to the rail, there is no way to turn it around either.  (Which wouldn't help that much anyway, since the fabric is semi-transparent, so you can see the black text from either side.	
1. 	Snuggly soft, gives me peace of mind that she stays covered all night.  We've used this brand of sack since she got out of the arm-wrap swaddle type, and it was now time for the next size up.  It's as awesome as I expected.	
1. 	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.	
1. 	What a great idea! High quality, we have washed these and they held up well.We bought 5 of these, what a time saver! We tried to use the traditional blanket wrapping, but that didn't stay put.Absolutely love this product. We have given this product to many of my girlfriends for baby shower, along with a bottle of Vitaville Argan oil for the expecting mom.	
1. 	I just bought this bouncer, and I wished I had bought it weeks ago!  My baby doesn't like me to put her down, and when I do to try to get things done around the house, she cries, and it drives me nuts to just let her scream!  So I got this bouncer, and the first time I put her in it, I turned on the vibration and the back massage, and she fell asleep immediately!The things I love about it are:1) The vibration doesn't turn off--it stays on until you turn it off.2) The back massage is a really nice feature--it is very gentle, I put my hands on it to see what it felt like.  My baby loves having her back patted, so this soothes her instantly.3) It has a handle on the top, so if your baby falls asleep in it (which WILL happen!), then you can just pick it up and carry it to the nursery, your bedroom, etc.4) It has really nice high sides, so my newborn's head doesn't flop around--she can rest it up against the side and snooze away.5) The toys are removable from the velcro tabs and can be used to give your baby a massage.  My baby really likes the rattle toy, and I feel like I can really interact with her when I shake it.  And when the toys are hanging from the velcro tabs, she just loves batting at them!I only have a couple very minor gripes:1) I wish the toys hung down in front of her face.  There are only velcro loops for the toys on the sides, so the rattle just rests against the side of the bouncer and doesn't rattle unless I manually rattle it for her.2) The motor is sooooo quiet (which is great!), but it's easy to forget that you have it turned on, then you run down the batteries.My baby takes her afternoon nap in this every day.  As soon as she falls asleep, I can just carry it to the nursery where she takes a nice 2 hour nap uninterrupted!  Plus, the music is not annoying and loud, like on many of the other bouncers out there.  Definitely worth the money to buy this product!	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
- 1	Sure, these are nice and soft and highly attractive like all other Aden and Anais products.  They might even work for a moderate drooler.  But my son is a heavy drooler.  They ended up soaking through entirely (and through the entire front of the onesie) within an hour.  I'm not sure how that is even possible as he goes through maybe 3-4 green sprouts semi-waterproof bibs per day (or, 5 Luvable Friends bibs).  These bibs are the opposite of waterproof.  They soak up so much spit and help to transfer the wetness directly onto the shirt below, leaving baby's chest all wet - while the bib feels only half wet.  For the same cost or less, I wish I had gotten ten more Green Sprouts bibs instead...Really wish these worked, had high hopes for them but now I definitely will not be purchasing any more.	
1. 	Debated purchasing these based on some of the reviews, so just to clarify some of the negative comments -1.  Yes, it's a piece of terry cloth.  If you can design it yourself you should, otherwise it fits perfect and does exactly what is needed2.  It has slots on each side, so it goes in between the clips when you put the bjorn on.  Obviously, when you unlatch it, it might fall off, but the point is that it's removable and easy to just put on, so this is not that big of an inconvenience.3.  Easy to wash and baby still likes to suck on this part of the bjorn.  Bibs did not work, as it didn't settle at the same height and she didn't like the fabric as much.Highly recommend, wish I would have purchased sooner to prevent the initial damage to the carrier.	
- 1	Very nice design but they leaked more often than not. I did buy the large inserts and when prewashed they shrunk. Im not sure if that's the issue or I just need to buy the medium insert. Mom of a 3 month old	
- 1	We didn't like this baby carrier because it is too complicated to use, takes to long to learn how to use it and baby didn't feel comfortable in it. We tried figuring it our from videos of other people using it, advertising videos, instruction manual. In the beginning while learning you have to be very careful and likely you'll  need help from another person. It looks easy in the video, but it isn't. We are very quick learners and can figure things out easily. This baby carrier was difficult to figure out and use. After trying it our for about 1h we had to send it back because it simply doesn't work. Our newborn doesn't fee comfortable in it. Baby's head wasn't getting support needed. We highly recommend following baby carrier:  BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier. It is well priced, easy to use and you can hold a baby up to 40 lbs.	
- 1	Great.  So my wife and I purchased this ultra-convenient frame/stroller for convenience.  It worked great for about 8 weeks, then one of the front wheels bent to where we couldn't use it anymore.  AND, the front wheels would at times jam the stroller from opening up in the first place.  In concept, a frame/stroller like this is awesome, but Graco needs to redesign this and make it better and sturdier.  All in all, a major dissapointment.	
1. 	This bib is great for any toddler. We used the Bumkins starter bibs and the sleeved ones a bit when our daughter was first starting to eat, but now that she's 2.5 and really needs more lap/chair protection than shoulder and arm protection, this is an amazing product. We've used our bibs at every meal since she started on solids at 4 months old. They've held up super well through lots of wipedowns, hand washes, and even machine washes. The velcro on one is starting to come off, but can easily be sewn back on.I found this to be the best of all the Bumkins bibs we've got. It provides more coverage than the other bibs, as not all food lands conveniently in the pockets (which don't stick out a ton to catch more food).I've no hesitation in recommending it to other parents.	
- 1	After reading all the awesome reviews, I drove an hour to Buy Buy Baby to try out this stroller.  We are preparing for our first trip to Disney and I have been looking for something to replace our tandem stroller.  I have two children, DS5 (45 lbs, 42&#34;) and DD3 (33 lbs, 39&#34;).  I have been searching for something that would accommodate my older children on long days at Disney.  Here is a list of reasons why I did not buy this stroller:-My son was too tall for this stroller.  His head literally hit the top of this stroller.  It looked horribly uncomfortable.-When both of my kids were in this stroller, it was almost impossible to turn.  Pushing it around the store was a serious chore, and I'm used to pushing a tandem!-The &#34;huge sun shade&#34; came down so low, neither of my kids could see anything when it was pulled down.-The parent cupholders are fabric pockets on the back of the stroller.  There is no tray on the handle (I knew this going in).  I experimented using the cupholder with a McDonald's medium beverage I had with me- the top of the cup was stuck between the handle and the stroller.  It was very awkward and I didn't like it.- The storage basket did not impress me.  I put my purse in it and it took up one whole side.  It wouldn't have been a deal breaker, but I was expecting massive storage and it didn't deliver.-The mesh bags inside the seats intended for kid's drinks/snacks didn't seem like they could hold anything (like a cup) without pressing uncomfortably into my children's sides.  Again, not major and could be fixed with something aftermarket, but worth mentioning.I did not buy this stroller.  I was extremely disappointed because I thought I had found the solution, but it didn't work at all.  When I could barely push this stroller with both kids in it, I knew it wasn't &#34;the one&#34;.If you have the money, buy a city mini GT double.  I didn't want to spend that much on a stroller that won't get much use since my son is really too old to regularly use one.  I ended up finding the babytrend expedition double jogger and I think it's going to work perfectly for us.	
1. 	I really like this seat! I had the larger tub by the same company for my first but somehow it didn't make it in my last move. I'm glad! That thing was huge and I can't imagine where I'd put it. Tgis seens much more secure for newborns.  Im just going to use a laundry basket once he can sit up and skip the big tub. ( the laundry basket allows water to pass through but keeps toys in reach)	
1. 	Easy to clean, secure when the lid is on. Great for travel. Flow is also great - my son loves to drink his milk from this sippy cup. Only complaint - not super easy to clean the holes unless you have a special cleaner, but I dont think too much - just put it in the dishwasher :)	
1. 	Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.  I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.  I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.	
1. 	Bought these because my lactation consultant recommended... I am a D cup and these are definitely more comfortable than the standard ones that came with pump!	
1. 	When I had my preemie I was looking for something that would keep him comfortable and warm. He was very uncomfortable in the carseat even with the extra padding so my mom purchased this and it did wonders! He loves it so much even in the warm weather he needs the back cushion to make things extra comfy. Love how soft and how easy it is to wash and all the lovely colors. Definitely recommend this!	
- 1	These are fine if you clean one bottle a day. They just can't hold up to regular use. The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too. The bottle brush just simply wouldn't get the bottles clean. Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....	
1. 	This is the net that you imagined to have for your kids. I went thru three, but finally landed on this one for its size and depth to hold many stuffed animals. My kids are happy and I am happy they are not cluttering the house	
1. 	Very sturdy, vibrates, lays back or sits up and rocks. The bar has toys to keep them busy. Very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	They work alright, NO ONE will use your outlet, not even you. They are impodsible to remove. I had to use a pointed tool with one hand while squeezing three buttons simultaneously with the other hand. Sounds easy huh? Don't buy.	
1. 	I like many things about this high chair/booster seat. This is very easy to clean which is one of the biggest advantages. It is a very inexpensive and functional seat which takes up little space. Also it adjusts in many ways which accommodates a growing baby. Very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I have a Medela Swing at home and it does the job. However, when I returned to work my company has some Medela Symphonys available for employee use. I bought this kit and, wow, does the milk come out faster with the Symphony than the Swing! Sometimes I can get in and out of the Mother's room in 10 minutes if my milk let down is strong. If you have access to a Medela Swing, buy this kit and enjoy its efficiency!	
1. 	I love this crib but I'm just a little annoyed that it arrived cracked in the back. I didn't send it back but it really is an eyesore.	
- 1	At 5 mos 2 weeks old, my son has no real interest in these toys. They also don't fit around his wrists great (he's not a chubby baby) and they fall off his legs/feet because they are too big. They also have a very faint rattle sound, no squeak, no real crinkle sound either. Boring.	
1. 	I, like MANY other people, couldn't decide between the Diaper Champ, or the more popular Diaper Genie. Well, I was sold on not having to buy special bags, so the Diaper Champ it was! I'm soooo glad I went with it! I haven't had ANY odor problem, and if the handle gets stuck, that's an indication that it's full...so just change the bag!Don't be swayed by the negative reviews here. This is an excellent product. I've had mine for almost a year now...it sits right in between my sons crib and changing table. I change the bag about once every 5-6 days, and it couldn't be easier. I definitely recommend!	
- 1	It'd be great if it wasn't so easy to tear off. The Velcro straps that hold toys doesn't do a great job of holding toys either. My ten month old rips this off the rail and rips the toys off the Velcro. Snap buttons might work better.	
1. 	This is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  It does the job well.	
1. 	I really like this product a lot.  There are so many cute designs which it a plus.  It's really nice to have a cute product to carry with you so you can nurse anywhere without exposing yourself. I have two qualms one is that the little pockets on the bottoms corners could be bigger I have had a hard time trying to quickly put my nursing pad in it.  The other thing is that I wish the blanket part was bigger, if my son is too squirmy the blanket easily moves and I had some almost exposing moments, I can't imagine what it will be like when he is bigger since he is only 5 and a half weeks now.  But other than that it's a pretty great product.	
1. 	This wrap kept my kiddo nice and snuggled up so he could sleep through the night. Love the color and softness, great price. Velcro works well.	
1. 	I like the crib. My last crib was about 19 years ago. They have changed - a lot.It was much easier to assemble than I expected. When my son was nearing the point that I needed to lower the mattress, I was cringing at the thought. As it turned out, my grief was all for naught. Four screws out, then back. It was done.Sturdy it seems. Some thread-lock might have been a plus. It seems the sides get a little loose now and then. A simple screw driver fixes that, but you have to be alert to the potential for things getting too loose.Lastly, there are bite marks 3/4 of the way around the front and sides. Good thing these are the rails that will go away as the crib converts into a bed.I liked it so much I got a second one for my daughter who is still in a bassinet.	
- 1	This basket was definitely a dissapointment. It holds such a limited number of pieces and takes up so much space on the top rack of the dishwasher that I have ended up never using it. Since purchasing it I have acutally bought 2 Munchkin Dishwasher Baskets and use them constantly. All the Dr. Brown's pieces fit in them perfectly, and I can wash 10 bottles in almost the same amount of space I can wash 3 with this basket. I would not recommend this item at all. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1 is because it is well constructed and the plastic seems durable.	
- 1	I received this item at my baby shower (11/03) and we still have it. The doors keep falling off, it fills up fast.  My daughter who's into everything have learned how to open the top and remove all the diapers.  She know that the door doesn't close and falls apart, so she's always where the plastic bag is.  We had to put kidco locks on the top to keep the top from opening and another lock on the door, because when we would open it, it would come out of it's holders.  Sure this is a nice pail to keep after the diapers are gone.  But, when it has some stinky diapers in it, it stinks and so does her room.  I have to put air freshners inside it to help with the odor.Not a great pail, it doesn't cost cheap, but it's made cheap.	
- 1	My 18 month old son is ready to be potty trained. In fact he asks for the potty. However, the faucet extender is a pain. When he washes his hands he obviously plays with and touches the extender. The unfortunate thing is that this product is actually 2 pieces. So in effect he pulls the yellow part off and...tada, no more extender. The game becomes to throw the yellow part and have mommy go pick it up. There are faucet extenders out there that are 1 piece. Oh well, waste of money for me but at least now I know. Be warned. Child might find this a toy and this 2 piece extender will be useless.

- 1	The 3-in-1 idea is excellent, this little potty looks attractive and like a miniature normal toilet, but we have found this toilet pretty useless honestly.- You have to buy the specific Arm and Hammer wipes that fit in the slot, as well as the specific air freshener for the top inside of the lid, so that's extra money if you care about keeping up with those features. For starters, you shouldnt need an air freshener on this potty, seeing as it doesn't flush obviously and you would immediately be cleaning it out after your toddler finishes using it.- This has a lot of parts, something that my two year old son just wants to play with instead of use correctly.- There are grips on the bottom of this thing to prevent it from sliding when your child uses it. (That's the lime green rubber strip on the bottom front and back.) Everytime my son sat on this, it still scooted back, and we now use it as a stepping stool for him to get onto the big toilet, and it still moves when he is just sitting on the toilet and his toes are scraping it a little.- On the seat, there is a urine guard that comes up a little to keep pee from splashing. My son is an average size two year old, and this seat opening is just not big enough for him. His junk sits on top of the urine guard unless we reposition him and show him to move himself around...How we have still managed to get our money from this thing:- NOT buying the air freshener or refill wipes at all.- Giving the seat portion, which pops off for easy cleaning, to my mother-in-law for the time being because it snaps onto a regular toilet seat so they can fit on it for a transition stage to the big potty.- We use this entire toilet for nothing more than stepping stool for my son to get on and off of the potty, which like I said it does slide a little on our tile floor and makes me son go Whoa! Whoa Mommy! hah. Or also for him to wash his hands.- I am planning on reselling it once my son doesn't need the seat adjuster at my In-law's house anymore.In my opinion, I don't think these toddler potties are worth the money. Buy the adjusters for your toilets in your home, and a travel seat to throw in your diaper bag. This is an unnecessary baby item, as are so many these days.	
- 1	So, maybe I am doing something wrong but these are terrible.  We have only had them about a week and I hate them. I was really excited about these because I like the idea of the organic cotton, but they have leaked every single time.  My son gets a slight rash with microfiber so I was hoping cotton would fix that.  I will say that has been the only good thing about these, no rash.  But they do not absorb at all. He is 20 months old and cannot even wear these for an hour without a leak.  In the mornings I change him at 8 right before we leave to take my daughter to school, by the time we get home at 9 he has already leaked through these diapers.  I much prefer my Flips and Thirsties AIOs.  I am going to try the organic cotton flip inserts instead of these.  And they take FOREVER to dry.  I find that it helps if you flip the top layer of cotton around the diaper, but even then they easily take an hour and a half in the dryer.  I tried to put them on the drying rack and 24 hours later they felt like they had just come out of the washer.  They also stain very easily, which isn't a huge deal to me since no one sees it but still not very pretty. Save your money.	
1. 	My daughter would sit in this Exersaucer ALL DAY if I would let her!!  Especially now that she's crawling, it is so handy to occupy her when I need her to be safe for a few minutes.I should add, though, that I got this as a gift and I doubt I would actually have paid full price for it.	
- 1	This is not an item that I would purchase or give as a gift, simply because it is a little bit pricey for what you get. It is small, yet still takes up a fair amount of space. The most expensive part is purchasing the batteries. Batteries don't last long and with a fussy baby you don't want to run out of them! This might be a good gift for a relative who only has the baby for a small amount of time, but not for every day use. If this were less expensive, then maybe it would be more of a consideration for me, but for the cost you can purchase something with an ac adapter that is more useful.	
- 1	My two girls both loved this during bathtime, but unfortunately the water flow spout stopped working after barely two months!  I changed the batteries multiple times to make sure it wasn't a power issue....turns out it's just poor craftmanship of an overpriced toy.	
1. 	I highly recommend this product for several reasons:1) You do not have to buy bag refills.  You can use regular trash bags which cuts down on additional spending.  The trash bag is also very easy to take out and to put in.2) Traps in stinky diaper odor.  We have never had a problem with the smell escaping.3) Easy to use.  You just put the diaper into the slot and turn the handle, the plunger pushes the diaper into the bag.	
1. 	I really like this mobile. It is much better than the ones you can get that match your nursery set. My baby loves to watch this mobile turn and the hesitation helps him to focus and study the images. It is nice to have a choice of 2 different songs sets or white noise. I have had some trouble with the remote working, but I don't use it that much so it's not that big of a problem. Also it's nice to be able to change the toys on the mobile as your child gets older. It helps them from getting tired of it. Great product!!	
- 1	I had to string two of these together to be of any use. Sometimes the baby is strong enough to simply pull on them and they unsnap.They'd be much better if longer and with perhaps two snaps per closure.But they're cheap, so you can make do with these if you don't have time to make anything yourself.	
- 1	I used this product for the first time today and it is already packed to be returned. After one use following the instructions to clean the sterilizer prior to first use, the metal heating bottom part turned brown in two spots and created a strange burnt plastic smell. I saw on previous reviews that this tends to happen after a few months, but I didn't expect it on first use. Will stick to the microwave steam sterilizer which doesnt create a smell or a fire hazard. BEWARE!	
- 1	I ordered this bc of the 'airyness' of the product. I thought it looked sporty and would be great for walks bc it gets so hot in the summer. I was disappointed bc 1) the material is very stiff and was cutting into my baby's leg, 2) the fit was so much different from the babybjorn miracle organic. The organic gave so much more support. I usually walk about 40mins with the baby in the miracle organic but after 10 minutes with the airy I had to go home bc my back was hurting... I don't recommend this. I gave it a 2 star only bc the look is cool.	
1. 	This is the best &#34;teether&#34;gets in the tough areas and he doesn't realize he is brushing his teeth.I have a million teethers and toothbrushes. This is the ONE to buy	
- 1	I did hours of research on strollers... contemplating between the First Years Indigo and theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7 Wheels, Seagrass. I finally settled on the Indigo stroller because the price was right and the features I wanted were all there. I purchased the stroller and matchingThe First Years Via Infant Car Seat, Abstract O'scar seat. My son was born in the winter and I didn't use the Indigo stroller regularly until about two months ago. For the first week, the stroller was wonderful. What I had initially liked most about the stroller was that I could easily attach the matching First Years Via car seat. In addition, the ride was smooth, quiet, and comfy. The stroller was a breeze to fold. Then, about two weeks into regular use, I started to notice the quality of the stroller diminish quickly. Here is what started to happen:(1) SQUEAKY WHEELS. The wheels started squeaking terribly. I'd oil them and within a few days the stroller was squeaking again! I'd be in a store and people would turn there heads to see who had the annoyingly loud stroller.(2) VIA CAR SEAT WOULD GET CAUGHT. This is what really bothered me. I could live with the squeaking, but this I could not. My son is 6 months old and we still use the infant car seat regularly. One day the car seat began to get stuck inside the left car seat stroller locking mechanism. We thought maybe it was our son's weight causing the problem, so we took him out of the car seat and tried again. No luck! We still couldn't get the car seat out. After fidgeting with the stroller and car seat for nearly 30minutes, we finally got the car seat unstuck! To test things out to see whether or not it was the stroller or car seat causing the problem, we decided to attached seat that came with the stroller. That too would get stuck and we wrestled around with it until it miraculously came unstuck.Unfortunately, this stroller just had to be returned (thank goodness for Amazon's 365 day return policy on baby items). As much as I liked its other features, I couldn't put up with its defective qualities. Perhaps I received a defective stroller AND car seat but I find that really hard to believe.In addition to it being defective, here is what else I didn't like about the stroller.(1) BULKY. I knew when I purchased this stroller that it would be a standard size stroller but I still feel it was unnecessarily bulky. In order to fold it up, you have to remove the seat and then fold up the frame. Before I had my son I didn't think this was a big deal. Now I know better. I'd recommend you find a one piece fold-up stroller like the Bumbleride Flyer.(2) NO CUPHOLDERS. There are no cup holders for the child or adult using the stroller. At the time I purchased the stroller, there were also no accessories available that could attach to the stroller. I think this is the huge oversight.(3) SEAT HAD TO BE REMOVED. I really found it annoying that I had to remove the seat in order to collapse the stroller or switch the stroller from back to forward facing. As I said earlier, I initially thought this was a frivolous disadvantage but I now think otherwise. Other strollers that have the same back to forward facing option allow you to simply switch the direction of the handles without having to remove the seat. If First Years ever redesigns this stroller, they should include that option in their redesign.Even though I decided to return the stroller, there are still some qualities that I liked about this stroller. Here is what I liked:(1) BACK AND FORWARD FACING. I loved that I could face my son towards me when he was an infant and away from me when he gets old enough that he wanted to explore.(2) EASY TO COLLAPSE. Although the stroller was bulky, the stroller was still a breeze to collapse.(3) EUROPEAN STYLING. In addition the practicality, I was looking for a European styled stroller. This is the most affordable stroller that is also stylish.After I returned the First Years Indigo Stroller, I went ahead and purchased theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7 Wheels, Seagrass. I will update this review in the near future with a comparison of the two after I get more use of theBumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7 Wheels, Seagrass. If you can afford to splurge on the Bumbleride Flyer, I would highly recommend it.	
- 1	We bought this as a 'last stage' cup before moving on to the real thing for our pre-schooler. As other reviews mentioned, the cap does not hold back any liquid... ok, maybe it does a little (10%?), but not to any extent that will make a difference if the cup is dropped or your child is anything but extremely careful with it. I saw a review that advises to use two of the lids to hold back more liquid, and again, I have found that it makes very little difference (maybe another 5-10%), and it substantially increases the cleaning work and complexity of using the whole thing (not to mention you have to buy twice the number of cups). After a frustrating week, we moved on to a clear, plexiglass, 'real' glass (see Clarus Tritan Prism Rocks Tumbler -12 Oz on Amazon - they are awesome), and our child actually does a lot better with it than with the OXO cup. Will a spill happen someday? yes, in all likelihood, but again, the OXO cup doesn't protect against this. Bottom line: if a child is ready of the OXO cup, a child is ready for a real glass. OXO usually makes good products, but this isn't one of them.	
- 1	I bought 4 separate bassinet sheets by separate manufacturers all for 30in long mattresses. My advice to readers is to buy 32in instead. The 30in ones all had problems fitting on 30in mattresses (the mattress ends up curling because the fit is too tight). This one's one of the poorer fitting ones of those 4.  Your mileage may vary if you are using it in a pack and play because then you don't have the height.  I'm using changing table mattresses so they have 1-2 inches in height.	
- 1	I wanted to love this high chair so much. I loved the neutral color, the tray design, the stability, the removable pad, but I absolutely cannot recommend this product unless you are planning on using it for a tiny baby and upgrading it before your baby hits 1 year old. The weight recommendation on this is 20-50 pounds. My baby is 20 pounds. He is small and he was SQUASHED in this seat even with the tray on the setting that put it the furthest away from the seat, the tray smushed the belt portion into his stomach. There was just no room in it at all. Luckily, Amazon being the amazing vendor they are, let me return the item with no trouble at all. I've been a loyal Amazon customer for 7 or so years, and this was actually the first return I've ever made. That definitely says something. There was no way I was keeping this.	
1. 	We were a die hard Avent family becasue of our daughter tummy troubles.  But they just didn't seem to be working for her.  They were great in reducing air intake, but she just seemed to leak an awful lot with them.  She would be covered by the time she was done and that was with the number 1 nipples.  Plus for some reason my husband and mother has trouble with the bottle themselves leaking.  So I started to research and try other bottles.We hated the liner in the nursers, she hated Dr. Brown's, and the paln jane bottles allowed her to take in too much air.  So we were stuck on Avent until last week.  My cousin had a little girl and we traded a bottle to try the other guys out.Well, we steralized what we had and traded!  Her daughter does great on the Avent and doesn't leak....our daughter does great with the Vent Aire and does not leak.  I guess it just depends on teh child.  But, these are great.  She manges to keep it all in her mouth and she doesn't fill up with air.  They are also more afforable than the Avent.Anotehr plus is that she is 3 months now and very much wants to hold her own bottle and with these, she is almost there.  She can wrap her hands around them and pull her feet up for extra support and just about hond them herself.  This feat makes her very happy and the lack of leaks and tummy aches make us very happy.	
- 1	Should have read all the reviews before i ordered this OXO brush.Cleaning a bottle also means you are gonna take a soap shower :)The bristles are very soft and pulling the brush out of the bottle, is really a mess.But: It does clean the bottles very nice though. LOL.The nipple-cleaner = useless. This plastic nub is not cleaning anything. I ended up, not using it at all, after 2 tries.Poor execution OXO.I really like the color thought - I ordered the green. The brush-holder works pretty good as well. It's sturdy enough and is not falling over with the brush sitting in it. At least something positive with this brush.My opinion: Waste of money. My 1-Dollar-Brush gets the same job done and it actually has a nipple-brush which works. LOL.	
- 1	After putting this together we found that the motor was malfunctioning. There was only one speed - fast, and when it was plugged in the motor made a loud unpleasant noise.We 'attempted' to disassemble it to return it but found that the base was impossible to break apart, and so it was impossible to get it back into the original packaging. Altogether, this product is poorly designed and I wouldn't trust it with my baby. Buyer beware!	
1. 	I was very very leery of jumpers.  Terrified infact.  However, my son was jumping so much in his saucer that I figured I'd give it a go.  I am so happy I did.  It really does seem very well constructed and my son LOVES it! He is so very funny in it.  He is eight months old and I wish I had tried it sooner. He actually sleeps better since we bought it.I still have to say I don't trust it and I am supervising very closely when he is in it.  I am just scared of the thing coming down on top of him because it is so heavy.  I practically hung on it myself with full body weight though and it didn't budge, so I do think it is safe.  I do have an old victorian with very big doorway molding though, so I don't know about newer homes with small molding.	
1. 	We have used this since the birth of our baby and have never had a big problem with it. The sling for a newborn worked well for us, the only thing I didn't like was the second stage, where you remove the clips for the bottom of the sling and just let it sit in the water. It seems like they could have designed this better. I never had a problem with the bump, as when I started using the second stage I would put baby's bottom behind the bump where it should be and shifted the headrest up a but. Once baby could sit up I had no problems at all. My child is now 15 months and still fits in the tub. The toys that come with the tub are also very nice. Our favorites are the pelican and the starfish.	
1. 	We have two of these things (one in F150 and one in Mitsubishi Galant). We never take them out and just swap the baby car seat into the base of whichever car we're driving (with baby). My only concern is it does &#34;press&#34; quite hard into the seats with the plastic corners and ultimately could lead to depressions in the seat long term. However, it is quite well designed and once you figure out how to adjust it (no red should show!!!) then you set it and forget it. The carseat pops down really easily and you can audibly hear the &#34;click&#34; of the lock/latch. It's quite forgiving and easy for my (5' 7&#34; tall) to get even into the tall truck. I usually just swing the car seat close and wiggle until it's in place. Would purchase again in a heartbeat...I'd recommend one for every vehicle, although we have swapped them into other vehicles (Toyota Venza) on the fly (less than 2 minutes) when I got a flat tire and grandparents picked us up on interstate...thank God these change out quickly as not a safe location for swapping. I do feel they're very secure, but at first it's supprising how the front end appears it could &#34;bounce&#34; up and down quickly with know restraint in the front.	
- 1	I read the reviews on this item before I bought it so I knew it would be a 50/50 chance I would either like it or hate it.  I can't get it to stick on our tub walls.  Have tried a few things to help them stick with no luck.  It was inexpensive so glad I didn't spend any more than what I did on it.	
1. 	My daughter loves this mobile.  She's still in the bassinet, but in the middle of the night or just when she's cranky, I can put her in the crib, turn on the mobile, and she stops crying.  She is just so enticed by winnie the pooh and all the characters.  She really enjoys herself!Great product!	
- 1	First off, DO NOT use this seat in booster mode. It does not position the seat belt in the correct way and is actually dangerous to use.Aside from that, this seat is notorious in child safety circles for being very difficult to install securely, and even more difficult to get the correct incline level.It will be a struggle every time you need to move it, and even then you may not get it quite in the right spot.There are many, many different seats out there at this price point that are much easier to use correctly.I am giving it two stars only because *if* you can get it installed correctly, it will contain your child in an accident as long as you are in harnessed mode. Of course, that should be true of any seat, and almost all will be easier to install correctly than this beast!	
- 1	Bought these for davinci 50 coil mini crib mattress.  These did not fit well with their &#34;deep pockets&#34;.  I washed in cold on gentle cycle in front loader & seams were already coming out. Had they at least held up during the wash I would definitely have given more stars and maybe even recommend them.  Please don't waste your money on these just because of the cute print.	
- 1	I was looking for a bottle warmer with auto shutoff and also an alarm as with new baby you get busy and when baby is crying you don't always hear well.  My son used an Avent and it had no auto shutoff nor timer.  We had to use the stove timer and we left it on many times with no shutoff.  Kozzi was really being advertised and recommended as wonderful but the Kozzi with the auto shutoff worked but the bottle was never warm.  You would have to do it over and over to finally get it warm.  I agree it had auto shutoff but the milk was not warm.  The cost was very high and I found one with a timer and a auto shutoff and it works super and it cost me 1/3 to 1/2 what the Kozzi did. I was very disappointed.	
1. 	I am a professional nanny and have been so for several years. I have worked for many familes and most of them have had newborns. I have taken care of only children, twins and triplets and also worked as a department manager at a Babies R Us store in the past. Given all of my work experience, I have had many opportunities to use most of the baby equipment on the market today. Of all of the items available, I LOVE the Fisher Price Cradle Swings the best. They has saved me so many times when one baby needs me and another begins to cry. One of the best things I have found is that the side to side motion is great for babies with reflux. A child with reflux should never be left to swing back and forth because that motion will almost always bring up his/her last meal. The side to side motion is much more gentle for babies with these problems. Also, one child I cared for has a cleft palate and anytime she brought up even a little formula it would fill up her nostrils, causing a huge issue with her breathing. In order for her airways to stay open, we had to do anything possible to prevent her from spitting up. Going back and forth in a swing was never an option so I am so greatful that her parents agreed to buy a cradle swing when I recommended it. She used it constantly for her first 14 months. Some people feel that the swing moves too fast for small babies and i agree. However, this problem is always remedied by laying a light blanket over the babies feet and allowing one side to hang over the edge by about a foot, creating a lag in the swing. This really helps to slow the swing down until the baby has enough body weight to keep it slow. One thing I caution all parents on is to never leave your baby unattended in it if he/she shows any signs of rolling over. I have never seen a baby fall out of a cradle swing but with the papasan swing, it is possible for them to hang over the edge a bit and get stuck in that position once they are strong enough to partially roll over.	
1. 	She finds it quite comfortable and falls asleep within 10 minutes of me putting her in it when she is tired. It is very easy to put in your car (especially if you have a latch system) and the straps are pretty easy to adjust as well. If I had to say one bad thing about the seat is that sometimes I find it a little difficult to snap the bottom part of the belt into the position between her feet. It's a little low down and you really have to push the buckle down into it to hear the click. Otherwise, the seat was well worth the money (and it's also rated very high on safety).	
1. 	Got this swaddle for my 2 month old who breaks out of swaddles easily. This is the best swaddle and would recommend to any mom! Got our baby sleeping through the night!	
1. 	I got this little sweet sheep as a gift for my son.  From just a few weeks of age, he falls asleep to the soothing sounds. He gets calm from it so easily.  The best part is the batteries last a very long time and the sounds play very long.  The only complaint is that you have to turn the whole thing off to stop the sound, rather than being able to push a start/stop button.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	My 18 month old discovered how to unlock and open the slidding glass door and make her way to the backyard.  This product works like a charm.  You just place on the stationary part of the door and the slidding door is stopped when attemted to be opened.  Even with my adult force I can't get the door open!  We remove it a couple of times a day to let the dogs in/out and it still works.  It is a bit expensive but the alternatives aren't much better and you will have to drill into the door frame.	
1. 	This sleepsack was a gift for a little guy.  The product was extremely well-made, and the color was an exact match to the advertisement.  Very nice item.	
- 1	After reading all the reviews, I decided to try the product anyway. The sound of the beep doesn't bother me at all, but then again my bedroom is fairly removed from the kitchen. The problem I have with this product is that it really overheats the bottle! Even though I followed the guidelines and instructions, the milk was always waaay too hot, and I ended up needing to cool it on ice.  In other words, it would have taken just as much time to just float the bottle in a thermos of hot water. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.	
1. 	Exactly as described, it is a great value! Beautiful and white...We can;t wait for our little one to get here	
1. 	These trays are great.  I've used them many times and haven't had any issues described in other reviews.  First, I've washed these on the top rack of the dishwasher and I haven't had any issues with the lids not fitting.  Second, I haven't had any issues with the trays being stained and I've used them for carrots (which seem to stain everything else).  My only complaint is that it is fairly hard to get the frozen food squares out of the tray, although running warm water on the bottom of the tray did help.  I do wish these trays were a little more pliable, these trays are very firm/stiff and hard to twist.Overall, I would recommend these trays.  They are easy to stack and fit perfectly in the freezer.	
- 1	Every time my daughter has a bath she plays with this toy. Its easy for her to turn on and off and sticks very well to the tub.3 months later and about 5-10 uses the thing will not turn on at all. Sucks. Tried new batteries and all. I took the whole thing apart too. its like the motor is shot. too bad i wasted my money on this this was an original and fun toy while it lasted.	
1. 	and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion. I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck, and that is only because of the gas issue. They are super easy to break down and clean. And yes, I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first. However, after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle, I haven't had the problems since.	
- 1	I used these spoons for my son's first solid foods. Because the first foods are more liquid than solid, these spoons were so shallow they hardly held anything on it before it hit the baby's mouth.These won't last as long because they hold less food per spoonful than other deeper spoons.The lip is SO soft and rounded that when you use the spoon to catch dribble on the baby's chin/face, it actually just smears it or pushes it around rather than scooping it back up.(Buy the multicolored Munchkin spoons which are just as soft, will wipe food off the baby's face better, and hold more, thus lasting longer for when your child starts eating more volume and chunkier foods)	
1. 	I have had 3 children, all formula fed from birth, and we only used this brand with the 3rd child - mainly because I could not find the brand I used previously (Canon Babysafe).Yes, they are more expensive, but if you think how many times you use them and wash them ... you certainly get your money's worth.  I only have 6 and this suits us perfectly.I have not had any trouble with leaks and find they seal quite well for outings when they are in my nappy bag.My baby took the teat from birth with no problems.  But I know some mother's who had babies that just wouldn't take this teat and they had to switch brands.  I guess with everything to do with babies it's a case of trial and error to find what suits you and your baby.What I like about the bottles is that the wide opening makes them extremely easy to wash and easy to put formula in.  I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.	
1. 	Covers work with other playtex sippy cups. great size and my daughter loves holding the handles by herself. Also easy to clean. We handwash the plug inserts so they won't break down as easily (in the dishwasher) or get lost.	
1. 	My 3 month old daughter absolutely loves this mobile.  At first I thought it was a bit crazy looking and it didn't quite go well with our theme but overall, I'm so happy we registered for this.  The music, colors and movement keeps her attention.  I have to warn, if you're looking for a mobile that will put your baby to sleep, this isn't the one for you.  It's too stimulating for rest.  We also have the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in her crib and use that in the evening to soothe her to sleep.	
- 1	Not sure, why its called safe sippy.Using it as a straw-cup it leaks everywhere. Horrible. Have not tried the sippy-option. Not using it anymore, because its a mess, if my 14 month drops it on the floor.Waste of money.Neat idea, poor execution.	
- 1	i like the idea of this - something soft and cushy for baby.  but it absorbs water, so after taking baby out&#8230;it weighs about 30 lbs. if you hung it on your shower head to dry&#8230;it would take the shower head down. so, i left it lying in the tub&#8230;and then it became mildewy.  i ended up throwing it away and getting the plastic version. disappointed.	
1. 	The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.	
1. 	It is nice to have for a good night sleep not just for kids, but adults. Makes room cozy and really makes you to go to sleep.The only wish for it is if stars would move.	
1. 	I wish I had this when my first born was in the infant carrier!this stroller is so light weight & easy to handle.  I bought it when my son was born & used it daily!The large basket under the seat is pretty easy to reach.. compared to my regular metrolite stroller.I wish Graco could keep the great features of this frame (easy to open & close & easy access to basket & great stearing, not to mention light weight) in other model strollers!	
1. 	The blue is a good color. Looks more expensive than it is. Stores lots of toys and works as a bench too. Doesn't slam on baby's fingers.	
- 1	I have used at least 5 diaper genie systems from all editions. One thing that I find surprising is constant complaints that bags are expensive and passionate defenders of this product who justify 200$ or more per year spending with claims this REALLY DOES NOT SMELL.  Well, it does not- to you. After using this for 2 weeks you will get used to the smell, well, most of people will, and it won't smell.  After using genie in 5 different homes, in the one I was on a daily basis, as full time nanny, this did not smell. In homes where I was only as occasional nanny or weekend help, this thing stunk badly for few weeks and after I got used to it, it stopped smelling...I worked as preschool teacher for 2 years olds class and our big trash can did not smell bad to me, but after quitting that job and returning later to visit, I almost throw up after visiting bathroom were that can was. And we bagged all the diapers.And now about those complaints about the price. Yes, this is expensive. Like I said, you will spend about 200$ if you have 2 kids in diapers. Refills will last you 3 weeks tops. Claim that 270 can fit in one refill is only applicable if you use premie size of diapers but it cannot be any cheaper in my opinion. Look at average prices of brand name trash bags. Yes, brand name because genie bags are also brand name. They are about 4-5$ for 25 bags that can fit 33 galons garbage cans. Cans that most families use with more then one kid. So trash bags are not cheap. I know people are complaining about the refill cost, but many compare cost of this refill with Target brand trash bags. And you cannot compare those two. This is not a budget product.So in the end, you can buy this, you can use it with you own generic trash bags, there are instructions online for that. That is the only way I see it working, and yes smell won't go away, for that you have to take the diaper outside.	
- 1	Although the monitor  is a bit bulky (if you have plans of clipping it to your clothes where you are out and about in your own house), it worked well the first six months. Then, all of a sudden, no more picture, just static. I have never been able to figure out what the heck happened and why. I certainly would not purchase any of their electonic products again.	
- 1	I am really not happy with this pump.Its super hard to clean, very uncomfy to use and it molded...	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of traditional Playtex sippy cups. They truly are the gold standard. They last forever, don't leak, and are cute as well. This new line that they came out with is just terrible. After 2 washings they leak all over the place. I don't know whether it's the new valves or the cup lids themselves, but they are completely useless. I'm stalking other sites to find the originals so I can stock up because these new ones are a disaster.	
- 1	Super flimsy and rip easily. I ended up having a mess in my cloth diapers anyways so these were completely pointless. My daughter got a major diaper rash as well.	
- 1	First of all, car seat is pretty bad. No adjusting system means I have to use towels to get it right. It also feels kind of cheap. I went out and bought a new car seat two weeks after receiving this one.The stroller is better, it runs smoothly and feels allright. The lower basket is great and overall it is a good product. Downfall is that it almost doesn't fold and takes up all my trunk! Overall, I would not recommend this combo.	
1. 	My son loved this as soon as he saw it. It was easy to put together and looks nice. He feels likes such a big boy in this bed.	
- 1	this product did not meet my expectations, the tie strings were too short and overall it was a bad design for my crib. i found a design to make my own on pintrest after i purchased this.  i would suggest buying some fabric and making your own.	
1. 	I bought this for my father-in-law who watches my son during the day. He's been pretty happy with it. As with other brands, it would be nice if it were a bit longer. Most changing pads are meant for smaller children. My little guy is just now 2 and is 36.5&#34; tall, so his head and body won't fit on this at once.	
1. 	This spounge is an amazing value for the price.  It is hearty and holds up wash after wash, it is also soft and cushy and perfect for baby or toddler to lean back on.  A must have!	
1. 	Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.	
1. 	This is a lot more expensive at the store, is a pure white which the rest are a dirty off white	
1. 	These drop in liners are worth every penny.  With my twins, the daycare goes through lots of bottles each day.  These are so easy to &#34;load&#34; into the bottles and have never fallen out, burst, leaked, etc.	
1. 	use it a lot for my 1 year old's meals.  I actually throw the entire seat in the washing machine and wash it on the hottest water I can and even throw bleach in there and it still looks great (the colors, including the strap have all stayed at 100%, no fading or bleaching).  I actually don't use the white top tray or the green part; I use the blue one so often I have to take it off and clean it anyway by hand after every meal.  I throw that part in the dishwasher and so far so good (about six months of at least once a day super hot water).  Everyone told me to get one you could put into a chair so it wouldn't take up a lot of space like a fancy one and they were right.	
1. 	No baby wants a cold wipe to their bottom!  This warmer has been plugged in and used for over a year now and it is still awesome.  Just make sure you check the sponge filter on the bottom and get wet when necessary and this will be you and your baby's best friend!  I buy these for all new moms!	
- 1	If I had written this review when I bought the cup 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, my baby is 14 months old. We try and give her a regular cup as much as we can. Sometimes, though, we need to give her a drink in a cup that won't spill - and these are perfect for that. The problem now is that she has teeth and she bites on the end of the spout. We do our best to discourage this, but it only takes a second and POOF - she's bitten a huge hole in the end. (Check out the pictures of this listing - someone posted an image of EXACTLY what happens when the child bites off the end.) I've started to get worried about giving her the cup, as I found her chewing on a piece of silicone she got off of the end. It wasn't enough that she would have choked, but still not good for her. Thus, I've had to buy replacement nipples ALL THE TIME. I bought 5 of these cups in different styles and I am about to go buy replacement spout #6 & #7. Bottom line: this is a great cup for a transition from the bottle. But, once your baby has teeth, you'll be buying replacement spouts until the cows come home or you switch to a cup with a hard spout.	
1. 	The only way we could get baby to stop crying and sleep at night was to bring him to bed with us (which worried us some, but definitely made baby happy).  We had tried swaddling with other blankets, and he ALWAYS worked his arms out within several minutes and then the crying would start again.  The Miracle Blanket is great--since we got it, he's been sleeping in his pack-and-play every night rather than with us. Occasionally, he does manage to get his arms out, but re-wrapping him usually settles him down quickly.  Other reviewers have mentioned that an especially big/long newborn will outgrow the foot pouch sooner, and I think that will be a problem for us, but it is worth it.  We're big fans.FYI--it takes awhile to dry completely in the dryer (knit fabric + lots of flaps that get balled up), so don't wait until right before bedtime to wash/dry it, especially if you rely on it!	
- 1	I got this pump, because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night. At first the pump worked great... getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk.Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher, so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me).Then, my milk supply started to diminish, due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing, but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement. I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively, with no bottles, to stimulate my milk supply back, but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever.So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust, what a waist of $50.00.	
- 1	I needed to shade back windows of my sedan to protect my newborn from direct sun rays. I bought this particular product based on positive reviews on Amazon and trust in Britax brand name (I own and love their car seat and stroller).Only positive is it sticks well to the window.It does not block the sun. It looks like a thin black mesh on the window that does nothing, doesn't even reduce the intensity of the sun rays. You can see the shade of this screen when sun light falls on it, but if u put your hand in that shade you can feel the sun just the same. I still hold the blanket to the window to shade the car seat.	
- 1	After it being not used as a pacifier just left thrown on the floor of the play gym, I decided to take a cloth and clean it, well that was no good it's not of good quality the plush toy has  alot of fuzzy balls and looks old. This is not worth $20 no matter what the seller says to justify the price of $10 shipping and handling. Not worth it, go buy a regular soothie and a plush toy animal for less.	
- 1	I got this bedding a few weeks ago from my registry. I just got the crib all assembled so I put the bedding in the wash on gentle (as directed) with mild baby soap .Well, the blanket tore in 4 places.... I'm 34 weeks pregnant, so I haven't even used the set and it's falling apart. Plus the skirt is not wide enough to cover the whole rail below so there are big gaps on both sides. I'd return it, but I already washed it. Very disappointed.	
1. 	We used this blanket from day one in the hospital, it was so much easier to swaddle our little one in this rather than the rougher flannel blankets the hospital gives you.  We had a hard time swaddling with the standard hospital blanket but this one is the perfect size.  Baby was swaddled and soothed in no time.  It is flannel, so can be a little warm for the warmer spring/summer weather.  We used this blanket in conjunction with Dr. Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block video and have had great success.  It has already been washed several times and definitely holds up!  We loved it so much that we ordered a second one.	
- 1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.	
- 1	My 3 year old when sitting in the rear sticks his feet in the wheel. Not only does it put the stroller to a hault, his foot also can roll with the wheel and get jammed in the back, twisting his foot ankle and leg.The buckles are super cheap too. If you pull on them they come undone. My 10m old was able to pull the buckle apart in the front seat, as could my 3 year old (37 months old) with the back harness buckles too.the basket is large, ya... in length but its VERY shallow. Your not fitting too much in there.Steering is ok, but because its the way it is, it doesnt turn on a dime nor can it be used ever 1 handedly. I never drove over grass with it, once his foot kept getting stuck i decided to never use it again.It looks nice, bright fun colors, looks appealing by style, and folds up nicely, but its not practical.	
- 1	It works for what we need it for and it is nice looking.  However our baby is tall (like my husband) and i'm short...about 5'1.  When i wear the carrier with baby in it her legs hit into mine when i walk.  She sits too low in the carrier.  Its not a great fit for short women.	
- 1	Those mittens are not elastic, and it is a hassle to put on a newborn's hands because it won't expend. You just have to try hard and put baby's hand in it, which makes it difficult and painful to our fingers while trying to make it fit.	
1. 	I will tell you that this is the second night my 2 year old son is sleeping on it but so far we love it! Easy to put together, it only took my dad and my hubby 20 minutes.. VERY sturdy, my dad laid on it after it was together and it didn't move or bend at all and he probably weighs 230lbs but it's light weight and easy to move. I like that about it. It's got a nice amount of space on the inside, my son wants me to lay by him for a little bit at bed time and it fits both of us ok and I'm 5'8 and 8 months pregnant.lol The wood is very nice and I love the cherry finish. My son loves his new big boy bed and even likes to lay in it to just watch a movie. I'm very happy and would recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	This gate is awesome because it is big enough to span the space I needed it to fit in.  The gate seems a little flimsy, but, one month in, it seems to be holding up ok.  I anchored the gate to the wall with heavy duty dry wall plastic screw anchors.  I'm not sure how long this will hold up for, but for now it's a life saver.	
1. 	It was hard to find a reasonably priced gate that's pressure mounted with a door that would also fit our wide hallway. This was just what we needed. It was easy to set up and has withstood our 1 year old son shaking it and hanging on it. He has gotten his arm/legs stuck in it but he does that in his crib too so I would not mark that as something wrong with the gate. Our 5 year old cannot get this open either so it works for older kids as well.	
1. 	I bought this when my daughter got back from the hospital from the NICU. I realized I didn't have a bottle warmer yet and I needed something fast and efficient because having to babysit a bottle on the stove with a screaming baby was getting OLD. You just put the amount of water you need for your bottle, the less ounces in the bottle the less water the less water you'll need, and the more ounces in the bottle the more water you'll need. I find that with my baby the perfect temperature for 4 oz. is at the 7 mark. You just have to plug it in, put the water into the bottle warmer and press the button. It takes 2 minutes from the time you press the button until the light shuts off then leave it there for about 30 seconds and your baby's bottle is ready. I still test the bottle on my wrist every time and it's remained consistent from the get go. Get a great bottle warmer without breaking the bank. It's convenient to travel with and small and compact to leave on the counter all the time. I would recommend getting this as a baby gift or putting it on a registry. Why pay $80+ on a bottle warmer when this gets the job done for a very reasonable price? Great for new mom's on a budget!	
1. 	This brush is amazing. I use it on any bottle, baby or water, that it is long enough for ( including 27oz water bottles). Durable.I keep toying with buying a second for travel ( for fear of being without it if it lost).  Would buy again.	
1. 	This nursing cover works but baby seems to get very warm underneath it.  Granted it is summer now, so in the colder months it will probably work much better.	
- 1	This mattress was way too firm.  My baby would never sleep on it.  It was more firm than the horrible pad the pack n play comes with (we have the standard Graco version).  Waste of money.	
- 1	The monitor will go out of range if I go to the opposite end of the house or in the basement & I won't be able to hear the baby. In addition, it has a short battery life & must be charged every fee days with minimal use.	
1. 	We have several brands of bibs and even though they are a bit more expensive these bibs have lasted a year and still look brand new. More importantly they have fit through a year of growing cycles and still cover the majority of spills and drops at every feeding. Great buy!	
1. 	I love this gate!  It can be mounted into the wood or used held by pressure.  We use ours w/the pressure and it even stays in place with the door closed!  it's very easy to use and durable.  The cat hasn't tried to jump it & can't get thru it unless it's open and the 80lb dog hasn't tried to jump it either (which was very questionable).  I definitely recommend this gate!	
- 1	These spoons suck. The cheap walmart spoons are even better..food doesn't stay on the spoon. They aren't soft like I thought..hate them.	
1. 	Great to have on the go. Kind of a strong baby powder odor but that wears off. They are nice to have at someone's house so you can bring your diaper away with you.	
1. 	After three months of filing my baby's nails due to one cut of the skin that had me swearing I would file until she was 18, I broke down and ordered these.  I am so glad I did.  It took me a while to get comfortable putting scissors near her tiny fingers, but they really are quite safe and once I got the hang of it, I can even do it with her moving around now.  It helps if I make some funny sound while doing it to keep her slightly occupied.  But, I am very glad I got these!	
1. 	While my first son almost never spit up, my second spits up ALL the time. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still a good bit. We've only been using these a few weeks, but he hasn't spit up near as much. It may be because he's getting older and eating more baby food and all, but I'll gladly give credit to the bottles!I'm going to point out a few things about these bottles that we've observed and you can decide whether that part is positive or negative.-After using straight bottles, these do take a bit of getting used to. Since the top is curved, it's easier to spill the formula if you don't turn it with the lower side towards you when pouring it in.-The small bottle is 6 ounces as opposed to 5 ounces on all the other bottles we've used. At first, I was really excited about this, but you still can't make a 6 ounce bottle using powdered formula. There's not enuogh room to mix it up. So, you can still only use it as a 4 ounce bottle IF using powdered formula. There's plenty of room if you're using liquid or breast milk for 6 ounces. (This set only has the 9 ounce bottles, though).-There's 6 pieces to put together for each bottle. Two pieces go together at the bottom, and 3 at the top. I'll admit sometimes it gets to be a pain with so many peices, but most bottles these days have a lot of pieces.-There's different colors, so there's a variety. I like that the colors are gender neutral. When you're putting the bottles together it does take a little more time trying to match up the tops and bottoms according to color, but that part isn't absolutely necessary. I like them to match, though.-The slow nipple is VERY slow! The fast nipple is VERY fast. I would prefer and in between. If you're using breast milk, the slow nipple is perfect. If you put cereal in the bottle, the fast nipple is perfect for that. It's fast enough that you don't have to widen the hole or anything. (I think this set only comes with fast nipples).Overall, we are VERY pleased with them! Even my husband is happy with them. :)	
1. 	My son loves playing with balls and this is just perfect. We stuck it to the patio window and he just loves it!	
1. 	Perfect for our bar height table and chairs	
1. 	I am not a carrier Mommy but when I travel this carrier has saved us. I used it for my 19 month old until just recently! I love that the baby can face both ways and that the head rest goes up and down This carrier is hands down my favorite and the only one I will recommend.I love how the top snaps together and how many adjustable parts there are. Before my baby was walking this was my go-to carrier.I highly recommend - it is convenient to use. Simple to understand, secure and there is no way you can snap baby's delicate skin. The back has an 'x' configuration that takes pressure off of any one specific area. It kept my back from hurting while running through airports. And baby and I got to bond during the experience. I always knew where she was. Even my husband has worn this - very easy to adjust back and forth.If you are looking for a baby carrier, regardless of baby's age I recommend this one. It cradles small babies and lightens the load of larger ones.	
1. 	For a Training pad these are super easy to use, wash and make acceptable with your kid. Have 5 of them now as we braved no diapers at night early on.	
- 1	I read so many good reviews about this pillow I totally ignored the bad some. There you go , my baby was scratched so bad from this pillow I doubt he will ever want to use it. His neck is all red, looks like burned. I really have to think of a way to removes the scratchy part, but till his neck gets better I'll have to put it aside. Be careful with this pillow, he was on it for less than 20 min and the damage is done. I just hope it will correct the flat spot.	
- 1	I bought this for bottles after reading all the positive reviews, but in my experience, nothing stays on it.  The bottles have to be jammed on and they continuously fall off side ways or pop off on top.  I have tried resting everything on top, but that is just as likely to fall.  Usually we just rest things on the counter in front because they are less likely to fall over.  While more attractive on the counter than a traditional bottle rack, I find this almost useless.	
1. 	The cotton Halo is perfect for warm summer nights. I've washed it (cold water) and dried it (very hot air) dozens of times, no problems whatsoever :)	
1. 	i have bought so many different sippy cups looking for the magical one i can use to replace my daughters bottles. and these seem to be her favorite! like others have said, they will leak when on the side or upside down. but i think for the price, its a small issue. we've lost a few here and there, but since they are so cheap i really dont mind. she learned how to use these in about a day and she is 11 months old.	
- 1	My 1 year old has been using this cup for a few months now and I'm not terribly impressed.  The fact that it has a straw makes it easier for him to drink out of, but the cup has not withstood the test of time.  The picture is peeling and a piece of the top has broken off. I will admit that my toddler has dropped it a few times and this has probably contributed to it's early failure.  Honestly, I don't know too many toddlers who don't drop things. Overall a good idea, but needs to be a bit sturdier if it's to be used for this particular age group.	
1. 	My chunky little one enjoyed hers for a while. It is beautiful, soft and looks unbelievably comfortable. (I just wish they made tem in my size.) They work lovely to sooth newborns and even has a soft blanket and toy.	
- 1	So yes, the car does roll well, great rubber grips on the tires.  And yes, it is a great size and cute.  However, I was so disappointed because rarely will a ball pop, if ever.  The &#34;Pop&#34; should be taken out of the title as I find it to be a push car that happens to contain little balls.	
1. 	A lot easier to use than some of those fancy diaper pails. Also, you can use any generic bags for them.  I felt that it kept the smell contained just as well as a much more expensive diaper pail that we had used for my older child.	
1. 	Love this booster seat. We have tried several different seats and this by far has been the best. Straps perfectly to every seat we have used it on, has removable back, 2 trays, height adjutment, adjustable straps, 3pt harness, folds comatc for travel or storage and also seems to be the most comfy to sit in for our 2 boys. We will also be using this same seat for our 3rd boy when the time comes. Worth every penny!	
1. 	These are the exact same ones that came with our Medela breast pump. It's nice to have a spare set!	
1. 	My daughter is teething and drools A LOT. She easily goes through 2-3 bibs a day, and so we bought 2 of these packs.  They do a good job of absorbing the drool and protecting her clothes (there's a thin layer of plastic between two layers of terry). If you are looking for a more &#34;plush&#34; thick and absorbent bib -- this is not it.  But this does the job without feeling weighty on baby.  I also like that the design is simple - solid color so it can really be worn with anything and won't get &#34;boring.&#34;Why 4 stars and not 5?  It's not the best quality -- a couple have separated at the seams, revealing the inner plastic.Happy, otherwise, and would recommend.	
- 1	Our Graco stroller is a regular stroller, nothing fancy. This netting is nowhere even close of big enough to fit it.	
- 1	Upon opening, these had an incredibly awful, &#34;chemically&#34; smell.  After a couple of uses, one of them also broke in half.  Much prefer the Ikea pinch guards.	
- 1	Died almost immediately after I put it into the Snuza Go. I'm having the hardest time finding a battery that will last in the Snuza--and if a Snuza battery won't do the job, I don't know what will!	
1. 	We bought this crib to replace our old drop side crib and it is made really well and super sturdy.  I would recommend this to anyone.  My favorite part is that it is low enough to the ground that I can sit on the floor and pat my daughters back with my arm through the slats.  This was an excellent purchase.	
- 1	Since my 8-week old daughter is one of the 40-60% of babies who suffer from reflux and excessive spitting-up, I decided to buy the My Brest Friend (MBF) angled feeding pillow.  Our pediatrician and lactation consultant recommended breastfeeding at a 30-degree angle to help gravity keep her milk down and aid in digestion.Unfortunately, the first thing I noticed about this pillow when I took it out of its shipping box was the noxious smell it emitted.  (I figured that if the smell bothered me so much, it definitely couldn't be good for an infant!)  Per the enclosed manufacturer's instructions, I machine-washed and dried the pillowcase before first use, thinking that might get rid of the odor.  But to no avail.  It turned out that the smell was coming from the pillow-foam itself, and not the cover.  I did some research and discovered that the majority of infant pillows, mattresses, plush toys, etc., are filled with synthetic polyurethane foam (a petroleum derivative), and can also contain (or be deliberately treated with) toxic-smelling chemicals such as artificial flame-retardants, some of which have been linked to illnesses ranging from asthma and other respiratory ailments, to cancer.  Definitely not good news for parents (like me) who try to make eco-friendly or natural choices for their kids whenever possible.  When a couple days' worth of off-gassing (airing-out) the pillow-foam on the patio didn't eliminate the smell, I had to resort to machine-washing and drying it in a mesh lingerie bag using the delicate cycle and low/medium heat.  Granted, machine-washing and drying synthetic foam is a tricky process at best, which is usually not recommended by manufacturers (including MBF).  However, I decided to risk it because I really wanted to keep the pillow and give my baby girl a chance to get some relief from her reflux, instead of returning the item unused.As for the utility of the item itself, while the slanted feeding pillow concept is a good one in theory, in this case, the execution falls short in several respects.  For me, the main deficiency with the MBF angled pillow is that it won't stay put in my lap.  In order for my baby to be positioned close enough to my torso to breastfeed comfortably, I'd have to have a concave stomach!  And honestly, which new mom would ever have a stomach that flat so soon after giving birth?  On top of that, you'd have to take really shallow breaths while using the pillow, since breathing normally causes your stomach to push the pillow off your lap.  And unlike the regular MBF breastfeeding pillow, the angled pillowcase doesn't have a belt or other device to hold the pillow against your body.  This is quite an oversight by the manufacturer, since MBF basically pioneered the handy belt concept.  It's such a shame, since the angled pillow showed great potential for helping with my baby's reflux issues in the couple of minutes that I could use it before it slipped off my lap.  For example, my daughter actually burped DURING breastfeeding for the first time while feeding on the angled pillow.  It had previously been very difficult to get her to burp even after feedings, which aggravated her spitting-up and tummy discomfort.  However, this pillow's inability to stay put severely limits its usefulness.  Oh well ... I'll probably end up using it on my baby's changing table to prop up her head & torso so she doesn't spit-up when we're changing her diaper after feedings.  Grade: C.	
1. 	Nice bumpers. Very soft and easy to place. The only down fall is that they may be too soft. My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up!	
- 1	We ordered these when we had my daughter and they were great for maybe the first couple of uses. After that, the pull ties no longer worked so we could not tighten them and close them up. We basically had to twist the bag and fold it over hoping that the smell stayed in and nothing leaked out. We have made them work for the sake of not wanting to order more, but have recently ordered a couple others through Amazon now that we have 2 kids. Unfortunately, we'd never order these again.	
1. 	I would've given this 5 stars, only I'm not sure if it was the blanket or just a coincidence?  I used the blanket for 2 days without much observance of any huge improvement in my 3 month old son's sleeping...but then again I left his arms out during those 2 days because I am trying not to swaddle him too often.  However, on the 3rd day, I swaddled him the correct way and he slept for a 7 hour stretch for the first time!  On the second night I swaddled him properly, he slept 6.5 hours.  So I'm guessing it was the miracle blanket, or it could be that he just turned 12 weeks and is starting to sleep longer stretches.  But so far, I have no complaints about this blanket!  Definitely worth a try.	
1. 	My toddler cannot go to sleep without the sleep sheep set to ocean sounds.  We've had it in her bed ever since she was 3 months old and we have a travel sheep to take with us when we're away from home.  Excellent to help her feel like she's falling asleep in a familiar place.  When our new baby arrives, we'll be purchasing another one for the new nursery!	
- 1	UPDATE -----4/30/13---I really like this monitor---when it works.  We purchased this because of the ability to remotely operate the camera to see more of our children's room.  This is great for toddler twins on the move.  We are able to see very well with the infrared and daylight.BUT----after four months, our first parent unit stopped working.  I believe it was the sound that stopped working on that one, but am not sure.  Amazon replace it very quickly without hassle.THEN---after three months, the replacement monitor got stuck on SCAN 3, and would not recognize any of the three cameras we have synced to it.  Amazon wanted me to contact Motorola.  I did, and they are sending a second replacement.  But, the warranty is only good for a year from the original date of purchase.  I am not very confident that this parent unit will last for the net few years.I am very disappointed, because I bought this monitor because we had toddler twins and one on the way.  I was hoping it would last until our newborn doesn't need to be monitored at night.  Very expensive for a short duration of use.We had a Summer Infant Slim and Secure with the twins, and it worked very well for two years.  It still works, but the picture is not as good as it first was, and the battery doesn't hold power very long.  At least we are still able to use it while waiting on a replacement.  And we use it when we travel.Original review:  We had a slim and secure camera that worked for a little over two years.  We then got these and really like that they rotate.  It allows us to see the whole room for our two year old twins, who can easily get into trouble!!!!!I also like the microphone, so I can say something to them or play music	
1. 	My Daughter loves this thing! She is petite and at 4 1/2 months she was able to sit in the cart perfectly! I love the velcro toy straps and the pockets in the back of it. Doesn't fit perfectly in our Target carts but it does fit, I have had no issues with any other cart. Its super easy to roll back together! You can easily do it while holding baby in one arm. It also washes beautifully. I highly recommend this product and I am sooo happy I didn't buy the first one in the store. It pays to do your research and I promise you, this one will not disappoint!	
- 1	This is a good enough idea, but it doesn't work.  I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on.  It falls off about 3 times a day.  If I use the oven it falls off within minutes.	
1. 	Simple, soft, and washes well, we have a few of these, they are very soft, wash well and seem to wear well.	
- 1	each section wouldn't hold more than 3 tablespoon of oatmeal or veggie mix,/ not a very practical buywe use it now to teach the kid to operate a spoon and a plate (with a very little food on it), but not for actual feeding.	
- 1	I got my ergo when my daughter was over a year so I didn't know how to use it with my newborn son. I got this and can't say it did any good. I could never get a natural, comfortable hold. I used my moby for the newborn days.	
1. 	It was great to know that the replacement parts were so inexpensive. These made it possible to have extra parts in my pump at all times.	
1. 	My son sleeps with this turtle every night and he turns it on and off by himself (2yrs old) which is good for me so I dont have to keep doing it lol.  The blue turtle glows very brightly on the ceiling and amazons price when I bought it was hands down the cheapest I found it for.	
- 1	I tried this out on my baby's standard size crib, and it fit horribly. The little loops that hold it down, don't seem safe at all!!! And they don't keep the sheet secure to the mattress. I don't know how they're allowed to sell these. They seem like a major safety hazard to me!!! Total waste of money!!!	
- 1	the measuring of the water is not comfortable it take more time to actually put the water at its correct measure than just boiling water in micro and using that to warm the milk	
- 1	After reading the great reviews I went with this tub. During the first use I was frustrated that my baby kept sliding down the sling. I quit using it for awhile and just used the foam turtle in the kitchen sink. Well now that he is bigger we started using the tub again. At 3 months he moves a lot. He is constantly sliding too far over to the side or his bottom lifts up on to the bump. I turned him to the infant/toddler side and he is not really ready for that. So basically this tub has been pretty worthless. I am going to purchase the Primo tub since the molding looks much more effective and safe.	
1. 	My daughter was ready to potty in public LONG before *I* was ready for her to potty in public.  This product has helped me catch up with her.  She gets to be more comfortable, and I can be less horrified that my kid is in contact with surfaces I can't bear to think about.This is not a replacement for your at home adapter, so expect to still be hands-on with your child, offering some support and stability.  My daughter is around 21 months and 25 lbs, and while I don't feel like she's going to fall in, I definitely feel better keeping my hands on her just in case.  It is a travel item, after all.  But it sure beats the butt-hover that happens without an adapter, and the folding action and the travel bag make this one a home run.  My daughter loves to carry the travel bag after she goes.  She's so proud of herself for using the big girl potty!I've already recommended it to all my potty training parent friends.  Such a great product!	
- 1	I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow.  I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music.  It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute.  There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep.	
1. 	we put these behind our bookshelves when our son was about 1.  he's not a climber, but we figured better safe than sorry.  they were very easy to install.  I don't know what condition they'll leave the wall in if we decide to remove them, but it's worth the peace of mind.	
- 1	I tried threading these on to a number of different brands of bottled water. The threads engaged, but wouldn't fully seat. The top wouldn't seal easily popped off.Not worth trying to return at this price.	
1. 	fun designs and washes up so easily. I was tired of treating stained bibs and washing them constantly in the washer, these are so easy to clean up. makes dinner and self feeding much easier!	
1. 	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you!  No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).  The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.	
- 1	This diaper came without the two inserts it was advertised as having.	
- 1	As a new mom with a VERY heavy milk flow, I have tried several different breast pads over the last few months.  Here is my overview of each:Johnsons baby nursing pads - 60 Ea: These are my FAVORITE pads for daytime use.  They will not hold as much as Ameda, so they aren't as reliable overnight.  However, they are very soft and comfortable against tender breasts, They also have a nice shape that is more discrete than other brands.  I also love that they are not packed in pairs or singles, just all lumped in the box together.  Yes, this means they are not as sterile as the other brands, but they aren't a haste to unpack each time you need a fresh pad, and you don't risk waking up baby with crinkly wrappers. They do have an adhesive to keep them secure in your bra.  Also, they are the only pad I know of with a nipple indentation, meaning they are a little less abusive to already sore nipples.Ameda 50 Count Noshow Premium Disposable Nursing Pads: These are the most absorbent pads I have found.  In fact, they are the only ones that keep me dry overnight.  However, they have no shape to them at all, and are extremely obvious if you wear a thin bra.  They have no adhesive, so they will move around in your bra.  Also, they are packaged in an extremely crinkly wrapper, so if my baby is asleep I have to take them in another room to open, so as not to wake up the baby (and he is a heavy sleeper!)The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.: These are the best pads for early stages of nursing, when the lanolin will help soothe sore and cracked nipples.  They are very cool and comfortable on your nipples.  However, they do not hold quite as much as the Ameda.  I did find that these needed to be changed pretty often to avoid feeling damp.  Also, the edges of the pad are scratchy and can be a bit uncomfortable throughout the day.Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack: These are a good all-around pad.  They will hold a good bit, but not as much as the Ameda or J&J.;  They do have an adhesive strip that will help them stay in place in your bra, and are a very good value to use long term.  Be sure you get the soft version, as the older style is much more scratchy and uncomfortable.Evenflo Comfort Select Nursing Pad, 48 Count: These pads are very absorbent, but not very comfortable.  They have an itchy material inside that tends to stick to cracked nipples when removed.  They also are very obvious through thin bras.Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack 100 Count: WORTHLESS.  These pads do not absorb even a single let-down if you have a heavy flow.  They would instantly soak through and my shirt would be wet.  Also, they have no shape so they will bunch up and show through your bra and shirt.  They also have no adhesive, so they will move around.  Overall, completely worthless for a heavy milk flow.	
- 1	The cover is too tight and it is difficult to put it on when the tray is filled. It is also not air tight so I have ditched the cover and use cling film. The trays are good and the shape of the pocket makes removing frozen food easy. Wished it came with two trays instead.	
1. 	I am giving this five stars although it broke because my fianc&eacute; put a lot of pressure on it for it to break. Before it broke, I loved it. It held enough diapers for a two-three days and the side pockets held everything else that I needed for changing him. It WAS perfect, I am tempted to buy another one, that's how much I liked it.	
- 1	We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.	
- 1	This is a great concept and has lots of pros, such as large size, a valve-free straw that goes to the very bottom of the bottle.  However, I am afraid the cons outweigh the pros.  The biggest problem is the clear plastic second top that twists to close and open the silicone straw. not only is it hard to twist it and almost impossible to clean underneath it, but the liquid the child is drinking from the bottle gets trapped between the bottle and the clear plastic top and then leaks from the hole in the clear plastic top.  Therefore, you cannot use this bottle for anything other than water. I like the idea of a valve-free straw and have been looking for one on the market for a long time (the only other one like it was the Green Sprouts aqua bottle but the plastic it is made of cracks the second it is dropped) and was happy to find this one, but it has proven not a very good design after all.	
1. 	Just like I said in the title, this is a soft cover. It is easy to clean. It's a soft pink color.	
1. 	Not as soft as the fleece ones I usually use, but at least they're all cotton. When I'm especially leaky, I do have to swap these out for fresh ones now and then, as they get rather damp.	
- 1	I don't know how to stop it from getting moldy since no matter what there is a small amount of water sitting on top of the spout.  Design flaw, but probably necessary to create the shape of a duck (or whale).	
- 1	We used these bibs several times and they did pretty well in the washing machine (we didn't dry them, per the instructions). The snap closure on one bib broke after about a month of use. Not the best product...very cute but not durable.	
1. 	I had originally bought the rainforest swing because of the colors and because you could plug it in. However, my son did not like it at all.  So we did some research and decided on this swing.  Within minutes of sitting my son in it he was asleep.  We have now had it for 6 months and he still loves it.  My son is medium sized and there is still plenty of room for him to grow.  It does go through batteries pretty quickly but its worth it.	
- 1	I'm glad I only bought one.  It says good for 10 lbs but over 10 lb baby wears this and it is so bulky.  It also leaks. It leaked so bad one night that his jammies and bed sheets were soaked in the morning.  If it leaks when he is 7 weeks old how bad will it leak when he's older and pees more?  One of the elastic bands does not stay in the hole.  It continuously pops out and rubs my kids skin.  I do like the snaps, pocket, and cover.  However, I like Bum Genius 4.0 or thirsties better.  I tried emailing the company regarding the leak but never heard a response.	
- 1	Sponge fell apart after 1 week's of use. Nipple brush rough and not dense, thus hard to thoroughly clean a nipple.  I would not buy this product again.	
- 1	I was disappointed... these are thicker than the ones we got from the hospital and my baby could tell the difference.	
- 1	The title says it all. We have headrests that cant be adjusted and so we could never 'install' this mirror. We used the velcro in a weird way to get it working for a while. It was still very unstable and move with every bump. After some 10 days of buying/using it, the mirror broke. May be my daughter hit it with her legs, I dont know. Whatever happened, it was an utter waste of money and I am back to trusting a pacifier to keep my baby sane and silent in the backseat. Sigh!	
1. 	... and more.  Instead of putting the kid(s) in it - we now use it to protect the places we do not want the kids.  The trick is to mak sure you get enough angles and such to keep it upright.	
- 1	its cute but after seeing a few other people use other products, i see that this one doesnt work well. It doesnt have the right holding space for a new born, its would prolly be ok for a child who was only bottle eating 3 or 4 times a day.	
1. 	Finally!  A product that is easily adjustable for every type of vehicle!  I've battled my old car mirror for a year and rarely get the perfect spot to be able to actually see my child!  If i forget to push the carrying arm back then I'm out of luck and I would have to move my mirror to be able to even see her mirror every time.  Very frustrating!This mirror is wonderful!  I bought two!  I can see both babies faces in my mirror without having to move my mirror.  It took just a few seconds to attach them and position them properly.  Great product!  Highly recommend!	
- 1	We have not had the best experience with this.  It's well made and fits the stroller nicely, but the concept is better than the execution.  When the smaller baby is I true infant, the older child makes the stroller to heavy to maneuver.  When the infant gets a little older and can sit in either seat, one child will have their view constantly at the level of the other child's feet.  I also had to have my stroller frame replaced twice by Uppababy b/c I think the weight of my larger child sitting in the Rumble Seat caused the folding joint to malfunction.  Uppababy's customer service is great, but we really don't use this stroller with both kids, b/c it's not a comfortable ride for anyone.  And we LOVED our Vista when we had just one child.  Too bad.  We now spend most of our walks in a Babyjogger City Select tandem.	
1. 	First off, I hate doing laundry, and we are mean to our covers. I wash hot, frequently with bleach, and I usually put them in the dryer to boot.  So that's me.Almost 2 years into cloth diapering (we have a skinny and tall baby) I've found that these covers have held up best to my abuse.  We've tried prowraps, diaperraps, thirsties reg and duo, bummis superbrites, and probably some others I'm forgetting right now.  These are the ones I grab first.  The elastic seems sturdier than those on the thirsties (a runner-up for me), and these are solid covers that you can give a good yank to and get a nice fit.  They don't get too thrashed when you forget to fasten the aplix up before pitching them into the laundry.  And, they haven't delaminated yet!Nice job, Bummis.  Your Swimmis are great too, btw.	
1. 	wonderful product to keep little fingers from accidentally turning on the gas on our stove..2 broken now after 2 and half years of use but we're going to buy them again for our next little one	
1. 	This is the bed rail to get if you have a mattress that sits inside a bed frame.  The hinge sits higher than the bed frame and allows you to fold the rail down when not in use or for changing sheets.This rail is solidly built and I highly recommend it!	
- 1	Was very small to begin with, then washed it as directed and shrunk a ton. Although indicated it would fit in the play yard mattress I bought, I was never able to use it!	
1. 	Wanted a &#34;high chair&#34; for my granddaughter, whom I babysit 4 days a week.  After starting my research for a traditional high chair - which I didn't really want - I came across this item from Fisher Price.  Read many of the reviews, both positive and negative and decided this was a low cost possible solution.  If it didn't work as a &#34;high chair&#34; we could always use it when going out to eat.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised by the item and it will save me from having to purchase a traditional high chair.  My granddaughter is 4-1/2 months old, weighs approximately 16 lbs, and has been holding her head up for a while and is almost sitting up by herself.  At this point she needs a little help in the chair, but with the tray close, she is doing pretty good.  I only sit her in the chair for a few minutes at a time to let her get used to it - and she hasn't expressed any problems (lol) i.e. she doesn't cry, squirm or seem uncomfortable.  I think by using this process, she will be used to the chair by the time we are using it for feeding her.  One of the things I really like about this little &#34;chair&#34; is the fact that it is height adjustable.  We have a counter depth table with a 3-4 inch apron and the adjustment is great for us as it will allow her little legs to clear once she actually joins us at our table.Please keep in mind that this chair is less than $25 ...... but for our needs, it seems like a wonderful solution to a traditional high chair.  I think if I would have know about this when my kids were babies I would have gone this route and not done a high chair.  This is so much easier to clean, and you can just stick it away when not in use.  Heaven knows I have accumulated enough things with my granddaughter ..... so having something I can stick out of sight when not is use in a great big thumbs off for me.Thanks for reading and hope this helps.	
1. 	Got this for my 9 month old and she play's with it in her crib at night we love it!!	
1. 	I purchased this after holding a family member's hostage for some time.It's great for travel. You can fold it up and put it in the car. It adjusts well in different spaces.Ie. We use it to cover the stairs in some places, we use it to cover the fireplace at home, I've used it to cover the bookcase.... It created a nice little cage for my kids.I have never used it closed... My kids would probably just drag it around if they were stuck in it. But I have used it to keep them out of things they shouldn't get into. I tuck the ends away to prevent it from falling over and keep a zigzag pattern going to keep it sturdy.I ended up purchasing the 6 panel item with the door as well because I didn't enjoy stepping and hurdling over this one every few moments while trying to cook/serve dinner. I was told by the company that they did not advise linking the two gates together because it would make them less sturdy. Thus, I did not.	
- 1	i have a one year old that cannot chew meat or chicken so i bought this hoping that i would be able to mash up meat for her.  this merely shreds chicken and even to do that, it needs a lot of liquid.  i put chunks of cooked beef in here, that i had cut up and it did nothing.  the meat chunks just got stuck on the ends of the blades and all that happened when i pulled the string was the meat wiping the bowl.  terrible product.  excellent idea, but poor execution.  what it did do well was with noodle soups - the noodles were cut into bitesize pieces but i don't think that it justifies the keeping of this product.i can see how this would do well with very soft foods with considerable liquid - but if foods are already that soft, i don't need to use the boon mush for it.use at your own risk, make sure you can get free returns.  also, clean up is not as easy as it claims.  any liquid splashes out, gets inside the top of the lid, and sometimes on the inside of the lid.  when you chop up hot foods, the lid has a tendency to get stuck from the suction.  so either you need super strength to undo it, or wait until it cools down.i will be returning this.  i'm surprised by all of the good reviews.	
1. 	This does the job quite nicely, particularly for the price.  If a little one were really persistent, he/she could probably dig fingers through the opening, so I plug up the openings I don't have anything plugged into with the caps they include.  It isn't easy to unlatch, if you latch it well. My only complaint is that I have to unlatch it to plug something new in, but I can't fault the product-that is just how baby proofing goes sometimes.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this product and thought it was really cute; however water tends to pool in the water deflector which creates mildew.  In addition, the mildew stains won't clean off at all.  I have even tried applying bleach products, and the material remains stained from the mildew.  There is a small hole in the water deflector to allow for water to drain; however I have found that this hold gets plugged and requires a toothpick to clean it.  The water deflector does deflect water to some degree, but it certainly does not create a waterfall as shown in the pictures.  If the waterfall worked properly, it would be a lot more fun.  The bubble dispenser seemed like a nice idea; however we ended up liking a bubble bath that requires the product to be shaken before dispensing, so the bubble dispenser didn't meet our needs.	
1. 	Excellent product; I thought that it is a little bit too hard but I guess this is how it suppose to be for a newborn	
1. 	Sturdy for my big baby! Comes with a thin changing pad that I think works great (little one is only on the pad for 20 seconds). Have used it daily for 8 months and still holds up very well even with a 22lb baby trying to climb, chew, and jump off of it.	
- 1	I researched umbrella strollers for weeks before finally settling on the Pilko Mini. When I received the stroller I fell in love with the neon print and easy, one handed, fold. The stroller definitely has a lot going for it, but it feels cheap and flimsy, and worst of all, the wheels SQEEK.... No... SQUEAL like crazy! And yes, they're noisy on your first trip out on the town! If I didn't know the price I would have honest to god guessed that this was a $50 stroller- not $250! C'mon peg, I can deal with the light and flimsy feel of the stroller, but fix the insanely noisy wheels STAT!	
1. 	My boys love their turtles. We have two and they are great for nighttime. The colors are relaxing and we also love that it shuts off after 20 minutes.	
1. 	This is the BEST infant bath seat around!  We live in a small apartment and really needed a bath seat/tub that was compact and easy to store.  We first had the Puj Tub, which seemed like a great solution, but it was actually too SMALL for our sinks.  It came unsnapped as soon as we placed our baby in it because it wasn't fully supported all around.  Then, I was over at a friend's house one night and saw that she was bathing her 6 month old son in this infant bath seat.  I was amazed at how small it was, but how well-supported and comfortable her (hefty) baby boy was in it!  And then, when I found it on-line, I was even more amazed by the inexpensive price tag compared to all of the other tubs on the market.  I immediately bought it and haven't looked back!  It fits perfectly in our single basin kitchen sink (although we have to position it along the diagonal of the sink).  Our son loved the seat from the beginning.  He sits in it without any complaint.  We now have to put it in our bath tub, though, because our son is really long and didn't like having his legs scrunched up inside the sink (this is an issue with bathing him in the SINK, not with the bath seat).  The bath seat has suction cups on the bottom, so the seat doesn't shift around in the bath tub while he kicks away in the water!  Best of all, it stores away neatly in our linen closet and would probably fit in most under-sink cabinets (we have a pedestal sink, so we keep it in the closet).  I would recommend this bath seat to ANYONE and I've already purchased one for my brother's new baby!	
1. 	Skip alllllllll the other gummy crib rail protectors and just get these. They go on with zero headache and stay on. Note, you will need 2 sets to cover both sets of rails. But these end up being cheaper and far more effective than the others, which, peel, curl and can even be bitten apart. Yes my little fellow managed that, even though it shouldn't have been possible. Thoroughly pleased and recommending to all my friends with teething babies.	
1. 	Love these.  They are thin, but I like that as they are disposable, and I feel better about less waste.  I use them mostly out of the house, but occasionally use them preemptively for messy diapers at home, too.  They do rip easily, but you'll learn quickly how to handle them to avoid it.  Better priced than most, too.	
1. 	We are currently using the cups and bowls consistently.  This is the only sippy cup my daughter will take. (We reuse these, not &#34;take and toss&#34; as the name states). Also the bowls with lids are great for traveling.  My daughter loves to hold the spoons. Overall, great value for all the pieces you receive.	
1. 	Been using these a year with no complaints.  Velcro is still good, catching food that falls, washes well.  The only thing more I could ask for is sleeves for the messy days.	
1. 	I think this bottle brush is much more effective at scrubbing the sides of the bottles instead of one of those normal brushes that have the bristles in a round shape, those seem to be much harder to scrub the sides. This brush holds up, does a great job of cleaning the bottles. Just remember to face the bristles down when you pull the brush out of the bottle or you'll flick water all over yourself!	
- 1	We loved this spoon set when it was new, but after a few uses and contact with hot food, it's melted and deformed a little.I think it'll be great for salad, fruit and ice cream, definitely not for hot food.	
- 1	Perfect for my little ones hands, and the straw aspect is awesome, that you can tilt it etc. But don't fill it and put it in a cooler or other bag. Not leak proof.	
- 1	It's like pushing around and old fashion steel shopping cart full of watermelons. When the car seat is on it invades the second seat so my son can't lean back comfortably, also you can't hang a diaper bag on the handles without compromising the second seat or standing are. It's a heavy hunk a junk that is hard to fold and takes up my entire back seat, really regretting this purchase!	
- 1	We received several SwaddleMe wraps (which we loved for a new-newborn, but not for 10+ lbs), so I thought this would be an even better/faster way to get through the night with a newborn.  Unfortunately, our baby was able to easily wriggle her fits through the neck hole which frustrated her and woke her up even more.Might work for some, but I'd skip these in favor of the SwaddleMe's or just a plain blanket with a tight swaddle technique!	
1. 	I'm a nurse, so I'm extra picky about health care products.  This is my choice for my two girls.  It's fast.  It has a ridge to indicate how far in to insert the thermometer rectally.  It's backlit so you can read it in a dimly lit room.  And it's accurate.	
- 1	Puchased nine months ago to use for my cloth diaper wipes. Bought a set of bumgenius wipes at the same time and the bumgenius ones have held up much better. The edging has come loose on several of the OsoCozy wipes, and I will need to replace some soon as they fray away. Pay the few extra bucks and get the bumgenius flannel wipes, they are better quality.	
- 1	I do like this stroller but the color I see on my screen and what showed up are completely different.  Its more of a greenish teal - ewwwww!  Not what I was hoping for.  Ended up with a Chicco  - highly recommend :)	
- 1	I recently purchased the White Door Guardian Patio Door Lock and while it does it's job there are a few issue I have with it.1)  It's not white.  Its an off white and no where near the normal disigner white that a patio door is.2)  The Product Description states, There is no drilling required , just run 2 screws into a keeper plate provided and then into the upper track.  I can tell you right now you will be doing soem drilling.  In fact it comes with a cutout to help with the drill locations.I figuired based off the decsiption that the keeper plate would need to be mounted in the upper track using screws but you also have to screw the lock system into the door itself.  It comes with 4 screws that need to be predrilled to mount itself to the door.3)  Shipping cost was too much for such a small product.  Only reason I went with it dispite the cost was the fact that I was mislead to believe there was no drilling required.In the end if you want a sliding door lock this will work but in my shoes I feel a little cheated.	
- 1	The sheep is lovely but the music box came broken. We did not open it until our son was born, so too late for returns.	
1. 	The songs and stories are so sweet, especially the What Does the World Look Like story. As soon as I heard that I knew I had made a good purchase. My daughter no longer sleeps in a crib, but I keep this on a shelf in her room and she turns it on whenever she passes it. I would recommend it to anyone.	
- 1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.	
1. 	My TV has buttons on the side going vertically. Around 1 my son kept turning them on and off and on and off......ugh. So I bought the 10X1 one. It's EXCELLENT and fits perfectly. He's a little smarty pants because he tried to take it off at first and struggled but it would not budge. :-D The ONLY downside is that I sometimes like to turn the TV on or off without the remote and since it's there until I remove it forever, I have no way to turn it off unless the remote is handy. But, I'm ok with that because I know it's serving it's purpose and I rather spend 2 minutes looking for the remote than constantly redirecting my child and potentially damaging my electronics with the constant on/off routine (which is how my computer's harddrive died).	
1. 	I have used this so many times since my daughter was born a year ago. This is GREAT to keep in the diaper bag. So convenient to have pre-measured formula on the go. I was worried that with the top of the container, formula would spill into other compartments, but it doesn't at all! I never had a problem with that. Also, the cover and the top stay on TIGHT, it never once came off in the bag, and the top always stayed on.This is a PERFECT baby shower gift, all parents should have one! You can use it for snacks when your baby gets older, too.	
1. 	I love reading Amazon reviews when I go to purchase something, and for this product, the reviews really helped me out.  Like others, this is just what I needed.  I had been using the 24 mm that come with the pump (I have the freestyle) and suddenly, I started experiencing pain and even bleeding.  Upon further investigation, I realized too much of my skin was being sucked into the shield causing a lot of irritation and pain).  I ordered these and I feel SO much better.  No more pain, and my milk is back to the production levels it had been.  If you are experiencing pain while pumping, I suggest going to the Medela website and looking at their diagrams for good/bad fits for pumping.  This smaller size has been a lifesaver for me!	
- 1	These are just too thin to be used as diapers.  They are also a strange shape which makes them difficult to fold to be used as diapers.  I don't use them.  They are just sitting in a drawer.  I think I will try to use them as burp cloths as they are useless to me right now.	
- 1	I got this when my LO was a little over a year ... he really didn't know what to do with it. It's a nice cup though ... I wasn't sure how I could teach him to drink from it ..bummer. I will try when he's 18 months.	
- 1	We returned this gate. It opened very awkwardly. Was not worth drilling holes in the wall for. If you want a gate please invest in a more expensive one. You pay for what you get with this.	
- 1	I can't get these to stick in the windows. Oh well.I do, however, put them together and stick them in the top of the rear window, moving it around depending on where the sun will be coming in on baby. They have to be together to be thick enough to stay put, wedged up between the window and the &#34;ceiling&#34; interior.	
1. 	I bought this years ago and I still use it all the time at the beach and at the park. Keeps you dry on wet grass. Easy to fold up. Light weight and easy to carry.	
1. 	When our son was just born, sometimes the only thing that would calm him down was being in the bjorn - perhaps because the movement mimicked the womb. My husband would put him in this and either walk up and down the stairs, or hop on the treadmill - and it would calm our son right down and usually put him to sleep. Now he faces out and loves it!	
- 1	This chair has been a total disappointment since we first got it for our son.  It is sturdy and durable, but it has some major drawbacks especially when it comes to cleaning.PROs:-Folds up easily and stores nicely-Has two removeable tray tops so that you do not have to clean the entire tray after each meal-Very adjustable (with caveat... see cons)-Tray is easy to put on and removeCONs:-Tray is very large- much too large for a child's normal portion of food and a cup- Because the tray is so large, it cannot fit into our standard sized dishwasher (despite being 'dishwasher safe')-The chair and padding cannot be washed easily- Chair should be made out of a 'wipe down' material for easy cleaning or made from something machine washable.-The cushions on this chair are labeled 'hand wash only'... this is a major inconvenience.-The shoulder pads - which get dirty at almost every meal - are only removable by disassembling the straps.-These shoulder pads should be velco or snap on and off to allow for easy removal and cleaning.- Despite otherwise being very adjustable, the recline is fixed on this chair.  As a result, you cannot set your child to sitting fully upright.  The chair is always reclined.	
- 1	I've been using the Bumkins diaper liners and have been very happy with them.  Wanted to try these since it's less packaging and comes in a roll rather than tissue paper style...these are definitely not as soft or absorbent.  They're also not as big.  Even my mother who helps babysit during the day asked what happened to the old liners (i.e. Bumkins).  She refuses to use these and would rather go without the liners.  Sticking to the Bumkins from now on!	
1. 	A friend bought this for me when my daughter was a month old.  At first I was nervous about putting her in it.  She seemed to look lost in it.  Then I realized it had snaps on it to make it different sizes.  Once I adjusted it properly, my daughter loved it.  I love it too.  She is now 2 months old and I can put her in it while I am cleaning the house, washing dishes, doing laundry.  Anytime I have work to do and she wants to be held, I reach for the carrier.  I have used it in the mall too.  When she fusses in her carriage, I throw the carrier on and she faces me and usually falls asleep.  It does have a lot of hooks.  It took me a couple of times around the house to get used to how to use it.  But once I got the hang of it, I can now put it on and get her in more quickly.  My daughter weighs 11 pounds now and I am only 5'2, it doesn't hurt my shoulders or back at all.	
1. 	best bottles for your money these old school bottles are not expensive and work better than plastic all the time	
1. 	My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.	
1. 	These lids are a must have for anyone using Dr Brown's bottles.  I store bottles in the refrigerator with them, they go right in the dishwasher, and I can take bottles in the diaper bag when I'm out running errands.  Very convenient.	
- 1	No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I haven't tried any other body pillows, so I can't compare, but it seems to help. Early in my first trimester, I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night. I still have some, but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help. I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow, so it isn't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case. Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing, but I'm not sure how it could be improved -  it's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off, but would probably be uncomfortable or wouldn't completely cover the pillow.Edit: I liked this pillow at first, but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat. Washing it didn't plump it up enough. I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug. Save your money	
1. 	Use this everyday and love it! We don't use it as a circle as it is shown. It stores accordion style and we use it to block of fireplace/entertainment center, or certain areas of room. Our house could probably use some serious improvements in child-proofing but this fence is fantastic for blocking off furniture etc.Again, rather than a circle we create walls accordion style which creates stability. Although, if you are planning to be able to leave the child unwatched while you step away I'd strongly recommend using the circle setup as it'll be much more difficult to move or find an escape.Grates are smooth and about the size of a quarter so no danger of slicing tiny fingers or getting them stuck. Also, the hings are very sturdy. The panels lock into place at various angles and it takes some serious effort to adjust the angle so no child is going to be manipulating the shape. Huge plus!	
- 1	We use pocket diapers, mainly bumgenius, but I also like to try other products.  I really wanted to love this diaper, but it's the worst one we've tried.  The fit is horrible.  There are way too many ways to size the diaper and I just don't have time to adjust 5 different straps to get a good fit on my crawling baby (nor would my baby sit still for that).  I tried three times to get a good fit and just gave up.  There are two elastic sizing on each side of the inside of the pocket and one in the back of the diaper.  Due to (I'm assuming) a fit that I could not achieve, we had many leaks in this diaper.  If you can get this diaper to fit your little one, I'm sure it would be a good diaper.  I just much prefer the ease of using the bumgenius over this.	
1. 	comfortable. The price is high for the plastic piece. It is hard to clean. Some stains on the surface are bulldog.	
1. 	Went perfectly with my used breast pump I bought a pump from a friend and had to buy new accessories and these fit perfectly and was really nice!!	
1. 	I like the ones that come in one package better, but these are great for when you are traveling and don't want to carry all of that (I'm thinking business travel, flights, etc.).  So while I would buy the ones that are not individually wrapped for everyday use I found these to be useful as well and felt that they deserved a 5 star rating because of that.	
1. 	Great sheet set, and the blue checks is neutral enough for girls OR boys... so soft, even given the thread count.  Didn't shrink or fade or pill, and fits relatively snugly over a regular mattress even with a waterproof cover.	
- 1	UPDATE:4/8/14 - I purchased two of these mattresses and spent over $500 on them. Expensive, but I figured I would pay top dollar for something relatively safer and cleaner than standard typical mattresses. Well, I recently purchased the matching waterproof mattress cover from Colgate and was surprised at what I found. It is sold as organic cotton, however the label stated 100% polyester. I called the company and they did not have a good answer for me. The woman said, Oh no it's organic cotton. Maybe it's the wrong label, but that doesn't matter anyway because you cut it off after you get it. NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER. I am paying a premium for a product advertised as organic cotton, yet the label doesn't state something like -- 100% polyester (exclusive of surface) or anything like that. If you are selling a product as organic cotton, you definitely would be stating that on the material label as other companies do.SO... now that made me suspect of this mattress, which states (and looks) like the same certified organic cotton surface. I looked at the material label on the mattress and it states 92% Urethane foam 8% Rayon. Once again, where is the organic cotton????!!!!I really wish the company would address this issue. I highly doubt that these are all errors on the labels. If you really have a product made with organic cotton, you state it.Original review: I spent a long time researching different crib mattresses. I have two cribs and initially received a different brand because it was the best available at Babies R Us. I kept that mattress for my secondary crib, but wanted to find a more natural, organic one that would serve as my infant's main crib mattress. I purchased this one several months ago and am very happy with it. There are two sides of firmness, to different degrees - one for a newborn and one for a toddler (they are both firm though.) There are no sagging spots and all crib sheets seem to fit perfectly on this mattress. There is no plastic odor like with some mattresses and this was very important to me. The mattress itself is soft and plush, but not waterproof, so make sure you buy a waterproof lining for under your sheets. This may negate the whole organic thing, but I don't want to ruin an expensive mattress after one accident.	
1. 	I purchased these flushable liners because my daughter will be using them with our new grandson.  I&#34;m sure she will enjoy the product.	
- 1	Broken Zipper upon ArrivalI was truly hoping that JJ Cole had fixed this issue as it seemed to be a major problem when the product was first released.  However, it turns out that there is no quality control regarding this product.  These defaults are major flaws, not the small flaws that could easily go unnoticed, such as in inside zipper, or inside seam.  The zipper just would not unzip all the way.  When I finally did get it to unzip, I noticed that the stitching was also coming loose and the zipper wasn&#8217;t aligned properly when sewn together.  Just poor product quality all the way around.  Plus the changing pad, as nice as it seems, is actually quite heavy compared to some other changing pads that come with other diaper bags that I&#8217;ve owned in the past.  Imagine carrying that in the diaper bag along with everything else you want to shove in it&#8230;heavy, heavy, and heavier.  The hardware doesn&#8217;t seem well made either.  I will be returning this bag.  Too bad that I didn&#8217;t heed the advice of my fellow Amazon users when they said &#8220;don&#8217;t buy this bag&#8221;.  It&#8217;s just really sad that they would even bother to ship a faulty/broken product in the first place.  Amazon should stop selling this bag until the manufacturer fixes these problems.	
1. 	we got these because of the deeper pockets which worked great over the crib mattress. I would recommend them to another parent.	
1. 	This crib sheet is really cute!  It fits snugly on the crib mattress and looks great too.  I highly recommend it.	
1. 	These work better than any deodorizer I've seen.  Pleasant natural smell, nothing nasty but enough to cover up any lingering smell that does seep out of a diaper pail.  Very happy!	
- 1	The basket and toys in it get mold very quickly and must be cleaned regulary. I will go back to using a mesh bag that suctions to the wall as I did not have to worry about mold.  Overall not happy with the this product.	
1. 	This works great keeping my 1 year old out of the toilet.  I have had a few adult visitors who couldn't figure out the system and were able to just remove the whole thing.  I'm not sure how they did it, and my kiddo can't, so I'm keeping it.  But keep in mind it is possible to remove without really meaning to.	
1. 	Teeth cleaning gel is great but the rubbery finger toothbrush is not great for the finger in it when the infant bites down. It's soft for their gums but I found that for my children I needed to use a soft bristle toothbrush to avoid getting my cover bit through the rubber fiver tooth brush.	
1. 	I bought the SnuggleNest because my preemie son seemed overwhelmed by the size of his crib, and would fuss alot when I would put him down.  I didn't want him to get used to sleeping in the bassinet portion of the Pack 'N Play, so I bought this to use in his crib.  My son goes to sleep now with minimal fussing, because he no longer feels like he is sleeping in a big crib.	
1. 	I had to buy these recently as I left for trip with our baby, breast pump, and other gear but I forgot these pieces. I bought this pack at Target for $42 to use while away from home but couldn't stand spending that much on something I already own so I looked it up on Amazon. The price was much easier to swallow so I ordered it from Amazon and returned the other unopened pack to Target. I don't know if I'll use the microwave steam pouches/sterilizers since I don't like to heat up the plastic bottles but they're nice to have just in case I change my mind. The free 2 day shipping from Amazon Prime made this a much better deal overall.	
1. 	Love! Easily adjustable and looks very comfortable for baby. She falls asleep instantly when carried in it. My husband loves it and wears it for hours with no stress on his back.	
- 1	The baby really didn't play with it at all. I'm hoping he will grow into it, but he's 8 months now and he still doesn't use it, even if I play it for him.	
- 1	I liked the idea of this strap as it just sticks on surfaces and does not cause damage.  However, my 16 month old was able to open the strap by clicking open the end (the white box without the button) that is not fixed to the belt.  I believe the quality of the white box is poor.  If the plastic and open/close mechanism were of better quality or if they had put buttons on both ends, then it would have been much more difficult to open.	
1. 	This is a great little invention!  My daughter always broke free from her blanket swaddles, and this would cause her to wake up.  As any parent can tell you, a swaddled baby tends to sleep longer.  I was looking for a solution, and here it is!  The color is nice, and the fabric is soft.  I only have two complaints: the Velcro is necessary, but SO loud and it's disturbing to a baby who is half asleep as I try to wrangle everything into position; the other complaint is that it can cause baby to overheat.  I live in New York, a place that is by no means tropical, and I keep my home a bit on the cooler side.  Still, this fleece thing can make baby hot!  I've started dressing her in thin pajamas to help solve this problem, and her little heat rash went away.  I hope other parents take note and do the same, because overheating is a risk factor for SIDS.  I really like the design that helps it wrap around the shoulders so it doesn't creep up and cover baby's face.  That was a stroke of genius.  :)	
- 1	As the other reviewers have mentioned, these disks don't do a damn thing!  We have the Safety 1st diaper pail, and we just ended up using really cheap plastic bags in it and changing the bag every time our son poops so we can avoid any odors.	
- 1	I was disappointed in this masher and bowl.  The masher is plastic - don't expect to mash anything with skin (beans) or meats either.  It works fine for bananas, avocado, etc., but I'd rather just use a fork and my own bowl (that has a lid - this one doesn't).  The holes in the masher are very small and far apart, so the food just gets kind of pushed around rather than broken up.  It would be much more useful if it was metal.The non-slip bottom on the bowl is nice, but the side grip is small and further impedes your ability to really mash things up.  The design is cute too.  Overall, though, it just didn't work for me.	
1. 	First off, this is not a high quality product. The shades are however exactly what i needed! They are fairly dark giving my newbie plenty of shade n keeping him from being fried or blinded by the sun. They are a great size compared to other shades. Still not quite big enough to cover the whole window of my suv tho. The price is great! I spent $15 on a set that reteacts. They were way smaller, kept out little sun, and were always falling down. These are way better. I deducted a star for quality and installation. They are very clingy which is awesome AFTER u get them on, not so much when applying them. My husband and i both worked on them and after many resticks, they still have a few bubbles and wrinkles but functionality vs style w 4 kids? Functionality always wins. Also i can roll my windows down completely with no problem. Big plus. All in all, for the price, these are a winner. Glad i purchased them.	
- 1	I never used this product- it was too small for my Mutsy stroller-unfortunately- I am still looking for one that fits	
- 1	I thought this was supposed to be a good pillow for breastfeeding but it's not.  Because it is rounded and not connected to me it slips out from under my baby while feeding.  He ends up in a hole and I need to have a towel or blanket over the pillow to stop him from sinking.It is very cute and the cover is very soft but it really isn't functional for breastfeeding.	
1. 	I'm not sure what seam other reviewers are talking about - perhaps the design has changed because I don't notice any annoying seam at all.  This pillow is so comfy!  I'm 6 months pregnant and 5' 10.  I feel like the length works perfect for me, and it fits me well under the head, where I hug it, and also where I put it between my knees.  I'm sleeping like a dream with this pillow, hence the 5 star rating, though I do have a few issues.  First, why the light color cover?  I really don't want it to get dingy, so I took another reviewers advice and am using a pillowcase cut open at the end to slip onto the pillow at the head.  Also, I don't feel like the u shape really offers that much back support.  I had hoped that it would help keep me on my side, but I still find myself easily turning onto my back several times during the night.  However, I was way more into the huggable aspect of this pillow, so the back support isn't my top priority.  It's a bit cumbersome to get into and out of this pillow when you're getting up to use the bathroom multiple times a night, but it's nice to have the option of two arms of the pillow so you have something to snuggle if you switch sides.  My husband is totally envious of my pillow - I'm leaving town for a long weekend and I know he will be poaching it the whole time.UPDATE 2/15/14: I am just about to the end of my pregnancy and wanted to update my review.  I have slept comfortably the entire time and really think this pillow is amazing.  Granted, I have had a generally comfortable pregnancy with minimal back pain and no hip pain.  Nevertheless, I am SO happy with this purchase, and credit it with many nights of peaceful slumber.	
- 1	Like other posters have mentioned, the projector stopped working. For us, it was after 2 months of almost nightly use.Prior to that, we were only marginally happy with the Munchkin Nursery Projector. The sounds are low-quality, extremely short clips; the white noise clip is short enough that it creates an obvious beat pattern (and thus fails to really be white noise).The one cool thing is that the projector has a auto-on mode where it will come on when it detects a baby's cry. It really works and hadn't ever turned on to a noise other than our daughter's crying. That earned this an extra star.Lastly, despite being in Amazon's 90 return window, Amazon will not accept a return because, this is a known issue and we're supposed to contact the manufacturer. A known issue and you still sell it and won't take it back? That's not cool... especially when the manufacturer's customer service seems to be slow in replying to email inquiries. I guess a phone call will be required.	
- 1	Not only is it a horrible sprayer that doesn't get anything off of the diaper, IT LEAKED ALL OVER.  After being connected for TWO WEEKS, and only being used, maybe, 3 times, it leaked into the floor and the entire ceiling in the basement needs torn out and replaced.  This thing has cost me almost $2000.....so far.  I've contacted OsoCozy directly, and I doubt they'll take liability.  Just wash the diapers in a sink.  It's not worth it.	
1. 	This net holds a lot more animals than I thought. Now my daughter can see all the stuffed animals she has and they are up off the floor. Would definitely recommend this product	
- 1	Since my son finally started doing #2 on the potty and potty training is going really well, I decided it was time to ditch the pull-ups and move to cotton training pants with a cover.  After reading reviews on covers I decided to order these because of all the great reviews.  Since everyone said they ran big I ordered 2 packs of the large (26-31 pounds) for my 34 pound, 38 toddler.  We had our first accident (using these covers over the gerber training pants)today and urine rolled all down his legs within seconds.  He may as well have worn nothing over the training pants.  I had purchased BRU vinyl covers to use until these arrived and they did not leak at all when he had accidents.  The unopened pack of these is going back.	
1. 	Great product, easy to use. It was not good for my son though. He needed it to help him digest after his night feedings, but he wiggled too much and would roll off of it. The product was great, my son was just not a good baby for the product.	
1. 	This is a good step stool. It helps my cautious 2 year old get into her queen size bed (no frame).	
- 1	This only provides basic to support to the very side of the belly, nothing to help with the rest or the top.	
1. 	I have really enjoyed having this item. When my infant was having trouble sleeping on her back because of acid reflux this pillow saved me. I have used the same pillow for my second daughter as well. It said it couldn't be washed and I thought that was gross to just spot clean. I washed it in my high efficiency washer and it came out just fine. I run a daycare now and have bought a second one for the other infant in my care. Neither of my daughters have slipped around in it, it holds them firmly in place. Now that my daughter is learning to sit up I put her in it and she sits up and plays but if she falls over the pillow catches her. I have owned this for a year and a half and I have no rips in it. It is also great for when they get a cold. It sits them up enough to let the mucas flow instead of clogging them up.	
- 1	This product is a great concept, BUT it has a critical flaw for me.  The whole idea that I need to drill a big hole inside each cabinet door or drawer is a non starter.  I mean, why would you spend money on a nice kitchen only to drill holes inside doors and drawers?  Hello?  Baby will grow up eventually so the locks are not needed.  What about those holes?  It is cute that the manual says do not drill through the door, hugh?  Why would I want to even have a drill near my cabinet doors?  Also, what happens if say the door cracks while I drill?  Who pays for that?  I know the answer to that one -> ME!  Soooo....product is going back.  Non-starter	
1. 	Catches everything! Easy to clean and to get on and off. It&#8217;s the only one we use now that my son eats solid food.	
1. 	These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.  I'd buy them again for sure!	
- 1	Not so much that I hated it, but the baby did.  It's LOUD.  I'm not sure I ever managed to suck a booger out with it because my daughter wouldn't hold still for it.  We had much better luck with the regular bulb aspirators.	
1. 	It's pretty hard to find a great oven lock.  This one had terrible reviews, but was the kind we needed for our new oven (a side lock).  We've been using it for 9 months, and my toddler (who is now almost 2) seems quite safe.  She's pulled on the handle of the oven a few times (and we've told her no, which she seems to accept most of the time) and the lock has stayed put.  She's tried to operate the lock a few times, and has not been successful at that either.  I can see a toddler who is very interested in the lock being able to figure it out, but she has been easily diverted from it.It's held up great, and I don't find it too cumbersome to lock/unlock it whenever I use the oven (which is pretty often - I cook a lot). I have no complaints.	
- 1	Elastic already came appart from the sheet. Have been using it for less than 2 months. I liked this sheet at first, now not so much. I thought it would last longer.	
- 1	These things annoy me pretty frequently because of how flimsy they are.  Maybe it's by design, but its just weird getting things to snap back together.  Its just cheap feeling... very cheap feeling..Also, one of the containers have this compartment that folds out from the bottom... which is also annoying.  Its made worse because you're doing all of this snapping and swinging with wet parts spilling all over the place.  It's messy and awkward.The round thing seems to waste a whole bunch of space, I assume its the perfect design for something specific, but I have not figured out what that is just yet.We bought this item to help with Dr Brown's bottles, and it does very little to help.. nothing fits anywhere and I'm always just rigging stuff in there.Save your money..	
1. 	This item works great for us! Again my 15 month old has lost interest in even trying to mess with it.	
1. 	I didn't use this much because my baby cried most of the time when I put her in the carrier.  I used it a few times when I had to push my mom in the wheelchair and carry my baby at the same time because I had no other alternative to carry my baby.  She liked it a few times when she was a little older and could face outward.  I really didn't find much use for it, though.  Maybe our next baby will like it more.  Our first was a little fussy in her first 5 months or so.	
1. 	They are so easy to put on (or change when you're half asleep) and really protect the baby's sheets. I have three of them right now! You need to be careful with them in the washer and dryer (the washer sometimes ripped the backings on them and the dryer sometimes broke off the snaps) but they are so worth it!	
1. 	This fits our pack n play mattress very well. I love it for when our daughter sleeps on that mattress.	
1. 	This worked perfectly for our fireplace.  It fit snugly and firmly.  There was plenty of adhesive tape for the entire length, which I know was a concern for other similar products.  The coloring was a nice neutral match as well.	
1. 	I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.  This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!	
1. 	I bought this crib in black.  i am so happy with it.  my husband was able to put it together pretty quickly.  it does dent and chip somewhat easily, but i will keep the black sharpie nearby.  it is very sturdy.  i will say that our baby isn't here yet, so this review is not based on daily use or having used with a baby yet.  i will try to remember to update this review after baby.	
1. 	Better by far than the wire ones that rust and break!  bristles are soft.  wish the nipple brush worked better; couldn't they put some bristles on that end?	
1. 	I like this bedding set.  Our baby loves the animals.  We also got the mobile, the lamp, and the wall hangings.  It's great for a boy or a girl, so you will get lots of use out of it.  The colors are nice and neutral, but cheerful enough for a baby's room!  A great bedding set all around.  The comforter part is kind of impractical, but great as a decoration.	
1. 	In the beginning, my son had a terrible time with gas bubbles in his stomach.  Within a few minutes of eating, he would scream in pain.  He was difficult to burp, so no help there.  We tried the Avent bottles, which only made the situation worse given the odd shape of the nipples.The FIRST time we used a Dr. Brown's bottles we noticed a significant difference.  In a very short time, he was no longer screaming after every meal.  Yes, there are 2 extra pieces to wash, but that's trivial compared to the alternative.	
1. 	So important helps protect mobile babies so they don't hurt themselves.  Nicely priced and easy to install product.  Would buy again	
- 1	It is important you know before you spend all your money on this monitor.The monitors are NOT interchangeable.ALL the monitors MUST be plugged in. The infant monitor MUST stay plugged in at all time. The parent monitors will make an absolutely horrid, obnoxious beeping sound even if fully charged while they are unplugged. The beep is actually louder then an infant screaming with all of their might. It's absolutely ridiculous!!!The night-light is a nice feature, that is, if the monitors were actually portable, which they really are NOT, unless you want to listen to it scream that it is unplugged and/or you want it to wake your child.It works on the basics, nothing more.	
1. 	We got this wipe warmer from my aunt for a shower gift. We had a different warmer on our registry. I read all the reviews for this warmer and returned the one we wanted originally. I couldn't be happier with this warmer. Yes, water does gather on the lid, but runs down the inside of the warmer, thus rewetting the pad in the bottom of the warmer that keeps the wipes from drying out. Zac doesn't get a surprise with a cold wipe and we don't get a surprise from, well, those surprises boys &quot;spring&quot;  on you! This is a must have and I recommeded it to many expectant mothers I know!	
1. 	I purchased this to use with our Baby Trend Nursery Center play yard.  The sage green matches perfectly with the play yard's colors (Columbia).  It fits the mattress well, even after washing.  I did let it air dry instead of running it through the dryer.  It's very soft and adds a little cushion to the thin mattress, which is why I chose this sheet.  I had some regular sheets, which work fine, but the mattress is so thin and there are hard bars underneath, I thought it needed a little something extra for baby's comfort.  We don't use the play yard much but the few times we have, baby went right to sleep and seemed comfortable enough.	
- 1	I really want to try these since the Dino Dudes print (no longer an option) is the same as my twins' nursery so I bought 2. At 11 and 12.5 pounds the covers are still too big. I am pairing them with a Best Bottom insert and maybe they are just too trim. I'll keep trying them..	
- 1	This necklace did not work out for my child. She did not like wearing it, it would get stuck in her neck and become irritating. Nowadays she just carries it around the house whenever she comes across it.	
1. 	I bought these when my daughter was in the nicu and I was exclusively pumping for her. I had Raw, cracked, and sometimes bleeding nipples from it. These were a godsend. I actually just passed them off to my best friend who just had her baby and was having similar issues (is that gross? Oh well).	
1. 	With my first child I tried out the store bought baby food and she simply refused to eat it.  When I asked my child care provider she asked me if I have tried the food myself and if I'd eat something like what I'm trying to feed her.  I tried it and it was disgusting.  I then decided to start making my own.With this baby (2007) I decided that I'm not even going to try with the store bought food and started making my own.  I'm using both the trays and the travel dish and they are great.  The only issue I found was it is a bit tough to pop out the food out of each section.  I use a buttering knife and just get it in on the side to get some air in there and it comes right out.  The little ice cubes fit great into the travel dish and I pop that into the refrigerator the night before and pack it for day care the next morning.We are string to give our baby more food so I am getting more trays.We are very happy with this product and will totally recommend it if you're looking to make your own baby food.	
- 1	This swing is amazing for newborns! But our daughter is only 3 months old and 12 lbs and the motor no longer works well... it will be at speed 6, the highest you can go and it barely moves... sooo frustrating since we use this for naps and down time. So am I supposed to buy a seat swing for post 3 months? This is too expensive to work for only 3 months...	
1. 	After a few months of use I am very happy with this blanket. It is durable and waterproof and folds out easily with one hand. I was concerned about putting it in the washer but have done so a few times on the delicate cycle and it is holding up perfectly.	
- 1	This tub was even terrible when my daughter was a newborn. She was either not in the water at all or was sliding down the sling into the water. At 3 months old I still have to use the sling because she slides over the hump on the inside that is supposed to keep her up. And yep! She still slides down the sling and is only half in the water so gets cold very quickly. I hate bathing her and she is liking it less also.	
- 1	See my update below:The functionality of this cup was great at first. No leaks, easy to use. 5 months in? I notice black chips floating in my baby's water and can see the plastic film from the top of the nozzle was peeling off. I got it off manually, and didn't see anymore flakes. Then, the straw part started to discolor and I noticed it filling with mold. Now the straw is a dark gray color and I can't even pass this on for another child to use. Straight in the trash. Unacceptable.UPDATE:I went to a store that sells this cup to ask why there was so much mold.  The store owner explained that ALL sippy cups get moldy (it's the nature of water) and in fact this was one of the only brands that sell extra straws and straw cleaners.  Some brands make you buy a whole new cup! So I went from thinking this cup is awful, to actually being happy about it.  I bought replacement straws and was on my way.	
- 1	The string constantly gets stuck so I have to smack it to make the music continue. Defeats the purpose of a pull string music toy. Pretty disappointing.	
- 1	I got this chair for my boy when he was only about a month old so I didn't try it right away but it did look cheap and way too much plastic exposed. I started putting my baby in it when he was 3 months old and this chair is horrible the back is completely flat which lets the baby slide from side to side and down, the cover is way too thin not even soft enough to let the baby sit there for more then a few minutes. The sliding and the cheap cover turned out to not even be the worst part when my baby began eating solids this chair is even worse since the straps are hanging in from of the baby and he prefers to eat those instead of the food! I wish we didn't throw the box right away I would've retuned it.	
1. 	I have to say anything Medela is great.  Always high quality stuff! Anyway this manual breast pump works great for on the go.  I have an electric pump that I use at home (the Medela Freetime) but I needed a pump I could take on vacation with me.  It works great.  It does not work great when your not full.  I don't feel it has enough sucking power to get the deep down milk (if that makes sense)  but i works great when your full.  My hand gets SO TIRED though!  So be prepared for that.  But otherwise it works great and is a great price. Def worth the money and gets an A+ in my book.	
- 1	Beware of this system.  We have owned this system for 2 years now.  We are on our 3rd monitor.  The video cameras work just fine, but the monitor is awful.  Our first broke after 15 months.  Because I didn't have a receipt, Summer Infant wouldn't exchange it.  I looked into purchasing a different system, but we already had multiple cameras, so I just decided to do the Secure Sight monitor again and save the Amazon receipt.  (Summer Infant offered a &#34;discounted&#34; price to replace the 1st broken one, but it was cheaper to buy a camera + monitor on Amazon.  Thanks for the &#34;great deal&#34;, Summer Infant!).  We are now 2 years and 4 months later and the 2nd monitor broke a few weeks ago.  I contacted Summer Infant. I had to email them a picture of my Amazon receipt and they sent me a prepaid packing slip to mail the monitor back to them.  The customer service rep said they would send a replacement.  I don't know how long it will take to get it.  Meanwhile, we are without a monitor in for the 2 year old we moved to a &#34;big boy bed&#34;!Picture quality is great, sound is great.  It is so frustrating because I am overall very happy with the quality, just not the longevity! I truly think they should last longer than 12-15 months.  If I were starting out completely over again, I would NOT purchase this system.  Because I already have multiple cameras, I just didn't feel like I could change brands, but we may have to if this 3rd one breaks.....when it breaks.....	
- 1	Can't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags?  It's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed.  For the price, Medela should really come up with something better.	
1. 	Good size (36 x 36), durable, sturdy.  Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition; that's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen.	
- 1	I prefer the gates that have those handles which go under the mattress rather than straps.  The straps were difficult to keep in place while putting the mattress back on box spring.  Also, it's extremely difficult to take down.  Perhaps mine is stuck.  Have no been able to take the side down so it remains up and it looks sloppy.  It also doesn't stay up straight.  One side bends inward and takes up sleeping space for my child.	
1. 	I don't know what everyone else is doing with it, but I've had no problems with it falling apart.  It was not difficult to assemble but you did need two sets of hands. I store all our diaper-changing items on the top shelf in baskets, and then diaper bags go on the bottom shelf.  The only complaint I would have is that the changing pad is yellowing in strange spots (nothing to do with where it is used most).	
1. 	I use this to store 3 Dr Brown's narrow neck bottles to and from daycare. Sturdy and fits them well.	
- 1	Thought this was good, but then I saw how much trouble cloth diapers are.Sorry, but a working mom cannot go this way.  Back to disposables we went.	
1. 	I use these at night when I nurse to catch the let-down on the side baby is not eating from.  It's a great way to build up a little extra for bottle feedings.  I hate wasting precious breastmilk!	
- 1	This is a great idea.  I love the blinking light - it's so easy to see.  It's small so it's not cumbersome in the infant baths. It also has auto shut-off which is ideal.  The problem is that it's not waterproof and it broke within a week of use.  Obviously this is a design flaw as many other reviewers have had the same issue.  I actually came on here to order another one, figuring that mine was just faulty.  Such a shame because I loved it.	
- 1	The little characters are really cute and my son loves them. However, most of the characters are hard to squirt and pretty much impossible to get all of the water out. My son also couldn't really push the characters together to link them. I had bought this at a store and didn't see the reviews until I was looking for a new bath toys :(The two stars are for being cute and having the hanging bag, which could be reuse for other bath toys.	
- 1	I got this for my 1 year old son, in order to get the water out he has to bite on a specific area of the straw so its not the easiest to use. On the plus sode it does not spill when dropped	
- 1	My fault for not reading the fine print, but these wipes are not fully organic.  As a matter of fact, the description (to be honest) should say Fuzzi Bunz Organic Cotton/Polyester Fleece Double Sided Wipes because it is possible to make a double-sided wipe out of one side organic cotton and one side organic fleece...I am a first time mom, and am trying cloth diapering with organic and natural fibers.  Luckily, I bought only one package of the FuzziBunz wipes and one package of each of several other types.  When cloth diapering, you cannot use fabric softener in your laundry or else the absorbency of your diapers and wipes will be reduced dramatically.  Without softener, these wipes generated enough static electricity to power my house.  I found them stuck to everything--my daughter's clothes, her diapers, towels, sheets, you name it.  I wasn't about to wash them separately from my other diaper laundry so, instead, I got rid of them.  For me, they were a total waste of money.  Why pay more for organic cotton if, in the end, you are rubbing your little one's most sensitive parts with polyester?!	
1. 	These bibs have been great! Love the colors. Comes in size 3-12 mos. Great for the price. Hold up well. Absorbency is pretty good. Ordered multiple sets! Use at home and at daycare.	
1. 	We started using this at about 12 months old. We used the newborn Mustela shampoo prior to 12 months.  We have yet to have a scalp issue with any Mustela shampoo product. Very mild but sudsy.  Does not irritate the eyes.  Our daughter has a habit of trying to drink the bath water but if she gets a gulp she hasn't had any bad reactions to it with the leftover suds!  No plans to switching to another brand anytime soon!	
- 1	This mobile sounds great in theory, but doesn't work in reality.1) Music only plays for 3 minutes, tops, no matter how hard you crank it.2) Mobile looks good in terms of contrast colors, right? Okay, but think of what the baby sees, not what you are seeing in the ad. The baby is seeing the BOTTOMS of these pyramidal shapes....aka, flat white spaces you fill with the graphic cards. So unless you place your baby at quite an angle from the mobile (and why would you do that? because the baby would not be able to see the graphic cards unless s/he is directly underneath them....) s/he will never see all the red, black and white colors and graphics that we see in the picture!!! I guess I am no genius, because I did not realize that until I actually constructed the mobile.... Frankly, the tops could be stark white...the way these dangle, the baby just does not really see the top half of the mobile elements.3) Shipping is really high for this. And they left something out of my order. They apologized and resent it, but I expect better for nine dollars ground shipping.In retrospect, I would have bought a fisher price jungle one with better musicFisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile, because I have the fisher price melodies jungle theme gym, and the baby likes that, OR I would have bought the cheaper infant stim mobile with just the cards hanging from the strings.Infant Stim-MobileThere is one available that ships directly from Amazon and is eligible for free shipping.	
- 1	I do not actually hate this item, but my child does and hasn't once used it despite being quick to potty train. It doesn't feel sturdy in our particular toilet ring (it pops fully into the potty only once my child has sat on the seat), and though that is not the fault of the maker, it's been a total no-go for us. A stepstool and toilet seat reducer have solved our problems!	
1. 	i love this bug! especially my daughter bites the antennas =))  and its not a bug its a future butterfly-the cutterpillar	
- 1	The suction cups won't stick to the formica around our tub.  I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile, but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can't get it to stick either.  Now that I think about it, suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too, so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder.  This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money, I'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead.  I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.	
1. 	I love the stroller frame. We have a great Jeep 3-wheel stroller that the carseat will attach to but it is a bit big and bulky for everyday use. Plus it doesn't fit in the trunk of my car. This stroller frame pops right in the trunk and is super lightweight. The carseat snaps securely onto it and the basket underneath can even be used for shopping if you're just picking up a couple things. It is also very easy to turn and maneuver even in tight spaces. It's a must-have.	
1. 	We got this seat since we have a small kitchen and have heard from other friends that their full sized high chair took up too much space.  The tray is easy to remove and clean (dishwasher safe too) I can get DS in and out of the seat fairly quickly. I like how securely it fastens to our chair at the table.This booster folds up nicely and can easily be taken with you if you plan on going out to eat.  The only downside with this is they  tray can become loose with little hands. My lil guy somehow got his fingers btwn the white tray and the blue tray attachment and couldn't get his finger unstuck and started to cry. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I looked down. I will be vigilant of that next time we use it, but otherwise, really great system.	
1. 	We were given 3 of these when my triplets were born.  They just turned 17 months and we are just now putting them away.  My trio had severe reflux and slept in these swings until about 2 weeks ago.  We used rechargeable batteries which saved us a TON of money (especially with them swinging at least 12 hours a day)!  LOVE THIS SWING!!!	
- 1	I bought these before I started to diaper my son, thinking pins were intimidating.  I got pins as well.  In theory these are a great idea, but I found they gave a super tight fit and didn't hold the layers together well - like the inner portion of the diaper kept slipping.  They worked well enough when my kids were super tiny and in newborn sized prefolds (which you CAN just lay in a wrap but I don't care for that method, though my husband did, which drove me nuts as I would then find myself snappi-less or pin-less out in public when changing a diaper LOL) - since newborns don't move around much, the snappi tended to stay in place.  By by and large I prefer my prefolds pinned.  It's really not hard at all once you do it for the first time - pinch the dipe away fropm the baby, slide the pin through your hair to make it slippery, and pin.  You get a more generous fit and a more secure hold, and there's just nothing cuter than a good old fashioned pinned diaper on a naked baby waddling around.  A snappi'd diaper just looks odd in my opinion.We use these now to hold diapers on my girls' baby dolls.  :-)  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy them, though they did serve some use early on.  .	
- 1	As a new mom with a VERY heavy milk flow, I have tried several different breast pads over the last few months.  Here is my overview of each:Johnsons baby nursing pads - 60 Ea: These are my FAVORITE pads for daytime use.  They will not hold as much as Ameda, so they aren't as reliable overnight.  However, they are very soft and comfortable against tender breasts, They also have a nice shape that is more discrete than other brands.  I also love that they are not packed in pairs or singles, just all lumped in the box together.  Yes, this means they are not as sterile as the other brands, but they aren't a haste to unpack each time you need a fresh pad, and you don't risk waking up baby with crinkly wrappers. They do have an adhesive to keep them secure in your bra.  Also, they are the only pad I know of with a nipple indentation, meaning they are a little less abusive to already sore nipples.Ameda 50 Count Noshow Premium Disposable Nursing Pads: These are the most absorbent pads I have found.  In fact, they are the only ones that keep me dry overnight.  However, they have no shape to them at all, and are extremely obvious if you wear a thin bra.  They have no adhesive, so they will move around in your bra.  Also, they are packaged in an extremely crinkly wrapper, so if my baby is asleep I have to take them in another room to open, so as not to wake up the baby (and he is a heavy sleeper!)The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.: These are the best pads for early stages of nursing, when the lanolin will help soothe sore and cracked nipples.  They are very cool and comfortable on your nipples.  However, they do not hold quite as much as the Ameda.  I did find that these needed to be changed pretty often to avoid feeling damp.  Also, the edges of the pad are scratchy and can be a bit uncomfortable throughout the day.Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-pack: These are a good all-around pad.  They will hold a good bit, but not as much as the Ameda or J&J.;  They do have an adhesive strip that will help them stay in place in your bra, and are a very good value to use long term.  Be sure you get the soft version, as the older style is much more scratchy and uncomfortable.Evenflo Comfort Select Nursing Pad, 48 Count: These pads are very absorbent, but not very comfortable.  They have an itchy material inside that tends to stick to cracked nipples when removed.  They also are very obvious through thin bras.Gerber Breast Pads - Variety Pack 100 Count: WORTHLESS.  These pads do not absorb even a single let-down if you have a heavy flow.  They would instantly soak through and my shirt would be wet.  Also, they have no shape so they will bunch up and show through your bra and shirt.  They also have no adhesive, so they will move around.  Overall, completely worthless for a heavy milk flow.	
1. 	so far so good. the hippo we purchased has been effective at preventing the child's head to hit the water spout. it has not come off yet either, which was a key consideration point, as other devices were too flimsy and easily taken off.	
- 1	This neckalace was way too lose on my child's neck. So loose that he could get the beads into his mouth. I don't think it is healthy for him to suck on it but there was no stopping him and also he could break it and choke on a bead or strangle himself. Stopped using this as soon as I saw him walking around with it in his mouth. He was one year old at the time.	
- 1	We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget. Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times. After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1) It is NOT particularly lightweight, and even though my son was a smaller baby, it still got really heavy really fast. After about 3mos. I refused  to use it anymore. We put it in hubby's car and I put the convertible seat in mine.2) The straps adjust from behind, and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually. So, if the season changes (or you just live in a variable region like we do) you'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie. THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm (lighter clothes) day. And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time!3) The handle was not very steady. What I mean is, these seats are pushed and pulled constantly, usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip. I found that after just a few trips, the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side, and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4) Last thing, but definitely my biggest concern. The anchor strap slips! You don't notice it the first few times, and you probably won't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally. Because it was in my husband's car, we didn't notice it at first. Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE! The strap (it was the LATCH strap) had gradually gotten looser and looser, even though we used a towel to even out the seat (as recommended) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible. We fixed it, then found that several weeks later it was loose again!I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat (since I've never heard anybody else complain of it), but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again. Go with Britax or Chicco!	
- 1	I was on bedrest at the hospital for most of my pregnancy so I bought a lot of my baby gear online without being able to see the items in person.  I wanted to love this stroller but when I finally got home after delivering the baby, I found that this stroller was HUGE!  It was impossible to load this in and out of the trunk while recovering from a c-section.  Not to mention, it barely fit in my trunk.  I have both a hatch-back sedan and and SUV.  It barely fit in the hatchback and took up most of the trunk space in my SUV.  I saw a lot of the same issues that other reviewers complained about.  The wheels wobble when walking at a brisk speed, the storage basket falls of its supports, and there is very little shock absorbance at all when going over gravel or thick grass.  Purchasing this stroller was a big mistake.  Since it was too late to return it, I gave it away (I posted it on Craigslist for weeks for $80 and nobody ever responded) and bought a Britax B-Agile travel system.  Now I'm happy!	
- 1	I hate it. Whenever I use it, it feels like a gun being pointed at anyone's head.The accuracy is dependent on the user and is accurate only when you make sure there is no hair etc on forhead on way while taking the measurement, leaving room for errors.It works, but I think ear thermometers are much more reliable.Update:The company send us a newer version of the thermometer. We got to use it over this weekend and it seems to have much quicker response time. I also checked the temperature measured to the rectal temperature and they are off aby around 1-2F .. which is pretty good. I do like the newer version much better and like the customer care of the company even better!!!	
1. 	I was uncertain if getting a red sleep sack was a good idea after having read some of the reviews saying that everything that came in contact with it had red fuzz on it. But I am glad I did. We have used it pretty much every night for the past 1-2 months, and no red fuzz on anything. It washes great, it is roomy enough, and yet my son can walk in it when he wakes up. The color is vibrant, and NO fuzz coming off of it.	
1. 	This was a life saver as the original play yard that we bought was not big enough. We found that when adding these extensions it was the perfect size for our son to move around and still have room for his toys	
1. 	My newborn squirmed and cried bloody murder during her sponge baths so you can imagine how nervous I was to immerse her in water for her first real bath. I needn't have worried. The shape of the infant side kept her comfortably cradled and even when she squirmed she stayed in place, allowing me to focus on getting her squeaky clean. (No need for two sets of hands). When she fouled the water, I used the drain to quickly empty the tub and then refill it before continuing with the bath. Since there is a toddler side I will be able to use this tub for quite some time before she transitions to the bathtub. Also the lack of slings or other cloth pieces eliminates concerns about the tub being fully clean and sanitary. My mother saw the tub and scoffed why would anyone buy a tub when they could just wash the baby in the sink. Then she saw how easy and effortless bath time was and she was sold. My newborn actually likes getting a bath now, hence I now enjoy bathing her. It's worth every penny.Things to know:1) The tub is big. It can't easily be tucked away somewhere out of sight.2) The shape of the tub requires maneuvering to get all of the water out while draining since all areas do not have direct access to the drain.	
- 1	It works great, unfortunately both the ones we've bought have lasted 3 months before breaking off. Hoping to find something more durable now, although I guess it's ok for the price.	
- 1	I purchased this for my son when he was 1 month old, he is now three months old and still loves it! He will kick his feet, laugh, coo, and just watch it go around. It has been a huge live saver for me. So I can get things done around the house. A definite must have for a fussy baby!!  It does clank as other people have said but that is what helps keep his attention. It is also nice that it goes for 20 minutes!Update. I have had to return it once due to the fact that it would not always spin around. I tried changing the battery but it did not help. Second one works better but must have full batteries or doesn't work consistently. I would choose a different mobile if I could do it over again. I choose this one since I had one like it for my first child but it was made by baby Eisenstein company and it was amazing, that was 9 years ago though.It goes through batteries extremely quickly.	
1. 	My daughter enjoyed this gym for several months, and it is now being enjoyed by a neighbor.  It comes with a pillow somewhat similar to a small Boppy.  It is great for tummy time.  I did not purchase this gym, it was a gift.  It is quite pricey for what it is.  Most babies I would think would be as happy with a less expensive alternative.	
1. 	Just an adorable baby blanket. We used the Kiddopotamus swaddle for real swaddling, but this has been a wonderful baby blanket. Our daughter now uses it during her nap in pre-school. We have loved it!	
1. 	I got these outlet covers for outlets that I would need to use more frequently.  The installation was very straightforward.  You just need to unscrew your old ones and screw these on.  They covered the area of my outlet the same way the old ones did, which is great considering we have painted walls and I didn't want to have to touch up unpainted spots.  The screw is in the center, so if you have an older outlet these won't work.  They openings are easy to slide over and stick the plugs in, and they snap back to cover the outlet quickly and effectively.  Whoever came up with these is a genius!  So far no complaints, but if something comes up I will update this review.	
- 1	While the sheet serves its purpose, it's rough material and I am concerned it may irritate my son's sensitive skin. I'll give it a few more washes to see if it softens up a bit. Very low priced so I guess I get what I paid for.	
1. 	Love love love our Halo Sleep Sacks!  My baby HATED being swaddled but I didn't want loose blankets in her crib, so gave these a try.  They're perfect!  Tons of room in the bottom for her to kick her legs around, and her arms are free, but it keeps her toasty warm on those cold winter nights!	
1. 	i have bought so many different sippy cups looking for the magical one i can use to replace my daughters bottles. and these seem to be her favorite! like others have said, they will leak when on the side or upside down. but i think for the price, its a small issue. we've lost a few here and there, but since they are so cheap i really dont mind. she learned how to use these in about a day and she is 11 months old.	
1. 	These are soft and absorbent. They're small so they'll be good for wipes. Right now we're using them as washcloths, and spit-up rags. There are a lot in a pack, so they're affordable as well. My only complaint is after 1 wash some of the stitching around the edges is coming undone, but that's not really a make or break thing for me. I feel like these are still really nice quality.	
1. 	We love those bibs, use them daily, saves a lot of laundry/ stain treatments. We have two per kid so that we can clean it and hang it dry (dries fast) but still have one in reserve if it gets too messy and not dry in time ... also they are perfectly wipeable. The pack easily and fold together small so you can stack on in the diaper bag.I used to have to buy them individually at BabiesRus, the price here on amazon is so much better, you basically get one free. I have given them as gifts and everybody loves them. Was sad to see on the newest ones I ordered though that they are not made in the US anymore ...	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
1. 	Bought these for my 2 year old Granddaughter. I am now a hero with my Daughter-in-law. They really save her clothes & the carpet.	
- 1	I just put together our Rainforest Friends bouncer and unfortunately the toy bar's on/volume button is defective and does not work.  The music is stuck in loud mode.  I have contacted Amazon for a replacement item and hope the next one is not defective. Whether or not it has to deal with the defective product or not, Amazon used frustration free shipping (which typically I love); however, they chose to put the cloth item in the box without a plastic bag covering it and the box arrived with a 2' by 6' hole in it.  There was also a small stain on the cloth which makes me think this had been returned in the past and then sent to me.If the next one arrives and works I will update and change my star rating.  I like the looks of the product; however, cannot justify giving a good rating for a defective product.	
1. 	Cleans easy, vents great, works perfect for newborns.  These bottles also fit into standard size heating element.  Easy to fit into the mouth as well.  Lovely new invention!	
1. 	This was perfect for traveling when my child was under 2. She loved the decorations on it and she was able to play with them. It is larger than an average pack n play, which was nice when she slept.	
1. 	I bought this as a baby shower present, but I also own one. I love it!!! It is so fashionable that people usually think it's a shawl and I'm just cold when I'm really pumping.	
1. 	My son used to have such bad gas, he'd scream for hours.  We'd have to give him Mylicon drops every two hours to keep him happy.  When we switched from a normal bottle to the Playtex Nurser system, we had no more problems.  He's happier, we're happier... These are the best bottles out there!	
- 1	I gifted this to a friend. It worked well for all of 1 day, and completely stopped working after that. They have since bought a simple one (unknown brand) which is working just fine. Amazon was amazing and gave me the refund even though my friends had thrown away all the packaging. I returned it in a sandwich / freezer bag.	
- 1	It may be cool to tilt toward the middle but if you get into an accident, the hard surfaces of the mirror could injure your child.  I'll stick to the cheaper soft versions :/	
1. 	This little bathtub is GREAT.  It has a nice texture to keep slippery baby in place while you're bathing her, and it's VERY soft.  One thing that added a little extra is it comes with its own (detachable) clothes hanger, making it easy to hang dry.This also makes a great back rest for momma's bath time!	
1. 	We love this seat so much, we ended up getting two...one for each of our bathrooms. Our 2.5yr old has no problem getting on this herself with the help of a step stool and she likes the fact that she's going potty like a grown-up. Our favorite thing about using this seat is no more cleaning out pee-pee and poo-poo (gets pretty gross when my girl has diarrhea) since it goes right in the toilet!	
- 1	I got the boppy for helping hold up the baby during breastfeeding. If you want a product for this purpose, I'd recommend trying a different one -- perhaps the breast friend? Because the edge of the boppy curves down, the baby falls into that crack / lower spot. It's just awkward. Also, it's better to have the baby's head higher than their tummy to avoid acid reflux (trust me -- you'll care about acid reflux :)), and so you'd have to somehow tip the boppy, which I never figured out how to do. I ended up not using it at all and just using a little square pillow under my arm that was holding her head, and no pillow under her bum.	
- 1	I actually bought this at Target, but please take note; this placemat is NOT intended for small toddlers. My 1-yr-old flings it onto the floor everytime we've tried to use it. Food everywhere! I'm hoping we can get some use out of it as she gets older, but as of right now it's been a waste of time and money. Not crazy about the silicone either as it gets mucky even when washed and folded.	
- 1	The instructions that come with this cup say it all: This product is leak-proof only when the lid is in the closed and locked position. That means when the cap is off and your child is drinking, it leaks!  There is an air hole in the top of this cup so that milk, water, juice, anything you put in the cup can come right out while you child drinks.  Forget it when your child turns it upside down, and they all do eventually - liquid streams out.  During the fist use, my son was swimming in a pool of milk.  I wish it did not have the air hole and it would have been the perfect straw cup - everything else is great.	
- 1	I'm surprised by the other good reviews of this cup.  It sucks for the purpose its supposed to have.  It does not mold to the forehead at all.  the whole cup squishes up so its just flat.  Its fine for rinsing the body but for keeping water out of the eyes its horrible.  and really you could use any old cup to rinse.  Such a waste of money.	
1. 	This item was probably the best money my husband and I spent on our daughter. Before this, she would fall asleep but flail her arms and wake herself up. Soon after my husband had learned how to do an extremely effective swaddle with just a normal blanket, not knowing these existed. Come to find out this just made life so much easier in order to avoid suffocation hazard. Our daughter was also able to get her arms out, particularly once she got older, but they always went over the wings, not under, so it wasn't a suffocation hazard. Basically, if you Velcro it extremely, and do it such that it is low, you should be fine. It's important to remember that you're trying to pin their arms to their sides, which means you can put the wing part pretty low, and it will make it harder for them to escape, and more likely that went they do, they escape with their arms above the wings.This had such a huge impact on my daughter's sleep. Now that she's 4 months she doesn't seem to need it anymore because she gotten too strong for it regardless of the size we puts her in. Most importantly this product allowed us to ensure that she continued sleeping for 8 hours/night while we got our rest. Highly recommended.	
1. 	It is awesome, because my back says thank you... It is so convenient, I recommend so much... Really I do...	
- 1	My infants arms get caught near tray and the tall legs.  The black area behind baby is very cheaply made.  It makes too much crinkle noise.  This high chair is more like the quality of a $50 high chair.	
1. 	Love the scent. And it lasts very long. My baby gets a top to toe massage using this Mustela Massage Oil every morning--and yet my first bottle lasted more than 6 months! How's that for great value for money?	
1. 	We just got this today so I can't comment on how it holds up over time, but I will say that it was a breeze to install.  I was a bit worried about the pressure mount because it was going to be between a wall and a bookshelf, but it's working out perfectly!  With the bigger extension, it fits like a glove and seems really sturdy.  I foresee much tripping over the lower bar in the future but that's the price I pay for wanting a swing-open gate.EDIT:  It's been nearly six months and even after being opened dozens of times each day and having a toddler hanging all over it from time to time it's holding up really well.  But do regularly check that it's installed tight enough, we usually adjust it every few weeks or so because it loosens slightly with use.	
- 1	Bought one and tried and tried and cannot get any kind of consistent reading with it. I seem to read as 97 or 104 degrees with readings taken a minute apart. We read all the directions and followed instructions and nothing seemed to improve accuracy. It doesn't seem to be better on the forehead or the ear. It just doesn't work reliably at all. I would never trust this to take my infant's temperature.	
- 1	The slots for the cords on the bottom of the cover are too small.  I wanted to be able to thread the powerstrip's cord up into that--but this is meant for thin wires like a lamp or something-- not a thick wire.  Also, it wouldn't cover the box of the cell phone charger, either.  This is for very basic wires and plugs.	
- 1	This product seemed like it would work so well, but in reality it is terrible!1) Lightweight diapers don't actually fall through hole. You have to poke them through.2) It is really loud when you close the lid. The clamps snap shut and are way too loud.3) Top heavy - it wants to fall over and has fallen over multiple times4) The lid does not want to latch half the time.	
1. 	With this sit my girl's back became strong very quickly and she discovered that she can hold her back straight very fast. Pushed her sitting time a lot faster. Get the table for it too. I put toys on it so she can play while sitting. Also, if you have small leaving space, it is a good alternative to a high chair. If you get a table attached, you can easily feed your lo there.	
- 1	It's ok not great. It's a slightly darker than the photo and the inside black circles fade quickly. Ive only had it a month. I was not impressed. I already bought another bag.	
- 1	I think this jumper will work better when my child is bigger, but it is not designed for babies. The bottom/seat is too wide, so my daughter's legs were losing circulation and turning purple after a short time. The bar that gives the seat shape is well padded in the front but not the back, which makes it uncomfortable/dangerous.	
1. 	My baby loves her bath time. I have only used the newborn side so far because she is 8 weeks old but the wedge in the base is perfect to hold her little butt in place so she doesn't slide in. And it fits perfectly in my kitchen sink. Well worth the price!	
- 1	Just received this item today. I purchased it because of the front-facing-out option, but will be returning it. I am being generous to rate it 2 stars because it does support baby's legs much better than other popular carriers that allow the baby's legs to just dangle. HOWEVER, it still does not even come CLOSE to supporting my daughter's legs knee-to-knee, which is what is really recommended in a carrier, and she just turned 6 mos today, is 28 long, and weighs 17 lbs- not an abnormally large baby. As others have mentioned, the fabric that supports the leg was so rigid and tight that it was a struggle for me to put my finger between her leg and the carrier- again, not a chubby baby- and it left indentations on her thighs after 10 min of wear. I can't imagine what it would do if she were in it for an hour! Also, she is in the 99th percentile for length and in the front facing out position, her face was shoved into the front of the carrier, even with it folded down, If a smaller baby were to be in this position, they would be face-first into the fabric, which defeats the purpose, not to mention would be uncomfortable and possibly a suffocation risk. Because the fabric was crossing her cheeks, she was constantly looking up to get away from it, which would get uncomfortable pretty quickly. The dangling straps were also fairly annoying. I was really hoping to love this carrier and it seemed like the best option, but sadly, it will be returned.	
1. 	I registered for this and got it at my baby shower and am so glad I did.  The nurses in the hospital always put my baby on her side to sleep using receiving blankets that were rolled up.  When I got home and used the Rest Assured it was wonderful.  My baby loves it and it is so easy to use and switch baby from side to side when you are laying her down.  It definitely makes me feel more comfortable when laying her down.  I don't have to worry about her choking if she spits up.	
- 1	I will never use this product given that sucking my kids noses will only give me an infection.  So I returned this product for a full refund and found a better alternative.  I purchased a nasal aspirator that connects to a vacuum cleaner hose.  So far it has been working very well.  My kids have severe nasal drip throughout the year and they have contracted throat infections and even bronchitis because of this problem BUT the aspirator I bought is very efficient!  It cleans easily and I don't put my own health at risk of catching their sickness. The nasal aspirator I purchased is called Baby-Vac product by Arianna.	
1. 	These are almost flat, so they're hard for even me to get out of the plug!  I've seen my daughter crawl over to them and try to touch the plug and she easily realizes there's nothing for her to play with and crawls away.  Very good design, unlike the one's that are bulky and easy to pull off.	
1. 	Very practical, not as bulky as a regular double, good looking, seems sturdy. It is of course bulkier than a single, but fit well in the trunk of a Nissan Rouge along with a pack and play and four large bags. Easy to fold, the storage basket could be better but that was easily fixed with the joovy parent organizer. I found the canopy small when assembling it, but the rotating feature actually makes it very useful. We bought it for a trip to Disneyland with a one year old and a three year old, both kids seemed confortable and both were able to nap in the reclining seat (it reclines just a bit, but enough for them apparently), and my three year old boy loved having choices and being able to easily hop on and off. I didn't find it too heavy or difficult to push, and i'm rather small (5 ft 1, 110 pounds). My almost six year old niece also enjoyed the bench when she got tired.	
1. 	I use this on my Maclaren Quest Sport.  Pros: you can fold it up with the stroller, and has extra storage for cell phone and maybe a diaper or two and travel wipes container.  Cons: didn't fit Avent bottles or larger sippy cups (we use Tommee Tippee), cup holders only fit pint sized waterbottles & other plastic bottles (like 20 oz soda for example)- and a definite NO to those paper take out cups(we learned the hard way) I bought a cheap cupholder seperately (Munchkin).  Overall, it is worth buying to save yourself some aggravation with the hard-to-access basket on the Maclaren stroller when seat is reclined.	
- 1	I cannot speak for the functionality of this stroller, unfortunately, because this stroller is going right back to where it came from. I just opened it up and saw the label that says it complies with California Technical Bulletin 117, which are flame retardants that have been shown to be toxic and completely unsafe for humans, not to mention, babies. I put it right back in the box to be returned. How dissapointing.This is a second product from Joovy that we will not get to use (first one is the play yard). They have what appear to be beautiful and well designed products. But the use of toxic chemicals is a deal breaker for me. Too bad. I was looking forward to testing out our new fancy lightweight stroller today.To compare, I have a Britax B-ready stroller that I love, and it does not have this label. To make sure, I checked their site. Here is what it states: As of January 1, 2013, BRITAX required all of its suppliers to eliminate certain chemical flame retardants containing bromine, chlorine or other halogens, from all components used in its car seats and all other products -- while still ensuring their ability to pass federal government standards for flammability. BRITAX is pleased to report that all of its suppliers have confirmed they are compliant with BRITAX's rigorous internal standards. Strollers do not have flammability standards. Therefore, BRITAX and BOB strollers are not treated with any chemical flame retardants. ([...])	
- 1	This paci holder is cute, but a little big. I only used it once because it just seemed so bulky.	
1. 	Perhaps the best baby wash product out there. Have used it with both my kids, and love how it leaves their skin soft and smelling great and not strong of perfumes.	
- 1	need a plug in version.  other than that it was ok.  we get along ok with out it. good idea	
1. 	Even flo is a good product but there are other brands out there. This is what we chose and will try something else for the next baby.	
1. 	These are fantastic. We have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. I use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm.	
1. 	My daughter is 4 1/2 months old and LOVES fruit... I let her suck on it but it always made me nervous... well, a teething baby + frozen fruit = happy girl! She absolutely loves these things and sucks the juice out of any fruit I put in it, plus the frozen fruit gives her poor gums some relief. I highly recommend these, just break out the bib because your little one will be drooling all over the place :)	
- 1	Yes, not all babies will get a flat head from sleeping in this sleeper, as the many good reviews reflect; however, I wish I read the reviews before getting the item myself.  I have to take my baby to a craniofacial specialist because of the flat spot that this sleeper caused on the right back side of her head.  My pediatrician noticed a flat spot at 2 months.  We stopped using the sleeper immediately, and now have to deal with constant re-positioning and keeping her off her head as much as possible to avoid getting a helmet to shape her head correctly.  Her head is still misshapen at 4 months, so we are off to the specialist.No, this will not happen to all babies - however, if I knew there was a slight risk I would never have taken the chance.	
- 1	This barely fits my baby's mattress and they are very thin. I don't expect these to last long at all.	
- 1	This looks like a cuddly lovey in the pic, they say it's a blankie, but it's really closer to a dog toy.  The entire thing is made out of noisy crinkly cellophane, so snuggling with it just startles the baby again and again.  It's much smaller than something like this should be, and the center is a big squeaky button like a dog toy.  The feet for chewing are made out of a very hard PVC like plastic rather than the softer silicon plastics you usually see on these things.  Have seen better versions of this idea.	
- 1	I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. It is a terrible product. It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby).I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk.	
1. 	Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!	
1. 	I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.	
- 1	I would actually give this fewer stars because we've gotten NO use out of it... but I think it's one of those personal preference things. My son just doesn't like it. We really thought he would - it's so soft and snugly. Thank goodness my mom also bought us the Fisher Price Soothing Massage Bouncer. He LOVES it. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. Wish I could give the papasan a better review - but my son gave it a thumbs down.	
1. 	This mobile was seriously my saving grace.  My son had colic and I could hardly ever put him down without him screaming.  But this mobile would keep his attention because of the color contrast on the black/white/red shapes.  I also love that you can change teh pieces on the mobile to make it a new mobile, keeping your baby's attention even more!	
- 1	TL;DR if you are looking for a great gate that will function well for 6 months, and inevitably break in unrepairable ways, this is the gate for you!I loved these gates.  We bought two of them and they were relatively easy to install and had been very effective at keeping our rambunctious 2 year old out of the kitchen and hallway.  The foot petal requires quite a bit of pressure, and even kept our 6-yr old nephew contained pretty well :)That being said -- their reliability over time is *horrendous*.  These gates come with only a 90-day warranty, and both gates started breaking in obviously flawed ways within 6-months.  The first gate stopped locking shut -- which is obviously a problem for a gate that is supposed to keep a 2 year old out of places.  The problem is that the spring-loaded plastic peg can actually separate from the spring inside the end of the swinging door.  I contacted the manufacturer and their customer support was very good!  They shipped out two replacement pegs and I was able to get the door working within a few days.  That being said -- the issue will certainly happen again, as there is nothing preventing the spring from separating.  This is a clear design flaw.Weeks later our second gate broke.  This time the foot petal stopped actuating the pin, so the door will not open.  After taking off the plastic assembly for the foot petal, I found that the metal pin which connects the plastic petal to the metal arm was completely broken (in two places).  After putting the pieces together, the issue became very clear -- the metal pin is tapered quite substantially in two places -- which is exactly where the pin broke.  With people putting significant force on the foot petal to open the gate -- dozens of times a day -- is really unacceptable to have such an obvious weak point in the design of the metal pin.The problem with the pin being broken is that there's clearly no way to actually reassemble the foot petal to the actuating arm -- even with a good pin.  There is no way to fix this broken gate.  Upon contacting the manufacturer's customer service, they confirmed that there is on way to fix the foot petal and there is nothing they are willing to do to address the broken gate.In the end, we regret having bought these gates, and I am rather disappointed that the manufacturer doesn't seem to acknowledge these design flaws in their gates.  I think it also speaks volumes that they offer 1-2 year warranties on almost all of their baby products -- except the gates.  Makes you really think...	
1. 	We installed a mobile and the paint scratched off almost immediately. The mobile hardly got any use, In fact, the crib was in our nursery and our baby slept in our room in a pack and play so I was surprised the mobile scratched the paint. Other than that it's a great crib.	
- 1	I tried it on my umbrella stroller and the cover looked hideous. It looked like I was pushing a big, grey, box. The fit was very poor and there wasn't much ventilation.Unable to refund this junk since I removed the blue film on the plastic panels.Waste of 50$	
1. 	This is such a cute playmat. My little guy likes it. It provides music, lights, and toys......plenty of activity to keep him busy for a little while!	
1. 	My daughter was ready to potty in public LONG before *I* was ready for her to potty in public.  This product has helped me catch up with her.  She gets to be more comfortable, and I can be less horrified that my kid is in contact with surfaces I can't bear to think about.This is not a replacement for your at home adapter, so expect to still be hands-on with your child, offering some support and stability.  My daughter is around 21 months and 25 lbs, and while I don't feel like she's going to fall in, I definitely feel better keeping my hands on her just in case.  It is a travel item, after all.  But it sure beats the butt-hover that happens without an adapter, and the folding action and the travel bag make this one a home run.  My daughter loves to carry the travel bag after she goes.  She's so proud of herself for using the big girl potty!I've already recommended it to all my potty training parent friends.  Such a great product!	
1. 	I've had this in my car a little over a year now (I use it with theBritax Advocate 65 CS Click & Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx).I found it was easy to position and has done a great job at keeping the fabric upholstery in my car from becoming badly creased by the weight of the car seat.I have a light color fabric and there has been no problem with dye bleeding onto my car. I think for the price, this is a great product and I'd recommend it. It's also handy because it has a little bag that you can use for a pacifer (makes it easy to locate a spare while driving).	
- 1	These work well in an emergency for the diaper bag, but not much else.  They are too small to really wrap a baby in, and are very thin and cheap looking.  I used one to cover the base for a diaper cake I was making for a baby shower and it looked cute, but I don't believe it is actually functional for everyday baby blanket use.	
- 1	I really REALLY want to like this cup. We live in an area where the temperature is above 100 degrees for three months in the summer. So having a cup to keep drinks cool is more of a neccessity than a convenience. I purchased one several years ago when my first child was small, and it was pretty horrible. 5  years later, I'm on child # 3 I decide to give it another shot, hoping maybe the design had been improved. I was disappointed again. While it did look like they had made some changes, I never got a chance to see if the flaws from the previous design had been remedied, because my son (who is almost 3) could not manage to get so much as one sip out of it. It's really a shame, because the thermos brand straw cups for kids are excellent, we LOVE them, but they aren't spill proof and there are just some occasions where spill proof is needed. We ended up returning this cup.	
- 1	It's crazy that I can't find a sippy straw cup that holds liquid without leaking and is not impossible to draw liquid out of!  This one doesn't leak unless my daughter drops it and it stays there for some time, and even then it just leaks a little bit.  But, it is SO hard to get the liquid out of through the straw.  I can hardly do it without busting an eardrum.  I have to take it from her between sips and squeeze the straw to get air back in the cup so she can sip again.  Yeah, she loves it when I take the bottle from her before she's done.  Same goes for the ones with the flippy lid thing.	
1. 	I bought this for my son, he is 12 months old and he is always messing up his cloths when he eats :) This really helps cut down on the mess! I love that its waterproof and has long sleeves. Also it is big enough to grow with him! The only thing that I wish were different is the tie in the back, they should have made them snaps instead.	
1. 	I love this pump. I was told by my doctor to pump to stimulate my milk supply and this totally helped. It is worth the money it costs. Think of it as an investment in your baby. Plus if you have more than 1 child you can use it again.	
1. 	I bought this for my baby girl when she was old enough to sit up at the table with us. She enjoyed sitting with us and she enjoyed the tray system that she could play with her food in. The chair is easy to take with you as it folds and it has two belts with buckles for you to secure it to whatever it will be standing on. The tray assy consists of three pieces: 1. the blue tray that snaps onto the seat (3 positions depending on your child's size) 2. The white tray that snaps onto the blue tray. That is where the food supposed to go, it is slightly smaller than blue, surely thinner and easier to clean in that sense. 3. The green cover to keep the white tray clean while you carry it.The green cover does not always stay put when being carried. My daughter wasn't having it with the white tray and would find it funny to snap it off the blue tray (nearly right after we started using the char). The blue tray she uses to this date as her eating tray if she's not sitting at the table. Recently we've been having her sit in this char but eat at the table like us.This tray in inexpensive and very functional. A few small design issues (mentioned above) were not safety related and we're able to live though them :)	
- 1	I used this on my baby who had a 102 degree fever.  She was hot to the touch.  This thermometer read 98.  It read low when I tested it on myself too.  I threw it away.	
1. 	I bought this a few days ago and use it all the time. It's great to throw down in the livingroom for the baby because it doesn't bunch up since it's thicker than a blanket. We took it on a  picnic today...it folds up nice and I keep it in the back of my car. You won't be upset with this purcahse!	
1. 	This held up great to two babiesand a lot of guest babiesand has been handed over to another expecting motherWashed wellstill looked goodthe music might drive you bonkers but....well that happens when you have a new baby and no sleep.BUT... if your baby is a rolling little thing they can knock it down if you don't have it standing up right	
1. 	Gerber Fun Grips are my favorite, they are easy to clean and they really are spill proof.  I use this size for water and juice and the bigger ones for milk.	
- 1	I used two bags of this detergent, I liked the hard water option. This product left stains on my diapers. I have switched to another brand that works much better than rockin green.	
1. 	These brushes are perfect for getting into the small spaces of my Medela breast pump pieces (the little channels inside the elbow-shaped piece, and the yellow piece that the valve flap goes onto). I've used them for over a year to clean the pump pieces, and I also use them on bottle nipples. They're also a perfect size for cleaning reusable straws. I've never used Dr. Brown bottles, but purchased these when I was specifically needing something to get into the smallest parts from the Medela pump.PROS:BPA FreeConvenientDurableEasy to useWashes Easily	
1. 	When our daughter started eating finger foods, she tended to get messier than she does when we spoon-feed her.  Even with a regular bib, I found myself spending a substantial amount of time treating her clothes for stains.  These bibs are great - waterproof, wide coverage, and a pocket to catch dropped or dribbled bits.  It doesn't hurt that they are cute, too.  I also like the fact that they are machine-washable, but if the mess isn't too big, you can also just wipe them clean.  I am spending a lot less time/money on stain removal on her clothes!  We'll likely buy more, as we have another baby on the way!	
- 1	Not so fun for my 7month old, for some reason she has not pay too much attention to this specific toy	
1. 	I recently got this pillow and I cannot tell you how wonderful it is! I can finally sleep! I'm 18 weeks, and I've been using 4-5 pillows a night to try and get comfortable. I haven't been able to fall asleep on my left side like is recommended; I've been sleeping sitting up and after the first bathroom wake-up I could sleep on my side. With this I was comfortable instantly and fell right asleep. I aslo fell back asleep after getting up to use the restroom right away (which is new!) It is incredibly comfortable, and easy to move around with if you like to flip over. It also comes with a sheet that shows you tons of different ways to use it (more than is shown online!) I adore it!!! Worth every penny! **I'd like to add, now that my daughter is 7 months old, that I adored that pillow all through my pregnancy, it was a God-send!	
- 1	I bought this for my laundry room that happens to have a bi-fold door. I followed the directions and it turns out this is too large and still allows for the door to open just enough to where little fingers can get pinched. I had hoped that this would keep the door from opening even the slightest bit. I would not recommend this product at all.	
1. 	They definately need to go back to the old model.  My son turns it on and off all morning and LOVES to watch the bubbles.  I believe the new one has lots of issues, but if you can find the old one, BUY IT!	
- 1	Absolutely the worst!  The little notches on the side are baby finger sized and they come right out.  Buy the old school kind for REAL safety!!!	
1. 	I was going to get the spindle changing table from POttery Barn Kids but found this one, at about 1/3rd of the price. This one is even better b/c of the rail that goes around the actual changing area.. i do recommend a contoured changing pad with a comfy cover. i have attached a crib mobile to this table to keep katie happy during diaper time. this changing table looks good in her room, i also bought the Jenny Lind crib. i did get the baskets from PBK to store stuff neatly on the shelves. The only complaint that i have is that the shelves are basically hard cardboard, but dont let that discourage you b/c they really are sturdy and as i mentioned i've got baskets on the shelves so you really dont notice.	
1. 	Really nice changing table!  I accidently cracked a piece of it while assembling, and the manufacturer sent me a new piece in a week or so.  Really easy to assemble.	
1. 	I wanted a wipe warmer for the simple fact of making diaper changes more comfortable for my son. This works so great as long as you frequently check the sponge at the bottom. It's very easy to do so don't let the other reviews fool you. All you have to do is press down on it and see if any moisture comes up. If you let it dry out, it's useless because it gets brick hard-trust me. I'd say you have to re-wet it twice a week and I would buy a new one every 3 months like it says. I don't put the whole holder filled with wipes and that makes it easier. I'd also rather not use any pop up wipes with it because using that mechanism doesn't keep them as warm. I like to open up the whole top part and pull out a nice warm wipe instead of a half way warmed wipe thru the top hole. And I've never had a problem with the top not staying latched-yes, I have used the top part plenty to know this.I made the mistake of letting my sponge get dry and it turned brown and hard so I already need to buy a new one before I can use it again. I also didn't buy distilled water, just used water out of our Brita pitcher and that works fine.The reason I gave it 4 stars is how often you have to maintain the water level of the sponge. It would be nice if you didn't have to check it so often and worry about it drying out so quick and turning into a brick.But it works great for its intended use and keeps baby happy as well.	
1. 	I wanted a mirror that rotated in so that I could easily see my baby. I have a GMC Terrain, so the mirrors that attach to the window wouldn't work. This mirror attached easily to the headrest (even though mine don't adjust). It give a clear image with NO distortion! I would recommend this item to other parents!	
1. 	i bought this when my twin sons were 4 months old, and they're still using it at 8 months.  i'm not sure what the other reviewer said about dye leaking, they have thoroughly chewed everything they could reach and we have not encountered that problem.  we tried to get away with just one exersaucer, but they both loved it so much we broke down and bought another.  it's provided hours of entertainment, and ranks up there with the kick n'play bouncer in terms of usefulness.  the only drawback is that although every square inch is crammed with toys for my little ones, the exersaucer came fully disassembled, and my poor husband spent almost 3 hours putting the two together.***UPDATE***my sons loved this exersaucer until they were 11mos old.  then they started walking and no longer like it, but looking back this has been the most worthwhile investment of all the various infant toys.  when your kid (in my case twins) outgrows toys every month or two, you really appreciate the staying power of a toy that can last 6 months!	
- 1	I have tried several cloth diaper covers, including this one. After liking the Bummis Super Brite, I thought the Whisper wrap would be as good. Sadly, I was mistaken! There are no gussets and poop definitely leaks more through the legs. ALso, there is no real moisture barrier material lining the cover. I could hardly call this cover water proof. It is soaking wet with pee in the mornings and we use both a prefold with microfiber inserts at night.Buy Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps instead or if you like the big velcro of Bummis (my reason for buying), stick with the Super Brite model.	
1. 	I do not know if it is easy to use, this is to help my sister to buy a child, he had not been born, so not useful.	
- 1	Go get the ones from target instead these are too thin. They soak through too easily and are a little bit rough. Also they are mostly white and have a dated look to them. Buy something else.	
- 1	This is the second Yookidoo bath toy we've owned that stopped working only a couple of months after we got it.  Changing the batteries didn't help.  These toys are WAY too expensive for the shoddy craftsmanship they provide.  I've tried to e-mail Yookidoo with no response so I guess their customer service is non-existent as well.  The only reason they get two stars is because my daughter did like the toy while it worked.	
- 1	I bought this because I saw many reviews that this fit the Pack n Play.  Without looking at dimensions (silly me) I purchased this and went off of the reviews.  This may fit other Pack N Play's but it DOES NOT fit the Pack N Play's that come with the Cuddle Cove and Changing Table.	
1. 	Nice design. Goes well with everything ( except bright red ). There are more cool additions for it in your local baby's r us.If the sheet they included was 100% cotton, it would have been 5 stars.	
- 1	We have twoGroVia One Size All-In-One Diapersin our one size stash which were hands-down one of our favorite diapers for our older daughter before she potty trained, so I had high hopes for the GroVia newborn AIO when we got one in a newborn cloth diaper package.  Unfortunately, our expectations were not met.While this is the first time we've cloth diapered in the newborn stage, we are not new to cloth.  We know how to prep diapers and followed the instructions from GroVia to launder 4-5 times before using.  We have been disappointed that this AIO has leaked every single time we've used it!  I believe the leaking is due to the microfleece inner extending into the ruffle at the leg openings, which allows pee to wick right out to the baby's clothing, car seat, swing, mei tai, and/or parental clothing.The only positive is that it's a nice looking, trim AIO which dries reasonably quickly.  The prints are cute, but due to the persistent leaking issues this is the absolute last diaper in our newborn stash that I will reach for.  Unfortunately the little one is not quite big enough yet for our one size GroVia AIOs.	
1. 	Ok gate, my son figure it out how to open it at 18 mo old, so went to plan B and did tie a scarf on the lower part of the door to keep it shut! Overall sturdy but you can find better considering Customer Service does not exist in USA, Canada only without toll free number, not good!!!!	
- 1	I thought this was a model that I had purchased many years ago fro my last child, and it turns out to have changed. It is awkward to place in the kitchen sink, and is odd to place the baby in. My daughter is still quite small, so it may get better the larger she becomes, however, in comparison to other tubs that I have owned, this is by far the worst.	
1. 	I ordered these and they are perfect for a baby room. I use one of them for diapers, another for laundry, and the third one holds all of the headbands for my daughter.	
1. 	When we found out we were having triplets, we like all other multiple parents bought a stroller to accommodate all the babies. The stroller is so large that we can not even fit it into a mini van. We have to purchase a large SUV or Full size van to go anywhere.We bought the Latch Lock carriers from baby trend and we just love them. When we saw the stroller that went along with them. We decided to order the Double Snap N Go.The stroller comes all put together, you just need to snap on the wheels. Then comes the fun part. The stroller is made for many different brands of carriers. You find the carrier you are using in the instruction manual and then you remove bars or rearrange them to fit your carrier. It is very simple and all the parts are well labeled.The carriers just snap on to the top, just like when you snap them into the base that is in the car. There is a strap that goes over the lower half of the carrier to prevent it from rocking or coming off the stroller. It is great because you do not have to unsnap your baby from the car seat and them snap them into the stroller. No need to transfer toys and blankets from car seat to stroller. What a time saver.It is very light weight and easy to set up. I pull it out of the trunk and just snap and lock it into place. I then just snap the carriers in place and we are off. It takes up the same amount of room that a normal single travel system would take up.For all you shoppers out there. I took the stroller into a women's clothing store and was able to easily navigate the store. The stroller handles very well. The front wheels are adjustable. You can set them for straight ahead or let them rotate.Because we have 3 babies, we easily become a tourist attraction. The stroller handles so well that I was able to move swiftly and accurately through spectators and display racks.We love the Double Snap N Go so much that we have asked for the Single Snap N Go for our Baby Shower.	
1. 	This stroller is so light and easy to use. We just pop the graco snugride car seat in and we are off. Much easier and lighter than a heavy travel system. And you can't beat the price. Great item!	
1. 	This bib is super cute, and washes nice, but I really did notlike the velcro fastener.  My baby got a cut and a scratchedbeck of the neck from this velcro.  It is sharp and I was nothappy about that.  Make sure you secure the velcro overlappingit to prevent scratching.  I am not liking velcro bibs anymore.	
- 1	I could still smell the poopy diapers in this pail. I think that is how it is with every pail though.  So, I don't use a pail anymore. I just bring her diapers downstairs and put them in the garage ASAP.	
1. 	Looks good. I don't open it, it looks very good and beautiful. Hope my daughter like it and enjoy playing on it..	
- 1	I'm beyond sad.  I love these bibs.  They are the only ones I've found that don't leak drool onto my LO's clothes, but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO's best white outfits.  (I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it's been washed at least twice before bleeding) I'm hoping it will wash out, but I'm not holding my breath.  I haven't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set.  (I haven't used the pink girl ones though.) I'll still continue to use these bibs, but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more.  (Though, I'm not sure if there is anything else out there.)My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle.  I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby's head and it's easier to get on and off.	
1. 	This play gym has survived through two children and looks just as great today as it did when we bought it. We wash the mat and the plush toys often. The items are easy to clean. The butterflies do not spin automatically like I kind of assumed they might, but they are fun for the kids none-the-less. Colorful with great sounds and great detachable toys.	
1. 	I actually read reviews from other sources (like consumer reports and such) before I bought this gate. This is rated the top gate for the top of the stairs. My husband installed the gate with no problems, although we did use larger screws than the ones that came with it, and we made sure it was screwed into a stud. The locking mechanism isn't the most convenient (it doesn't lock automatically when swung shut), but it is secure and sturdy. My two-year-old cannot unlock this gate, but his 6-year-old cousin was able to, which is fine because a 6-year-old won't fall down the stairs! We had the problem of a gap in between the gate and the top stair just because of the location of the stud, but the gap is not large enough to crawl through or get stuck in. We also purchased the accompanying kit that connects the gate to a wooden banister, preventing damage. If you don't purchase any extra supplies (either the kidco kit or your own hardware), both ends will screw into the wall and/or banister. Overall, I think this was a great purchase. I know my son and soon-to-be-crawling daughter will not be able to get down the stairs!	
- 1	I bought this to match the theme for my baby's room (we have the matching hamper, bedspread, bumper).  I always wash everything before using it.  But as soon as it came out of the washing machine (and I was all of my baby's things with gentle cycle & cold water), the blanket was pilling and fuzzed up.  In fact, the rest of the load (my baby's clothes) were all covered in the fluff!  I had to re-wash the load without the blanket.A BIG disappointment!  Love the colors and design but need to be made with better quality!	
1. 	This step stool is the perfect size!  Bought it for our 2 year old and he is able to carry it from bedside to bathroom with no problems.  It is very sturdy and has no sharp edges.  Great, simple product!	
- 1	I told myself that if I ever got pregnant again that I would splurge on a pregnancy pillow!  Well, I did and hated this thing.  After 2 nights with it, I could not tolerate it.  Both mornings I woke-up with a sore neck and there is not a good way to turn it over in the middle of the night when you are covered by a sheet.  I actually, had to get out of the bed, pull the sheet back, flip the pillow over, and hop back into bed.  If the pillow was on the edge nearest the side of the bed, good luck trying to get out in the middle of the night for restroom break!  The leg support was the only thing that was decent.  I decided this was not a splurge; I will take my 10 pillows any day over this uncomfortable pillow!	
1. 	This bib works great for my daughter. It's a nice big size which is helpful since she is so messy! And the pocket does a great job of catching her leftovers.	
1. 	Easy to use and install. A little loose/wobbly on my toilet, even with the size adjustments, but not in a way that makes it ineffective...yet.	
1. 	I really like how this product hid the plugs and kept my son from unplugging/plugging the electronics.  It is very hard however for me to open it, but I guess that's the point.	
- 1	I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.	
- 1	I like the concept a lot but this blows around too much in the wind and doesn't stay put. I am trying to use it with my son sitting up &#34;normally&#34; in the stroller - I wonder if it would have worked better when I had him in the infant carrier seat?I remember reviews saying it worked ok in the wind, so if I am missing some sort of tip, let me know!	
1. 	I chose to register for the Diaper Champ for convenience.  You can use a plain ole garbage bag instead of purchasing something separate.  What busy mom has time to run out to get special bags?  In 5 months I've had one instance of a terrible smell and it was just a really bad diaper - we all know those.  :)  It's very easy to clean and so easy to use.	
1. 	These are the best bibs in on the market!  We've been using and laundering my sons set of Dr. Seuss Bumkims for two years now, and they still look brand new.You can machine wash and dry, which is what I usually do, but you can also hand wash them very easily and they dry in no time at all.  They come in so many cute designs and I love how small they fold up for travel.I have a newborn daughter and purchased her a set while I was still pregnant, as I knew it was all I would ever use later on down the line when she is able to eat solids.Don't bother wasting your money on anything else, just get these.  They're so reasonably priced on Amazon for how good they are and the use you'll get out of them!	
- 1	It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid. It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids. For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably. Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss. If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance. But should not have any issues in carpet. Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product. Going back to fisher price bouncers.	
1. 	I bought this co-sleeper to use when my baby outgrows the By Your Side Sleeper which will be very soon. I was looking for something safe to put baby in to cosleep. The By Your Side Sleeper was great to use for the newborn stage and to have baby safely right in bed with you. But I needed something bigger and the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper was the answer. I have it set up in co-sleeper mode but I don't have it attached to the bed yet. I am currently using it as a changing table to get baby used to it so I can hopefully transition easier soon. The co-sleeper is a nice size and I like that it has mesh all around the mattress area on the liner for breath ability. I also love that the co-sleeper turns into a playard so I can use it after outgrows co-sleeper. It's a great value. It's a 3 in 1 deal for me: extra changing table so I don't have to go to baby's room for diaper changes in middle of night, co-sleeper soon, and then playard.I did buy extra things for the co-sleeper.I had to buy theArm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Leg Extension Kit, Naturalsince we have a high bed with a pillow top mattress. I haven't put them on since I haven't attached to bed yet.I boughtContinental Quilting Quilted Waterproof Multi-Use Padfor extra cushion on top of the mattress pad and it will also absorb any leaks that might happen. It fits the co-sleeper great and covers the whole mattress pad.I also boughtAmerican Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play Sheetsince I wanted a nicer softer sheet. It fits the co-sleeper perfectly and its super soft.	
- 1	This item just wasn't very sturdy and eventually just fell apart. I couldn't even figure out how to get it back together. I think if you keep it stationary it might be okay. It supports a baby's weight and all that, but... don't move with it. It'll let you down.	
1. 	baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome. especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty. Ziplock is useful but not reuseable. It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots. This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.	
1. 	With two babies learning to crawl and going every which way, I needed a solution, pronto! The Superyard XT was a lifesaver. Although it's not perfect, we found solutions to make it work for our twins.Pros:* Huge area for two babies plus an adult - We have the regular 6-sided superyard with one extension (2 panels), to make it eight sides. The dimensions are 80 x 80 if you use it as an octagon.* Toy stations can be set up on each corner and toys attached to the sides, including any that would work on a crib. Rotate them frequently to keep your child interested* ATiny Love Classic Mobileworks great with the Superyard as it's huge, safe to use until they are standing.* It's big enough to give freedom to your child but small enough to fit in your home.* 35 wide x 26 inch high panels are easy for an adult to step over. I wouldn't recommend it for a pregnant mom however.* Easy to clean - can be use indoors or outdoors* Adaptable panels are great for childproofing - we've used panels to keep kids away from windows and from large TVs, wedging ends between heavy furniture and securing them firmly.* Extremely durable - we've had this for three years, used it for many playgroups, and several families have borrowed and used it. It still looks new.Cons:* It would be ideal if it had a child-proof gate - the sides are very hard to open and the playard becomes very unsteady once you do this.* Your child will be able to slide it around if it's not secured. We bought inexpensive interlockable foam pads from BJs, placed the superyard over them, marked along the inside and cut them to size. It won't budge like this. For ease in reassembling later, mark the tiles from left to right and from top to bottom in order as it will be like a jigsaw if you take the tiles apart.* To keep your child from pulling the foam tiles apart, place a large quilt over the foam mat, tuck the ends under and you're set to go. Amazon sells many inexpensive microsuede machine washable ones - make sure is more than 80 wide.* Toddlers may be able to climb out if they're barefoot or wearing socks. Putting shoes on them solves the problem.* This is hardly portable, no matter what it says. Once set up, it's there to stay. With eight sides, it's on the heavy side.Look under product images or my profile, I have lots of pictures posted of how you can adapt the Superyard, cut the foam tiles, make lots of play stations inside it and turn your living room into your very own preschool. Just kidding, sort of.	
1. 	I use these to freeze homemade purees for my baby.  Once the purees are frozen, I store the cubes in large freezer bags.  To get the cubes out of the tray, I just turn them upside down and run hot water over it for a few seconds.  Then they easily come out when you twist the container a bit.  I wish I had these trays when I was making food for my first baby, it really is a great help and saves space in my freezer to store them this way!	
1. 	i received this pump at the hospital where my son was born. i also have an electric pump, but this one is very handy, is easy to pump and works really well. it is also easy to clean.	
1. 	... the rest of the items were!  I just can't seem to get enough suction out of the aspirator for it to work.It has everything you need, and the carrying case isn't bulky.  It really is a good investment!	
- 1	This is a cute but very small and super thin blanket. I'm not sure there are any functional reasons to have it. You can't swaddle with it and it's too thin to offer any warmth.	
1. 	This product does what it says - it remains by bedside - is sturdy - saves you getting out of bed when feeding and is comfortable enough for my baby who has been sleeping there for over three months. It is a little short but this is OK and is still safer than a normal bassinet.	
- 1	These are my least favorite cloth diapers and pretty much just 'back ups' in the rare case where laundry got put in too late and nothing else is left.I was excited to find another AIO diaper that seemed to be designed similar to swaddlebees (our favorites) and reasonably priced, so I bought 4.  I bought two cat in the hat, a turtle, and a bloom flower design (we have b/g twins). My husband immediately HATED them because of the ridiculous number of snaps, but I didn't mind as much.  However what I did notice immediately, was that the absorbent material on the inside of the diaper was very thin.All it takes is one pee, and this diaper is soaked through.  I haven't had any major blow outs, but because they hold so little, I've tended to only put them on when I know chances of a poo are low.I've had these for six months now and recently noticed that as soon as they are peed in, they feel wet.  EVERYWHERE.  On the OUTSIDE of the diaper.  Not just leaking at the leg holes or the top wet, but through the PUL, front, back everywhere.  I've stopped using them altogether and keep them as a last resort in case I forget to do laundry.  I won't be buying anymore of these for sure!  Sided note- the turtle diaper is made of a different, less shiny PUL and hasn't started leaking through the PUL ... But I still rarely use it because it doesn't hold enough liquid, especially now that they are getting older and pee more!	
1. 	Fantastic little booster seat.  It's the only one we own.  Perfect for our small home where a traditional stand alone sort of high chair just won't fit around our table (I use it on an IKEA Stefan chair).  My little one has been using it for the past couple of months, starting at about 7 months of age.  Easy to adjust straps and simple to snap on to any chair.  We've carried and used it on long trips to grandma's, at various restaurants and it has worked perfectly each time.I've never used the removable tray and lid.  No need to-- the snap-on tray washes easily.  After a few very messy eating sessions I've taken the whole chair into the tub for a wash down... so easy!I highly recommend this seat.  It's made of a sturdy plastic that looks like it's going to hold up for a very long time to come.  It's way more useful AND economical then any stand alone high chair.	
1. 	Not only does this blanket look great and feel great, it's so practical.  It folds up super easy and always compact into it's own carrying case.  It's so easy to clean and big enough for a few people to enjoy.  This is a must if you like to picnic or spend any time at the beach, park, etc.	
- 1	My child could care less about these little rattles. The socks, I'm afraid, can't be called socks. I dont know whose feet they are made to fit, but they can't fit my newborn! They have no stretch to them. And she was only 7 pounds when I purchased these! Cute idea though.	
1. 	Great price for 2 of these shields... I have been using shields since day 1 with my daughter so I am quite experienced. I have no trouble using them, and actually like the thickness of them as I wear them daily. Daughter has no issues with the shield either. Overall great price for 2 shields!	
1. 	It is really a great idea this speepSack. I do not have to worry of SIDS with my newborn. I really recommend this product.	
1. 	The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is a very obliging unit. It services all types of containers, and of differing sizes too. It can warm disposable, oversized, and odd shaped bottles, glass babyfood jars, and tin cans to name a few. It's small in size, measuring 5 x 5 x 5  high. Thus, it occupies very little room on the counter, or bedside table. A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer, and is removable for larger items. On the front of the unit is a dial control. It has 3 settings, 1,2, and 3, 1 being the coolest. Next to the dial is a power light, which serves 2 purposes.1.) It indicates the unit is ON and working, and2.) When the water reaches the correct temperature, the power light blinks ON and OFF to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer. For that reason, one must unplug it after each use. With a rather lengthy cord, 3 feet long, it is very adaptable. For those concerned about d&eacute;cor, the all white exterior is designed to blend in. In addition, the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable. By that, I mean it's lightweight; it weighs 1 pound, and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag. We traveled frequently when William was an infant, and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles, i.e. Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience:Right off the bat, I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day, as I was unable to breastfeed. Thus, I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer. Pop a bottle in the unit; plug it in, and in 5 minutes it's done. How difficult is that? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast, evenly, and it's durable. Moreover, now there's no more white, icky, stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer, I never encountered any problems. Let me tell you, this unit got a workout in my house. I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual. I know ~ geek alert. Okay, that's true, but it's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming. I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk, because I'd get distracted. Consequently, running a timer became apart of the routine. If Avent were to add an external timer, this would be extremely helpful to users. I almost never used the coolest setting, only when thawing frozen breastmilk, and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles. Both were rare occasions. I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator, and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here's another tip, adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product. Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch. I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue. Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience; although, a power strip would solve that problem. Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed. I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer. An hour might go by before I realized my mistake. Now that's a fire hazard!Closing Remarks:When it comes to bottles, Avent is still my 1st choice. I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand. I guess that goes to show... input from customers can, and does influence manufactures. Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer, which would certainly increase the price. However, I for one would be willing to pay for those added features. Would you? While writing this review, I've debated how to rate this product. I was extremely pleased with this warmer, but I also recognize its shortcomings. I've opted to give this product an above average mark, because1.) It did what it was supposed to do. It warms bottles fast, and evenly.2.) It accommodates plastic, glass, tin, and a myraid of bottles styles.3.) Warms disposable bottles, and bottle liners, and4.) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding,Mary	
- 1	I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all	
- 1	it's possible that my little one is too little, but she doesn't play with these blocks, they don't stack all that well, and i just don't get the value.	
- 1	These bags are a great size! I can fit up to 4 prefold diapers in them and always have one in my bag. I was disappointed to find that after washing them only a few times, they became hard to close. I've since had to replace the string. It lasted for about 4 months of heavy use before the stitching started to come loose and I had to throw them out.	
- 1	He wasn't into these at all, the linking things was sort of interesting but just not that great. So he'd play for about 30 secs then run off, waste of money for us.	
- 1	Not user friendly.  Don't waste your money.  Grasping the door knob, squeezing, and turning, is not easily done.  More difficult if you have little hands.	
- 1	I purchased this set for my toddler because he was demanding his own fork and spoon at mealtimes, and he did not want the plastic kiddie ones we had. Since regular forks and spoons are a bit large for his mouth, I found this set. Well, he doesn't like it. He still prefers adult forks and spoons, which he uses with success. The spoon in this kiddie set is too wide to fit in a toddler mouth, and the fork's tines are so dull, he can't stab anything with them. Otherwise, they're nice quality, but not meeting our needs.	
- 1	I purchased this gate to contain my cat that was peeing/pooping throughout the house and to eventually limit where my son can go once he learns to crawl. It's not the prettiest looking gate but it's reasonably priced so I figured I would give it a try. The espresso color looks a lot better than the cream... Anyways, if you have baseboard molding that's more than an inch high, you won't be able to install this gate as the top and bottom can't both be flush against the wall. Already that limited where we could install the gate. When we found a spot that would allow us the install the gates, my 13 lbs cat (not the problem cat) managed to knock the gate over. When we placed it at the top of the stairs, the gate found its way to the bottom. If a cat can knock these down, I'm scared to see what would happen when my son begins to move around!	
1. 	I like this product, as does my son (though he hasn't quite figured out how to jump yet). But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper.	
1. 	Not only is this bib super cute...it is super easy to clean. Literally just wipe it off and its good to go for next time.Awesome bib...much better than the other wipe clean bibs out there. Will definately be buying a couple more!!	
- 1	This car is cute and small. As another reviewer mentioned, it's about the size of a soft-ball. I was expecting that when I purchased it. However, I was expecting the pops to be more forceful-- you can hardly tell that the balls are popping-- they move just as much from the car moving. Also, the wind-up feature on the car I received appears to be defective-- it is stuck and doesn't roll forward. So, basically I ended up with an expensive rattle. Good idea, just wish it worked better!	
1. 	My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.	
1. 	This product is well made and does a great job of painting stars all over a dark room for a child's security at night.  My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loved the idea of starting the turtle before she climbed into bed.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was some way to plug it in and leave the thing on all night.  the timer is great for those who don't want to use it as a permanent night light but for me, it was the only negative.	
- 1	Nice product and quality. But our formula we use (enfamil nutramigen) you cant heat it. So now we dont use it. Hut either way our baby boy didnt care if it was warm or room temp.	
- 1	Camera died within 6 months of purchase. I called and they are sending me a new camera but I have to wait until they receive my faulty one in the mail and then wait a couple more days for the new one to ship. Kind of a bummer.Picture quality is not terrific. I purchased this because it was on sale, but kinda wish I sprung for a nicer one. You get what you pay for. You only get a color picture if the room is completely lit and even then the colors are extremely muted - not vibrant.Was somewhat pleased before it died, now I'm just irritated.	
1. 	Great item. Has nice sounds and is very very soft.Our boy likes it a lot as does his cousins (gifts).	
- 1	The toy is nice, but the tunes are tinny and not good quality. I would not recommend this to a friend.	
1. 	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!  I used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.  It was such a pain to use.  We all hated it.  The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.  And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.  It takes regular trash bags.  I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.  And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!  If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!	
- 1	I returned these cups because my 10mo son could not extract the milk from them. It appears that you need to bite the straw and suck before you can get anything. Not a good product design. I ordered them because I like the look and functionality of the removable handles however, its not usable.	
- 1	I was very excited to get this sling.  I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby.  The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc., and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements.  My 2 mo. old dd is very comfortable sitting in it.That said, I would not buy it again.  My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in.  The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting).  The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well.	
1. 	Love this thing.  Relatively cheap, comes in various colors, has an adjustment knob to 'fit' various toilet sizes, the hooks allows you to hang it (added a tacky hook to bathroom wall) and best of all it doesn't have the creavises other seats have - let me explain.  Had another potty seat that was 'cushioned' -&#62;  not sure why a kid needs a cushioned seat, it is not like they will be sitting reading the newspaper for ten minutes at a time - anyway, it didn't take long for the vinyl cushion to get pee and other 'gunk' stuck between the cushion and the plastic rim - and then you have to look at it each time to put it on the toilet.  This is a better option.	
1. 	I bought this seat because I was disgusted at how my 3 year old had to put his hands on the toilet seat to steady himself on public toilets. I am SO HAPPY with this purchase, it fold and fits right in your diaper bag..even a smaller one like a ju-ju-be between! The storage bag it comes with is just a large zip lock style bag so I'm going to be looking into a cloth wet bag to store this in instead so I can wash it when needed :)	
- 1	my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).  The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.  Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.  I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.  Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.  I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?  Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.	
- 1	These are called Toddler Spoons, but the handle is way too thin for a toddler to use to feed himself. However, the rubber end is so wide that it is really too large for a baby. The result is a weird toddler/baby hybrid spoon that you may be able to use with older babies 9-12 months, but will just need to replace with the fatter handled toddler spoons once baby tries to begin feeding herself. (Also the surface is mostly flat, so it is fine for thick baby food that just sits on top of the spoon, but won't work on thinner foods. I wish I had skipped this purchase and gone straight from the smaller baby spoons to the thick-handled toddler spoons.	
- 1	I had the Jeep window shades in my Tundra, but when we bought the Camry, the shades were too big. So I bought these, hoping that installation would go better and they would be the right size. Not only were they not the right size, but they were flimsy and not tinted near enough to make a difference. I probably could have ripped one of them if I hadn't thrown them away first. We ended up reusing the Jeep shades and cutting them to size with a razor blade. They work soooo much better.	
- 1	After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be great but it didn't work with my little one.  The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality (hence the 2 stars) but it's not easy to put on and once it is on, my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar.  It's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use.  They are soft and easy to work with. If you prefer plastic, the softer ones are better.	
- 1	Great price but the plastic buckles that hold the cover on regularly pop apart, the toy bar is not very secure at all and my baby actually lifted it off by himself today. No big deal, just thought it was poorly designed. The lion head pillow is too thick and my sons head was sliding off to one side so he ends up leaning until I just quit using the pillow, but the top of the cover has a flap that goes across the back upper half and creates a taut line right across the back of where the babies head lies which I assume is why they added the pillow. We only use this thing now for a minute or two here and there, just not sturdy or comfy enough to me. We have a FP rainforest friends rocker / bouncer that we love. It's more $ but to me it's hands down worth it.  It also doesn't sink at low as this one does which I like a lot better. Has much better back support for the little guy. The FP one has been great too for naps when we are away from home.	
1. 	This is a pretty good sheet. It looks good, but it is a tad loose for my taste. The looseness is unattractive and makes the pattern kind of sag. It does not seem to be loose enough to cause any difficulties for baby to me though.	
1. 	We used a Stork Craft crib and dresser in our nursery and turned to them again for our son's &#34;big boy&#34; room. These sets are well wrapped and arrive safely, and are relatively easy to put together (maybe not quite as nice as IKEA). We definitely used screwdrivers and drills, not the included allen wrench. :) Overall it looks nice, but I'm disappointed that the finish of the various pieces doesn't match very well. (One drawer front, for example, is noticeably lighter than the others, and a few others had flaws in the finish that were clearly not due to shipping.) The drawers feel a little loose when you open and close them with one hand, as if they're not quite set on the rails well. (Obviously this could be user error when putting it together as well, but we didn't have the same problem with the other Stork Craft dresser.) Finally, the wall-mount (critical for a toddler's room) doesn't appear to be very sturdy and could potentially damage the wall. The high back and wide sides of the dresser top look great but prevent the use of after-market wall mounts that need to attach flush to a side.Still, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture and a great value.	
- 1	Don't spend the extra $ on the light - It doesn't do anything.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this product.  Even after all of my friends told me I didn't need a separate appliance to make babyfood (just use your food processor!), I went ahead and bought it.  I had read the reviews and I knew that it wouldn't cook a lot at a time, so I wasn't expecting to make mass quantities of babyfood, just to make it easier to give my daughter whatever veggies we might be eating that night.  Well I'm pretty dissapointed -- almost everything I've tried in isn't as cooked as it needs to be.  I find the machine to puree the food when it's half raw, resulting in a lumpy mess.  I've tried mixing the food with breastmilk and pureeing it further, and then it just tastes like raws veggies pureed with breast milk.  Gross.  I have also tried cooking the food for longer than the recommended times, but I guess the steam isn't strong enough, because it's never cooked enough.  I've tried sweet potatoes, green beans and carrots, all with disastrous results.  Lesson learned - next time I'm just going to cook the food in the oven or in a steamer and then throw it in the food processor.	
- 1	Great concept, but I do not like these. They are hard to open (which I realize is good for the child, but I still don't like it) as well as near impossible to really clean.	
1. 	I thought the regular Bumkins bibs were great, and then I got these! With cold weather came long sleeves and I was tired of pulling my 17 month old daughter's sleeves up, which only sort of worked anyway - she is a messy eater and getting into a defiant stage. These have been wonderful! No liquid soaks through, and the sleeves fit well so they drag in the food and are not cumbersome. The fabric is lightweight and breathable. We even used them with her formal Thanksgiving dress and, as usual, not a single drop or stain on her outfit. Now if they just made something for the hair and face! Hahaha! Seriously, best bib ever.	
1. 	This is worth it. I haven't seen a baby who didn't love this. This will buy you enough time to take a shower (hang it in the doorway so you can supervise) or dinner with your family. Alternate this with an exersaucer for a nice change of pace.	
1. 	With baby #2 arriving we pulled out all the Dr. Brown bottles but had used the cleaning brushes they originally came with. 2 packages of these later and we're in shape. Great for cleaning all the little pieces and useful for sippy cups with straws too- bottle brushes never can clean those.	
1. 	I bought this brush to replace an old bottle brush that had the foam on the end coming off.  I figured it would be pretty average and that I'd probably be looking for a new brush in a few months, boy I was wrong!  This brush is actually really soft but effective at cleaning.  I've only used it for straw style sippy cups, but it does a great job cleaning out all the nooks and crannies and the nipple cleaning end is pretty good for wider straw openings.  I'd imagine this would work great for bottles too.I make sure to sterilize the brush with boiling water often since it's coming into contact with my child's cups.  I never use the brush for anything other than sippy cups and other kids dinnerware (adult dishes have their own brush).So far, really happy with the purchase and the price/delivery of the product.	
1. 	PROS:1. Inconspicuous2. Let Down starts in the first 2 minutes3. QUICK - 15 max mins per breast4. Can pump two breast at a time5. Plenty of accessories to start with (and spares)6. Durable (this bag has been with me everywhere, including travel and still holding strong)7. Can be used in a CAR with the attachementCONS:1. Not very quiet (I use cloth to reduce the noise)	
- 1	I wanted to like these so bad but they're useless.  First of all, they leak right through (for me).  I don't mind but they are also quite bulky and thick.	
1. 	I did a lot of research on different bottle brands while pregnant, and settled on the Playtex nursers as our first try.  While I planned to breastfeed our baby, I knew I would be returning to work when s/he was only a few months old and the baby would need to take bottles of expressed breast milk at daycare.  The Playtex nursers were recommended online for breastfed babies due to the collapsing liner and the wide nipple.  I also consideredDr. Brown's,Avent, andBreastflowbottles but decided against Avent due to reports of frequent leaks.  I crossed Breastflow and Dr. Brown's off the list because I knew I'd be washing pump parts every evening after returning to work, and didn't want to add to my workload with a complicated bottle assembly to clean as well.I had our baby in August 2010 and began breastfeeding.  We waited until she was 4 weeks old to introduce a bottle, but she took to it quickly with no issues going between breast and bottle.  She started daycare at 2 months and she has gotten 3 bottles of expressed milk each weekday since then, with an occasional bottle of milk given by my husband or a sitter.  She was exclusively breastfed until 6 months, when we introduced complimentary solids, and she continues to nurse now.  We do not feed bottles when she and I are together and in fact will not accept a bottle if I'm around.Likes~ No difficulty transitioning between breast and bottle, due to the wide nipple base and collapsing liner~ It's easy to find the drop-ins (including store brand liners that fit the nursers) in any store~ No leaks!~ Inexpensive~ Minimal washing is necessary if you're careful (just the nipples; we reuse the rings and caps unless there's a need to wash them)~ Using thePlaytex Drop-Ins System - Breast Milk Storage Kit, I'm able to keep extra milk in the daycare freezer - all her caregivers need to do is thaw the drop-in of milk, and put it into one of her nursers, and it's ready to feed.  They have only had to use backup milk once but they said it was very easy and they appreciated that they didn't have to worry about spilling the milk while pouring it into a bottle.Dislikes~ The drop-ins are not environmentally friendly since they're disposable. I struggle with this because we try to live a more green lifestyle but at the same time I enjoy the convenience of using this feeding system.~ The plastic nursers themselves have gotten a bit etched looking after nearly 8 months of daily use. This is just cosmetic in nature and does not affect function in any way.She's never gotten formula so I can't relate any experiences with smell in the trash from the liners, or from formula sticking to the drop-ins.  However I have a friend whose babies were formula fed and she used the Playtex nursers with no problems.	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	
- 1	These sleeves are so tight, it is such a hassle to put on.  I'm also not sure that they would really help avoid breaks b/c very little is covered the sleeve.  I prefer to carry my glass bottles in one of the long neck bottle koozies.  They are cheaper, effective, and you can use them for beer once your baby is finished with bottles.	
1. 	My toddler son loves this elephant, and it's working very well.  We have the kind of faucet that does not have the pull knob at the end, and it fits perfectly.  It would not work on a faucet with a pull knob, though.  It's bigger than I expected and maybe a little embarrassing if your kiddie bathroom is also your guest bathroom, but it serves its purpose well.	
1. 	I own this manual pump as well as an electric double pump, and I actually use this way more. It's just super-easy to put together and use. Much less fuss than the electric. I'm also able to get a good amount of milk at my own pace/strength. I've packed this on trips and used in a public bathroom without feeling nervous since it's quiet and discreet. Highly recommend.	
1. 	My son hates tummy time and until I got this item he would cry from the moment I put him down for tummy time until I picked him up.  It was really a struggle for me to encourage tummy time when he disliked it so badly.  This item has improved the quality and enjoyment for my son.  He now rolls over to his tummy on his own to play with the mat.  The product is simple to use and effective.	
- 1	I was excited to receive this mobile.  My ds wouldn't sleep in his crib, and after reading the reviews I thought- this is it, lull him to sleep with this entrancing mobile.  I took it out of the package and quickly ran upstairs to attach it to the crib.  Unfortunately, it only fits in one direction, and because our crib is curvy and thick- and wasn't going to work.  But, I was desperate- &#34;this was it&#34; I needed my ds to sleep!  So... we crafted up a stand with 4x4's and up went the mobile (slightly tacky but for a good cause).  At first ds didn't care for it, the light was too bright for nigh time.  However, I worked it into the routine before bed.  Every night we push the same button, we rock in the chair, and then I put ds in his crib to watch the mobile.  Beautiful!  Then, one night we were rocking and I looked up to see the mobile frozen.  The music was going, but it wasn't peek-a-booing or spinning.  So I quickly assumed the batteries were dying.  After replacing the batteries and screwing it back together everything worked again.  Until the next night, yup- frozen again.  I guess the leaves are just to heavy to play peek-a-boo every night.  I purchased this mobile when my son was 3 months, he was 6 months when the mobile started freezing on us.	
1. 	I really like these outlet plugs, most of the outlet plugs are so flat that even when an adult tries to take them out so we can use the outlet we break a nail or hurt ourselves somehow.  It is hard to explain but I like how my 1 year old can't get these out of the sockets but I can without an injury.	
- 1	We charged this up, used it... and it lit up for us exactly once.No amount of fiddling with it & recharging it has brought it back to life again.Great design, nice idea...if it worked. Ours doesn't, so we're returning it. Very disappointed.	
1. 	Our daughter received this ladybug (size small) for her 1st birthday.  When we got it out of the box, it comes assembled and ready to go, we were shocked at how tiny it was.  Our daughter is very tall for her age- 32 which made her look gigantic next to it.  My husbands first thought was, it's getting returned.  I told him to give it a week and see how she does. Well, we did, and I am glad.  She loves it!  At first she tried pushing it from behind, but within a few days, she was on it and scooting along.  It's the perfect size for her to pedal flintstone style, despite our first thought.  It definitely works well on hard floors vs carpet.  She just scoots along and has a great time.  Also, the toy is very sturdy, so I see it lasting awhile.	
1. 	My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.	
- 1	Update: I bought this stroller and originally gave it 5 stars, but after using it for 5 months i am much dissatisfied with quality and comfort. Problems i encountered:1. I had to buy a mattress (found one at buybuybaby) to make it comfortable for a newborn when in the bassinet mode. when in the bassinet mode, the stroller tends to tilt head down. i had to use towels under the head and a heavy object under the feet to level it out.2. i was never able to fold my stroller base, but it was never an issue since i have an suv, and it fits there just fine.3. i have and still is using it mainly with a car seat, baby is comfy in his car seat, i have put him in the stroller sitted and reclined and he seems to be very, very uncomfortable. he only tolerated about 15 min (he can stay in the car seat for hours).4. after five months of use and light grocery shopping, the basket has stretched out and now even with very light objects placed in it, it touches the ground, so i have to carry groceries in my hands when i shop now!5. straps are not very comfortable, especially now when using a bundle me up to keep baby warm.6. diaper bag issue became apparent when i switched from the car seat to stroller base, since basket is barely accessible and small, i strapped by diaper bag to the handle and it worked fine with the car seat, but with the actual stroller seat, diaper bag ends up sitting on top of babies feet or i have to carry it...if i had to do it all over again, I would not buy it! I am looking for a different stroller now, since my son is ready to sit up and needs a comfortable stroller for daily walks.Pros:large canopycan face both ways	
1. 	I couldn't get comfortable using this item, so after the first try, I ended up washing it and giving it to a friend who wanted it. She has had more use out of it then I have.	
1. 	I recently bought this for 7 month old daughter who is just starting to crawl. It the perfect thing to keep her amused for anywhere from 20minutes to an hour! It means I can go to the bathroom in peace and get some chores done knowing she is safe and amused.It is super easy to put together - it literally takes less than a minute - take out of the box - unfold it and it clicks into place. The pictures on the side are of good quality and my daughter likes to pull and play with them.We also have a weekend home - so bought two of these. I would guess this could also double as a crib for the weekend house - ie - for a night or two at a time.Highly recommend for the 7 - 10 month phase of baby's development.	
- 1	This product is horribly cheap! My five month old was able to pull off one of the discs....because that's how strong babies are, even newborns. It's supposed to be hung close enough to them to see (it's VERY small) but out of reach. Well, she was still about to reach up and grab the smallest disc at the bottom of the mobile because it's supposed to encourage grabbing after all. Well luckily it happened right in front of my eyes and I was about to pull it away from her. It's made of very cheap plastic discs. Don't waste your money! Get a mobile made of soft materials.	
- 1	I bought this so that I could warm bottles for the baby and because it came recommended from another mom.  I like it at first, sure it was a pain to have to boil after each use to reset the heating mechanism but for the convenience, I didn't think it was too bad.  I've had it for a few months now and I really dislike it and am going to return it if I can.Problem #1--You need to plan to use it because it will take up to 20 min to warm a bottle fresh from the fridge and a little less if it's at room temp.  If you baby likes a warmer bottle, then it can take longer.  So, if you baby isn't on a really predictable schedule, this isn't the warmer for you.Problem #2--I packed it in the diaper bag and then went to go use it only to find out it had been activated.  The activation disk is very sensitive to being bumped or rubbed and will activate the heating crystals easily.  So I was scrambling to find away to heat the bottle at the mall with a screaming/hungry baby.  I ended up having to find a place to breastfeed which isn't easy if you have a baby that is a messy/distractable nurser, there is not a private enough place for these kiddos!Problem #2--It's heavy.  It will definitely add weight to your diaper bag that is noticeable and it's not petite in size.Problem #3--the annoying problem of boiling it after each use takes on a whole different level of annoying when you have to spend 20 min boiling it when you haven't even used it because it was activated by accident....stupid sensitive activation disk!Problem #4--Not a big deal, but if you have older children this becomes a cool toy.  They get amazed to see liquid turning to crystal and getting hot...this is just as annoying as it getting accidentally activated!So for the amount of times I have actually used the item (twice) v. the times I've had to boil this item to use it (at least 10!) I wouldn't buy this or recommend it to anyone.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
1. 	I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles. It is fast and easy and I can't imagine going back to boiling bottles again. A must have for working moms.	
1. 	I was hesitant to buy this due to the price, but loved how they looked so thought I would take a chance - glad I decided to buy. My son (now 5 months old) loves the funky creatures (we unlinked the stuffed toys for him to play with when he was younger) and enjoys chewing on the colorful links. These are some of the best links I've found and we use them all of the time to link things together or to link toys to his stroller/car seat.	
1. 	We originally bought these flannel baby wipes for cloth diapering, but ended up using them for a variety of other uses around our house. Mostly we use them as baby washcloths at bath time, or to wipe up small messes at meal time. Although we are not currently using them as diaper wipes, we never leave home without a couple of these wipes in our diaper bag. They're just too handy to leave at home.	
1. 	We  have used  this edging  and corners  on several  pieces of furniture.  It serves it purpose well.  However, our son just started pulling  the trim  off so we  have  had to replace the adhesive a few times.  Overall a  good product.	
- 1	had a plastic like smell for a few daysi don't know if its the material or the 3&#34; thickness but i was not satisfied with how the mattress gave way to our kid's body weight  and she is not fat (@24lbs)	
1. 	I borrowed this item from a friend when I had my first child.  I loved it!  It stores a stack of diapers, a case of wipes, diaper cream, lotion, etc.- all within reach.  What I liked best was when friends and family came over to help out with the baby, they could clearly see where everything was to change baby's diaper.  Also, the plastic is clear, unlike a fabric diaper stacker, so you can clearly so how many diapers you have handy.Loved this item, will probably buy it for myself now that I'm pregnant once again!	
- 1	My baby really loved this, however the seat broke went he was in it.  I was hoping I received a faulty product so I exchanged it for another, with the same results.  The green plastic parts used to hold to seat together are cheap and don't hold.  The screw  that is suppose to go in to the cheap green part also strips out the part making it impossible to fix.  If they made the seat frame one piece, all the problems I had with it would be solved.  However until then....don't buy this its a waste of your money.	
1. 	Love this stroller frame.  I have the Graco Snugride 30 carseat and thought this would be perfect to use with it b/c its so lightweight.  This frame is also really easy to put together. All you have to do is put on the wheels and they just click on.  Easiest assembly I've ever seen.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to deal with a full size gigantic travel system stroller for their newborn.  If you buy the larger style Graco carseats, you'll be able to use this stroller frame for longer.	
- 1	I got this sheet for theGraco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman, which has a 37x26 pad.When this mini sheet was brand new out of the packaging, it -barely- fit over the pad.  And then it shrank since I washed it in hot water and dried it on high.  While I can still fit the sheet over the corners of the pad, the long sides of the sheet will not tuck under the pad, so the elastic is exposed. If your PNP has a smaller pad, then this might work for you, but for me, it will end up being an extra cover for my changing pad instead. Definitely a disappointment.The material is soft, but very thin.  You can see through to the color of the PNP pad underneath.  Also, note that the sheet is actually a jersey material, not your typical bedsheet material.	
1. 	The PROS: It is lightweight enough so my baby (5 months) can play with it. I give it to my baby in the morning as he wakes up & this keeps him busy for a few more minutes while I get a little more sleep. :) He loves touching the light (shell), watching the constellations around his crib, & changing the colors on the turtle. I also use it at night as a cue for bedtime & I notice it settles him down after a long busy day. He loves looking at the room filled with stars. I keep it on & enjoy it myself while I breastfeed him before bedtime. The timer option is also great.The CONS: You can't really see the brown constellation, only the blue & the green.	
1. 	We were using the training cup with handles (gerber) where the straw folds into the top, but she was not getting enough fluid and like many other reviews, giving up, thus not getting enough fluid (water). I purchased these and in two days, she figured out how to hold the cup (w/o handles) and use the regular straw (without suction). her fluid intake went up ten fold.... highly recommend these cups if you have a child who is resisting the training straw cups or any other training cup. Note: these hardly leak, and only alittle when they do, considering there is no lid, very impressed!	
- 1	Didn't work as I expected. It it similar to the Moby wrap (in style) but only half as wide. I used it twice. The material is also like old gym uniform, that shiny stuff.	
- 1	Great idea but our baby has had no trouble ripping these off of every surface we've put them on.	
- 1	Edited to Add 6/4/2010:  Just wanted to add that Peg Perego gave me a full refund and sent a box and a pre-paid Fed Ex label for me to ship the high chair back.  The customer service was excellent.Edited To Add 5/2/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The last of the screws fell out. So the bottom side of the tray that separates the baby's legs is completely off.Edited To Add 5/1/2010: SAFETY WARNING!  Unbelievable.  Another screw fell out on the bottom side of the tray.  This is the third screw to fall out.  Fortunately, I saw it fall before the baby had a chance to swallow it.  I contacted Peg Perego on 4/28/2010 after the second screw fell out and demanded a refund.  To their credit, they said they would give us a refund once we show proof of purchase so we now have to find the receipt.  Also, they did add that they've never had this issue before on the Tatamia (which is relatively a new line) or on any of their Peg Perego high chairs.  I am wondering whether the screw mechanism on the bottom side of the tray are the same for all Peg Perego high chairs. I am wondering whether it is a design defect or a manufacturing defect.  Something is wrong.  Even IF my baby (from when he was 8 months - 12 months) was playing with it, it is a problem because a baby should NOT be able to unscrew sharp screws from the high chair so easily.Edited To Add on 4/28/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The screws underneath the tray falls out.  About a month ago, I was lifting our son out of the Tatamia chair when I saw a screw on my son's lap (almost an inch long with a sharp end).  I realized that it fell off from the bottom of the tray where there are 3 screws.  It scared me because he is at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth.  I was relieved he didn't swallow it and it didn't puncture him.  I had my husband put the screw back in.  Today, my husband was lifting our son out of the chair when he saw another screw on his lap.  We're sure our son is not unscrewing the screw (he is only 11 months old and not dextrous enough. Even so, the design should be such that a child cannot unscrew the screws.) This is unacceptable.  A baby can die if he swallows these screws.  I am downgrading this from 2 stars to 1 star.  I am going to call Peg Perego tomorrow.My husband and I were initially excited to get the Tatamia.  We've been using it for the past 6 months now and we're less than thrilled.  There are several problems with the Tatamia.  (1) The top tray falls off very easily.  Several times, my baby (at 10 months old) managed to get the top tray off... so that left a real mess. I tried to click in the top tray but it won't click in.  It just rests on the bottom tray.  Since the baby always flips it over, I just use the bottom tray now.  (2) It is difficult to slide the tray in and out of the high chair.  With both your index fingers, you have to position the knob just right to slide it in and out but the right side keeps getting stuck.  (3) My baby first hated sitting in it.  He has now grown accustomed to it but it doesn't look very comfortable.  (4) The plastic device on the back of the seat to enable you to recline or sit-up doesn't work very well.  I thought maybe it was just me until my husband started complaining about the same problem.  (5) The high chair doesn't roll very well.  You can't move the chair sideways so you have to go backwards and then swivel and then go forward. As for the swinging feature, we used it once and it was a pain to get it into that position and back so we never used it since.	
1. 	They do the job. They're keeping baby's fingers from getting in those darn sockets! I think they're pretty easy to pull out as well.	
- 1	I almost wrote a glowing review when i first got it. it sat on the faucet fine, it protected their heads, i could use the thingamajig that makes the shower go on and off easily, and the kids loved how it spread out the water and that i could fill it will bubble bath. that was the honeymoon period...the bubble bath dispenser stopped working pretty quickly even though i tried washing it (i figured it was sticky with soap) and helping it along with my fingers while it ran, but it became more of a hassle than to just pour the bubble bath or shampoo directly in the running water.then the mildew... oh the mildew. i didn't initially take it off after every bath but noticed it was started to get a little black on the inside. so i bleached the heck out of it and then took it off and hung it to dry after every bath. it was still FULL of mildew. it was stained to the point that even though i knew it was disinfected i just couldn't use it anymore because the whole bottom was tie dyed with black mildew stains.overall since i had to buy another faucet cover anyway it was a dumb purchase.	
1. 	We really like this item because it keeps a bit of everything you need for baby within arms reach. Sturdy and easy to use.	
1. 	I LOVE Avent products. I only used Avent bottles with both my kids and I own both the Avent iQ24 Steam ELECTRIC sterilizer, as well as the Avent Steam MICROWAVE sterilizer. I like both of them ... and RECOMMEND them over boiling water in a pan any day. However (if price were not an issue), I do like the iQ24 a little better, simply because you can just plug it in, add water, and don't have to worry about taking something in and out of the microwave. It is very easy to use and the digital display tells you the status, so no guessing. You do pay for that added convenience and the bells and whistles of the digital display and alerts.As for boiling water ... when you first bring your baby home from the hospital (whether it be your first, second, etc.), you are generally sleep-deprived and not exactly thinking at your best or clearest. The LAST thing you want to be doing in this state of mind is BOILING water on the STOVE TOP to sterilize bottles. You cannot/should not walk away from the boiling water to do other things (which is hard to do as a parent of a newborn). In a sleep-deprived state, if you walk away, you WILL at one time forget you had the bottles boiling. There is no safety mechanism ... the water will eventually evaporate ... and that is dangerous. This is why I like the Avent STEAM sterilizers ... they do the job without supervision, so you can do your job as a parent.The GREAT thing about the iQ24, is you plug it in and put the bottles in to be sterilized. You can remove them in 6 minutes, or leave them there (where they will remain sterilized). You don't have to stay with the iQ24 to supervise it, as you do with boiling water. You can pick up a crying baby, change a dirty diaper, or just sit down and get some much needed rest. To me, that was the priceless part of the iQ24 ... that ONE less thing to worry about.The Avent MICROWAVE steam sterilizer does essentially the same thing, but with less bells and whistles and less expense.It also works great to sterilize pacifiers.I give it 5 STARS ... just wish it weren't so expensive. :)	
1. 	Great bed! Transitioned my 2yr old daughter to this bed after her crib and we LOVE it! She does too! She was so excited to have her first real bed and wanted to go to bed right away when she saw it! It is rich in color, very well done and sturdy. I sit on it (150lbs) often and I have layed down with her a few times with no problems! She sometimes walks on the bars supporting the bed underneath when we remove the mattress for linen changes (she is 38lbs) and they hold her.  The standard crib mattress fits snugly right into this frame with no problem. We actually purchased a memory foam padding (twin size) and cut it to fit her crib mattress and encased in a mattress covering. Crib mattresses are so hard and we really wanted her to have comfort now that she is old enough to not have a hard mattress. All this fits great in this bed. The bars are great keeping her from rolling out of bed. I usually find her backed up against them while sleeping so glad they are there.  My only gripe is that we had the davinci crib which was supposed to convert to a toddler bed but did not work out so we had to buy this product. Anyway...glad we did because it is perfect for her. Highly recommend! You will not be disappointed!	
1. 	Ok so my 8mo old has been doing EC (google it) since 3 mo old.So we have like 4 of these (1 per room)You gotta get a WHItE one!! White makes it so much easier to see if he has gone #1 (and 2).I wish all 4 of ours were white.Please star this so others know white is the way to go.Oh and bjorn, please make a clear one!!Frank	
1. 	These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product.	
- 1	I ordered and currently use the original version of the Adiri Nurser bottle, as that was the only bottle at the time my exclusively breastfed baby would take. Thank goodness he has grown past that phase and now will take the Born Free bottles I had purchased and received as baby shower gifts. This NexGen bottle is too much trouble. All the different pieces and steps to fill and heat it are so cumbersome and time consuming. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for all of that. They really need to rethink the design on this thing. It's also hard to read the amounts. I thought I would love it, as I like the look and feel of it but boy am I glad I didn't have to actually use it too long.	
- 1	We were happy our toddler has been successful with potty training with her baby bjorn potty chair, so we decided to get this for on the go.  Unfortunately, she is so scared and doesn't want to sit on the Potette.  =(  We have tried countless times and she refuses to sit on it.Read some amazing reviews and hope we would have the same luck with the Potette.	
1. 	It is true that these bottles have quite a few parts to clean, but I consider it totally worth it.  My son has had less gas since we've been using these bottles.  I've never had a problem with them leaking.  There's a line on them that you're not supposed to fill past, as long as the milk isn't filled past that line you shouldn't have a leaking problem. My son loves the nipple, as a previously breastfed baby it was easy for him to transfer to this bottle.  As another reviewer mentioned, don't even bother buying the 4 ounce bottles.  At two months my son is already at 5 ounces, so we barely got any use out of them.  The 8 ounce bottles are all you need.	
1. 	This is our second thirsty tote for my sons sippy cups.  The first one went missing, and I loved it so much, I had to get another just like it.  His cup slides in for transportation in the diaper bag, and isn't bulky.  We've had some insulator sleeves/pouches that were super bulky and took up a lot of room even without anything in it.  I realize Built didn't necessarily make these for sippy cups, but I'm so glad they did!  It's perfect for what we use it for!	
- 1	Bought one to try-must admit this is my least favorite of my stash ( I might be the minority on that opinion ).  It does stay fairly dry with two inserts. Washes ok- began to pill quickly. The inserts aren't the best- I use both. I so not like that the pocket is on the front- it's always wet and kinda gross. It's difficult to get the insert in because the pul material is almost sticky. It doesn't fit my baby very well.  The size for the waist is too tight for his thighs.	
1. 	The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.	
- 1	I usually love baby einstein, but not this one.  My son just isn't interested in it (but yours might be).  The sound is very quiet and my son just doesn't pay much attention to it.	
1. 	This infant carrier is great. I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time. I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2.) He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot. I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat. It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases. It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to. It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks. Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.	
1. 	These bibs are wonderful for those heavy duty spitters!  The pack of 10 is a must for my daughter, who wears bibs as a part of her daily outfit because she spits up so much!  I love the terry-cloth feel, without the bulk!  The inner, waterproof material keeps her shirt dry throughout the day.  Changing bibs after each meal is much easier then changing outfits!	
1. 	We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.	
- 1	I hate these snack cups.  The lid pops off (spilling snacks everywhere) every time the container is dropped...  I appreciate the concept - it's nice to have a lid attached so that crumbs don't get everywhere and it's easy for my 15 month old to hold and get snacks himself.  However, these are pricier than other options and the lid constantly comes off - totally defeating the purpose of having a snack cup with a lid in the first place.	
1. 	We use these to freeze purees. They are wonderful. Top rack dishwasher safe & haven't retained any smells so far. Love the lids	
1. 	Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.	
1. 	My daughter has the purple Twilight Turtle.  It is VERY cute.  She cuddles it during the day and has tea parties with it, and at night she puts it back on her dresser for bed.  It has three different color options for the stars on her ceiling, and I can set the timer to make sure it stays on long enough for her to fall asleep but not drain the batteries.  The stars and moon displayed are a muted, soothing tone, giving just enough light to soothe to sleep.  We go about three months on one set of batteries, and we use the turtle almost nightly.With the hard shell, it's a good toy to have on a dresser - it's not soft enough to snuggle in bed, but if set near the bed it projects stars across the entire ceiling. I also like that the buttons are big and spaced enough apart that they are easy for a child to operate and pick their own colors at night.This is not a light to leave on for the entire night, but it does a great job at soothing and I'm glad we have one!	
1. 	My baby likes these nipples, and they actually work better than the Newborn nipples. My baby always gags and gets too much from the newborn size, but she has no problems at all with these.	
- 1	Wow, I hate to be the only naysayer here but these really proved to be terrible quality for us.  I originally bought them because my velcro bibs lasted only 2-3 years before they started falling apart and/or the velcro didn't work anymore.  I thought those were bad quality, but wow, these are way worse!After only 2 months, 2 out of the 3 of the bibs are unable to be used.  The same place broke on both bibs - the snap on the side which isn't adjustable.  The first bib broke when my 2 year old pulled on it too hard.  The 2nd bib broke in the same place, but nobody pulled on it, the snap just literally fell out of the bib.  We haven't done anything other than hand wash the bibs and use them for meals.  I've never been impressed with J.J. Cole quality and so this didn't surprise me, but for the price I expected these to last much much longer.	
1. 	The First Years Infant to Toddler tub with New Born Sling is just great.  I could not believe, looking at it at first whether it would be comfortable for our newborn, but the sling is just great, and baby loves the warm water and fits comfortably in the sling as mom enjoys bathing her.It is built to place on the middle post or section between a double sink and the tub is rather sturdy when placed on our double sink, although like bathing our newborn in a warmer environment than a kitchen.  The tub is also not too heavy if you are carting it with enough water for the baby to bathe in.  There is a plug at the bottom for easy draining.  There are basically three ways to seat a babe. The sling for the new born a more padded seat for an infant to recline in and a more sturdy seat for the toddler to sit up in if you wish to use it.When you think of it, for the money, this Infant to Toddler tub will save you in the long run until your little one is ready for the larger tub.  Great gift idea and should be on every moms registry.	
- 1	I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often.  It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's spring locks to lock into place.  It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it.  And sometimes it's almost impossible to unlock it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it.Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price.  You could find something much better for around the same cost.	
1. 	I really liked this gate. It goes to 60, no more. It took a little while to put up, and like all pressure mounts can do, it fell once. Other than that, it does what it should and I like the mesh; it's harder to climb.	
- 1	My son has two other sets of stacking discs which he absolutely loved.  When I saw this item, I loved the idea that the magnets would offer a different take on the blocks from the Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics Rock-a-Stack and Melissa & Doug Rainbow Stacker.  Unfortunately, the toy did not live up to expectations.  Although the wooden base, 5 brightly colored rings and bear head are nicely made from wood, the  magent is extremely weak.  In addition, at least one of the discs repels the disc above and below it, regardless of which way I flip the discs to re-stack.  As a result, it keeps collapsing and cannot be reassembled.  Although my son has enjoyed tossing around the independent pieces, this product did not serve its basic purpose as a stacking toy.	
- 1	We used to use just a regular trashcan with an airtight lid to hold dirty diapers, but there's only so many times you can wash it out or put some baking soda in the bottom before you need a new container. So, when we were visiting a friend I noticed that they had an actual diaper pail, not just a trashcan, and that it worked really well. It was a diaper champ and it worked great. You couldn't smell anything standing right next to it. For some reason though, I decided to try the diaper genie. I liked that you could open it with your foot--theirs was a bit hard to twist back and forth with one hand (of course it was also two years old). Big mistake. I should have bought the diaper champ, and should have kept the box to return the diaper genie. The smell is horrible. After a few diapers are in it, it's very smelly. Plus, every time it opens it releases a lot of the smell. I checked that the internal closure mechanism is still shut when I open it--it is, it's not a broken one, it just sucks. Also it's really flimsy plastic and feels like it's going to break whenever I open it to take the bag out. And the bags are horrible! They made the bags about half the size of the actual space inside so you have to change them constantly (the bags are as big as the actual plastic ring they come in, tiny!). The pail could literally hold another bag worth of diapers in the space available around the current bag. And because it opens from the middle to remove the bag you can't use it without the bag. I'm going to try other bags, but it seems like they would be quite difficult to put in it. But I'll probably just end up giving it away and buying a diaper champ. Don't buy this product!	
1. 	I did a LOT of research on baby carriers prior to our baby being born. These are expensive, so it matters. And I think carrying your baby is easy, convenient, and keeps everyone a little less fussy. Each one has a niche, so I wanted to make the right choice. Being a spring baby, we opted for the bjorn air when she was little and have an ergo for when she gets a bit heavier. But I was still missing something. My baby COULD sleep in those, albeit very uncomfortably. I wanted something she could nurse in and sleep in that would give me at least one hand free. I work from home sometimes so feeding the baby while working kills two birds.My only hesitation in buying this was it was so cheap. Every other ring sling I'd considered was 2-3X this sling. But I'd already invested in two other carriers and the reviews were positive so what the heck.This is exactly what I wanted and more. It's great for around the house for nursing or sleeping. It does have a learning curve,  and I'm still learning - but I have some basic holds that work for us. This is also great for sitting up and facing out. It's so versatile, on a recent trip I took this one carrier and used it for everything.*best use for me: nursing on a plane. We've taken quite a few trips and I was originally holding her and using a nursing cover. Well my arms would only last about 30 minutes. With this I get complete privacy and when she falls asleep she's in the sling - hands free! When the plane lands if she's still sleeping I can get up and go. If she wakes up I just sit her up and face out. I love this thing!!  It's also so much more tailored looking without the tail. I'm tall and slender, so I have a small tall to work with if I really need it.It's pretty comfortable. The padded shoulder definitely helps. I find this no more or less comfortable than other carriers.Cons - ring slings in general seem a bit more feminine and so my husband won't wear this one (but doesn't mind the ergo and bjorn).The fabric I ordered was a little rough when it arrived but it's getting softer with each wash.	
- 1	I thought this was useful until I discovered the BabyConnect app for iphone.  That is much more versatile and lets me keep track of only one device (my phone).	
- 1	We bought this for a trip I was taking by myself with my large, 34 inch tall 16 month old.  I installed it correctly and put my son in it.  It was very easy to install, but the red strap that fits around the seat was directly behind his head, making him keep his head forward.  Also, as another reviewer stated, the chest strap was right under his chin, which I feared would decapitate him in an accident.  Because there is no middle strap between the child's legs like in a carseat, they do slide down and the chest strap is literally at their neck.  I even brought drawer liner with us and put it under my son's bum to keep him from sliding out, but it didn't help.Lastly, the airplane seatbelt (we flew on American) didn't get tight enough to really keep him in place.  He's a large child and at 26 pounds is way over the minimum weight of 20 lbs.  I cannot imagine using this with a smaller child.I ended up bringing his carseat on with us and using that on the flight back.  I will be selling my CARES and getting this instead for next time.Go Go Kidz TravelMate - Black/ Orange	
1. 	Very nice it's was exactly what I expected. I will defiantly recommend it. I will be buying more in the future.	
1. 	I transitioned my son to the HALO sleep sack when he was 4 months old and he did great! We were swaddling him before and found it to be an easy transition. The sleep sack has a v-neck top so that it is not to close to baby's face. My baby does check on the bottom sometimes when he is rolling around his bed. The material has become a little frayed from washing it a lot but overall it's a great product!	
- 1	Beware! This company misleads you into thinking you are buying something safe for your child but I don't think gmo corn filling is very safe :(.	
1. 	We bought a second one for our second daughter.  Light, easy to clean, durable. Makes the chore of changing sheets easier.	
- 1	It works OK. Using the top opening doesn't keep the extender attached while the water is running and the back opening causes a pool of water to collect after use.  When you use the back opening, the angle of the extender points up rather than towards the bottom of the sink.	
1. 	I used these miracle blankets with all 3 of my sons and swear by them. THey are super easy to use, keep their little hands & arms down in place by their side (unlike many traditional swaddle blankets where the babies are able to &#34;break out&#34; of them very quickly!) and keep them wrapped up tightly and secure. We used them for several months and they were a lifesaver. As soon as we would swaddle them up in this blanket, it signaled &#34;night night&#34; and they would fall right asleep.	
1. 	I bought one for my daughter and myself since I watch my grandchild a lot.  We love this booster seat!  The reviews for booster seat products helped a lot in making my choice.  It's great for parents without a lot of room for a regular highchair and for grandparents who need to store a highchair when not in use.  No tools are required to assemble, the booster height is adjustable and it sits securely on our dining chairs.  I like that the trays are dishwasher safe.  When he no longer needs the highchair it's still a great booster for sitting at the table.  We've had no trouble with the way the tray attaches or detaches as I've read in some of the reviews and we feel he sits safe and secure in the seat.	
- 1	These actually decreased my production of milk. I had problems producing so this wasn't good at all. Waste of money.	
- 1	I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns.  These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better.  I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump.  The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors.  Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean.  It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also.  I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them.	
- 1	The straw has a design that opens when the straw itself is squeezed (with teeth or gums).  When the straw is not squeezed, liquied doesn't flow.  Even the straw is squeezed, very little liquid flows through.  I tried it and had a really hard time with it.Perhaps this is a design for kids learning to drink through a straw.  My 16-month old daughter did not like it.Ultimately, I used some scissors to cut that little plastic closure.  The flow has improved greatly.  The cup itself is nice and sturdy.  Easy to use.  I like the colors.Still, I wouldn't recommend this cup.	
1. 	This has been an absolute essential for my children. I initially tried a different swaddler and instantly gave up on the idea of these fancy swaddlers (it was totally useless). I'm glad I decided, on a whim, to give this one a try. It is perfect in every way! Easy enough to do in the middle of the night (night after night, sleep deprived) in the dark. I love how you can undo the bottom (for diaper changes) without totally unswaddling your little one.As my kids start to outgrow swaddling, I'd use this and attach the flaps under their arms (instead of over). Still provided that same comforting feel, but with the arms out. Helped ease them out of swaddling (which isn't easy). From that point on, we used Halo SleepSacks (also awesome).We live in a cold climate, and the Microfleece was nice. It would probably be too warm in a warmer climate, especially since we're told now that keeping babies cold decreases SIDS risk.Not every baby loves swaddling. But if your little one appreciates a good swaddle, this product is for you!	
1. 	I love this product, not only because it keeps my baby safe while she sleeps, but it also keeps the blanket on her!  She likes to kick the blanket off while she's sleeping, then she wakes up and her poor little feet are freezing cold!  So I tuck her blanket in all around her under the sleep positioner mat, and it's almost impossible for her to kick the covers off!  This is a must have for all new parents and babies!	
- 1	I am a fan of OXO products but this one is a miss. The case is rather bulky and heavy for the diaper bag, but I could let that slide if it worked. When i put wipes in it, they dry out within a few days, making them unusable! So I would have to remember to put new wipes in every day. That's a extra step I don't need as a busy mom. Disappointed.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this thermometer but I'm a little disappointed.It's great as a thermometer, it displays the temperature as expected. The turtle design is attractive and whimsical for babies. What disappoints me is the alarm which is supposed to be the &#34;safety&#34; component of this product. An audible sound is supposed to be heard when the water temperature gets too hot. Well, the sound that comes out is not very alerting. It sounds like a quiet chime or subtle beep. When the water is running, there's no way that you can hear the &#34;warning&#34; chime.  If you depend on the alarm to alert you that the water is too hot, you will not hear it.I don't recommend this as a safety device but if you only want to know the temperature of the bath water, then this will suit that need.	
1. 	This keeps my kids drinks cool while it is easy to keep clean as you can just throw it in the washing machine. I was looking for something like this because the insulated pockets inside the diaper bag start getting filthy from the little milk spills and it is hard to keep them clean.	
- 1	We chose this swing for the relatively gender neutral color scheme and the fold-up option.  However, after using it for a couple days with our newborn, the swing didn't swing, it just jerked back and forth, and the music sounded awful.  We exchanged it through amazon for a new one (extremely easy process thank goodness).  While the swing is still swinging a month later the music doesn't work, which is actually ok because we can't stand the music anyway and our daughter doesn't need it to be content in the swing.  We don't fold it up and store it as much as we thought we would.  It has potential but falls a bit short on the reliability side.	
1. 	These are helpful to keep the different clothes sorted by size so you can put clothes of many sizes in the closet without getting them mixed up and making it easier to locate.	
1. 	Very easy to install keeps my little one safe. Will buy another for my other fireplace. I would recommend to anyone with little tots.	
1. 	This is a really nice baby gift. Honestly I thought we would use it more than we so for white noise. The good news is that the noisemaker can come out so she'll enjoy it as a stuffed animal for many years to come.	
- 1	This was part of a baby shower gift, given to me with a baby tub. Was a great idea, looked cute, and I was very happy to have it on hand when my little one recently decided to start trying to stand up in the tub, and grab at things such as the spout. Well, my husband and I went to blow up the spout cover tonight and the valve won't stay closed AT ALL, not even for a few seconds!  This means the cover is totally useless and I won't get a single use out of it. It's cheap plastic, I know, I didn't even necessarily expect it to last that LONG, but to find it won't hold air for even a single use is ridiculous and a total waste of money/wasted gift. Extremely disappointed. Debating whether to contact the manufacturer and waste my time over a $5-6 item. Never had a valve that wouldn't close at all like this, no excuse for that level of poor construction.	
1. 	I bought this for my busy 6 month old and she spent many minutes playing with her toys while safely enclosed from hazards.  She just started crawling and this is just enough room for her to get the exercise she needs.  It was already assembled, pretty sturdy and is expandable.	
1. 	I have to be honest. I bought these in yellow because they were cheaper than the others.  I am glad I did. They stand out against the hangers and clothes so I can see them.  I am thinking about buying another set because we have a closet organizer and I had to pick which racks I could use them.  Good problem to have.	
1. 	We bought this because Baby Bargains recommended it, and we couldn't be happier.  No weird off-gassing smells, waterproof (though we put a waterproof pad on it) and firm enough to be safe.  Our newborn sleeps like a champ!	
- 1	I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike, and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it wasn't a whiz and now that I'm back to normal, it hardly works at all. The last time I used it (so I could have a night out) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk (wouldn't you know, she only drank 1/2 ounce.) Even when I would finally get a let down, the action/suction wasn't enough to keep it going. Also, I couldn't get the message cushion to work for me at all. The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and &quot;diaphram&quot;, but that still didn't help. It would stay sealed for a couple pumps, then unseal and seal again--off and on. Very frustrating to deal with--makes it hard to relax like you need to. Plus, when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk, that's a lot of squeezing, which is also not relaxing. I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump (as low as $140 in online searches.)	
- 1	I wanted to like this monitor- but this one most definitely stinks.  It is so quiet that even on the highest setting the baby is barely audible.  I would constantly have to check on him to make sure I wasn't missing his cries- which at that point defeats the purpose of the monitor.  If I happen to hear a faint something on the monitor I would have to tell everyone in the house to be quiet and stop everything everyone is doing just to hear if the baby is crying on the monitor.  I checked the manual- I was doing everything right.  Volume was turned on high - but the high setting on this monitor sounds like the low with any other monitor.  Don't get me wrong/ I'm not looking for rock concert loud- just high enough volume so I can hear the monitor next to me while quietly washing dishes.  I don't feel that is setting the bar that high....  Sent this one back and bought a Motorola one from babies r us and am MUCH happier.  No static and crystal clear- LOUD sound.  Now there is no doubt- I know if he is crying.	
1. 	I was initially concerned about spending so much on a play mat, but it is worth every penny. My 3-month-old daughter loves the rain forest gym and stays absolutely entranced with the brilliant colors, flashing lights and butterflies. This has also helped encourage tummy-time, which she hadn't previously been too keen on. I like the extra loops on varying levels that allow me to attach more of her toys. The only thing that would improve this product would be to have the butterflies spin on their own.	
- 1	wanted this to BE THE BAG. but it was not 2b. too small for tall bottles. its small is size, would fit 2 small bottles maybe 3. the willow teal design is nice. and its a little too shiny for my taste tho.	
1. 	This dresser is beautiful.  Listing says solid wood but drawers are particle board except for the front.  This was a little difficult to put together.  The previous reviewer complained of the drawers falling apart, I can see how that would happen if they were not put together correctly.  Mine came with all the parts and instructions so we had no problem with that.  It is sturdy and drawers open and shut properly.  Very nice.  ([...], it is cheaper there).  Shipped within 2 to 3 weeks from manufacturer.  This furniture seems to be in high demand and is on backorder often, so check before ordering.	
1. 	This chair is quite nice.We had the more expensive Chicco chair, but this is just as good for its purpose.This fits our table top because of its adjustable handles and doesn't make our kitchen/dining area look like a childcare.If you are on a budget. This is the one to get.Much better than those big bulky high chairs everyone uses.Only got 4 stars because there is no color choices.	
1. 	A sturdy, attractive, functional changing table at a reasonable price. (We also bought the matching crib but haven't set it up yet, as baby is still in a bassinet.) I love the classic style--simple yet elegant. The only drawback is that the changing pad it comes with is flimsy--but this is the case with most changing tables. Just buy a separate changing pad and you're all set.	
1. 	I love these dispensers, time and space saving.  easy rotation and cleaning.  i need to order more, wish i could pick my colors.	
1. 	I love that there are different levels to the nipples. It tells you about how old your child should be when using a particular nipple. I have to say that for my child, it has been pretty close to perfect. I love Dr. Brown products.	
1. 	I like this toilet seat. It keeps his little butt out of the toilet. He likes it, too.Good for boys, no spray. Looks nice. Cleans easy.	
- 1	The toy itself is super adorable.  The grocery bag is brown felt, the orange is a corduroy type material that opens to reveal the 'inside' of an orange.  The banana is felt and the little peel has Velcro on the ends so you can peel and unpeel it.  The apple is this silky spandex type material that has a sweet little jingle on the inside.  The cauliflower has those crinkly leaves that babies seem to think are a drug because they just can't get enough of the sound, and the little milk jug is vinyl which opens up at the top to reveal a little mirror.  So sweet and adorable.  And we don't let our daughter play with it because it has a horrible smell of formaldehyde.  My mom got this for her last Christmas (2010) and it STILL smells.  We have allowed it to 'air out' for months.  It makes me so darn sad because I know she'd love it.  I hope I'm the only one with this problem.	
1. 	This is the best sippy cup I've found, and I've gone through quite a few.  What a waste of money with all the other cups I've been through; for the same amount of $$ I could've gotten these plus change left over!  My baby wasn't able to suck out of all the leak proof sippy cups (and I've bought at least 3-4 others) but these he'll happily use.  Plus, it's a two for one because you can use it as a regular cup afterwards.  And there are only two parts to wash!One thing you have to beware of though --  DO NOT BOIL these per the instructions!  I did, and it warped the lids so badly there was no way it would fit back onto the cups; so minus one star.  Since they were cheap I just got more.	
- 1	After reading all of the great reviews for this straw sippy cup I thought I had finally found THE sippy cup to beat out all other sippy cups.  And the fact that it was only $5 was just too good to be true...and it turns out that it was.  The sippy cup worked as advertised - it has a straw and you can get liquid out of it.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's a bit hard to get liquid out of the straw but not THAT hard.  My 10 month old managed to drink out of it right away without any issues.  The reason for giving it only 1 star was the fact that I had it for only 3 days before it cracked on the bottom from being dropped, which I didn't notice until a few hours later when I found a huge puddle of water all over the table.  I really wanted to like this sippy cup so I was disappointed that it broke so quickly.  I've been through a lot of sippy cups and this one definitely took the record for shortest time between entering the house and exiting the house (in the trash).  Too bad.	
- 1	If you develop thrush and are using these to protect your clothing from yeast/medication...it will make the infection much worse because they hold in moisture.  This led to large acne-like rashes next to the areola and a foul smell. This was without added moisture from lactation. If these were used solely for leakage, still wouldn't buy them. The plastic is very hard to open, I had to cut them open with scissors daily. For clothing protection I much prefer Nuk ultra thin pads. They aren't wrapped in additional plastic, the price is great and they don't cause moisture buildup. They worked well fir lactation also. And they were not noticeable under clothing. Johnson's and Medela are also preferable to this brand.	
1. 	My son used this until he refused to sit in the basket anymore.  I just washed it every so often and kept it in my car for next time.  Maks them more comfy and keeps them warmer in winter.	
1. 	Glad I went ahead and bought the bigger size. I find it much more comfortable and I'm getting more milk	
1. 	My daughter has the kind that just plug in and you have to pry your fingernail down between the plug and the fixture to get the darned thing off.  I have soft fingernails so it's really hard for me to do that when I want to use and outlet at her house.  I got these for my house and they are much easier to use.  All you do is squeeze the sides and push the top button and they pull right out.  It's great because they stick out a little from the wall so you can get a much better grip on them and don't have to use your fingernails to pry them off.  However, it would be a challenge for a baby to get them off because he probably couldn't squeeze the sides and push the button at the same time. I'm happy with the purchase.  I am a 57 year old grandma and if I can do it anyone can.	
1. 	I'm totally neurotic about my baby choking on food, so I bought this food mill to mash up soft foods more uniformly than I could do with a fork. I use it primarily for bananas, blueberries, and avocados. It's simple and easy to use. I would not use this as my primary means of grinding up baby food- I use my Cuisinart for that, but for quick simple things, this works great.	
- 1	Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.	
1. 	I had to buy this jumper for several reasons: (1) - I rent my apatment and could not have a doorway jumper (which would be cheaper) because my landlord would not approve it; (2) - my son likes jumping and tries to jump on my laps when I hold him since he was 2.5 months old (he is 4 months old now); but he's a chubby baby, and my arms get very tired when I hold him jumping. (3) - I read many positive reviews of satisfied parents.Both my son and I like this jumper. Like all Fisher Price items, it was very easy to assemble. Other reviewers had mentioned that it needs lots of space, but it takes only 30X36 inches when assembled. Though the manufactuter recommends to use it for babies who can hold their heads up, most pediatricians do not recommend it until the baby can hold his back - not earlier than 3.5-4 months; so I waited until Ivan got 4 months old. First time he was very surprised and amazed. I can stand myself! - his little face said. Very quickly he discovered how to use it and started jumping carefully first, and with more joy then. First few days I let him stay there for only 3 minutes each time, then 5-7 minutes, several times a day. I think he's still too young and his spine is not strong enough for longer loads yet, so I take him out immediately when he seems little tired. Later we will use it more.The only thing I do not like is the revolving toy on the right hand of the toybar. When I put my little man in the jumper first time, he was looking for any handle on the front bar to hold himself, and tried to grab that revolving toy. I noticed that a tiny finger can easily get stuck under this toy, and if it revolves the finger may get hurt or even broken (I checked it out with my own finger). I recommend to remove this toy before you start using your jumper. Maybe I sound like an obsessed crazy Mom, but I assume it's never too much precaution when it comes about your baby's health and safety.	
1. 	My daughter is small for her age, so we have to use a smaller, cloth bib under this one to catch the mess between the bib and her neck.  I haven't had any issues with the pocket not catching food that slides down the bib.  It washes very well and has withstood many washings without showing any signs of deterioration.	
1. 	I think these membranes are supposed to be replaced every 3 months, but I didn't replace mine until they tore (at I think 6 months).  I bought this pack and these worked until I stopped pumping after 12 months.  These are pretty much the same thing you get with your pump originally.	
- 1	I have other NUK cups which are better.  The paint started coming off the cups after 2 washes.  My son's hands were all different colors after drinking out of these cups.  The insert on the top of the lid does not stay on, so they leak.  But even with the insert in please the tops still leak.  Complete disappointment.	
1. 	We got the EuroBath when our daughter was six months old, and we love it!  It's true that you have your hands free for bathing, because the tub fully supports even the wiggliest baby.  Our daughter was able to spread out her legs and splash around, and she still loves it now that she's a toddler.  Although the tub is big, it's definitely worth a little hassle, because it makes bathtime fun for everyone.	
1. 	I bought this along withGraco Quilted Pack 'n Play Sheet, CreamandCarters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Chocolate. This is the item of the three that is not being returned. I purchased theMamaDoo Kids Playard Mattress Topper, Foldable, BLUE -Made in USAas a topper so the baby can actually sleep in the pack n play, but the other fitted sheets out there don't seem to allow for any extra room. They are extremely fitted, which is a good thing if you plan on using them directly on top of the original hard surface. This waterproof sheet must be washed in cold and dried on LOW setting, but at least it stood up to the low dry, which I cannot say for some of the other waterproof pads that still melted. I thought this was a cheap brand but am very happy with the initial quality. And for the price, organic too? No complaints here....this was a good purchase. :)	
- 1	It's just made very cheaply and wasn't worth the hassle. It also never seemed to block out the sun, which always seemed to be coming from another direction than the two back windows.	
1. 	this is the best 'stacker' i could find that was safe (bpa free) for my baby to put in his mouth.  i first gave them to him around 6 months old and he LOVED them! they are fun to stack (and knock over!), to put other toys inside, to play in the bathtub (a few of the cups have draining holes in the bottom), and to play in the sand. they are very durable too!	
1. 	My daughter absolutely loves this seat. I put it in the kitchen next to the adult table and she can participate and enjoy family dinners and have her own space, too. And I do not have to worry about her tipping or reaching for anything. I took it to our friends' place and also to the restaurant. It was very convenient. It's very light and easy to transport - it folds in seconds. I love that it can be strapped to any chair and it it can be cleaned very easily.	
1. 	Typical product for playtex bottle. It's easy and convenient for me to order them online and have them come right away to me instead of going to the store.	
- 1	This was good while it lasted, but unfortunately it catches on EVERYTHING and as a result it has broke the clip on BOTH sides of my uppa baby vista.  so sad.  I will be calling uppa baby to see if they can fix it.  I don't have a solution as I feel like a cup holder is almost necessary on a stroller that you use all the time.	
1. 	It slides around a bit for a little one learning how to use it. But so far its been sturdy, and my 2 1/2 yr old can get on and off by himself.(Though it took me a hour to get him off of it the first time he used it, He loves it) I just wish the cushion secured to the base better. Over all its Easy to clean. And the pee shield is wonderful, And a larger size than some I have seen which is perfect for little men that wiggle around.	
- 1	I really don't have much to say about this product that is positive. The picture looks great but the end result is far from ideal. First, they don't provide any sort of directions about the optimum height for each point of the hammock to attach to the wall, or give you any indication of how low the hammock will hang after it is attached. Second, the hardware provided is absolute junk. If you decide to purchase/install this, I highly recommend going to a hardware store and getting the kind of drywall anchors that you screw in (as opposed to hammering in). This way they can easily be removed if you need to change the position of an anchor.	
- 1	The idea for the mamaroo is great and I was looking forward to using this product. However, there are many design flaws and overall I feel this product is just not worth the cost. I would not buy it again. I have the 2011 model. Here are the major flaws in my opinion:1) The seat does not really recline. The seat basically goes just from sitting all the way up to sitting slightly up. I wish the seat actually reclined more. The company states that the mamaroo reclines all along its axis but in reality the seat belt harness is attached to the axis in a fixed position and limits how the seat can be tilted. I found that even in the most reclined position, my 4 month old baby is still falling down in the mamaroo and ends up basically supported by the crotch harness since he is so upright.2) The safety crotch harness has many flaws. First, I don't understand why a 5-point system with shoulder harness was not included. Instead, the mamaroo comes only with a 3 point crotch harness. As I mentioned before, the baby ends up putting a lot of weight on this harness since the seat does not really recline. The harness has the hard plastic buckle inserts facing the baby and not the parent! I find this to be ridiculous. I have to struggle to snap in and unsnap the harness by reaching around to the inner part of the harness where I cannot even see the buckle. The hard plastic of the harness buckles press against my baby. The plastic buckles should face out towards the parent who has to use them, not the other way around. This design makes no sense to me. Since the seat doesn't really recline and since this means the baby puts a lot of their weight into the harness while sitting upright, it makes having the hard buckles on the inside even worse for the baby. I don't think the safety harness is comfortable for the baby, easy to use for the parent, or even secure (due to the lack of shoulder harness).3) The mamaroo does not come with any actual music. You have to use your own music via an ipod-- fine for someone who has an extra ipod to hook into the mamaroo but not so good if you don't have an ipod or an extra ipod.... The nature sounds that are built into the mamaroo are fine but unfortunately you can't scroll through them on the electronic display. Instead, you have to just flick a circular switch to go through all the nature sounds to find the one you want. I find that this can irritate or wake up a baby. I would prefer to see the sounds listed on the display in order to choose the sound I want quickly.4) The motions that the mamaroo makes are fine. They did not soothe my baby, however. My baby seemed to find the motions pleasant and amusing but they did not help my baby to sleep. Other regular swings have worked much better for helping my baby to fall asleep.5) Although my baby is still under the 25 pound weight limit for the mamaroo, I already find the mamaroo seat to be small for him.  In addition, the seat is made out of material that causes my baby to sweat. I usually have to place a cotton cloth behind my baby's head while he is in the mamaroo, otherwise the back of his head will get too sweaty. I wish the mamaroo came with a better fabric that was more comfortable for the baby.6) The mobile balls that hang over the baby tend to fall off constantly and end up on the floor. They are also not very interesting for the baby.Overall, I was shocked to find so many flaws with such an expensive product and especially one that is supposedly designed for and by moms.	
- 1	We have 4 of these cups plus a stainless one and loved them. They are easy to drink from, leak proof when the top is snapped shut and fairly easy to wash. These were the only straw cups I used with my toddler for the past 1+ yr. However, I recently learned some disturbing news about the plastic material they use for these cups, called Tritan. It's made by the Eastman company and is touted as being BPA-free and ultra-safe. However, there is some question about their safety testing methods and some suggest that Tritan may leach substances that are worse for you than BPA. There have been some comparisons between what Eastman is doing and what big tobacco did. That's scary, especially when the health of your baby is concerned.I'm very disappointed to learn such disturbing news about a cup we trusted and loved so much and am especially disturbed that these companies would play their &#34;games&#34; with things that affect our babies health (thought I'm not entirely surprised). I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 bc they are very well designed. However, we, sadly, won't be using these cups anymore. Shame on you Eastman.	
1. 	we are in a rental home so needed to set something up that would not leave any marks or damage. Took me awhile to thread and tie everything, but was certainly worth it. Not the prettiest net, but it works and it isn't permanent!	
1. 	I have a Medela Swing at home and it does the job. However, when I returned to work my company has some Medela Symphonys available for employee use. I bought this kit and, wow, does the milk come out faster with the Symphony than the Swing! Sometimes I can get in and out of the Mother's room in 10 minutes if my milk let down is strong. If you have access to a Medela Swing, buy this kit and enjoy its efficiency!	
1. 	I was excited to get this.  I love this and so do the children. It washes up nicely on the top rack of my dishwasher. This is played with everyday.	
1. 	We love this little lady bug. It is the perfect addition to our daughters room. The stars show up really well in green or blue.  The red is a little harder to see, but still is visible. I love that it is battery powered so you can move it around depending on if you want some of the stars to be on the wall or all on the ceiling.  (Batteries are included, so no need to struggle like I did to find a screwdriver to install the batteries only to find out they are already in there!) This item is well worth the purchase. It creates just the right amount of light in the room so it combats the darkness, but still dim enough to encourage sleep. I think we will have to buy the turtle for Grandma's house! And, I have a feeling we will be purchasing another for our older daughters room.	
- 1	had to return it because i couldn't stand the rubber smell...so sad because i really wanted him to gnaw on sophie :(	
- 1	I am a first time mom and I bought this playpen for travel. It is a great product if you rarely travel with it.Pro's: Changing table folds away with the press of a button, had sounds and vibration, and is at an ideal height for my tall husband and myself to change our child. It is also large and sturdy enough I can see her using it until she is able to crawl.Cons: This product was not made to fit entirely into the travel bag. When I contacted Graco about this problem the phone system told me they were closed until normal business hours so I e-mailed. I was answered quickly and was told I would be sent a travel bag in the mail. I received the package Graco sent 2 business days later. Inside were 2 travel bags identical to the one that came with the product in the first place. The only reason the product dose not fit entirely into the travel bag is because of the bulky plastic changer tray and changer frame. I wish I would have know this, I would have saved my money and bought a more portable and more affordable model.	
1. 	Great find! Had no problems with the straps. Small enough to take anywhere! Used at a stadium seating event, the beach, park, home etc.	
- 1	We got half a dozen of these to secure the kitchen cabinet doors from a 1 year old. The adhesive is good and so far it has stayed on. The lock is also practically impossible for infants/toddlers to open. My problem has been that 2 of these are already broken. The plastic strap broke right off the connecter and there is no way to fix it. It just snapped and came off. The plastic is a bit rigid and hence it's breaking off easily. In my opinion the design is good and they could have gone with a less rigid plastic strap, even a rubber/fabric strap would've worked.Feb 2013 - Update 1: I had ordered more to replace the broken plastic straps and then just keep breaking. Great product ruined by poor quality material.Jun 2013 - Update 2: Now after being tired of replacing it every time the plastic strap broke I've found a workaround. I used extra shoe laces that were lying around and just folded them into two, cut them in right length and used them in place of the plastic straps. You have to use a filler (any tape) or tie a knot to hold it in place inside the connector. Works great and no fear of it breaking, ever!	
1. 	I purchased this for my 2.5 year old for traveling and he loves it. It folds up so small and takes up little space in the car. When unfolded, it's a comfortable place for my toddler to nap and sleep at night.	
1. 	I love everything Swaddle Designs!  Every item I have ever gotten from this company has been super soft and great qaulity.  It also helps that they are adorable and a bit different from the typical cheesy baby designs.  My nursery is green and brown so I fell in love with the look first, but the quality is just as awesome as the look.	
- 1	We've had this seat for less than a year and as many other users have reported, the &#34;skin&#34; of the seat cushion is flaking off. I contacted OXO through their website and they were extremely helpful. The OXO Satisfaction Guarantee allows you to return any OXO product for any reason for replacement, exchange, or refund (must include receipt for refunds).  Without a receipt, they will simply send you a replacement. I would have prefered to receive a refund because I discovered a vintage Fisher Price booster at the Salvation Army thrift shop that seems to work great, but since I didn't save my receipt, I will take the OXO replacement and donate it.	
1. 	I bought these after my son yanked open a drawer on a 5 drawer dresser and it tipped and fell on him. I was standing right there and was able to catch it and break the fall. If it had fallen on him I doubt he could have survived. We strapped everything in the house to the walls and found these straps to be easy to use. Its an added peace of mind having these in case I am ever not there to catch a falling dresser. Buy them, use them, prevent serious injury.	
1. 	We've tried a LOT of bibs - and Bumkin bibs are the best!  It is truly waterproof, yet it can be washed in the washer (yay!).  This one in particular is a favorite because the long sleeves and generous length are prefect for protecting long sleeve clothes (or nice dresses).  This also has a tie at the neck (instead of the velcro that the short sleeve version has) which ensures that it doesn't snag sweaters/dresses and if you tie a double know its a little more difficult for tots to take off mid-meal.  We have two for each child and love them!	
1. 	We had the smaller (5 ounce) versions and they were our favorite (compared to medela and avent).So naturally we went ahead to try these ones. They have a nice slow flow, and provide the air vents at the bottom.However, I must note that those vents are like 99% gimmick. You hear the air come out of them like twice per drink (which can be like an hour if you have a little one that gets tired and sleepy every time they eat).We have used them quite a bit, and there is really virtually no difference in gas between these and the other 2. Add the fact that you virtualy never hear any air come out of it, and you get the idea.The shape is nice, especially if your baby has trouble holding down the food and you have to feed them in a more upright position.Overall a nice baby bottle for your baby.Highlights:- convenient shape- slow flow (pro or con depending on what you want)- ventaire system a gimmick	
- 1	Standard round toilet, nothing fancy. Even had the non skid mat that another reviewer recommended. Less than a minute after install and my toddler had the whole device off the toilet. Repeat install, trying every spacing with spacers and different positions within the allotted pie space in instructions. Same results. Wait for hubby to come home. Repeat. Luckily Amazon has a great return policy. Ordered the one that attached to tank and has an arm that comes down to seat lid. Toilet stays closed now. Fun to watch visitors try to open.	
1. 	This monitor has been great - I love the fact that it comes with 2 recievers - we have one in the family room & one in our bedroom - works great - no static & very clear. It is also wonderful that you can see what is happening as well. I can vacuum & be able to look at the monitor to check on her - I know longer have to worry about if I'm going to hear her or not. Another great thing is that you can plug it in, or put batteries on it. They also have clips so you can take it with you outside or wherever. I highly recommend this monitor.	
- 1	We received this graco digital monitor set for a baby shower gift.  When it works, it is very clear.  Most of the time it's annoying.We've suffered through it losing connection and beeping extremely loudly.  It would be fine if we were pushing the limits of the range, but one room over it loses connection and reconnects twice an hour without being moved or touched.In addition to the annoying beeping from disconnects, there are static pops, most likely from power line interfereance.  If you want true clarity with this device you may have to keep it on battery or use a power filter in front of each plug.Such a waste of money - we ended up turning it off and leaving all of the doors open to listen for the baby.  Our child sleeps through the night without event but the bleeping baby monitor wakes us up every other hour with incessant crackling and beeping.  We're awake while our baby is peacefully sleeping.We decided to buy the Philips SCD590 DECT based monitor that costs twice as much to replace this.  It was money well spent.  We'll give up eating out for two months to get non-interrupted sleep.  Our child sleeps like a baby.. we want to as well.Don't buy this product -- it's not worth the frustration and annoyance.	
- 1	I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old.  So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid.  What a waste!	
1. 	This is a great potty.  The biggest issue to me was cleaning.  This chair has no seems or corners to trap things.  The inner liner lifts off and is easy to wipe clean with a disinfectant cloth.  The boy shield is not too high and is rounded nicely so they won't hurt themselves while getting on.  The base is very solid and sturdy and doesn't move at all.  It also looks comfortable with the arm rests.  My son isn't potty trained yet but we purchased it so he could get used to sitting in it.  He seems very happy and will even sit in it to read a book.  Does what it should and doesn't distract from what they are supposed to be doing with alot of toys and noise.	
- 1	I bought these bibs at a retailer.  I thought that they would work well, but they are terrible.  First, the plastic is stiff and does not drape over my baby at all, which means that it slides around all the time and food gets in under and around it.  Second, as others have said it is quite hard to clean, especially around the piping.  Third, the pocket is pretty much flush with the bib and therefore doesn't catch much.  Fourth, the bib is relatively short, which wouldn't be a problem if the pocket worked better.  Fifth, although waterproof plastic may seem like a good idea, in fact liquids just rolled straight down the bib and onto baby's lap.  For someone looking for a bib I would recommend a soft cloth bib with waterproof plasticized backing in a large size or a bib with sleeves.	
- 1	i can not figure out how to use it. My baby was not comfortable in it. The price is too expensive. Returned it in the end.	
1. 	We purchased this changing pad with our first son and placed it conveniently on top of a dresser along with a wipes warmer and all the other essentials - diapers, extra wipes, in the dresser itself.  The changing pad itself is very lightweight and the slip proof bottom worked well enough for us to not screw it down or anything.  It could be moved, but it didn't really slip.  We also bought two cloth changing pad covers by summer infant but these were not truly needed.  They may have made it more comfortable, but required a more difficult cleaning for accidents, which tend to happen with a newborn boy.  The pad itself is made of waterproof material and any accidents wipe straight away.	
1. 	This is one very serious cup holder that will never fail if installed right but that is hard to do. It seems like you install it one way, but you actually have to do something else. I'm pretty handy but this one was tricky to me. Instructions are atrocious.First, this cup holder will fit all thickness handles. I have a First Years Wave stroller which is very thick. It could've handled thicker and thinner just the same.Second, it does swivel to level your drink if installed on a diagonal bar. You have to press a button to make it swivel.Here is the trick--when you get it, the tab piece that goes around the bar comes bent in the middle and it feels like you put your bar in that part, tighten, and you are done. This is wrong.***HOW TO INSTALL***You should unbend the tab piece where you think the bar should go. Then, bend the piece again around your stroller to make a custom sized loop. This plastic is pretty thick that is probably why a lot of people don't think to do this. When you put the tab into the fastener, look at the treads and line them up before it goes in all the way in to make a tight fit. Then when you get it in, you use the screw thingy to make it even tighter. I also think that this is how you are supposed to install it and the instructions just aren't clear or people are not taking the time to read it.If you don't do this, installation will be loose and the drink will fall and you will complain.Someone had a tip on here to use kitchen grip pads around your bar. This is a good idea. I installed mine over the foam part of the stroller handle so I didn't need it but I would've liked some if I was installing over the metal part. Not necessary but would be a nice to have.	
1. 	This was my first sling and my first experience with baby wearing. I registered for this for baby #1 and a friend gave it to me at my shower! My baby is now 8 months old and I've been using this since he was 3 days old. The sling has come in handy so many times at the store, at church, in class, on walks, in restaurants, doing household chores, and just because. :)  (I uploaded a few pictures so you can get a visual).I love that this ring sling is both practical AND beautiful! I got the fern batik print and love it. The fabric is very durable, and the shoulder and rails are nicely padded. As some mentioned, the padded rails can make tightening the sling a little difficult at times, but once my ring sling was broken in a little, the padding softened and it's become much easier to adjust.This is a great sling for those new to babywearing or who want to test out a ring sling without spending $50+! Some of the slings I was looking at are upwards of $100 - while I would love to someday have such a high quality sling, this one does the trick nicely for now. :)A few tips and techniques I've learned:#1 - Positioning: SAFETY FIRST! Please be sure that your infant is positioned high enough for you to easily ensure he/she can breathe easily, especially if you are wearing your newborn! Close enough to kiss is what I always read. It can be a little tricky sometimes to get your baby up this high, but I found that if you tighten the sling a little more before putting baby in, it's easier to maintain that visibility.#2 - Don't pull on the tail. When you go to adjust the sling, don't pull down on the little tail to tighten things up. This makes it hard to get the proper fit. Instead, pull each side/rail individually UP and across your body, until things are snug and positioned correctly. You'll probably have some extra poofiness at the end of the sling and it won't end in a nice sleek little tail, but you can always wrap the excess around the rings after you've adjusted. :)#3 - Spread out the back! Make sure that the shoulder padding is spread out nicely across your shoulder, not bunched up at the neck, owch! Also make sure that the ring sling fabric is spread out nice and wide across your back, and that it's not twisted. Spreading out the fabric means a much more comfortable carry, and it won't stress your back so badly.#4 - Switch sides! Be sure to wear the sling on alternating shoulders so you don't over-fatigue one side of your body. I admit, I didn't always do this - because of breastfeeding complications involving an abscess, I couldn't have anything pressing on my right breast where I had an incision, so I would always wear the sling on my left shoulder, keeping baby more toward the left side of my body. Once I healed, I went back to switching shoulders.#5 - Grab a friend and keep practicing! It was helpful for me to have my husband there to help me spread the fabric in the back and across my shoulder, then to hand me baby so I could put him in the sling. If you're having trouble initially, ask someone to help you til you've got the hang of it. Everyone's body is different and every baby is a little differently shaped, so it'll take you some time as you figure out the most comfortable position for you, and the best positions you want to use for your little one.#6 - Don't give up!!!  There is definitely a bit of a learning curve in babywearing, and this sling is no exception. Your muscles will take a bit of time to grow accustomed to the extra weight so you might be a little sore (if you're really really sore tho, look into your positioning and technique as things might not be quite right in that area!) Do your own research and look up how to wear your baby safely. I watched YouTube videos, read tutorials, and did tons of good ol' Google searches on different positions in the ring sling (newborn, cradle carry, hip carry, forward facing, etc.) Above all, have fun with it and don't get discouraged if your first few attempts are less than perfect! Before you know it, you'll be whipping your sling on like nobody's business. :)	
1. 	I own this one in green and love it. It actually SAVES my back from carrying my daughter a lot. I have a colicky baby so that I can hardly put her down. It's really comfortable for my child and I and SO easy to use even it looks complicated. It only takes me seconds to put it on. When my daughter was under 3 months old, it was a little bit big for her (her head flopped way back in a very uncomfortable position. I had to use the Original style instead). Now when she is older and heavier, this one is the perfect carrier. I absolutely recommend this style for bigger infants, not newborn though.	
1. 	My baby struggles badly with reflux and has since he was 4 weeks old.  This positioner has helped in many ways:He came home from the hospital with jaundice and had to be hooked upto a UV machine at all times for just over a week.  Because of the short reach on the tube, we had to lay him down to sleep on our couch.  This product kept him in place the entire time and kept him safe while he slept somewhere besides his crib.In his early days, I would swaddle him and put him on his side.  Not only was he able to sleep more soundly but I also had the relief in knowing he was not going to choke sleeping on his back.He was also struggling with spitting up every time I would lay him down to change his diaper.  I have the contoured changing pad and I purchased another inclined sleeper to put under the changing pad cover to keep him more upright when I change him.Now that he is 4 months old, he has learned how move around in his sleep and he slides down on the wedge but I still couldn't live without it under the changing pad.	
1. 	Diapers smell and I like to empty out the diaper pail frequently. This is the perfect size, with a deodorizer compartment.,it's been perfect for our needs and it's empty before it gets too smelly in the room.	
- 1	I was hoping I found the solution to avoid water in my babies eyes while rinsing the shampoo out. Sadly, this wasn't it for us. You have to press FIRMLY to create a seal. To push firmly enough to create the seal, my little one ended up toppling over in the bath. My baby can sit unsupported and has been for a while. But one hand was used to try to help support him and the other hand was trying to maneuver this to create that seal and then I needed to get water to rinse his head... Obviously the feeling of almost being &#34;pushed over&#34; in the bathtub startled my little one so panicked ensued as little fingers tried desperately to pull the splashguard off.	
1. 	This bib is fantastic. The only down size is the neck is large, the rest is pretty good! I will be ordering a few more  now that my kiddo has started to feed himself more.	
- 1	ovens get hot (duh) and the adhesive doesn't stick when the oven is used.  fell off in a few days	
- 1	I'm going to buck the trend here.These bags are very cute and stylish.  They are effective if you want to reduce your usage of plastic baggies.  I like how they are zipper and not velcro.  They do a good job, for the most part, of containing foods, although, if you're trying to store something juicy (like cut up oranges), you might be pushing your luck as the moisture will gradually seep through the seams and make the fabric outer cover damp.If the only things you're going to use this for are dry snacks like crackers or cereal, you're probably fine just wiping the interior with a damp cloth after each use.  And then once a week throwing it in the laundry for deep cleaning.But if you are using it for anything that is going to leave any residue (juicy fruit, oily chips, PBJ sandwiches, you get the idea here) these are really not practical.  Turning inside out and wiping the interior doesn't get it clean enough for me.  You can do a load of laundry (but most people don't do laundry every day) or hand wash and submerge it in soapy water, but the fabric outer takes forever to dry.  So you really end up having to buy a 2 day supply of these to rotate through if you want to use them everyday.  And they are relatively expensive, so buying several might be cost-prohibitive for some.Also, the outer fabric, while cute is... well... fabric.  So it can stain.  Making your cute bag not-so-cute anymore.  Also, it fades and shrinks a little, so the bag doesn't lay nicely after a while.  Not huge deals, but worth mentioning.  Your kids probably won't care.If your looking to buy this for your kids, I would instead go with theBumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Yellow, LargeorBumkins 2 Count Reusable Snack Bags, Blue/Green, Small.  They are about half the price of the Itzy and for anyone who has used the amazing Bumkins Bibs, these are the same material.  They are a breeze to wash, dry super fast and I've never had it hold a stain.The prints are loud and garrish, but my kid likes it fine.  Much more practical for busy moms (and dads!).I have both the Snack Happened and the Bumkins bags, and I reach for the Bumkins every time.	
- 1	I was unable to unlock these - would have prevented everyone in our house from getting into cabinets!  I sent them back.	
1. 	No other bottle brush cleaned the Avent bottles like this one did.  It is curved at the tip perfectly to fit the curves of the bottles.  The spiral end cleans the inside of the nipples well also without much effort.  Each to hold and lasts a long time.	
1. 	Maybe not ideal for an infant, but after about a month, it works remarkably well. And it doesn't look like a SWAT vest, which is a plus in my book.	
1. 	For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret.	
- 1	I agree with the other poster who said this needs to be recalled. We used it fine with our newborn for a while, I actually loved it. However, one afternoon I found it bunched up around my 1 month old daughters neck! She is a real squirmer and easily would break out of regular swaddles so I thought this thing would be a good idea but it turned out to be too dangerous. I also filed a complaint with the government consumer safety agency. I'm using a SwaddleMe now and it works much better, it can't bunch up around the neck. I heard a Woombie is good too.	
1. 	This is a must purchase for your Bob as the cooler weather approaches. We purchased this and the wind/rain screen. Both are excellent products; fit the Bob perfectly. Our son can enjoy the outdoors in snuggly comfort (and his mom can still exercise in the winter!).	
1. 	I bought this for my 3 month old daughter because she always was rubbing her blankets or swaddles or burp cloths against her face. She also began sucking her thumb and we thought we'd rather have her suck on a lovey than on her thumb. This item arrived fast and we had no issues with the packaging. I followed the was/dry instructions and it held up just fine. I slept with the lovey the first night so my scent would be on it and then introduced it to my daughter the next day. I put the lovey on my daughter at every nursing and I also put it in her car seat at every outing. She took the lovey quickly. She doesn't &#34;need&#34; it as she is only 3 months old, but she certainly holds it and rubs it every time it is with her. I still sleep with the lovey to allow my scent to be on it and perhaps I smell my daughter's scent, too, which is why I love it so much?!  The lovey is a perfect size, the material is soft, and the ears and knots in the fabric are perfect textures for my baby. I have the pink one and am pleased with the colors and the overall appearance. I will definitely buy another one and I hope my daughter keeps loving on her lovey for a long time to come.	
1. 	Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.	
- 1	Love the artwork,  my daughter loves the ABCs but it slides all over the table. We bought another one to put underneath to keep it in place. Bummer	
1. 	I bought this changing table with the matching Delta Jenny Lind crib from another store (shop around for the best price).  When they arrived, my husband and I set up the changing table first.  It was very easy for us to set up (although I think it would be quite difficult for just one person to do).  I did feel like the wood was going to crack at times, as in some places it must be strained to fit together while you tighten the screws, but it held up in the end, and is actually much sturdier than it looks like it is going to be when you take it out of the box.  Are there nicer, sturdier products out there?  Absolutely, but you're going to pay for the difference.  Overall, we are very pleased with the value of the product for the price.However, as a side note, the oak crib did not match its matching changing table.  The changing table is a nice reddish oak, while the crib was very blonde.  We took the items back to exchange for a matching set, only to receive another unmatched set.  Please be aware of the color differences if you are considering purchasing the set.	
1. 	I bought this when my daughter graduated to the big crib at three months. She laughs continously when I turn this on. It isn't very useful to lull her to sleep but I use it to entertain her in the morning when I getting ready. My only complaint is the way it attaches to the crib, it's a bit awkward and it damaged the wood finish a little, however a little padding under it has solved the problem. I have never used the remote, so I can't comment on it.	
1. 	This is a great bibs for beginning eaters. I like how they are machine washable. Cute designs. Neck size works as well.	
- 1	I can't comment on the carrier itself. I honestly was disgusted I actually touched what was sent to me. I ordered the gray and white mesh- and sent to me was a very used black bjorn. I'm allergic to cats and the item was covered in dog or cat hair. This product is for my 8 week old son, I would never have purchased this if I knew it was gross and used!And yes- I ordered the new Bjorn Mesh, prime (which of course was on time). Not happy.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and loved it for the first six months.  Then I discovered what a waste of money it was.  Once solid foods were introduced into my son's diet, this didn't even come close to holding in the stench.  I even used the different types of refills that were made for it...ie. infant, original and toddler.  Still didn't do the trick.  I even put air fresheners in and near it....  Eventually I gave up and took dirty diapers straight out to the garage and only used it for pee diapers.  Still a hassle to remove the diaper weenie so now I just use a normal trash can.  Much less hassle and same results.	
- 1	My son is a little rough on things, so keep that in mind.  It was a great concept, until my son figured out how to pull it out, and then broke it.  The plastic did crack very quickly while still in the holder, as it is flimsy.  Additionally, he could pull it down in front, and reach over it.  So - they probably need to try again.	
1. 	It works well, is easy to install.  you can't roll the window down, obviously, while it's attached.  For the price, it's a nice option to have while driving on a sunny day.	
1. 	Highly recommend this.FANTASTIC BABY BRUSHThis is an excellent baby brush - we bought this for the brush alone - toothpaste will be a nice extra when we start using it (just water and the brush with an infant for now - and baby loves it).  He actually smiles and opens wide.  This is contrast to using a wet cloth to wipe his gums and teeth which made him cry.  It must feel like a baby gum massage or something.The brush is like a large, soft thimble with a mini brush (very soft) on the finger pad.  You put it over your index finger and rub it on baby's teeth and gums.  From what we read (including from the American Dental Association), you should start some kind of brushing this as soon as baby starts teething, but toothpaste seems optional for infants.TOOTHPASTEWe're not using the toothpaste yet, so I hesitate to comment on it - other that you can see from most of the other reviews that the toothpaste is a big winner too.	
1. 	I use this nursing cover mainly at church in the mother's room. It works exactly as it should. The stiff neck stands out a bit and makes it easy to look down and see baby and adjust things. The cover is large enough and I like the black color with eyelet pattern since it goes with everything. I also like it because it makes a great item to drape over the carseat when the baby is napping to keep things dark.	
- 1	I'm surprised these have as good of reviews as they do, because our experience was terrible!! I purchased these on sale at Walmart, bought 4 of them. I wanted to like these sooo bad! My son seemed very happy with the easy to hold shape of them, and liked the flexible soft straw a lot. It's an easy shape for a one year old, who, like our son, is skipping the sippy cup stage and heading straight onto straws. They also didn't seem to leak at all just holding them upside down, which I always test on these silly cups before deciding if I'm going to take them back or not. On to the BIG negative: The day I purchased these, came home, cleaned one out, and handed it to our boy. Our son dropped the first one we handed him ONE TIME and it SHATTERED into at least ten pieces. I had water and 3 ice cubes in it, nothing frozen. Thinking maybe it was just this one cup, I gave him another one. SAME THING happened less than an hour later. Mind you, he's 13 months old. He wasn't chunking the cup, or dropping it from any place high. He was simply doing what kids do, walking around, holding his cup, and clumsily dropping it. These should be made to withstand a lot more abuse than this. I will be returning all of these cups to Walmart first chance I get.	
- 1	I totally agree with the previous reviewer.  Our daughter LOVES NUK nipples & pacifiers, but these are a pain in the rear to try to find in the middle of the night.  Heck, they're a pain to try to find any time - even if she drops it in the middle of the day, if the pacifier falls with the red NUK face down, it literally blends in with whatever it's on.  Very frustrating. Go with the ones with color.	
- 1	the blanket is very soft but every time I use it i have to get thefuzz off the baby. It sheds on everything!	
1. 	I live in Massachusetts and wanted to make sure I could keep my baby warm when we went out. I looked at the BundleMe, but then read that it's not recommended by car safety experts because it sits between baby and the car seat bottom, somehow compromising the seat's performance in a crash. So I went with the CozyUp instead, and am very happy with it so far. It goes on very easily. I thought the head opening might bother my baby, having the fabric so close to her face, but it doesn't seem to. Getting her in and out of the carseat isn't any harder, and I feel confident going out that she is warm. I recommend this to other mothers.	
- 1	tipped over far too easily if sides are pulled onmattress not a snug fit and is therefore a suffocation riskswiftly returned with no problems thanks to Amazon's great returns	
1. 	Big, but great tub for newborn.  Kept my son, comfy, warm, secure and safe	
- 1	this doesn't fit in my car (volvo) and I had to rig it with tape to kind of work.  Should have just returned it but I opened it to install it.	
1. 	Amazing, adorable, colorful, safe, and giant!  Folds up easily and not too heavy to carry around if you want to take it.  The ideal playpen.	
1. 	this is such a good price for this base. It was easy to assemble and I love how easily it folds to fit in my car.	
1. 	Works good at restaurants to keep little one from touching dirty table. Large surface area. Rubber-like surface easily wipes clean. You can put food directly on surface. Easily rolls up and can keep in diaper bag. About the size of a paper towel cardboard roll. Deducted one star because suction cups do not work well to keep mat in place. Would recommend. Haven't found anything else that works better.	
- 1	THIS PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA BUT IT WAS REALLY NOT. I DID NOT LIKE HOW THE BABY WAS PRESSED AGAINST MY SISTER'S CHEST. IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE 28 POUND. SHE IS AN AVERAGE SIZE BABY SO FATNESS WAS NOT AN ISSUE AND THE PRODUCT IS RECOMMENDED FOR 8-35 POUNDS. IT HAS TOO MANY STRAPS AND THE MATERIAL SEEMS VERY BASIC (CHEAP)WE DISCARDED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THE BABY WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE IN IT.	
1. 	My daughter is five months old and we still use this item!  She sleeps so well and it really works well to keep her positioned correctly.  We love it and highly recommend it.  My niece, who is seven weeks older than my daughter, also loves and still uses hers.	
- 1	For solid foods this container is okay.  I would avoid this item if you want something leak proof.  The lids are difficult to snap down, and even with a lot of effort to make sure that the lids were sealed all the way around, liquid still escaped from both sides.  I would only use this for foods like mac/cheese, cheerios, and items of similar consistency... Cleans really easily in the dishwasher, though.	
1. 	My little one loves these bottles. The size is perfect and the design makes it easy for her to hold.  The drop-ins make clean up easy!	
- 1	I was really excited to get these and start using them.. but I didn't find them anymore comfortable than the Medela flanges that came with my pump. I actually think it makes the whole flange/bottle combination annoyingly bulky.  I did not see an increase in milk production as other reviewers had said they did.  I was hopeful to fall in love with this product and get an increase in production but was not impressed.	
- 1	I had ordered this blanket a few months ago, and wanted to order a third for my baby to have at daycare. The Taggies I received, sold from The Pro Store, is not the real deal.  First, the material is fleece on this blanket, not boa as stated in the description.  There are also only four tags on each side, not five (16 total).  The product tag says &#34;my taggies&#34;, where the authentic item says &#34;Taggies&#34;. I will be attempting to return this item and will report to Amazon if possible.	
1. 	We use these bowls all the time! They stack great in a refrigerator or cooler. They don't have the worlds best seal (so don't put anything liquid) but they are perfect for baby food or finger foods.	
- 1	a huge disappointment. it sags, and can't hold any bottles. Bottles just flip over. Forget even trying putting in adult drinks.	
1. 	We had a Sesame Street potty seat from when I potty trained our daughter 3 years ago, but it didn't seem like it would block any spray from my son.  He just turned two and has expressed a lot of interest in using the potty (he's gone a number of times in the last week!).  He loves this seat and says Go peepee on the Winnie the Pooh potty! (or Go peepee on the McQueen potty, since we have a different one in our bathroom downstairs).  No spray/splashing problems, easy to clean/wipe up.  This mommy is happy!	
- 1	My 18 month old son is ready to be potty trained. In fact he asks for the potty. However, the faucet extender is a pain. When he washes his hands he obviously plays with and touches the extender. The unfortunate thing is that this product is actually 2 pieces. So in effect he pulls the yellow part off and...tada, no more extender. The game becomes to throw the yellow part and have mommy go pick it up. There are faucet extenders out there that are 1 piece. Oh well, waste of money for me but at least now I know. Be warned. Child might find this a toy and this 2 piece extender will be useless.	
1. 	This bouncer has a seat with the least incline of all the Fisher-Price bouncers, and it is suitable for a very young baby without much head control. Of the three bouncers we've owned, this one is my favorite. The melody of the music moves between the left and right speakers and features a variety of instruments and sounds to stimulate the baby's mind. The toys are within reach of a small baby and the mirror overhead is interesting to our baby (though it might be more interesting if it weren't so convex).Fisher-Price is not a reliable brand and this bouncer is no exception. The baby's right-hand toy mount does not trigger the music when it is pulled as the left-hand toy mount does. The vibration motor in the Sensory bouncer we received had a high-pitched whine as if a ball bearing were going bad. The two other bouncers we've tried include the rainforest bouncer (the volume control periodically changes to loud on its own) and the puppy bouncer (though the baby loves the puppy face, the poor connection in the arch often turns off the music, and the toys are out of reach for all but the biggest babies).	
- 1	Very hard! Our baby cried when he fell on it in his crib. We returned this item-definitely not for us. We do not recommend this.	
1. 	This play gym has survived through two children and looks just as great today as it did when we bought it. We wash the mat and the plush toys often. The items are easy to clean. The butterflies do not spin automatically like I kind of assumed they might, but they are fun for the kids none-the-less. Colorful with great sounds and great detachable toys.	
1. 	This pump is awsome!  After the first couple of days I was about to give up breast feeding but I'm glad I didn't!The first two days you won't even have breast milk, you only produce colestrum.  The third day, your milk comes in and your so engorged that you'll wonder why anyone breast feeds.  Well, at least thats what happened to me!I tried pumping to bring relief but it only put me in more pain because the pumping was making my nipples totally swollen, I had ice packs in my bra!  I then refused to pump hoping the milk would just go away or stop building up.  When that didn't happen I would try to force feed my three day old baby, needless to say, that didn't work either!By the fourth day I thought my breasts would explode if I didn't get the milk out, so I had no choice but to pump.  I drained myself on the fourth day, a few times, but by the end of the day, the milk comes out much easier and my nipples were used to it.What does this have to do with this specific breast pump?!  Very little but I thought this might help some frustrated new mother out there.However, this pump does get the job done in more than half the time of a manual pump.  I've used the Avent manual with my first baby and it took forever!  Also being able to adjust the suction and speed makes the job much more pleasant.	
1. 	I purchased this stroller for my babysitter as she is taking care of two other children aside from my baby. It is very helpful for her to take my baby and the three year old in the stroller while they walk the six year old to school. The material is great and the orange color is awesome. Although it can be a little heavy, it's well built. It is a great product!	
1. 	I bought this monitor and even though my baby will still arrive in July, I have already tested a lot and it works just fine! It films even without any lights at all! I think I would be worried about leaving my baby sleeping by herself (my first!) but now I feel more secure as I don't need to go to her room all the time to check on her.Baby monitor without video are worthless, in my opinion! If the baby is right in the border of your bed - for example - it won't make any different sound until he falls. But with the video you can see and save him before the accident happen!	
- 1	I thought this was supposed to be a good pillow for breastfeeding but it's not.  Because it is rounded and not connected to me it slips out from under my baby while feeding.  He ends up in a hole and I need to have a towel or blanket over the pillow to stop him from sinking.It is very cute and the cover is very soft but it really isn't functional for breastfeeding.	
1. 	These are a great quality toddler bib and we have a lot - everyone should have them in both long and short sleeve!	
1. 	I am absolutely in love with this.  I sleep better, my son sleeps better... I can lay, half asleep, rubbing his belly, helping him keep his pacifier in... and it is so nice to have him right there...  I bought it when he was 4 weeks old and wish I had it from the beginning.  Absolutely love it!	
1. 	I am a Family Childcare Provider in Massassachusetts. I have 3 children sleeping in cribs and have purchased many crib sheets. Some don't fit the crib mattress correctly and the kids are able to pull them off in no time (2 year old)... These sheets have nice wide pockets for covering the mattress completely. Easy to change and vibrant colors to boot... A very good purchase...	
- 1	Our daughter spits up and drools a lot, so we bought this to save her sheets from nightly washing.Pros:- The fabric is very soft and absorbent while the backing keeps sheets safe.- Most things shrink a lot in our washer and dryer but this has come out just fine and without any shrinkage.- The sheet saver does keep the sheets clean as long as the baby doesn't travel too far down her crib.Cons:- The cover is a bit too small since our daughter travels in her sleep and he head doesn't stay in the same position.- The strings that hold the cover in place are too short and too thin.  It is very difficult to tie it on securely around the slats or our crib.- The strings have become a safety hazard when our baby isn't swaddled since she can reach out and grab them.	
1. 	Love the sounds, love that it is plush, and love the velcro strap. My daughter is almost a year and we use it every night. I like that it shuts off after a time period. I only wish there was a button to turn it off if you accidentally push the button (like in the car).	
1. 	We love the Bjorn, and love this new (more feminine) color! Great fit for our infant twins and a little more stylish now too :)	
- 1	I bought the new infant insert like everyone else on here hoping it would support my baby in the ergobaby. The ergobaby seems like it will be great for when my son gets older, but this infant insert just doesn't make any sense. My son is squished and hot. Not to mention it doesn't support his head at all. When he's leaning backwards he looks like he is straining his neck as it doesn't offer much support. I don't know if I'm just doing it wrong but he's looking straight up towards the sky, that can't be comfortable! If he leans forward he is right under my chin so I can't look around and I'm afraid he can't breathe. To be honest my son and I both hate this stupid thing. I wish they would come out with better instructions on how to use it. I might try what others have said they did and just use the cushion, but at 4 weeks I don't think he'll have enough head control for that.  Maybe down the line it'll work. I'm excited to use the carrier without the insert.	
1. 	I have a large one-year-old - in the 90th percentile, and this fits him perfectly. It's been great for winter and has kept him toasty with some fleece footie pajamas underneath. I highly recommend all HALO sleepsacks. The material is soft and the zipper is easy to pull up and down. Big thumbs up!	
1. 	If there were 10 stars for the rating system instead of 5, I would probably give it 9 out of 10. It's a great product but it's not exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it's big enough for 2 adults and a picnic basket (not really much more). Yes, the handle is nice so it folds into a purse-like contraption for carrying. And yes, the backing seems to keep out the moisture since we last tested it on a moist lawn. But the top material is sort of plasticy. It's not crinkly cheap plastic, but it's not comfortable like a soft blanket. I guess there are give-and-takes when it comes to trying to stay dry or using a traditional blanket.I got several other picnic items at the same time on Amazon so check out those reviews as well. And let me know if you find them helpful!	
1. 	You'll need this, for the diaper changes. Safely place the diaper, then the baby fold, hold and tuck. Great product, nice quality of material. Has storage place for few diapers and wipes (wipes are inside a supplied plastic container) and very, very useful while travelling. Only caveat, as the material is synthetic on top, in cold climate - placing the baby on it, welllll he/she might not like it! Could have had a cloth cover on top.	
1. 	I was among the parents who were really upset by the news about BPA in children's bottles -- especially because I exclusively pumped milk for my son, which meant that his milk was not only served but also stored in plastic bottles. We switched to glass shortly after the news broke.The Evenflo glass bottles are certainly a great buy -- the price is fantastic! I wasn't wild about the rubber nipples that came with the bottles, but I just pitched them and used the nipples we'd been using. (Just about any standard-size, as opposed to wide, nipple will fit these bottles.) I also feel like glass just gets cleaner than plastic ... that's probably not true, but the glass doesn't get scratched and cloudy like plastic, so the bottles seem more pristine to me!Of course, the best part about glass bottles is that glass is inert. So there are pretty much zero worries about anything leaching into the milk (or formula).Now, the downside ... these suckers are HEAVY! We almost never used the larger bottles, because when filled, they just weighed a ton. And if you've never been smacked in the face with a bottle by a toddler ... well, let's just say these ones are way more painful than the plastic ones!And, unsurprisingly, glass can break. These are quite solid, though, and I think we only ever broke two -- one at home (it was dropped on a hardwood floor) and one at an airport (my son threw it onto a chair with a metal arm ... whoops!).Since my son is no longer drinking anything from bottles except a little water at bedtime, we've switched to BPA-free plastic, just for convenience (and this co-sleeping family's safety!). But when our next baby is born and I'm pumping at work, we will DEFINITELY be storing the milk in my glass Evenflo bottles.	
- 1	I sadly went by the weight guidelines, very, very bad idea. I bought these to use with my Flip diaper covers; however they were too big. Now I am stuck with over 24 for of these things. I boiled, washed four times AND dried twice. Afterwards, they still wouldn't fit in the diaper cover. My daughter is 16 pounds and a thin girl, I cannot image using these on her, it would be too bulky. Save your money, go with Green Mountain Prefolds. Wish I had from the start.	
1. 	I've been using this for my son who's now 7 months old.  He loves it. The features are nice & it's built pretty sturdy.  He's never tipped over in it, but I also don't put it in the rocking position since you aren't supposed to until the child is a toddler who's getting into and out of it by themselves.I also have an older model of the same chair for my daughter who's now 3 and she still uses it!  I got her's used, so I don't know how old it actually was, but the vibrate function quit on her's when she was a little over 1.  (Of course, she didn't use the vibration anymore by then anyway, so it didn't really matter.)  My son's vibration on his chair is still working great though, so perhaps they have improved their manufacturing on these newer ones.I like how the seat belt is able to be put underneath the chair for toddler rocker use. It seems safer that they aren't actually removable plus they don't get lost that way either.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for only a couple reasons:1. If you have a very small baby the toy bar is too far away. (My daughter was always small-below the bottom curve on the growth charts...at 2 years old she'd barely reached 20lbs.) However, for average or bigger babies, the placement is perfect. (Like with my son, he is in the 75th percentile & it has always worked fine for him...but he was the exact same height and weight at 4 months that my daughter was at 1 year).2.  While being used as a rocker for toddlers, it is reclined a bit further than I'd like.  There are only 2 settings for the seat back and even the one that's more upright is still leaned back pretty far.  It works well for kids to lay back and relax to watch tv or something, but it'd be nice if you could sit it up more like a regular chair.Overall, a great buy & will last you a long time! (which is really nice since most baby gear gets outgrown pretty quickly)	
- 1	I'm sure they're great for others, but I simply could not get the hang of them (combined with a prefold) after 2 months. They leaked out the legs AND the back every sing time. From what I've read elsewhere, the elastic binding (otherwise known as FOE) and tag have a tendency to wick moisture.I'll stick to pocket diapers...only 3 leaks after 4 months!	
- 1	I got this one because of the price.  Yes, it is cheap.  But I find that at our house (in the city and near other houses) there is just constant interference.  It pops, hisses and goes snowy.  And the interference is loud enough to wake you up...repeatedly...all night.  We tried the other channel, removing electronics from near it and nothing makes it better.After about 6 months we have turned it off for the most part and use our audio monitor for sound. if we need to look we turn it on, but otherwise we don't use it that much due to the interference.We can see the baby though the way we mounted the camera we can't see the whole crib from about 3-4 feet above the crib.I would not recommend this to a friend.  For the money you spend you could just spend a bit more and get a better one.	
- 1	I'm not sure how other people can give these a good review, or maybe I don't know what they're supposed to be used for? Certainly not diapers!  My mother recommended that I get some flatfold cloth diapers just for cleaning up messes, using for burp pads, etc.  The ones she meant were the cushioned ones, however. These are the consistency of cheesecloth - I mean like, see-through! I'm returning immediately.	
1. 	We didn't want more furniture if we could help it and this was a good compromise.  This fits right on your chair, or you can use it on the floor.  It has 3 positions, so it was easy to use when he was just starting solids.  The tray is easy to put on and take off and the whole thing is easy to clean	
1. 	I use these with my Medela pump in style advanced with no issues whatsoever. I love them better then the bags, they are easier to store in my opinion, they don't leak, easy to thaw, easy to heat in a bottle warmer. They are the perfect 2 oz size for my newborn baby who takes between 2-4 oz per feeding. I have bought 2 boxes to keep me going for a while.	
1. 	We love these bibs - they are all we use.  They are water proof and the pocket catches the drips, drops, and blobs that occur at every meal.  The various fun designs and washability are also a nice bonus.	
- 1	The thermometer that is stuck to the cushion is useful but the plastic is too sharp and pointy.  It's not completely flush with the cushion so when you lay your baby down on it, the thermometer will scratch your baby's bottom.  We have to use a wash cloth to cover the thermometer when we use it.  I wish they would have put the thermometer somewhere else on the cushion- like the side- that doesn't touch the baby.  Either that or make it so the edges are not sharp.  The cushion itself is nice and gives good support though.Update-- I have since pulled off the thermometer completely.  It's glued on and when I pulled it off a bit of the cushion came with it.  Not ideal but better than having a sharp edge scratching my baby's bottom.  We just use the thermometer separately to read the temp of the water.	
- 1	I used prefolds and covers a lot, but this one tended to move every time. Couldn't keep the prefold in straight and so then we would have to change entire ensemble every time. One of the reasons I liked prefolds and covers was the ability to change the prefold and use the cover several times. Not the case with this one. Had to change cover every time.	
1. 	I really love this product. it was perfect for my changer topper and most covers fit that I bought for it. one thing is though the picture looks like the changing cover vynil is alwyas flush against its surface but actually it is not. The pastic vinyl is loose and hovers above the surface. No big deal since the cover does the same thing.	
1. 	Purchased these breastshields for use with my pump in style medela breast pump.  The box contained two, hard plastic, breastshields which attach to connectors (sold separately). You will also need valves and membrames.  I purchased because the shields that come with the pump in style were size M (24mm), which didn't fit.  Good purchase and good price compared to other online and in-store products.	
1. 	I've been using this for my son who's now 7 months old.  He loves it. The features are nice & it's built pretty sturdy.  He's never tipped over in it, but I also don't put it in the rocking position since you aren't supposed to until the child is a toddler who's getting into and out of it by themselves.I also have an older model of the same chair for my daughter who's now 3 and she still uses it!

- 1	These are nice and useful in theory, but only if you don't have a toddler with grabby tendencies. Our toddler ripped them off within a week. The sticky tape that is provided with the corners isn't good enough to hold them in place, realistically, if you have kids with any amount of natural curiosity. We are going to try and find a better double-sided tape for these, but this purchase may just be a lost cause.	
- 1	I was disappointed with the fact that you can't inflate by blowing air with your mouth.  I would need a machine to blow air into tub. :(	
1. 	such a space saver for the cabinet and everything is so much easier to reach now  this is my 2nd organizer	
1. 	This is very convenient. I have it connected to the side of our changing table, which makes it easy for me to have the essentials readily available when time for a diaper change. Great purchase.	
- 1	the zipper broke on both bags pretty fast, and the elastic doesn't adjust to fit into a diaper can. I won't buy it again. Blueberry makes a much better one.	
- 1	We got this for traveling. First trip it was OK although it slipped off the bed by night's end.While it kept him from rolling off the bed, he could easily just go over it.And on our second use it kept deflating & we found a small hole on the seem that couldn't be patched. We did try the useless repair kit...No luck... Hole continued to leek. A rolled towel or small swim noodle work better than this overpriced, overrated piece of plastic. Unfortunately the return window expired so needless to say its was a total waste of money!!	
- 1	I previously had the Suummer Infant handheld monitor with a 1.8 screen and it worked great other than occasional static.  When I had my second baby I needed another camera and on a whim decided to upgrade to this set instead (I got the set that comes with dual cameras). While the daytime vision is pretty clear, night time vision is nearly worthless. I placed the camera in the exact same spot where I had my previous camera and I can't see anything at night whereas the night vision from the cheaper set was very clear. Also, in both day and night modes there is a lag...like with a cheap web cam...movement looks like it's in slow motion. Very annoying and I didn't have this problem with the previous one either.  All in all I'm disappointed that I didn't just get an extra camera for the one I had...this one definitely isn't worth the money.	
- 1	I bought this on whim during a trip to Babies R Us without reading any reviews first-MISTAKE! It was $40, which I thought was expensive, but it also warms baby food jars so I decided we would be able to use it long-term--WRONG. First, the settings for each type of bottle and whether it's room temp, frozen, etc. are totally inaccurate. We tinkered with the settings for a few weeks to finally find a set that worked for our 8 oz. refrigerated formula in glass bottles. The settings? Wide neck, frozen breastmilk. Even then, we sometimes had to reheat it several times. Other times, it was too hot. After cracking 3 of our glass bottles, we returned it. I later read reviews on BRU that indicated it melted some plastic bottles as well. This warmer is a total miss and waste of $$. We are now happily using an old-fashioned pan of hot water.	
1. 	We have gone back and forth over whether or not to buy a diaper pail or not..we adopted a nearly two year old and know that she will not be in diapers much longer.  These scented bags are a great option for those who won't need diapers for much longer.  They really do mask the poo-poo smell and that's all we needed.  5 stars!	
- 1	We have a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio infant seat that we purchased in 2008 for our first child. We lived in AZ so we never needed a bundle me. I purchased one with expectation of using this for our second now that we live in the midwest and I am due in December. Lucky for me a friend came to visit and I was able to dry run the car seat with the bundle me, and it does not fit in the car seat due to the wings. However, I love the cover and the snuggliness and will be attempting to modify it to fit around/ under the SIP wings. Once we removed the elastic my friend's daughter was able to recline better, but she was awkwardly sitting in the car seat at first.	
1. 	We ordered this for our 2 1/2 year old since he has outgrown the pack and play and we needed somewhere for him to sleep when traveling.  This works great!  Setting it up is a breeze, and it seems very sturdy.  It takes up much less room in the trunk than the pack and play.  He had no problem sleeping on this during a recent trip.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that the sheet that comes with it is not very good.  It's rough and doesn't seem comfortable.  You could easily throw a crib sheet on it though.	
- 1	We got half a dozen of these to secure the kitchen cabinet doors from a 1 year old. The adhesive is good and so far it has stayed on. The lock is also practically impossible for infants/toddlers to open. My problem has been that 2 of these are already broken. The plastic strap broke right off the connecter and there is no way to fix it. It just snapped and came off. The plastic is a bit rigid and hence it's breaking off easily. In my opinion the design is good and they could have gone with a less rigid plastic strap, even a rubber/fabric strap would've worked.Feb 2013 - Update 1: I had ordered more to replace the broken plastic straps and then just keep breaking. Great product ruined by poor quality material.Jun 2013 - Update 2: Now after being tired of replacing it every time the plastic strap broke I've found a workaround. I used extra shoe laces that were lying around and just folded them into two, cut them in right length and used them in place of the plastic straps. You have to use a filler (any tape) or tie a knot to hold it in place inside the connector. Works great and no fear of it breaking, ever!	
- 1	We use this tray for our four month old's toys to keep him busy in his Bumbo seat, and in that regard it has been useful.  However, the tray makes the leg holes pretty small, making it difficult and awkward to put the baby in the seat and even more difficult to lift him out. His legs usually get caught on the tray. Since you must snap the tray in place before putting the child in the seat and cannot safely remove it while a baby is sitting in the seat, we have had no other option that to struggle with it, or not use it at all.	
1. 	I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it.	
- 1	I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.	
1. 	While the hospital offered to take footprints of our baby, we were so exhausted of being there that we refused so that we could leave more quickly. Though I didn't regret this decision, I did regret that we didn't have any footprints of our little newborn. So I purchased this product as a way of remedying that. We found it really easy to use, you just put babies feet on the little ink pads and press the feet onto the included thick pieces of cardboard-ish paper. Though you have to be careful that you don't screw things up, since you only get to ink pads and there are 2 feet, we found it pretty easy to do, even with a somewhat squirmy baby. We got four really great prints of both feet and are so happy to have this keepsake.I then scanned in all four sets of prints and now have them digitally to send to grandparents and others. I also plan on making some little photo frames for Christmas for relatives who would appreciate that, and having these digitized will make it easy to do that for everyone. Overall, a great product, easy-to-use, and well worth the price.	
- 1	I bought these because we liked the newborn covers-- the fit was just right for our little 6-lb baby girl over newborn prefolds and kissaluv newborn fitted diapers.  However these one-size covers fit my now 10lb baby very poorly. When I fold down to the smallest or medium size, the garter around the leg holes gets really bulky.  No leaks though.  Even at a larger setting there are garter marks around her thighs and she has quite skinny legs.  The thirsties x-small and duo wrap covers and the blueberry coveralls fit her much better.  Maybe when she gets bigger, when we won't have to fold the rise down so much, these will fit better.  These are my least favorite covers and I honestly regret this purchase.	
1. 	I am not paranoid by any means about crib suffocation.  My seven month old does occasionally go to bed with a teddy bear (he insists upon having something to cuddle) and we keep his limbs out of the crib slats by way of a breathable bumper.  But it is nice to be able to keep him warm without putting a blanket in the crib, as a blanket that could get around his face does give pause.  In the sleep sack he can kick his legs to his heart's content, and the sack is loose enough that he's worn it once in his car seat on a particularly cold night.  The sack is roomy enough that we could secure the car seat straps between his legs without problem.  It was safer than putting him in his seat wearing his fluffy down coat, and kept him warm.  We use this thing every night.	
- 1	This product sucks. My little boy LOVES to chew on things while he's teething - and he bites down hard. He was never able to bite hard enough to get this dumb thing to vibrate. Very disappointing.	
1. 	This pillow was a great sleeping aid for the prego. Its still gets used for a body pillow. Its also great on the couch, lol!	
- 1	I wanted to purchase a diaper bag that didn't look like one.  But I do wish I had searched around more.  The Diaper Dude is bulky.  It's hard to find what you are looking for in the larger storage area and it's always in the way.  A backpack-style bag would have been a better option.	
1. 	We've used this diaper pail for 16 months now and smell never escapes from it (except when we open it to change the bag). We use plastic trash bags from Target, we pay I think $4 for 100 bags. It's a deal and works great. I could not imagine a diaper pail that would work better than this one.	
1. 	Delivered as promised. Not toss away cups. Easy to wash and reuse! Still using them and condition is still good. Dish washer safe	
- 1	This did not last very long.  It looks nice and appears to be well made.  However, within first 2 weeks of it being on the seat in front of my 2 y.o., he discovered that he could hook his heels in the pockets and yank them.  I was driving on a highway, so there was nothing I could do to stop him.  Pockets survived, but mat completely ripped away from the strap that ties it around front seat headrest.  Wish it were a sturdier fabric and construction.	
- 1	it has/had great promise. We purchased one for our younger son (2) and he loved it. So we got another for our 5 yr old son. The first one stopped working after 2 months for no reason. It just would not charge and like other reviewers said something inside was rattling  like it had come loose. Luckily Amazon refunded us - I did not even bother contacting the manufacturer. Our second light broke today. It did fall but if it can't handle a fall what type of portable light is that? I won't ask for a refund since my son did drop it but I feel these are poorly designed and need to be improved. My younger son was devastated when it broke and my older son was crying tonight because he liked carrying it to the bathroom at night. We got the Kinderglo moon that is similar and portable and so far it is excellent. We just ordered another for our older son since they both need night lights still. I do NOT recommend this light.	
- 1	~BACKGROUND~I purchased the set that includes these foot rattles, but in different colors -Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle & Foot Finder Setfor my 2 month old son to use in aiding his motor skill development.~PROS~- Cute and colorful eye catching designs.~CONS~- Foot rattles are hard to put on initially and then remain stretched out and too big.- Foot rattles are not designed like a sock with a curve to them. The are merely tubes of fabric. Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?- Foot rattles keep coming off. There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down. Even over socks they just keep sliding down. When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.- Rattles are a bit too quiet.- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.~CONCLUSION~I think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.Unfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles. This is strange because he loves looking at and touching similar looking toys.I would not recommend these and would recommend spending your money on something else.	
1. 	This is a nice, cozy fleece sleep sack for the winter months.  My son sleeps well in these esp. since we can't use blankets in the cribs these days.  I love the puppy dog print on this one:).  Very cute!	
- 1	We used to use just a regular trashcan with an airtight lid to hold dirty diapers, but there's only so many times you can wash it out or put some baking soda in the bottom before you need a new container. So, when we were visiting a friend I noticed that they had an actual diaper pail, not just a trashcan, and that it worked really well. It was a diaper champ and it worked great. You couldn't smell anything standing right next to it. For some reason though, I decided to try the diaper genie. I liked that you could open it with your foot--theirs was a bit hard to twist back and forth with one hand (of course it was also two years old). Big mistake. I should have bought the diaper champ, and should have kept the box to return the diaper genie. The smell is horrible. After a few diapers are in it, it's very smelly. Plus, every time it opens it releases a lot of the smell. I checked that the internal closure mechanism is still shut when I open it--it is, it's not a broken one, it just sucks. Also it's really flimsy plastic and feels like it's going to break whenever I open it to take the bag out. And the bags are horrible! They made the bags about half the size of the actual space inside so you have to change them constantly (the bags are as big as the actual plastic ring they come in, tiny!). The pail could literally hold another bag worth of diapers in the space available around the current bag. And because it opens from the middle to remove the bag you can't use it without the bag. I'm going to try other bags, but it seems like they would be quite difficult to put in it. But I'll probably just end up giving it away and buying a diaper champ. Don't buy this product!	
- 1	My son recieved this for his first Christmas and he was just over 5 months. Before long he started to put it in his mouth, as babies do, and the paper sticker unglued. He didn't choke on it, thank heaven, like that other child in the reviews. So now the button is just covered in glue which I was going to try removing with Goo Gone, but then I'm worried about that being left on there even after I clean it off.  He was completely in awe of it though, always stopped the crying and was great to bring out in public. I did worry too about the brightness and speed of the flashing lights but tried to use it in moderation and not let him hold it too close to his face. Anyways, if this sticker didn't come off it would be a great toy. I've even contemplated buying him the new version and replacing the old one, but the new version's sticker is also paper so I won't spend my money on it. A shame too, even now at 11 months he still loves it in the store. How hard would it be to make the whole button colored plastic. Geez.	
1. 	This little guy was one of our baby shower gifts that actually gets daily use.  It's cute, for one, but I really questioned whether or not it did much for my baby.  I don't think it did when she was really small, but the white noise seems to be useful for her now, at nearly four-months old.  We use this basically every time she sleeps, whether a quick power-nap or going down for the night.  We have it strapped to her crib (which she has slept in since before 1 month old) and have used it basically every day and night.  We always use the heartbeat sound since I think for now, having some consistency is probably the most comforting to her.  I think the monotony of the sound is probably best for little babies, too.  The whale sounds seem like they wouldn't be very soothing to anyone, of course, I'm not a baby, so my opinion probably doesn't mean much.Occasionally, once the sound stops, she will actually wake up, but turning it back on and rocking her a minute or less will have her out cold again.  I do wish you could have the sound on longer, for that reason.  I also feel like the plastic switch box is pretty cheaply made and find that the buttons kind of stick in a pressed-in position.  This has not affected being able to play it or anything, yet, but it's kind of annoying and I wonder how much more abuse the heartbeat button will take.Overall, I think that using this regularly comforts her AND she uses this sound as an association for sleeping and calming down.  I used to think I'd just set up and iPod and speakers in her room for white noise sounds, but this sheep has been really convenient and easy for us to push the button and be all set.	
1. 	This stroller is fantastic for our Graco SnugRide carseat. Very easy to open and fold, lightweight so easy to stow in the back of the SUV, small enough to maneuver through tight spots (like between racks or down aisles in stores), and turns on a dime. Decent storage under the seat, plus a cup holder and a second holder on the handle. In response to the reviewers who said the carseat clicked into place but still flipped out -- there are two RED clips that, after clicking the carseat into place, must be turned to lock the other end of the seat down. If you don't turn those red clips, the carseat is NOT secure. But if you do turn them, that seat's not going anywhere. We highly recommend this stroller.	
1. 	We really liked the chicco keyfit 30 carseat and were debating between the chicco travel system and this snap n go to use with the carseat. We decided on the snap n go because it is light weight, easy to fold and put in trunk (with one hand), and an added bonus was it was inexpensive. Many people said the travel systems were very bulky and cumbersome. We have been extremely happy with it. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because it can be very difficult to remove items (i.e. diaper bags) from the bottom carrying basket... it is usually necessary to remove the carseat from the carrier to easily access the storage basket. If the snap n go had a hinged basket door at the back that you could drop down to access the basket it would really help.Also noteworthy is the keyfit30 does not snap into this snap n go frame. Many retailers say this is very dangerous, and that the keyfit30 and the snap n go are not compatible for this reason. However after researching many people use the keyfit30 with the snap n go frame with no problems, and likewise we have had no problems as well. Although it does not snap, it is a very snug and secure fit. The strap/buckle system adds extra security to ensure the keyfit30 stays in the snap n go frame.I highly recommend the snap n go carrier frame.	
1. 	We own more than 10 of these bibs, and we love them. As far as I am concerned, they cannot be improved upon. Buy one and see. They are totally waterproof, roll up and stuff into diaper bags easily, and they come out of the wash looking like new. Even after 2 years of heavy use. Seriously, stop researching and buy this product (or any other Bumkins bib!)	
- 1	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! If you are ok with that, then it's fine. However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. No thanks. I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.	
- 1	I borrowed this swing from a friend when I had my twins.  Within 6 weeks the controls shorted out.  Once you turned it on, you could not turn it off unless you removed the batteries.  So I bought the same swing (I wanted to return a working swing to her).  I used it for about 6 weeks & it did the same thing.  Since it was new I called Graco & they sent me a replacement motor.  Just a few weeks later I had to call Graco again because, yet again, it shorted out.  They have sent me another replacement motor & I am going to put it together & return it to my friend because I HATE this swing.  The reason it got 2 stars is because Graco has been fabulous.  The swing would get 0 stars from me, but the customer service would get 5.  My Fisher Price swing is still working great after 4 years & it has survived toddlers!  If I had to buy another, I would get a Fisher Price swing.	
1. 	This is pretty much a must-have for infant seats, I don't know why they don't just sell them together. Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt, then just pop the car seat/carrier in and out with a simple little latch. It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze. Definitely get this!	
- 1	We actually tested these vs the Joey's hemp inserts. These ones absorbed 3 oz of water, the regular Joey's (single insert) absorbed ~5 oz of water (almost 6 oz), and the Joey's premium (a thin double insert) absorbed nearly 9(!!)oz of water. They're all nearly the same price and about the same size, so I wouldn't recommend these. I've been told before that organic cotton (they're all a cotton+hemp mix) is more absorbent than regular cotton, and now I believe it! :)	
1. 	This changing pad made me feel much better than I wasn't going to smack my son's head on the edge of the changing table. It makes both of us feel secure while he's changing. We didn't end up using the straps on the pad because our changing table had a strap, but this is still a plus in my book, because it could be used on a surface not intended to be a changing table.I was also concerned that regular changing pad covers wouldn't fit it, but they do.	
- 1	I am giving this a bad review because I did not fit my pump. It will NOT fit a philips avent COMFORT twin electric breast pump. I felt like they should have specifically said that. Do not buy this if you have the newer comfort pump.	
- 1	I got this because I have a Deluxe Jumperoo but noticed that my baby was having more fun in the exersaucers at daycare because he could turn around.  He does like to jump so I tried to make sure that he could do both.  Well of all the things we have for him he dislikes this the most and I don't blame him.  I personally hate it too.  First, it's a pain to put together, it doesn't seem like the best quality, the little feet on the bottom are worthless and just cause problems, the bouncing part isn't very bouncy at all, the 3 height adjustment is a joke and you would have to adjust then put baby in to see how the fit is and then remove to re-adjust.  That's too much hassle!  The adjustment is just different snaps on the underside of the seat.  Why do I want these things putting pressure on my little guys diaper area.  Doesn't seem very comfortable to me.  Now I made the mistake of placing one of the toys in the wrong slot and had to move it.  Let me tell you removing toys is extremely hard, even my husband who is a carpenter had a terrible time removing them.  I, like he, couldn't remove them with my hands.  He needed plyers to squeeze the ends together to remove.  That is just way too much work.  All in all I would say it's not nearly worth this much.  If you want a better quality exersaucer then get an Evenflo one, if you want something nice and bouncy then get a jumperoo.  We've gone and purchased a new jumperoo because they now have seats that spin 360 like the exersaucers.  My son is much happier because now he can spin around and jump like a mad man.  Don't waste your money on this.	
1. 	I've had my Kidco for 2 years and I've not had a problem yet...although I'm known to take really good care of things.  I do not put the blades in the dishwasher, I wash with soap and water and boil in water to sterilize.  Sometimes I throw the plastic compartment in the dishwasher if I'm feeling a bit lazy and won't need it right away.  I make larger batches of food and freeze them so I've never had a problem pureeing anything smooth.  I do steam most everything before I blend which may make it easier too.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  There are no bells and whistles, just a simple design.	
1. 	I bought this after our own picinic type blanket kept soaking through with morning dew or grass that had been rained on the day before.This blanket doesn't have that problem. But I'd say it is a bit on the small side. My other blankets fit 2 adults and a couple of young kids easily. This one really only fits 1 adult and 1 kid (maybe 2 kids) without having to cram together.Folds easily though. Might just buy 2 to solve the size problem.	
- 1	It is extremely hard to open the pouch. I suppose this is great when your baby is holding it, but they are nearly impossible to use especially if they are a little dirty from having food in them.	
- 1	They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick. It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated !!! Think of nightime feeding !!!!	
1. 	I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.	
1. 	We have 3 of these, and could probably use a couple more.  These are the easiest stools for my daughter to use.  She climbs up and down the potty herself on it easily since it is so stable.  She can also easily retrieve it and put it somewhere when she needs a little step up.  I wish there was a taller size of this so we could use at the sink (she's too short to reach with just this stool at the sink).  And in the early potty training days she wasn't tall enough to reach the toilet with this either, so I think a taller size would just be really useful.  But regardless, this is a good reliable stool to have and looks nice.  I find baby bjorn products to generally be very good.	
1. 	I am happy Medela makes a replacement pack but I hate the fact that I had to buy them in the first place because the ones I had fell apart.  They are very flimsy and eventually they split in half or the tabs fall off.  You have to use them or else the pump doesn't work so be prepared to buy several of these if you plan on breastfeeding for awhile.	
- 1	We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter...  It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it.  All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat.  It does not stay flat -  Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles.  Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying.  Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess.  It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.	
- 1	The strings ripped off when I tried to pull it off of the crib. I also didn't like the idea of this being on top of the mattress and crib sheets. So it might be a good idea if you don't have a great baby mattress or aren't into decorating the baby space. At first I thought this product was clever, but once I got it I realized how useless it was. It's so easy to take the crib sheet off of my baby's crib, so I really never needed this.	
- 1	I bought a grey one and paid more money than what I should have on it and what I received was a lime green one.	
1. 	Great to find this product in Winter. Keeps baby cozy while we stroll around town. Easy on and off. Fits on my Uppa umbrella stroller and my Orbit one too!	
1. 	We bought this crib for our first child and recently got it out to put up for our second.  After getting it up we both commented on how this crib was a steal for the money.Cons: The finish does scratch fairly easily and our son chewed on it and ruined the finish...but it is what it is, we weren't buying a lifelong heirloom to pass down.Pros: Sturdy, easy to assemble, manufacturer's customer service - when we got it out to reassemble it we had discovered one of the lug nuts had fallen out and we couldn't find it anywhere, so I emailed the company and I had the replacement part at my door within five days - for something we bought nearly five years ago - I find this ASTOUNDING in regards to customer serviceOverall - if you're debating between this crib and another - I feel this crib is a HUGE value!	
- 1	Mom's and Dad's do not buy this pack and play. I opened the package excited to set this up and right away I noticed how cheap it was. Then the worst part the middle brack was longer than the ones on either side of it... so the pack and play was not level and rocked. Sooooo unsafe. I called the company and they told me to call Amazon and return it. I'm so mad about this. The worst part was trying to put it back in the box. DO NOT BUY THIS!	
1. 	My daughter is a big time drooler and cannot be without a bib, ever.  Regular bibs allowed her clothes to get soaked in drool in a matter of minutes.  These bibs are great at keep her clothes dry and fewer changes are a big bonus as she hates having her clothes changed.	
- 1	I hate this bottle brush because I use it to wash out Madela bottles and they have a small opening. I can get the brush in and it touches the sides but when I pull it out I get sprayed with water. every. single. time. I have only had it a week and am already looking for a new bottle brush.	
1. 	I haven't had any issues with the suction cups staying stuck to the windows; but with that said, I did take a moist sponge to them before sticking them to the windows of my car and holding those suckers down for about 30 seconds. The issue I've had (which is so close to a non-issue it's not funny) is that the hot indicator stops being effective after a particularly hot day. It's been 40 degrees outside the past week and my hot indicators are still white. Also, do you really need a window shade to tell you that the car is warm inside?Other than the ridiculous white hot indicators I like these shades; they've been the most durable I've used yet over the past 2 years.	
1. 	I received this tub as a baby shower gift when I was pregnant with my son.  My husband and I were so excited to finally use it when our baby's cord stump fell off.  We didn't use the hammock part, we just put him in the infant seat in the tub so he would be warmer.  He loves the bath and I feel secure using it.  He fits in it perfectly and I don't worry about him slipping around in it.  The tub has little places to put your soap and wash clothes.  It also has a little plug on the side to drain the tub, although, honestly, I just flip the thing over and dump it out in the bathtub.  We set it in our master bathroom bathtub and I sit in the empty space left over. I don't worry about splashes or filling it. I highly recommend this tub to all new moms.	
- 1	Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.	
1. 	Fit my Medela PISA parts perfectly.  Wish they had come with membranes/valves though.  Over all, I guess I can't complain since it didn't promise that.  It was just kind of annoying that it didn't come as a set.	
- 1	Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this pump... but I find it to be LOUD, uncomfortable and just not very effective.  With my first child I used an Avent manual pump and a Playtex double electric pump.  I didn't love the Playtex pump because it did not have quite enough suction and was a little loud (just normal motor noise) but it was comfortable.  When I received this Ameda Purely Yours model from my insurance company I was hoping I would have an electric pump that I would like more than my Avent manual pump.  No such luck.  I can express 5 oz in a few minutes, quietly, with my Avent manual.  With this pump I'm lucky to get 3 oz. in 20 minutes.  I've tried different sized flanges, Pumpin Pals inserts... still no improvement.  Maybe it is just me... maybe the Avent manual pump is really better for me, regardless of what the experts say about double electric pumps being better than manual.Update:  Our pediatrician told us at a check up appointment that the pumps being provided by health insurers (I received the Ameda Purely Yours through Blue Cross Blue Shield) are terrible.  That has certainly been my experience with this one.  I guess if I had to do it again (thankfully I don't because the Avent manual is working so well for me) I would invest in purchasing a Medela or an Avent electric.	
- 1	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.  I could tell that she was not very comfortable.  It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.  Also it is very small in size.  If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.	
1. 	I didn't realize the colored pieces were not solid, and it's hard to tell from the photos. They aren't loose enough to pinch little fingers, but still add an additional element to the toy. The sound is nice when rattled, and the colors are bright and cheery. The simple design is perfect for my baby who gets over stimulated eaily. It's pleasant sound has a calming effect. This is the best little teether I've found.	
- 1	I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy, and it worked well for the first few months.  However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support.  I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much.  Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around.  Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all.	
1. 	So happy to find a cozy fleece sleepsack that doesn't come in a washed-out pastel color.  Keeps my little cupcake warm at night while looking delectably adorable!	
1. 	These work so well - they are amazing. They are thick enough so that you do not have to worry about leaks. And these bags are somewhat opaque so you do not have to worry about people seeing too much of what is going on inside the bag. I will never, ever buy another brand - I would rather stick with something that I know will get the job done right!	
- 1	The material & design is great but I don't know how mothers use this comfortably w/a newborn who is basically flopping around all over w/o any neck support. It was also difficult to transfer my 1 month old out of the sling smoothly and into her crib while keeping her semi-asleep.	
- 1	Came in package with a tear at the seam. I kept it anyway. Its white but also stickers in package left mark on top. I think I will just get one with pattern next time.	
1. 	I love this blanket, can throw in the washer and hang to dry.  Folding it up is easy and the strap is super convenient.  Tons of moms I know have these, that's the only potential drawback - they're so popular you might have the same one as someone else and have trouble telling them apart!  Definitely recommend!	
- 1	SO MUCH FABRIC! Even once I got the hang of it, I HATED how it felt on, it is SO HOT! My baby would get hot and fussy in it too. AND it just doesn't feel that secure. I like the Ergo 100 times better then this.	
- 1	My baby never wanted to take them, or when he did, he looked like he was going to choke (even with the newborn nipples!), and was doing a mess, with milk dripping everywhere. The Evenflo nipples were cheaper and better.	
- 1	Didn't use this cup much at all. The spout Collapses when my son was drinking out it, causing the liquid to come through the top.	
- 1	The term 'blanket' is not an accurate description here.It's far too small to be used as a blanket - I use it as a burp cloth (just covers my shoulder).  It looks like a rushed-job from the creative department of someone's kitchen table. Neither plush or elegant. Missed opportunity!!	
1. 	I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.	
- 1	I got this second hand from a friend. Her baby loved it but grew out of it very fast. My daughter was 5 weeks and 11 lbs when we first used it. There's absolutely no noticeable difference in speeds, also it swings VERY wide. My baby girl loves a wide swing, especially when she's fussy in her car seat - it relaxes her instantly, but a SLOW one.I had her in just long enough to do some quick makeup and pack her diaper bag. I nursed and burped her 30-45 minutes prior to putting her in the swing. She was swinging for 10-15 minutes when I heard her fussing because she woke up. I went to soothe her and see if she needed to nurse again and she started spitting up TONS of milk. It was literally gushing out of her mouth.Now, my diet is consistent, she exclusively breastfeeds, she's never had a bottle, she's never had bad gas, and she's only spit up a total of 3 times all of which were trace, dime sized amounts. There's no reason she would spit up that much. Thank god I was in the room and looking at her when this happened because she could have choked on it there was that much.I will NEVER use the power swing on this again. Which is a shame because I was looking forward to her enjoying this. If you want something for your baby to nap in try the fisher price newborn napper. It's takes up less space, folds away, is portable, and rocks very gently either from your or your baby's movement.	
1. 	This pillow was very supportive to my baby belly and my back.  My husband was worried I would keep using it after our daughter was born, and I was tempted!  Will use again for 2nd pregnancy!	
1. 	I breastfeed my son for 95% of his meals, but every now and then, I like to have the convenience of a bottle. If you're not trying to build a humongous stash, this is perfect. Simply twist in your pump and freeze. Thaw out the milk, shove in the dishwasher and repeat!	
- 1	These look so cute, but they are not practical.  After washing once or twice, they become stiff and non absorbent.  These sit in the bottom of my burp cloth pile and do not get used.  Very disappointed.	
1. 	I had the original ( smaller version) for when my baby was 0-6 months and after she turned 6 months we started using this one. Is thicker and more bulky offering more cushion and keeps warmth better so now it's perfect. But I am not sure about summer time... it may be too thick.	
- 1	I almost wrote a glowing review when i first got it. it sat on the faucet fine, it protected their heads, i could use the thingamajig that makes the shower go on and off easily, and the kids loved how it spread out the water and that i could fill it will bubble bath. that was the honeymoon period...the bubble bath dispenser stopped working pretty quickly even though i tried washing it (i figured it was sticky with soap) and helping it along with my fingers while it ran, but it became more of a hassle than to just pour the bubble bath or shampoo directly in the running water.then the mildew... oh the mildew. i didn't initially take it off after every bath but noticed it was started to get a little black on the inside. so i bleached the heck out of it and then took it off and hung it to dry after every bath. it was still FULL of mildew. it was stained to the point that even though i knew it was disinfected i just couldn't use it anymore because the whole bottom was tie dyed with black mildew stains.overall since i had to buy another faucet cover anyway it was a dumb purchase.	
1. 	These bibs work to contain a lot of food from hitting our floor and save me tons of messy laundry since i can wash these and set to dry with their high chair tray. This means instead of having many cloth bibs, I can have just the two of these and use over and over. Perfecto! Less mess on the floor, less wasted food and less laundry!  If you child is used to cloth bibs, these might take a couple times to adjust too. We first tried these when my boys were under 1 years old and after using cloth bibs, they clearly hated these and i put them away for awhile. I tried again many months later and one child accepted it right away, the other took a couple times and then also adopted them. Now, they have no issues and enjoy putting them on themselves when they climb into their chairs. I don't use a lot of plastic anything, but these have very little skin or food contact unless you feed your child naked, so I feel ok with these.	
1. 	This dispenser makes life with Baby easier.  Fill the container with the correct amount of formula for a bottle in each section.  When ready to mix the formula, just put the spout into the bottle and empty the measured formula into the bottle.  The lid fits securely on the container and is not difficult to take off.  Quick, easy, and no mess!	
1. 	These bottles are working great for my both 19 and 5th months. Although I agree with the fact that cheaper bottles do the trick, my children prefered these from all other I tried. A lot have to do with the nipple. Any way, what ever are your intentions, that's your child that's going to choose his bottle !!	
- 1	Brand new out of the box, the reservoir smells terrible. I've descaled it 3 times as instructed in the manual and the smell remains. Anytime I steam something, the smell is there and the food tastes terrible. I haven't fed my baby anything made by this horrible machine because I feel like I would be poisoning him. I didn't know about the smell until now because my husband got it for me as a Christmas gift and my baby hasn't been old enough to eat solids until now, 6 months later, so I can't return it to Amazon. I've called Beaba and requested a return or refund with no response. Until Beaba responds and resolves this issue, the 1 star remains and I will continue to discourage people from buying it.	
1. 	I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.  I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.  I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.  It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.  Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.  If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.	
- 1	I have used decals many times, from many different companies and have been really lucky I guess. I love skip hop products, but their decals just don't stay on the wall :( overall it still looks adorable, and you do get two whole trees (or really 4 half trees and leaves and stuff to do with what you please), but I was saddened by the immediate peeling, especially since I'm practiced and pretty careful. It's definitely just not as tacky as the other brands. luckily my daughter sees me smoothing it all out constantly so instead of wanting to rip them all down, she just mimics me and smooths it out again. I doubt that will last long though! :)	
1. 	We've tried a couple of toilet locks and this one has worked the best so far.  It is easy to install and does make the seat sit funny like some others do.  It is easy to use as well and stay high above the toilet away from any splashing or other unpleasantness.  This has worked very well for us and is well worth the investment to avoid toys, books and all sorts of other things going down the toilet.	
1. 	My 11 month old sleeps with this on every night and loves it. It has lovely soft colors that light up his room just perfectly and allow for me to check on him without having to turn on any lights. It eats up batteries it seems like mad, but I love it too much to worry about that!	
- 1	The description says the bottles come with SLOW flow nipples, that means level 1 nipples. When I open the package surprise level 2 nipples. I need level 1 for my newborn, what a disappointment to wait for the package to arrive and is not what you want.	
1. 	Amazing!  Nice construction, perfect for Dr Brown caps, tops, and binkies too!  This is a simple dishwasher basket, not extras that just take up space. Plain and simple and best of all BIG!	
- 1	This little toy is cute and fun to chew on for babies, but my dog couldn't help but notice the same thing! I have no issues with the toy at all for my infant - it's just as good as everybody says, but my dog takes it from the baby all the time, and we don't want to clean it up 5 times a day, so its become the dog's toy.There really is no difference between Sophie the giraffe and a squeaky,rubber dog toy from the pet store, so if you have a dog and you are buying this for the baby -- you may want to find a different toy.	
1. 	Nice quality toys -- I liked them so much I purchased all of the fruits/veggies in this series.  Carrot and bean work well for teething (although daughter favors her plastic teethers over these); tomato and mushroom are too large for little mouths to get around them.  I like that we can use these to teach my daughter about vegetables as she gets older.  We had to keep the wooden crate separately for a while because she would throw it around, but at 1 year now she can play with it safely and really enjoys taking the veggies out of the crate.	
- 1	Maybe if I had gotten this when she was younger I wouldn't think it was such a waste of money.  To get any results it has to be used on the nail for quite a while longer than my baby (and probably most) will hold still.  I got this so that I wouldn't have to try to cut her nails only while she was sleeping and it ends up that would be the only way she would hold still long enough.  I'm sad I wasted my money.	
- 1	I had two Beaba trays and wanted a third but was hesitant because of the price (usally around $20).  This tray looks exactly like my other trays and costs a lot less.  I used it several times and noticed that the silicone was a bit harder and less pliable than those on the Beaba trays.  The last time I used it the silicone cracked and then tore when I was trying to pop the food out.  Once the silicone cracks/tears you are no supposed to use the tray anymore (according to the instructions it came with).  I was excited to find a cheaper solution, unfortunately it didn't work out.	
1. 	This bed  has served as my son's regular sleep space away from home for months now (from 20-30mos so far). It's much more roomy than most travel cribs. The down side to that is it's tricky finding proper sheets. We simply went with regular crib sheets.I used a crib-sized mattress pad to add a little extra cushion and support, but I didn't go out of my way to find an extra travel mattress that would fit. I hadn't seen any good recs for one anyway.Overall, this is great value for the money and will likely provide a regularly sleeping space for my son until he's 3 or so.	
- 1	I bought this toy for my teething 4 month old after reading so many wonderful reviews.  She loved the squeek and loved chewing on this flexible toy. I loved it for about two weeks. Then I noticed to my horror that it was peeling in many different places and pieces of it were coming off. Now my baby has no teeth as yet but this toy could not even hold up to her gumming.Unless you want your baby ingesting whatever that stuff is made from, don't buy it.	
1. 	Worked very well for when my son began walking at around 12 months and would fall into everything.  I purchased the colour that best matched our fireplace mantel	
- 1	This was way too small for the price that it is.  Also it seemed like my kid could just knock it over.  Check out super panel playyard for same price and the extensions are much cheaper!	
- 1	We use the GroVia Hybrid diapering system and love it!  I have almost nothing poor to say about Grovia...except maybe about these bags.  They are the only GroVia item I have not been perfectly happy with.  I'm not even sure what it was about them that they just didn't live up to what I was expecting.  They were very small and I wasn't sure I would trust the draw string to dirty diapers.  I have ended up with Plant Wise bags instead.  A couple different small sizes for the diaper bag and two large ones with elastic for the diaper bins.  --  I still love GroVia just not this product.	
- 1	These bags are not very good, but it is convenient to pump right into them when you know you're going to freeze that milk. I found that I can use the connector that comes with these bags and cut a slit in the lansiloh or honeysuckle bags and it works just as well, while pumping into a better bag.	
1. 	So worth the price. I put mashed bananas or frozen baby food in them and let her chew away. It really helps with teething!	
1. 	These trays are perfect for freezing pureed baby foods to thaw and feed when you need them. I prefer these to ice cube trays for several reasons:-They hold more in each cube - ice cubes are so tiny for servings-The lids keep food from absorbing other freezer smells/freezer burn-They are sturdy and easy to twist, twist and pop the food out-They wash well in the dishwasherI don't have any cons for these trays, other than it does seem a touch expensive. I would have purshased more sets if they didn't cost quite so much.	
- 1	bought it for my coming baby because I want nothing but the best for her. end up I made a huge mistake by buying this pillow.This thing is not the one I saw in retail shop even the inside foam.After i unzip the cover, I found out inside only a few pieces of cheap foam which glued together.the odor is worst thing. even I expose them under direct sun for many days, the smell still stick.I dont think I will use it with my fagile new born.	
1. 	We're on our first child, and after lots of research (there seems to be good and bad about EVERY monitor out there), I asked my sister-in-law for recommendations.  She told me she'd started with an expensive brand monitor, only to find issues with it, and replaced it with The First Years monitor.  Said it wasn't perfect, but none are, so why spend more money?  Wow, so glad I took her advice!  These were inexpensive, and after four months of use, the only thing I would improve on them is their antennae (would be nice if they were less in the way when clipped on the belt).  We have not had a problem with static, unless the channels accidentally get bumped out of sync (our fault, anyhow) and it fixes as soon as we match them back up.  No interference, even when beside other electronic items.  Nice clear sound, all the way down two stories to my laundry in the basement!  My sister has gone through several different brands, my mom has several for grandkid naptimes at her house, and this one beats them all hands down.  That said - we're four months in.  We'll have to let you know what their longevity is, but I'm expecting it to be pretty good.	
- 1	I wanted to like this wrap.  My 3-month-old daughter didn't seem to like it at all though - she cried the whole two times I put her in it.  Perhaps it is because we live in Texas, and Texas summers are just HOT.  There was just a LOT of material and I felt like my baby sagged in the wrap, no matter how tightly I tried to tie it.  I'm going to continue in my quest for the right baby carrier(s) for my daughter.	
1. 	This Light Green hamper has really came in handy for my nephew bedroom...we can just thorw his dirty stuff in the hamper...then take out the mesh bag and thorw the stuff into the washer and take the mesh bag back up to his bedroom the only problem is the bag (hamper part) i wish it would be removeable for cleaning.. like if a little dirt got on the bottom from carrying it up and down the stairs.... over all i love this hamper! makes it much easy on me! i just carrying the whole hamper downstair and fold it up and set it on top of the washer and/or dryer!! i really enjoy this hamper!	
1. 	This is just the right size for the porta crib I boughtWe have a new baby granddaughter coming so it will be at our house when she is here	
- 1	I purchased this shade but find it difficult to stay on. Also not as shady as I thought it would be.	
- 1	These covers are not efficient. Each diaper change constituted a new cover because they would get so soaked. Her pants would be wet too! I went to the Real Nappies website and was disappointed to read that I had &#34;wrecked&#34; them by not washing them properly. So I swallowed my pride and stripped them. That didn't change anything. I now realize that it wasn't me because I bought new covers (Thirsties) and I have yet to strip them (been using for 5 months).	
1. 	My daughter still loves this mobile and she's 13 months now.  It's so cute with all the flowers with happy faces that she can see when she looks up.  We have it over the changing table because it's a great distraction.  Definitely recommend it.	
1. 	I have used this product every day for almost nine months, and I have been very pleased. I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but I also wanted her daddy to be able to feed her occasionally, and I didn't want to feel like I could never be apart from her. This pump is very affordable, and works very well. It easily attaches to any size bottle Avent makes, which is very convenient. It also comes apart for easy cleaning. It may not be quite as efficient as an electric model, but always works well. It's also small, which makes it easy to even throw in the diaper bag, if needed. I have been very happy with this pump.	
1. 	We got two of those for our baby boy an used them at about 4 months. Worked great, prints turned out very good, the ink can be removed easily with baby oil. The only problem I had was that I could only take the foot prints and so far not his hands - it is really hard to open a babies hand, put ink on it and then press it on a paper without having to spend I guess hours and then change the carpet...All in all a great product, would highly recommend it!	
1. 	Personally I like it, easy to install and use. But I had to return because it didn't work on the shape of my toilet.	
- 1	Every time my daughter has a bath she plays with this toy. Its easy for her to turn on and off and sticks very well to the tub.3 months later and about 5-10 uses the thing will not turn on at all. Sucks. Tried new batteries and all. I took the whole thing apart too. its like the motor is shot. too bad i wasted my money on this this was an original and fun toy while it lasted.	
- 1	this concerns me because I am not sure of the safety of the toy or whether it's a legitimate Lamaze toy.  It looks legit, but this issue just raises concerns for me.  Again, I am not saying that this toy is unsafe or not Lamaze, just that the buyer should be aware of where the toy is coming from.	
1. 	I used this the entire time I was pregnant. It worked really well and gave me a lot of support on my back. One bad thing I didn't realize is that it doesn't come with a cover. So there was no way to wash it if it got dirty since it's too big for the washing machine. Also, it ripped at the end within the first month. I didn't bother to repair it and it didn't rip more.	
1. 	I love this item. We keep it next to our bed because my daughter will not sleep in her crib. The changing table is great, along with the storage at the bottom. Not hard to put together. I did it myself in about an hour. It is very pretty and convenient to be able to carry baby around.	
1. 	Bought this for when we sit outside with my 5 month old, it is small enough to keep in the car for outside parties, picnics, etc and very convenient to carry.  We went to an outside party where the grass was just watered and this kept us dry and provided a nice place to put the baby down so she could play out of the sun.  I've washed it a few times and its held up great so far.  Love it and predict it will get much use in future outings!	
1. 	This basket is made well enough - not exceptional, but fine.  Bedding is kind of thin.	
1. 	I bought these to use as a pad on the changing table, however they are so big that I also use them in the baby's crib.  I use them as traveling changing pads as well.	
1. 	The product itself is great! Works like it's supposed to and my little one is unable to put things into the openings if she takes the plugs out. Matches my trim color nicely, not noticeable at all.The only qualm I have is that I expected both plates to be center screw style (as stated) and I received one center screw and one decora style (two screw). It's fne because I have both in my house but I was looking to cover specific areas and now am short one. Sigh.	
- 1	My son didn't like it. The milk flows to fast and he chockes. We have been trying other bottles, the perfect choice was the &#34;comotomo&#34; natural baby bottle.It's a shame because I love every product from Medela. Maybe it's a good choice for older babys. It doesn't work for our 2 month baby.	
- 1	The lid doesn't close properly. The spring works only some of the time because it gets stuck. I would have done better with a tupperware container.	
1. 	This has a very nice design and is not annoying looking like most potties. The high back is nice for my daughter because she can read her favorite book and lean back. Rubber grip on the bottom works well too, does not slide around.	
1. 	these are adorable, gender neutral bibs. i bought cloth bibs before my son started eating bc i was trying to be one step ahead of the game. big mistake. cloth bibs are for drool!! these are for food! they're awesome for traveling too because they dry so quickly! we just took one on our 2 week vacation and it suited us just fine. i won't be buying another kind of bib. BUY THIS	
- 1	I bought this based on the - mostly good reviews- however, I am giving a warning.. read the bad reviews and take them to heart.. everything stated... Stiff material that hurts then, sticks in their throat, velrco easily undone.. its all true! beware! this will be like throwing your 12.00 OUT OF THE WINDOW.	
1. 	$80.00, fine.  Knowing what I know now, I would've paid $200.00.  This is the second pair of hands you need.  It is very comfortable to use, even as your baby gets heavier.  It's got the option of facing your baby outward as well and my daughter loved to look around as she got older.  I washed it and it faded a bit but I still feel the Bjorn can do no wrong. An ansolute must and a fantastic gift idea (maybe get a few people to go in on it to help if finances are a problem).	
1. 	My baby had outgrown our hard plastic tub and was uncomfortable in it.  I got this tub as a replacement.  After reading another customer's review I also purchased a sponge for the bottom and have had no problems with him slipping under water.  It smelled VERY STRONGLY of plastic so I had to wait a couple of days to use it, I recommend airing it out.  But once it's blown up, it's ready to go.  It's a little difficult to fill since it's so puffy, I have trouble getting it under the tub faucet but since I need to test the water temperature anyway, I just cup my hands and let the water run into the tub like that.  If you had a tub hose or something it would be easier.  My son loves this tub.  He lays back and luxuriates in his bath and it's very cute to see him &#34;relaxing&#34;.  (8 months old).  The suction cup on the back is awesome for hanging it up out of the way in the shower when we're done with it.  We keep it blown up and don't use the drain plug, we just tip it up to drain it because I read another review that the drain plug got warped and started to leak.  I'm avoiding that by just tipping it up to pour the water out.  Working perfectly so far!!  :)	
1. 	I bought this booster when my daughter was 9 months old to use at restaurants instead of a high chair. She seemed to like having her own tray, and I found this booster more secure and more sanitary than using a restaurant high chair. My daughter is now 20 months old and she has outgrown her high chair and we use this seat at the table every day when we eat. I have known another mom that never used a formal high chair and only used this chair strapped to one of their kitchen table chairs. This booster takes up a lot less room than one of those huge high chairs. I love that the height on the chair is adjustable and the price can't be beat. This is one of my must have baby products. We even bought one for Grandma's house when we go and visit.	
- 1	If this pad had a nonskid backing,it would be perfect. However it doesn't and so we don't use it anymore.	
1. 	Love this book! Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!	
1. 	Haven't had a chance to use these yet as our baby hasn't arrived, but I'll update once they're in use.The packaging was OK from Amazon, but the box was way bigger than the item... could be more efficient...	
1. 	I only need to use an on-the-go bottle warmer sporadically in the week, and only to warm up a single room-temp bottle at a time, so this works great for me. Any more often than once a day, and this would be totally inconvenient, as the warmer insert needs to be boiled for 15 minutes to be usable again, which means you do have to be home for that, and it does need to cool off afterwards.Heats up to a safe temperature very quickly, and keeps warm for about an hour (residual heat for a few more hours afterwards). Not as hot as boiling water, but does the job (in a little more time), and super convenient when we're out and about.Only two cons: the time and effort it takes to make it usable again, and the weight of the warmer - it's like carrying an extra (small) bottle of water, which unfortunately does add up with everything else already in the changing bag.Pros: compact, very portable, usable anywhere (doesn't need batteries or anything else to work), fits most bottles, and I love that the instructions are printed on the heating pad, so you don't have to remember them.	
1. 	These spoons are perfect for babies just starting solids. They are light weight, easy to hold small amounts of pur&eacute;ed food and I love that they are dishwasher safe. The package claims top rack safe, but I have been able to wash them with the rest of the silverware on the bottom.	
1. 	I ordered these and they are perfect for a baby room. I use one of them for diapers, another for laundry, and the third one holds all of the headbands for my daughter.	
- 1	I washed these and then the very first time I used them, not even 5 mins after putting them in, I leaked through one. I use other washable pads no problem. In this case you get what you pay for.	
1. 	I've used these bottles for all three of my kids as they are the only thing I've found that most closely resemble the breast. We've all read about nipple confusion and it concerned me since my kids attend daycare and I still nurse when I'm with them. All three of my kids took to this bottle with no issues and I like that you can take them completely apart for cleaning. The two size option is good as your baby grows and his appetite follows.	
- 1	I thought that these would be good since they were plastic and they would bother her new little teeth. However, the dip in the spoon is a little deep and the food does not come off of it when feeding. She loves chewing on the handle but I will be purchasing different spoons for feeding.	
1. 	Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies.  My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only. My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean).  You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost. Another bonus is there is less clean up.  Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding.	
- 1	It's too hard to roll and turn. Plus, I'm not sure if they are swivel wheels or not. But I do like how it's adjustable height (just the seat is not the entire walker), and how baby can stand behind and push it.	
- 1	I returned this car seat shortly after we purchased it. It was difficult to align the seat belt buckles together before latching in and I crushed my baby's finger! The seat belt holders was not convient or easy to use. It was about the same size as the maxi cosi we ended up puchasing. The brown wasn't as deep as I was expecting either.	
1. 	Been using this since my 5 month old was born. I drape a hand towel over the top for softness. Never have to worry about his head going under water. Baby bathtubs can be expensive, so I appreciate the price on this one.	
1. 	my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).  Still will play with it.  only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.	
1. 	This bouncer/rocker is a great addition to your baby supplies. My daughter sleeps so well in it. It converts to a rocker, so it will be around the house for a while. At the price, this product is a must have. My only complaint is that the batteries in the vibrating portion of this product go out too quickly, but that could be in part of how much we UAE it.	
- 1	For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50% less and my LO still hated them! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies	
1. 	These are really great even though they do not protect from spills as well as some other brands. The reason I prefer these is because there is nothing left in the cup, unlike the other spill-proof cups which have a bulky seal on the inside. The bulky seal tends to trap liquid inside and my son gets frustrated when he can't get the last little bit out of the cup.These are also great for mixing medicine with juice. Since there is no liquid left in the cup, you know that your little one was able to get all the medication along with their drink.	
- 1	I purchased this potty seat for my 2 1/2 year old son.  While the quality is excellent, it simply doesn't function as a potty seat for my little boy.  Considering there is no shield for urine, and given the size of the opening, the pee would just go all over the floor and not in the potty at all.  Will have to send this one back and purchase another seat with a shield for little boys.	
1. 	We were using a full-sized highchair for our 6 month old, but it was huge and took way too much space up in our kitchen. Also, the tray was too high for her. So, we purchased this booster and we all love it. She is able to reach her tray easily and can pick food up from it. I debated between getting this one and one of the space saver highchairs and I'm very glad we got this one. So easy!	
- 1	This is by far the worst package I had received ever. I wanted this do bad for my daughter, the package came opened and the box was in a horrible condition. I bought I brand new item but instead I got something used. I am very unsatisfied with this item!	
- 1	I was very happy to find high contrast toys for my little one. Unfortunately it became not so contrasty when I washed it. I followed the directions of the manufacture. I washed it with ice cold water and when I say ice cold I mean it. We have been having record breaking below zero weather. This affects the temperature of our water. The water will turn your fingers into icicles just running it over them. As a precaution, I threw in half a box of color catcher sheets and ran it on the hand wash cycle of our machine. I wanted to cry when I took the toys out. Everything white turned bright pink. What were they thinking using a red dye that bleeds like this on something meant for a baby?	
1. 	These brushes are much better than the ones with the sponges on top.  The sponge ones rip after a week.  These brushes last and last.  Also, I love the nipple cleaner it comes with.	
1. 	Our son loves this. Wish we had gotten it sooner. He was 4 months before we finally got him a mobile. He was not interested in the little plushie ones at that time but enjoys looking at this one. We made it more interesting by adding a battery powered music box so it rotates. Only problem we had was that some of the cards weren't cut well so it made it impossible to change the design that faced the baby	
1. 	This works great keeping my 1 year old out of the toilet.  I have had a few adult visitors who couldn't figure out the system and were able to just remove the whole thing.  I'm not sure how they did it, and my kiddo can't, so I'm keeping it.  But keep in mind it is possible to remove without really meaning to.	
- 1	The caitlin pattern is so pretty! But I just hate the Hugs system, the rubber looks so uncomfortable, when my baby is sitting in it, the car seat cover flaps come up and you can see the styrofoam underneath, I do not have latch and there is no storage for the straps so they just hang there looking sloppy. I have it rear facing, the straps may hide better front facing, I suppose. Also I find it difficult to loosen the straps. And the seat is not well padded (compared to my other car seat - the Chicco Nextfit) I am returning this car seat. I am so sad, because it is such a beautiful pattern!	
1. 	I really like this potty seat. My cousin gave me 2 and I bought a third one for Grandmas house. It is soft & folds up into its own carrying bag for travel. Easy to clean as well. My only complaint is that its a bit floppy. What I mean is that sometimes when my daughter places it on the toilet it folds in and falls into the potty. We try to just keep it in place so that don't happen. But the fact that it fits easily in my diaper bag for &#34;outings&#34; is the main reason I like it so much.	
1. 	It fits my toto oval shape toilet bowl, I like it! And my baby loves to put it on the toilet bowl and sits on it.	
- 1	I received this feeding set as a free item from Amazon during a promotion. I really don't have any use for it because my child doesn't attend school or daycare just yet but I have found that the smallest bowls do come in handy in my husband's lunch. After using them for over six months I did come to find that I preferred other storage sets, the lids on these do not go on easy and I wouldn't really trust them to not leak. I don't hate them but I also didn't waste any money buying them... and I don't really recommend that you do either, I'm sure there are better sets elsewhere for a similar price.	
1. 	This size is perfect for the mini cribs at daycare. NOT a regular crib, NOT a pack & play! It's also very soft & cozy for the baby.	
- 1	you must adhere these to the glass for a full 48 hrs before you use them. we did that. followed the instructions precisely. and then what happened as soon as we tried to use them? they popped off the glass! they need a better adhesive to actually work.	
- 1	They advertise this on Amazon as a nursery item. I would strongly advise against it.I ordered 4 white baskets, with the hope to store diapers, wipes, creams etc. in my baby's room, in an accessible area for everyone. All of the four baskets had the same issues:- Terrible chemical odor, probably from the paint.-  The paint was peeling off and was chipped throughout. It looked like a dog had spray painted it, blindfolded.- The end of the wicker was not tucked in safely, but rather exposed on the outside and was as sharp as skewers all around it.I regretted this purchase as soon as I received my order, and sent it back immediately. I would not recommend this to anyone..	
- 1	Carefully followed directions but it still didn't stick, and easily fell off when I tested it by trying to open the oven.	
- 1	so pissed. my son will be here in a few weeks and my hubby was putting it together and two of the bars are messed up . now we need to contact graco to get two new ones so we can set it up. paid over 100 and it comes broken. thank you!	
1. 	I am the Grandmother to 2 infants and 1 toddler. One of the infants lives in our household and I can state that Avent is at the top of my list when it comes to bottles and nipples. No excess gas is produced, no bags to fuss with and have to toss away, clean up is simple just as mixing the formula is simple. No extra parts to have to put inside the bottle and try to remember if you are supposed to boil them or just wash them. I love Avent.	
- 1	I'm sure that some people like reusable bags, depends on how green you want to go but I just don't feel like I can get this clean enough to feel comfortable about using over and over again. The instructions say that you can put in the dishwasher or machine washable. I wouldn't want to put this in the clothes washer and it's hard to place in the dishwasher and keep it open and in place without it getting blown around the dishwasher by the water spray.To me these are like reusing a straw or plastic sandwich bag. Just get a new one. There are other places to save money on and other things make more of an impact in the landfill than how many times that I might use a plastic sandwich bag.	
1. 	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!	
- 1	This is a MUCH smaller seat than most I have seen out there for toddlers.  There is no back to the seat, and no straps so it really is a booster seat only.  However my three-year-old daughter, who is average size, barely fits in and it actually HATES it because it is so small.  For the price, you're much better getting a baby-to-toddler seat with tray and straps than this one.  It'll probably work if you have a very small child and small chairs, but my average-sized dining table and chairs are too big for it.	
- 1	These cups leak more then any other cup we have owned (and we have a lot). If you want a good insulated cup try the Munchkin click lock sippys, or Zoli-Bot straw cups. These ones start leaking the second you put the top on even if the cup is only half full- it just starts pouring out the top of the straw! We just threw them all in the trash.	
1. 	Works well and as expected	
1. 	This product is genius and it doubles as a teether.  Our baby frequently flips it around and naws on the handle.  We use fresh organic pear and frozen organic strawberries, blueberries & raspberries (the cold is great on the gums).  It is challenging to clean and would just say mush up your bananas and feed with a spoon - this doesn't work well with bananas.  Pear comes through the mesh very easily along with the berries.  Our little one loves this and it's a treat for her.  This is a must have for all new mamas and a very cheap purchase.*Baby may initially reject because of mesh but express some food out and they will love.*Great for teething babies.*Great transition from super pureed foods but before lumpy foods (this makes the food have some texture).*Can be difficult to clean but just buy a baby tooth brush to get into all the nooks.*Buy it, it's wonderful!	
1. 	I have never used nail scissors in my life and was skeptical to experiment but my little one was constantly scratching his face. A friend highly recommended this and I am so glad she did. You can get a great close cut with these and they are super safe. Can you still accidentally cut too close- yes... if you are trying to cut super close its possible to nick the skin under the nails but the blade is thin enough so you can see where and what you are cutting if you are careful. This is a must have for any newborn. I tried filing with an emory board and even the expensive battery operated files but this is much faster and more accurate. Great product.	
1. 	This was perfect for newborn grandchild. Daughter was very pleased getting this as a gift.  Made baby bathing safer and less stressful for everyone.	
- 1	Yes, I hate it.  The suction cup doesn't stick.  The toy doesn't stay in the base.  The (loud) music plays at the slightest vibration.But my children love/loved it.  I got rid of the suction cup base and try to move carefully around the toy when it's put away.I'll get rid of it as soon as they forget it's there.Bottom line:  Run.  Run far away.NOTE:  Apparently, there's a new version of this toy.  Mine is two years old.  I obviously have the old one.  The new one might be much better, though the incessant music is one of the things my kids love about it, so this toy without the music is not really this toy anymore.	
1. 	My husband and I love this set. We don't know if we are having a boy or a girl, so we wanted something for either and that could grow with our child. The actual colors and fabrics are much prettier than on the website. We painted the walls a medium blue and two dressers, one yellow and one green to match. We purchased animal knobs at a home improvement center for the dressers. I washed the bumpers with Dreft on delicate cycle and hung to dry, they came out beautifully, it held its shape and there were no rips. I washed and dried the sheet on delicate and had no fading and very few wrinkles. I haven't washed any of the other items yet because they won't be touching the baby. (We are hanging the quilt on the wall for now.) We purchased or registered for many of the coordinating accessories, but we like that we can add almost anything animal theme to the room and it fits in nicely. Everyone tells us how gorgeous the room is and we can't wait for the baby to arrive in a couple of weeks to see how he or she likes it.	
- 1	I was fooled by the picture. Okay, a lot of that is my fault. I should have read the weight and dimensions and of course it's obvious that photos can make things appear bigger than they are in reality. Nonetheless, I've never quite been fooled like this with size before. These clothes are TINY TINY TINY. You think wow, a pack of 10! but really they all add up to barely 1 decent sized cloth. Also, they are incredibly thin and not absorbent. They should have been made thicker. I don't buy the excuse that thin = more gentle = better for baby. You can make it thicker, more absorbent, and super soft still and in fact, that would dry or clean the baby faster so the baby ends up being less frustrated. If baby could speak, she would say, I know I'm 7lbs, but the size of this washcloth is STILL a joke to me!	
1. 	I am very happy with this purchase. I am a SAHM and only pump once a day, if that, so this is all I really need. It is comfortable and easy to use and I am glad I went against friends opinions that I had to have an electric pump.	
- 1	I want to do cloth diapers for baby #2 and bought these to use as inserts thinking that they would be fine. When I got them I opened them to make sure they would fit, they did, but they were super thin and did not look like the ones that were given to me with my first born. So I looked these up again and read the product and read the review. I did not know that there were different ply's and I wished I had read the reviews before I bought them. I went ahead and washed and dried them as the instructions said and was disappointed that the reviews were right. The product when washed came out really wrinkled and when tumble dried per the instructions they shrunk and were wrinkled and to me seemed to be thinner. They do not look like they would be useful for burp cloths. Will not be using them for diapering.  I will be using these for cleaning and dusting.tried to use as a diaper but they soak from end to end in no time. even with a diaper cover they still got her clothes and blankets wet it was almost like she didnt have anytthing on.	
1. 	Works just fine with no issues in my 2013 Mazda CX-9.  Recommended, and I would buy again.  Keeps the seat clean and tidy.	
- 1	In general I love Under the Nile baby clothes: they are wonderfully soft, often thick cotton, lasting and size just right for my baby who is in 99th height percentile, when all the other brands are always too small for her age group.  HOWEVER, this top is strangely cut. It is &#34;granny style&#34; at the bottom, and the holes for the legs are to tight for my baby's thighs (and she's not that fat - just really long).  I got three tops and opened one, so I will return the other two and try to move the snaps on the one I have to allow for more room. Very disappointed as I have all the matching footed pants and love love love them!	
1. 	I bought these to use under my kids' car seats to protect the leather underneath. These do the job and keep the car seat from moving around too.	
- 1	I can't help but agree with other reviewers who call this item out for what it is...pure price gouging by Arm's Reach.  Leg extenders should absolutely 100% be included with this product, not sold separately (especially for a price of $20+).  I'll also be buying a more reasonable, sturdy alternative.Also misleading is the fact that co-sleeper instructions (I have the mini model) state that the unit as packaged is adjustable for beds up to 24 in height.  This really only means that the top of the co-sleeper frame is 24 high, NOT the mattress platform.  Be aware of this when purchasing.  If your bed is higher than 23-24 and you want your baby sleeping at the same level as you...you'll need to buy extensions, whether you choose to purchase from Arm's Reach or not.	
- 1	Raging piece of junk. We used it for a year. Battery wouldn't charge without video screen on. Battery never really held a charge long. Display unit died after a year. Replaced with Summer Infant Unit. Motorola should have put their name on a nicer piece of hardware.Biggest positive was that pan/tilt was silent. Otherwise, resolution isn't all that great compared to the Summer unit, it's always in night (black and white) mode, no web cam output, short battery life, and it will break.If you do without the noise level indicator, I'd go with a webcam (foscam)/smartphone solution. Otherwise, I'd suggest other options.	
- 1	My son drops plates, cups, spoons and food on the floor every single meal.It is just so tiring to pick it up over and over and over again.So I thought this would help him to keep the plate on the table.However, this suction is too weak that my son can lift it up and throw.Also, the rubber stains a lot.I just don't see the usefulness of this plate.It's so sad because this plate is so cute.I guess I just pick them up hoping someday he will learn not to....	
1. 	This is ideal for very small babies, not bigger babies (3-4 months plus) becauise it gets a bit uncomfortable for them.  There is a bump in the middle that is the problem, but its also a sign that you need to change th position of your baby in THIS tub and start thinking about washing in the regular tub.	
- 1	we tried these burp clothes for 5 months and then we just gave up,it was too rough on the baby skin so if u wanna use it for burping only it fine but don't wipe the poor baby face with it.	
- 1	i didn't use these very long. they slid all around and didn't catch no poop for me. i don't even think i got to flush one down the toilet.	
1. 	We bought 3 of these smocks for our 5 month old for mealtimes.  It it is a great product and we found it particularly helpful in keeping our baby's clothes clean.  We now use it for our now toddler's art class.  Long lasting product.  And we washed them a lot !	
- 1	I used this play yard for a couple weeks, until my baby, who is just learning to pull up to a standing position, fell and cut his head open on the rough plastic edges that stick out on the frame!  It's also not very sturdy, and super easy to push around, so when my son would try to use it to pull up, it would slide around the floor.  I'm returning this and getting a different type of enclosure for my son to play in that is safer.	
- 1	Super flimsy and rip easily. I ended up having a mess in my cloth diapers anyways so these were completely pointless. My daughter got a major diaper rash as well.	
- 1	The wedge has a pretty big bump where it meets the mattress and our son just slid down the side of it. We only tried using it one night and then took it out. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	I am rating this a one because of the color. I am sure that this seat cover would work wonderfully, however the color is so disgusting that I had to return it.  The color in the picture is not a good representation of the ACTUAL color.  It really a disgusting baby poop green!.  Believe me, I am not all that into style but I thought that it looked modern and neutral in the picture and would be a little less loud than the others but eeew[...]	
- 1	I clearly got carried away with the hype for all the new things out there to transition a baby to the cup.  Wow when my mom said just use a cup.  I will I'm done with the wired illogical designs.  Time for a cup, use a cup.	
1. 	Washed, never bled, shrunk a little but no more than expected, color stayed after wash.  Smelled like chemicals before wash.	
1. 	This worked for giving our newborn sponge baths, but I ended up getting a tub with a newborn insert when it came time for giving real baths. Overall, I wouldn't buy it again.	
- 1	I bought this product, but ended up returning it because I couldn't see how it would ever stay clean. There is no separate cover, so you have to actually wash the pillow itself. The pillow does break up into 3 sections, which makes that possible, though difficult. I bought a $20 body pillow with a washable case instead.	
1. 	Nice way to store milk. I had production obstacles so these were great because I didn't have to worry about bags leaking with my precious milk. Great peace of mind.	
- 1	These bottles suck!  A complete waste of money, maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road.  They are a HUGE pain to use.  For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle).  We had to hold it under running water which takes forever.  It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples.  If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown's bottles, they have more parts but easy to put together.	
1. 	This monitor Iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful. First, this monitor comes with 2 receivers - a must for a two-story home. We can hear EVERYTHING including noise from outdoors. The red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can't see without glasses, esp when waking up in the middle of the night, and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud. The nightlight on the monitor with the 15-minute timer is a great feature b/c it doesn't generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb. Our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won't fall back to sleep easily. Therefore, we've used the monitor light. We've had no problems nor complaints with this product.	
1. 	I got these outlet covers for outlets that I would need to use more frequently.  The installation was very straightforward.  You just need to unscrew your old ones and screw these on.  They covered the area of my outlet the same way the old ones did, which is great considering we have painted walls and I didn't want to have to touch up unpainted spots.  The screw is in the center, so if you have an older outlet these won't work.  They openings are easy to slide over and stick the plugs in, and they snap back to cover the outlet quickly and effectively.  Whoever came up with these is a genius!  So far no complaints, but if something comes up I will update this review.	
1. 	It's a useful thing to have while traveling, but doesn't have enough volume for regular use.  If you really want to make your own baby food a real food processor is a must, this isn't efficient enough for daily use.	
1. 	The best toy I've bought for my son. He loves to spin the beads and the abcs. A type of toy that is very versatile with age.I also love that I bought mine on super clearance at Target for $[...]. Still can't believe the price.It was an amazing find.	
- 1	I researched beyond belief and found a really good deal on this pillow. I was SO excited to get it...until I tried it. There's no space in it, you're stuck in this pillow cocoon, which I thought was going to be a positive as I wanted front and back support. I'm a back/stomach sleeper so finding a spot for my arm without cutting off circulation seemed impossible. The cover was scratchy. The pillow was firm with no softness/squishy ness for comfort. There was no room in the bed for my husband so I tried it on the couch (trying to avoid a return) but it didn't fit. I've never hated a product more. It was returned immediately. I used 2pillows instead and they were much more comfortable!	
1. 	I was  worried about putting this hearth guard down because I didn't think it would stick (I've had trouble with corner guards staying on)... but this comes with heavy duty velcro stick ons.  The velcro is hard to pull apart so I think it will be difficult for my son to figure out.  The pad is very cushiony and I'm sure it will serve it's purpose.	
- 1	Before my 8lb son was born I bought Thirsties duo snap wraps size 1 and Osocozy infant prefolds. Upon bringing him home even though thirsties claims to fit 6lbs-18lbs diapers were too bulky and got in the way of his cord so I went online and purchased some extra small diaper covers from various brands. When this bummis cover came in I loved the looks of it, it appears well made but as far as sizing goes it is WAY off! It says it fits up to 10 lbs and I cant imagine a baby over 7lbs fitting in the newborn size. I tried to return it but could not because I had opened the package, super disappointing : ( I also purchased xtra-small thirsties wraps and those worked out great for a newborn- I highly recommend	
1. 	I purchased two of these to fit my DaVinci Crescent 50 coil mattress and even after washing and normal drying they fit the fabric perfectly.  I use these under theSheetWorld Extra Deep Fitted Portable / Mini Crib Sheet - Burgundy Jersey Knit - Made In USASheets and it works wonderfully!	
1. 	This is a fantastic and portable blanket...great for picnics or for little ones.  Used this all summer with my son at the park and it's held up well.  Love the pattern and the way it folds up is ingenious.  The strap makes it easy to carry when your arms are full of the ten million other things that you carry with you when you have a child.  Very glad with this purchase.	
1. 	This potty works very well for us.  My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).  It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.  I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.  Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the child	
- 1	As soon as you put it on it slides right off, I do not have a shower knob on my faucet, I think if i did it would help it stay up. Waste of money, had to come on amazon to buy another one.	
1. 	Great sheet. I know that the label says not to put it in the dyer but I've always dried it on high heat. I've even washed it in hot water and thrown it in the dryer. There is just no way I would always remember to line dry it. It still fits my mini co-sleeper perfectly. I've always found putting the sheet on to be quite easy. I like how this sheet fits the co-sleeper perfectly. You won't have to worry about it coming lose. It's not super soft but I actually like that.	
- 1	I have received the Squeeze & Teethe Lamb from Infantino to facilitate my review. Let me start by saying my son is only 3 1/2 months old, but is teething. I found this very difficult for him to hold because of its size, and the only parts that really fit in his mouth were the ears and legs.  Any Mom with a teether knows how they jam the toy in their mouth. He tends to do that with the head portion, which is to big for him and he just gets frustrated and cries.  I do think the texture is good, very soft and very squishy. I will continue to give this to him as he grows, perhaps he'll be able to hold it better as he gets older. Unfortunately for now, I have to give it 2 stars for the stage I'm in.	
1. 	Love love love our Halo Sleep Sacks!  My baby HATED being swaddled but I didn't want loose blankets in her crib, so gave these a try.  They're perfect!  Tons of room in the bottom for her to kick her legs around, and her arms are free, but it keeps her toasty warm on those cold winter nights!	
- 1	Got this swing months before my son was born. Everything worked great at first and the lights were adorable. Has many options for swing speeds, options of having music off or music on with lights or not at all. The swing adjustment is great, my son preferred the side to side swinging. My son loved it and put him right to sleep in the side to side position My baby used it a total of 5 times, FIVE TIMES. And now the only thing that works is the swinging motion. The lights nor the music no the mobile will turn on! I noticed the music and lights lagged to turn on, but it finally gave out. and it only took 5 times. I will be calling to see if its recalled or they have a replacement part they could send me. HUGELY disappointing!!	
1. 	I ordered this to match my son's Sugarbooger retro robot backpack and had his name monogrammed on both in brown. (The ID card pocket had to be removed before the lunchbag could be monogrammed, but that was done at the monogram shop and didn't cost anything extra).  We have really enjoyed the set.  The lunchbag is coated on the outside and lined on the inside so that both are easliy wiped clean.  I've actually rinsed mine several times with my sink sprayer and it faired just fine.  It's extremely durable and just the right size to fit everything we need for a meal out including a drink and utensils. It is insulated and keeps things cool for several hours, though I always include a little icepack.  The pattern is so unique and looks vintage without the hazards of actually being old. I've gotten lots of compliments on these products and even had a friend order one after she saw mine!	
1. 	I've had this bag for almost 4 years.  I'm a girl, not a dude, but that's okay.I guess this bag is not huge--I've never had another one to compare to--but I have enough room to fit my wallet, camera, phone, keys (interior pocket), more keys (clipped on one of the clips), a bottle (in the special bottle pocket), a wet bag, diapers, wipes container, drinking glasses, plates, a spare pair of toddler pants, and a couple snack cups, with some room left over to shove in a toddler jacket or two if needed.  Not bad.I think I had to put it through the washing machine once due to spilled milk, or maybe I just hand washed it.  Either way, it cleaned up fine.  In fact, it looks about the same as when I got it.  I haven't used it every day, but I have used it a good number of days and it has held up.	
1. 	We decided to decorate our daughter's nursery in ladybugs and this is the perfect touch!  Not only is a good size and very cute but the light it projects and the constellations are great.  Way better than a typical nightlight that would be plugged into the wall.  This is battery operated so you can put it wherever you need and it puts off the perfect amount of light.	
1. 	My daugter is 6 months and cannot stay in one place for long, but when I put her in this she absolutely loves it. If she gets bored of one thing she moves on to the next and she already seems to know how to make the animal sound effects/classical music work the way she wants it to.The only thing I dislike about this product is that the dragon hand puppet and the seat isn't removable so that I can wash them.	
1. 	I love the Playtex nursers. They are so easy to use and maintain sterile conditions. You simply drop a new liner into the bottle and attach and clean nipple and it is ready to go.  You can mix the formula right in the bottle, shake it up, and press all the air out by pushing up on the bottom of the liner until the formula squirts out the top. This makes it so the baby doesn't get a lot of gas in his/her tummy.	
1. 	my kids had issued with the swinging parrot with the wheel. My daughter would get her hands/feet stuck in them. we took it off them for my son we tried it again and he would hit it hard and it bruised his head. It's great otherwise. you can always add other toys like rings and dolls .	
- 1	these cups are terrible.  They are heavy and extremely bulky.  Very difficult for our toddler to handle.  Don't like them at all!	
- 1	They're thin, couldn't hold spit up, and I wouldn't even consider using them for diapers! Really poor quality! One of them shredded partly when I washed it the first time! I  might consider using them as dust rags.	
- 1	We bought two of these for our 14-month-old twins to use when we eat out. What a waste of money! We used them for the first time on Friday. First of all, the suction cups did NOT stay securely in place no matter how firmly we pressed them down. The top kept rolling up. Our boys didn't really mess with them at first but halfway through the meal, one of them easily pulled the whole placemat off the table and all the food on the placemat and in the little trough went flying!Great idea in theory; I wish they actually worked!I gave this two stars instead of one because it *might* work better for a younger baby (6-9 months or so).	
1. 	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.	
1. 	Good choice. Baby can't take it off the outlet. It isn't too hard for mom to remove it to plug in the vacuum.	
- 1	This is a nice product, and not expensive which is good.  But my baby has never been interested in it.  I use the night light but its a bit too low to rely on it for diaper changing for example.  The sounds are nice and the images projected seem nice too but they do not capture the baby's attention AT ALL. And i'm talking about a very curious baby.	
1. 	This swaddle blanket is indeed a miracle - it really holds! So easy to use, pretty much foolproof (watch the video online to help you get started). Keeps baby tight and warm and ASLEEP (we started using it the night he was born and he's slept through the night since)!One small downside (if you can call it a downside at all): Our son is a big kicker/mover while sleeping and every once in awhile manages to kick one of his legs out the bottom, but it doesn't seem to phase him or interrupt his sleep.Will definitely be giving this as a gift at every baby shower from now on!	
1. 	This worked great for the first year and was well worth the price.  However, we only ever threw pee diapers in it and took poop diapers outside.  Now after a year, it's starting to get stinky with only pee diapers.  It's also been hot here, which seems to contribute.  I've had friends say that they're fancier, more expensive diaper pails also get stinky after a year or so.	
1. 	Great high chair for travel!! We started using this when our daughter was old enough to sit up, it came in handy when travel because restaurants high chairs are huge for a 5 months old and filthy.  Our daughter is now 16 months, 22 lbs and we still use it. You just wipe off the tray with a diaper wipe and throw it back in the trunk until you need it again. It's nice to go anywhere and always have a seat.	
1. 	This is a great product. It's very soft--although, as another reviewer stated, we have taken to putting a receiving blanket on the top so it's easier to wash! But it's still nice knowing there is a soft cover on the pad for the times when we don't have an additional topper on it.	
1. 	My pediatrician even recommended this sponge and that I buy several of them since they get gross after awhile, my baby seems to be the most comfortable, and it fits perfect in our sink!	
- 1	they must have altered the design at some point because what i received isn't a flip open spout, it's a very annoying bend open spout that opens over the edge.  Big Hassle to use :( DIdn't realize it wasn't what i ordered until i had already opened it.	
1. 	I gave the Eddie Bauer backpack diaper bag five stars because it is simply wonderful! I had been spotting this bag in the store for sometime and broke down and bought it. I am so glad I did. It is so good for those short trips to the grocery store, visiting friends & family , shopping at the mall. I can easily pack two bottles in a small cooler type bag , plenty of diapers (I take 6 diapers) and a compact container of wipes, I also put several outfits in the zipper part (You never know when your little one is going to mess up his clothes)and my son's bib. I have lotion and baby oil in the side pockets and everything just fits perfectly in the bag. I can also put my keys and wallet in the zipper section also and I still have plenty of room. This diaper bag is however not for a long trip, it is perfect for those short trips. I love the backpack style and how compact it is and it works great. I hated taking my bigger diaper out with us when we were only going to be gone for a couple of hours because it was so bulky and I didn't need that much stuff anyway. I think the price is very reasonable and well worth. Trust me you will use it all the time and wonder why you have those other diaper bags. I would rather use this diaper bag than the other two I have. I would highly reccommend this backpack style diaper bag to everyone! My son is 2 1/2 months old and I can carry everything he needs in this bag. Try this diaper backpack one time and you will be hooked like me!!!!	
1. 	Our Daughter loves it!  We've pretty much been using this since she came home from the hospital.  She liked looking at the lights when she was a newborn.  Now that she's a little older and more aware, she is digging on staring at herself in the mirror and batting at the toucan.  I like that I can change up the toys to make it fresh for her so she doesn't get bored with it.  This is surely a hit in our house!	
1. 	I wanted a shopping cart cover for my baby.  Not because I am a germaphobe; I just wanted something softer for him to sit in since he's only 8 months and just mastered the whole sitting up thing.  If he suddenly flopped over, I wanted him to have cushion there.  Anyway, today was the first day we tried using it.  Up until now, he was just in his infant carrier, which I put on top of the shopping cart.  Well, he is just so heavy, I no longer feeling like carrying the infant carrier around anymore (he's just under the weight limit for it).This cover was so easy to put in the cart!  Took no time at all.  He sat in it just fine and looked so comfortable.  He was happy to be sitting upright looking around the store.  I had a different cover with my first born (I think it was by Sassy or Infantino) and it didn't wrap over the whole seat area of the cart and it was a pain to get hooked up.  This cover- totally different.  I just popped it in, fastened the velco, slid in the seatbelt, done.  Maybe 15 seconds.I recommend this cover to everyone.	
- 1	This is a good idea for a teether since it's basically a bumpy pacifier that's easy to chew. However my son hated it. The actual raspberry part is way too big for a baby's mouth. We tried it a couple of times and he never took to it. Also, like many other reviewers, I wasn't too comfortable with the fact that the berry part seems to be glued on, posing a choking hazard. Overall not worth buying for us.	
- 1	First off, the suction cup only works on glass tile or very smooth tile.  The majority of the tile in our bathroom has some texture to it.  The suction cup never would stick to it.  However we had a small amount of large glass tile and it worked very nicely... for about 4 months.  Then it stopped working and now won't even stay on without any additional weight.  Very disappointing.	
- 1	I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy, and it worked well for the first few months.  However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support.  I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much.  Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around.  Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all.	
- 1	I think this was a nice try, but our baby did not like this and it was not like the breast at all. waste of money.	
1. 	I have to be honest. I bought these in yellow because they were cheaper than the others.  I am glad I did. They stand out against the hangers and clothes so I can see them.  I am thinking about buying another set because we have a closet organizer and I had to pick which racks I could use them.  Good problem to have.	
1. 	My in-laws wanted to purchase a cot for my son, who is 24 months old.  They had trouble finding one under the $60 price point in local stores (Seattle area).  This cot fit the bill, pricewise.  When we received the cot, we opened the box and my son was interested right away.  The quality is very much the same as adult cots in the $50 and up price range.  The stitching is very sturdy, the middle is reinforced with straps and double stitching as well.  The ease of folding and placing into the carry-all cover is incredible.  We intended to use this cot for travels to Grandma and Grandpa's home, since our son has outgrown his playpen; however, since opening this cot, our son has used it for his daily naps in our living room!  Everyday use with a 24 month old boy, who weighs 35 pounds and is 37 tall, and this cot has held up just great!  I would highly recommend this cot to any toddler parent looking for a nap cot or a travel bed for their child.	
- 1	This swing has some nice features. The music, the different swing positions, and the mobile. Unfortunately the swing is very loud sometimes. It sounds like it is working really hard. It wakes up my baby when it gets very loud. My husband is going to see if he can use a silicone lubricant to make it quieter.	
1. 	I like many things about this high chair/booster seat. This is very easy to clean which is one of the biggest advantages. It is a very inexpensive and functional seat which takes up little space. Also it adjusts in many ways which accommodates a growing baby. Very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	My 3 year old won't give these up.  She wears her XL sleep sacks every night.  She's got the walk perfected where she jams her toes into the corners and shuffles along.  She refuses to size up to the ones that have feet holes.  So is this a good thing? I don't really like it but she does.  You can get a lot of wear out of the cotton sacks even if your kid is far beyond just standing.	
1. 	This one is easy.  Put your stuff in, add a little water then push a button.  Truely a no brainer.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that you do have to drain it after each use.  My freind didn't and something started growing in it.  Other than that, this is perfect.  If you take out the racks you can fit a ton in it at once.  You don't have to watch over anything-go ahead and take care of your baby while this one does all the work for you.  Put this time saver on you registry.	
1. 	We love this blanket so much, we've given it a pet name! My baby only stayed swaddled until she was about 2 weeks, then could wiggle out of even the tightest wrap and cried almost all night. Then of course would sleep all day... then would be wide awake at night again! It was frustrating! When she was about 6 weeks, I remembered that I had bought this Kiddopotamus blanket (it was just sitting in the closet) and thought I'd try swaddling again. That night, she slept 9 hours straight! Every night since, she sleeps at least 7 hours, and some days as much as 10!  Unlike other swaddle blankets I have, this blanket is soft and stretchy so she can move a little if she is uncomfortable (but arms stay in there) and you can open the bottom easily for diaper changes or when the temp is warmer. We think it's a lifesaver for those who like to sleep at night. I think it has magic powers. ;) And, it's cheap!	
1. 	I bought this monitor and an extra camera because we have a 18 month old and a new born coming.  (I write this from the delivery room!) But our 18 month old was in a toddler bed but was sleeping anywhere but the bed, so we wanted to know what he was doing and that he was safe.  I couldn't ask for a better camera.  There are cheaper ones and more expensive ones.  I can't really get the color option, but I don't really need it.  Also, being able to hook this up to a bigger TV is AWESOME!  My wife just hooks it to our TV in the bedroom and we have no problem seeing our toddler.  With two cameras this works wonderfully. Nightvision is very clear with just a nightlight.  We have four portible phones, wireless internet, and other devices and we have had little to no interference.  This was a great purchase for less than 200 bucks.  Something that we can use in a ton of different ways.  We love this!	
1. 	I don't know what the old magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.	
- 1	I loved the look, the feel, everything about this chain until this weekend.  I bought at christmas for my son, he is now 4.5 months (2 months later) and teething, puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything.  Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads, I noticed it in time, a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces.  I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it, easy to choke on these pieces. If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!	
- 1	We couldn't get the sleeves past our child's hands. She's really not that big. The elastic around the cuffs is super tight. We gave it away. We like the other regular bibs from this company. Cute designs.	
- 1	The product description says that it is 7 oz cup, but I received two 5 oz trainer cups. However, I did not return it and keeping it as the product is good otherwise.	
1. 	Buy this one as soon as you find out your pregnant. I waited and had a few weeks of no good sleep, wing up several times from pressure on my belly. Slept with it for 2 night no and am 4 months pregnant. Just loooove it. The only problem now is that I don't want to get out of my bed in the morning, because it's almost too comfortable.	
1. 	I used these bottles on my baby, and now enjoy giving this BPA-free Playtex set to other moms. It's really a practical and appreciated baby shower gift. I'd definitely recommend this to a new mom or someone looking for a good gift for a new mom.	
1. 	We got this item to use mainly as a step stool for our 14 1/2 month old daughter.  She is working on potty training and we opted for one of the seat instead of a potty.  The step up is still a bit high for her to manage on her own but with a little help from mom or dad she able to manage it.  We were just lifting her up onto the seat but our doctor suggested a step stool just to aid in the process.  She was always proud of herself as were we when she used the potty but this simple and inexpensive item made her 10 times prouder of herself.  WE can tell she really feels like a big girl when she uses it and her potty seat.It's also GREAT for bath time.  We had one of those hook on tubside kneelers and it worked great for us but with age we needed more of a seat than a kneeler.  She loves to play in the water so we were usually sitting on the counter and letting her play.  Well this gives us more height and it wider than the other thing so we're able to sit beside the tub (without sitting in the wet floor) and play with her.  Plus there is room inside it to store a couple of her favorite books for potty time.	
- 1	Be aware these pacifiers are MUCH harder than the 0-3 month ones. I ordered several two packs and it didn't say what age they were for. When they showed up one said 3m+ on them and when I went to wash them I noticed they felt a bit less squishy but I didn't think anything of it. Well my eight month son is not having it. I gave him one, he put it in his mouth sucked once and then took it out, looked it over, and threw it! He's done it every time I've given it to him, he hates them and I've given up. I feel I should mention he was started on these in the NICU and won't take any other type of pacifier. So if you're concerned your kid might not like them, buy from a store where you can easily return them.`	
- 1	when i saw this product i thought it could be a life saver but when it came and we used it, it was a total disappointment. it is very small. it does not close properly. its expands but no use.. it a company should make durable, basket in which you can also put bottles as well as the nipples and other parts. it is only for nuk nipples. but bottom part of the basket is useless too. i hated munchkin less...	
1. 	I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle.	
1. 	At 23 weeks pregnant, I out of nowhere noticed significant mid-back pain while sleeping on my side and decided it was time to look into a pregnancy pillow. I analyzed all of the reviews of multiple different pregnancy pillows, and decided on this one based on the fact that it seemed to provide more support than others. Here's a breakdown of how this pillow works for me:PROS:- This pillow provides INCREDIBLE support for pregnant women. I noticed immediately that my back pain was alleviated. Additionally, I didn't realize that I needed stomach support so early on at 24 weeks, but this provides just the right amount of cushion and helped me feel better instantly.- My arms, legs and hips no longer hurt from sleeping on my side. My arms don't fall asleep, and my legs feel fully supported.- I went from horrible choppy sleep to the soundest sleep ever instantly. I seriously lay down on my side in this pillow and wake up 7-8 hours later completely rested. The reason is because the pillow fully surrounds you and you feel enveloped in cushy warmth - it's hard NOT to get a good night's rest with this pillow.CONS (sort of):- The pillow is massive. My husband and I joke that it's like wrestling a fluffy alligator, but it's actually not a problem at all in our king size bed. If you share the bed with your partner in anything smaller than a king, I think this pillow would be too bulky.- It's a little hard to turn from one side to the other because of how the pillow is shaped and how you wrap yourself in it. But once you do get to the other side, you're out like a light bulb again instantly.Others mentioned feeling like the inside seam is too tight, but I haven't had that problem. When you touch it, you can definitely tell that it's sewn tightly, but it doesn't provide any discomfort for me at night. I'm 5'10, but I think the fact that my torso is on the shorter side works in my favor here. I had my husband try lying down in it (he's 6'1), and he noticed the seam a bit, but didn't think it was bothersome.I tried another pregnancy pillow while traveling recently (Boppy Custom Fit Body Pillow), and hated it. I immediately missed my Snoogle Loop and had only wished there were a way to take it with me while traveling. The Boppy was all the local store had, and it was several nights of miserable, unsupported sleep.The Snoogle Loop is large and a bit more expensive than others, but I cannot recommend this pillow highly enough for anybody who is pregnant or needs support for sleeping on their sides. I am nearing the 3rd trimester and still sleeping like a baby, and I owe it all to this pillow.	
- 1	Mine did not pass authenticity tests and did not work. We purchased a Hazelaid after this and it works perfectly.	
- 1	Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.	
- 1	pretty expensive for a 3 day use only, it didn't help, yes it feels a bit cold when applied, like, for 3/4 of a second, then I don't know, it didn't make any difference for me, didn't help at all, I'm not sure at the point here...	
- 1	What a waste! I bought this thinking my 4 oz bottles would fit in it and they dont. This basket is basically only good for nipples. If I'm going to wash my bottles by hand why would I put the nipples in the dishwasher??  Just seems silly to me and Im sorry I wasted my money!	
1. 	For such a small price, these outlet plugs are totally worth the pennies. A peace of mind is priceless. Luckily you won't break the bank with these.	
- 1	The quality of the crib was great!!!! BUT it did not come with instructions and alot of the screws were missing .... TERRIBLE	
1. 	I decided to purchase this swing after reading all the wonderful mommy reviews. My son adored this swing from day 1. He took so many naps in it. The moving bugs/birds over head were one of his favorite features although he enjoyed looking in the mirror also. The music/sound options are great although the music does sound funny when the batteries are starting to run low. The only downside I found was that once my son was 15 lbs, the swing had a hard time moving him in the front to back motion. It would pretty much kill a new set of batteries. But the side to side feature was still good. I 100% recommend this item.	
1. 	These are nice bibs. I love bumkins bibs for their quality and durability. I bought the jr. size bibs for my little one thinking it was a gimmick to have to buy bibs in different sizes. I think these particular bibs would've suited my guy in the beginning and that they are great up to a point. They are quite small when compared with the jr. bib but they do fit around the neck to ensure less crumbs and mess hit the t-shirt. The jr bib failed to do this b/c my guy was too small so I used to put a second infant bib underneath which avoided that issue. These bibs can fit 6 mos-2 yrs but I think they are becoming a little too small for my 16 month old in that he makes bigger messes with all the food he tries (my guy is not that big either, 24 lbs). Less bib means less coverage but they do a great job otherwise.They are soooooo easy to clean. I bought several to have in rotation. I just rinse them after the meal and I set them aside to air dry, then reuse. They really are odor resistant (to a point) and the pockets work ok at preventing crumby messes.all in all, a great product! (no PVC and very eco-friendly which is a huge + to me!)	
1. 	Love it.  Fits comfortably around my baby's neck, no itchy areas.  Keeps him relatively clean.  Washes easily in the sink after each meal.	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these...one for my 3 yo and one for my 20 mo old.  They both love to have their own bowl of snacks but are always spilling.  These are WONDERFUL because they can carry the snacks around and I don't have to worry about them spilling.  Also great for eating out...keeps them happy and occupied while we eat dinner.  My 20 mo old figured it out in just minutes.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there was a storage lid you could put on either over or in place of the other lid...that way you could store the snacks in the cup (in your diaper bag or at home) w/o them getting stale.	
1. 	I like this set. I got everything I needed in one set different colors too. It is a great product very much recommended.	
- 1	Ok, I have so many reasons why I dispise this diaper disposal.  When I first bought this diaper disposal, I was happy that it took regular kitchen sized garbage bags...They should point out that you need to use the kind with the drawstring, otherwise they slide right back into the unit! Second, the way that you push the diapers into the bag is by simply closing the lid...well the lid is so loud, it sounds like a guillotine.  If I have to do a latenight diaper change, I let the diaper sit until morning because the sound wakes my son up everytime! Next, I loaded it with 4 D batteries..the green light blinked a few times, but that was it.  I never heard a fan sound or anything like that.  Also, now that my son is eating solids, his diapees are pretty ripe (TMI, sorry), but his room smells like a dump if a few diapers pile up, and I'm talking about a day's worth!  Wasn't the whole reason why I bought this was to keep the stink out of the room??  Don't waste your money.  I'm thinking of donating to Goodwill, and getting a Diaper Champ!	
- 1	More my fault than anything, but the molding on the edge of our crib didn't work with this clamp.  I had a hard time finding one that did!	
- 1	I thought my baby would be mesmerized and fascinated by the lighted musical waterfall.. but I think she's rather intimidated by it and all the stimulation. The waterfall is not as cool as I expected and the music or sounds weren't all that impressive. The hanging toys which are made of hard plastic, indeed hang too low so every time she moves her legs her knees activate it, which seems to agitate her. The seat is pretty and uses good fabric but overall this item is not really worth paying its price.I wish I had just bought a used or cheaper bouncer.	
- 1	I'm a new mom and bought several different kinds of lap/bassinet/crib pads to compare. This particular pad does not stand up to repeated washings and low heat drying. the fabric gets scratchy and pills. It is also not as absorbent as the carters keep me dry pads. I keep two pads on my changing areas and after 3 launderings- this pad leaked onto the second pad. The carters keep me dry pads have held up to repeated washing and drying and absorb all the wetness on the topside and the backside of the pad stays miraculously dry.*my pottery barn changing pad cover thanks them for that!	
1. 	These bibs are nice! We have the On The Go & Guppies prints. They are eco-friendly, a decent size for my 20 month old and dry so quickly! We can use it for breakfast, completely soak it clean, and it is always dry by lunch or snack time. I like that they can be machine washed. The pocket does not snap apart and that would be nice at times to get crumbs out of the tiny crevices, but I guess that is what the machine washing is supposed to accomplish.The only flaw I have found thus far is that for some reason I thought that they were made in the USA, but they're not.	
1. 	I bought these for my 6 month old son who loves chewing on the tags of his bibs. I also liked that these were soft and he could wave them around erratically or throw them without hurting himself or anyone around him.The blocks arrived a day after I ordered them and I couldn't be happier and immediately washed as directed. One block made crinkly noises while another had a rattle in it. The animals are cute and vary in texture. As new, they stacked and the corners were perfect. After the wash, they didn't stack as well and one corner of every block was folded inward. This minor problem didn't keep my son from enjoying the blocks or keep them from rolling around when tossed but its a minor aesthetic nuisance. We could pull the corners back out from time to time, but they would just fold right back in. I have had no other issues with this toy and would recommend it to anybody whose kid loves tags.***UPDATE: 7/28/11***After multiple washings, the blocks are now just lumpy pancakes. They definitely do not stack anymore but the animals, tags, crinkly noise maker, rattles are all still intact and vibrant. My son still likes them but only to chew on.	
1. 	Probably my favorite baby item ever! These bibs are a soft plastic, so it's comfortable for my child to wear but it holds its shape. It doesn't bend or anything so once it's on, it's staying in place. The lip is the perfect width to catch food. There isn't a gap between the table and the bib for food to fall down. Other bibs similar to this I have tried, the lip is more flat or doesn't hold its shape and therefore doesn't catch any fallen food. The collar is very adjustable, so I can fit it perfectly around my child's neck, and there isn't that gap between the bib and the shirt for food to get on the collar of the shirt.  I always have hated how when i put a bib on theres just a tad bit of shirt collar showing and it always got stained. well not with the baby bjorn! It wipes clean or can be put in the dishwasher. And it doesn't stain... You know how some foods like pasta sauce or carrots always seem to stain plastic containers and such? Well I have left spaghetti sauce on this bib overnight and it still did not stain it. The bibs look as clean as the day I took them out of the package. If you have a kid eating solids, you have to buy this bib. It's the only one that actually succeeds at keeping food off if your kid.	
1. 	This is so soft & comfy, plus its warm & we keep it pretty cool in the summer. He sleeps so well with it so were goin to get another one. Fyi our son is only 9 weeks but 12.8 lbs and is 24 long so we used this larger size.	
1. 	I hate to use that as my title cause you hear it all the time BUT I swear I have tried just about all of them and this one is by far my favorite... Honestly everything is going to give you a little back pain after awhile... heck my purse alone does... But this Bjorn distributes the weight and pressure of the baby that you honestly will be thrilled with the carrier. I have tried all of the little cheap ones and I figured I was saving money but not I have a carrier collection and only use my bjorn. So Honestly Save money by purchasing just one.My son loved me holding him when he was little and when he got  interested in looking around I just flipped him around and he had the comforts of mom but yet could see everyone else.. And I had the use of my two arms... :-)	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs. I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!	
1. 	This is a must! I love that it has ZERO FLOURIDE! and the little blue finger brush is super handy :)	
1. 	I purchased one for my twins.... I plan to purchase another. The size is great, it can hold a lot of toys. The pockets on the side actually can hold books well. The bag with handles inside is prefect. I actually have it out with all my kids blocks and it adds more space in the toy bin. I don't close the top, I have it bent back and so far if I try to close it it works fine (hasn't reshaped to being bent back). The little toy mat that folds down in the front is a nice feature. My twins don't actually us it to play but I have hardwood floors so it adds a little extra padding. The best part for me is safety. My twins know how to get in and out of this but never get hurt because it's not wood or hard plastic. They also run around a lot and I don't have to worry about them bumping into this and getting hurt. And last it is extremely easy to set up and down. Takes seconds. In my opinion if you were going on vacation it's prefect to bring since it folds flat.	
- 1	Milk spouts back up through the straw ALL THE TIME and has left milk stains all over the place. I thought maybe I had a faulty one, but I bought two, and both cups leak through the straw. It is highly inconvenient! My daughter likes it and it's easy to clean, but I've also got this one:[...]which is much better if you're looking for a sippy cup with straw.	
1. 	Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize. It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it. We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast). Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him. It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model. Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.A good wrap often quiets our baby down. He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles. It's like magic. Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying. Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells. Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights. That's worth the price in itself! Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better. Maybe he likes the extra warmth. Maybe it's the softness. Mabe it's the larger size. My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him. Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him. I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.Gary Peterson	
1. 	I was very confused to narrow down on a bath tub for my new born daughter initially, after reading the reviews for this bath tub, me and my wife decided to give it a try for my new born daughter. My baby absolutely loves to be bathed in this, she is so comfortable in this and the sling is perfect for the baby. It fits well in our bath tub, It is really a good bath tub and good value for money.	
- 1	This Munchkin Product is horrendous, once put together the product was very wobbly/unsteady and when you roll the wheels keep falling up. I got the regular non deluxe cart same crap problems. Don't waste your money. Get a hand held Diaper Caddy.	
- 1	I love the cute sayings on these, and that's about as far as it goes. They are so thin they couldn't possibly absorb much after bath time. Very VERY thin.. I got the same style of towels through SpaSilk and they are at least 100% thicker & softer. I suppose you get what you pay for..	
1. 	I have an espresso wooden rectangular coffee table.  I bought two sets of these and they are working perfectly!  They come with 3M adhesive tape and attach securely.  For some reason, even when I measure and lay out the tape carefully the strips always were cut a little too short so I had to cut a few filler pieces for the spaces between some of the corners and the edging.  I applied the edge guard on both the top of the table and the lower table that sits close to the ground.My little one was making us so nervous from hitting her head on this thing before so now we don't have to sit there with our hands over the corners when she plays around it!  I know she will fall and bump her head from time to time but I think this could help prevent a serious accident.  When I googled some babyproofing options for coffee tables I read a lot of stories about some really gory coffee table accidents so I do think this is worth it even if they aren't the most attractive thing in the world!	
1. 	One thing to point out in particular, you get two sets. There is no need to purchase two if you double pump. I made that mistake. I have used these many times and I have not any leaking problems. Although, I did listen to other reviews and I do use the blue sealing disk when using the avent bottles that require them. The plastic is heavy duty and prevent from having to purchase the bottles that go with your machine specifically which can be expensive. They have saved me a lot if time too. Previously, I would pump into medela bottles, then pour into avent to feed. Now I have one less bottle to wash every time I pump. Huge Timesaver. I would definitely buy again.	
- 1	I purchased this item a little over 7 months ago. I have purchased many other Bright Starts products and they have been great so I decided this would likely be great too. I'm sad to say I was extremely disapointed with it and a total waste of money. It was falling apart before I could even get it out of the box! The rattle ball fell off and I had to sew it back on, the elastic band of the pull cord was shot, and the battery was dead. I'd have spent almost as much shipping it back as what I spent on it so I kept it. I then tried to attach it to the carrier and had to immeadiately remove it because no matter how I tried to place it hung directly in the baby's face. I give this 2 stars because even though it didnt work out, it was super cute and a good idea.Found that in my case it was much better to buy individual hanging toys.	
- 1	Ive never seen the label on the bottom change.  And Ive tried it in extremely hot water...  waste of money	
1. 	I got this for my kids for Christmas. They are ages 6,4,2,and 6 months. They love it! I have even tried it in my room and the stars are just the right dimness. As an adult night lights are too bright for me, but these had the perfect amount of dimness. I also like how it turns off after a while. This was a very good buy.	
- 1	I got this and no matter what temperature the water is, the word HOT shows up and doesn't go away.	
1. 	My mother-in-law bought these for my 14 month old, and I can't imagine not having them now. Our son snacks on cheerios, yogurt drops, goldfish, just whatever we have 2-3 times a day inbetween meals or on the go on a busy day. When he is being grumpy, this can be a great distraction until nap time actually rolls around, and we are having fun trying to teach him to say the word snack when he wants this. The soft plastic lid of this comes off, and is all completely top-rack dish washer safe. I say these aren't perfect because my son's favorite snack is cheerios, and honestly, my carpet looks like it rained cheerios every day, but that is just because of how my son holds the cup. He will hold it by the top with his thumb pressing down one of the soft flaps, and then waves the cup around flinging his snack everywhere. So like I said, these aren't perfect and completely spill proof to little messy eaters, but the independence this gives my son to snack when he wants to is just fabulous. I highly recommend these!	
1. 	I'm not judging anyone else, but I was very surprised when I read how many people wrote about these coming off or being pulled off. I guess my daughter never tried very hard, but they are really stuck tight. I've had one set for about 14 months, and bought a 2nd set for another table about 8 months ago, and they're not going anywhere.  I can't speak to them hurting the finish of the wood, since I've never tried to take them off.  They don't look too bad either, since the dark color matches most of my furniture. I do wish they came in more colors for some of my lighter wood.	
- 1	I have never used any other toilet lid locks, but this is so hard to install I have never been able to use it. I have just resorted to keeping the bathroom door closed all the time.	
1. 	I found it very useful. It fits nicely with all the BabyBjorn carriers. The material is very good and durable. It doesn't look cheap. It's also light weight. My baby stays pretty warm and comfortable in it. I'm not sure if it can cover her the same way in her infant car seat though. Anyway, I still recommend it to others.	
1. 	this is our 3rd (and surely, the last and the BEST) baby bath tub!  the first 2 tubs (Safety 1st and Summer) were nice but became too small for our baby when he was just 2.5 months old.  wish we knew about this tub before, we wouldn't have wasted money over the first 2 tubs.excellent points on Eurobath --1. huge space -- width, length and depth -- giving the baby enough space to splash and play (safely, without fear of him slipping into the water).  depth of tub allows for baby to be partially submerged in water keeping him warm throughout his bath.2.  holds baby safely in place allowing me to wash him using my 2 hands.  works great for first-time moms who fear and dread bathing a baby!3.  great anchors for the baby's arms.  these help mom clean baby's armpits, nape and back without any hassle, while keeping the baby in place, secure and comfortable.4.  drains fast.net, this is the best-ever tub we've laid hands on.  highly recommended for babies from birth to toddler.	
1. 	THEY ARE I WAS I SPECTED, GOOD QUALITY, GOOD PRESENTATION, PERFEECT PRICE, GOOD FOR CHILD AND GOOD FOR BABIES FROM 9 MONTHS	
- 1	I bought this bouncer for my 4 month old daughter because I wanted another seating option for her besides her swing or Boppy lounger. I thought this bouncer had a good concept with the interactive toy design. However, once I put together the bouncer and let my daughter sit in it, I saw that she couldn't even really reach the monkey and butterfly toys at the top.  She also couldn't get the push and pull feature of the toy bars.  I don't know if she's still too young and only knows how to bat at the toys but it just seemed like to me that she got bored very quickly sitting there staring at toys that she couldn't play with.  Perhaps an older baby may like this better but according to the bouncer description, you shouldn't use this on a baby that can sit up on their own and that's the only way I can see any baby being able to reach up for the high toys.  Also, the music and monkey sounds that comes on when you move one of the handles gets really annoying after awhile.  It would be good if there was an off button for the music rather than having to just remove the battery.  Lastly, I thought the toy bars could be moved to the sides so you can easily take your baby in and out of the chair but it doesn't.  That means you have to lift your child from the top and slide their legs out from below the toys.  Not a big deal but another annoying part of the toy design.  I ended up returning this bouncer as it wasn't worth the money for the badly executed design of the toys.	
- 1	This pillow is HUGE. I am married and in our queen there was hardly room for my husband. It kept sliding off the bed which made it impossible to lay in it properly. It irritated my tremendously so I returned it. Too expensive not to be awesome. I was 5 months pregnant when I bought it thinking it would help me from sleeping on my back (because you are not supposed to) and it made my sleep more uncomfortable then sticking one of my regular pillows in between my legs, which I'm back to doing now. Try a boppy if you're pregnant instead?	
1. 	I love this bottle brush.  I use it to clean Dr. Brown bottles (and nipples), Avent sippy cups, my cheese grater, deep drinking cups, and my plastic and metal colanders/strainers.  No complaints.	
1. 	It's well designed to fit a number of bottles and all the accessories.  My only problem is that the bottles take a while to dry.  I sometimes have to let them air dry off the rack.	
1. 	The waterproof layer is the best feature.  Our baby drools all the time but it never gets through to his shirt.  Regular bibs just won't cut it anymore.  The neck size is good for a child probably up to 16 lbs.  After that, it gets quite tight.	
1. 	This product is worthwhile, because you are going to be changing diapers constantly, and you need to throw them away in some sort of sanitary and convenient manner. When baby starts eating solids, there is quite a different aroma coming from his diapers! This device is basically a garbage can, but it helps keep the nursery from getting stinky. The only thing is, because it holds so many diapers, it can make the nursery smell very baby powder-y. So keep the room well ventilated. The Diaper Genie is easy to use, and the refills last a long time. If you happen to live in a building, with a garbage shoot on your floor, then you don't need this. Just put a day's worth of diapers in a plastic bag, and down the shoot.	
1. 	I wish I had gotten these sooner! I have 2 children both under age 3 and these have been wonderful! I ended up spending lots of time and money trying to clean my fabric seats. Between bottles and sippys leaking or being dropped and snacks being lost I had my work cut out for me. Since installing these under the carseats clean up has been quick and easy. They also protect my seats from the indents caused by carseats. The pockets on the front have come in handy for storing smaller items that we carry in the car, like kleenex packs and headphones.These are well worth the money spent.	
- 1	I wanted to love these. I wanted my baby to love these. They are lovely to look at, they feel lovely (I love the material they're made of, they feel like extra soft rubber), I love that they're natural.But my son hated them. More than any other pacifier and he really wasn't too picky about pacifiers. They have a tiny little nipple and I guess he just didn't like that. He would suck on them occasionally because he was a pretty easy going baby when it came to pacifiers but once he hit two months old he stopped willingly taking them. He just loved his soothie pacifiers.He currently loves to play with them as a toy. He'll hold them and gnaw on the sides or even the back looped part! He still doesn't like sucking on the nipple part though! haha	
1. 	This bouncer is the best! W orginally purchased the Papsan seat and our newborn loved that but once she started focusing things with her eyes she was bored and would fuss. We then got this one and she will sit in it for hours and will watch the fish and starfish bubble around. It is very soothing for the baby and mommy also!I would recommend this one before any other!	
1. 	love it, the color is nice and the fabric is really soft, easy to wash. Blue color is very nice.	
1. 	The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is a very obliging unit. It services all types of containers, and of differing sizes too. It can warm disposable, oversized, and odd shaped bottles, glass babyfood jars, and tin cans to name a few. It's small in size, measuring 5 x 5 x 5  high. Thus, it occupies very little room on the counter, or bedside table. A plastic basket fits on the inside of the warmer, and is removable for larger items. On the front of the unit is a dial control. It has 3 settings, 1,2, and 3, 1 being the coolest. Next to the dial is a power light, which serves 2 purposes.1.) It indicates the unit is ON and working, and2.) When the water reaches the correct temperature, the power light blinks ON and OFF to indicate the water is ready.There is NO ON/OFF switch on this bottle warmer. For that reason, one must unplug it after each use. With a rather lengthy cord, 3 feet long, it is very adaptable. For those concerned about d&eacute;cor, the all white exterior is designed to blend in. In addition, the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer is portable. By that, I mean it's lightweight; it weighs 1 pound, and is compact enough to fit in an overnight bag. We traveled frequently when William was an infant, and this unit made a nifty travel companion.Pros* Accommodates all brands of bottles* Heats fast and evenly* Compact and lightweight* It's durable* Heats bottle liners without melting the plastic* The basket can be removed to warm oversized bottles, i.e. Avent Magic cup* Grounded 3-prong conductorCons* Overheats* No ON/OFF switch* An internal thermostat and an external timer would greatly improve this productMy Experience:Right off the bat, I was heating 10 bottles of breastmilk a day, as I was unable to breastfeed. Thus, I was thrilled to have a bottle warmer. Pop a bottle in the unit; plug it in, and in 5 minutes it's done. How difficult is that? The EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer heats fast, evenly, and it's durable. Moreover, now there's no more white, icky, stuff to clean off my pans.In all the time I used this bottle warmer, I never encountered any problems. Let me tell you, this unit got a workout in my house. I think my success was actually due to reading the instruction manual. I know ~ geek alert. Okay, that's true, but it's also fair to say that I quickly learned to keep a timer when warming. I overheated many bottles in the months I served warm milk, because I'd get distracted. Consequently, running a timer became apart of the routine. If Avent were to add an external timer, this would be extremely helpful to users. I almost never used the coolest setting, only when thawing frozen breastmilk, and I only used the 2nd setting when warming disposable bottles. Both were rare occasions. I generally thawed breastmilk in the refrigerator, and I used disposable bottles when I was on the go ~ outside the house.Here's another tip, adding an internal thermostat with an automatic shut off feature would seriously improve this product. Many have complained about the lack of an ON/OFF switch. I kept the EXPRESS Bottle & Babyfood Warmer on the kitchen counter so the lack of an ON/OFF switch was never an issue. Had I kept it at my bedside this would have been a huge inconvenience; although, a power strip would solve that problem. Whether one turns off a switch or unplugs the unit either way this final step must be completed. I can NOT tell you how many times I forgot to unplug this bottle warmer. An hour might go by before I realized my mistake. Now that's a fire hazard!Closing Remarks:When it comes to bottles, Avent is still my 1st choice. I have learned through research that several manufactures have modified their bottle warmers to accommodate the Avent brand. I guess that goes to show... input from customers can, and does influence manufactures. Avent could make a few improvements to this bottle warmer, which would certainly increase the price. However, I for one would be willing to pay for those added features. Would you? While writing this review, I've debated how to rate this product. I was extremely pleased with this warmer, but I also recognize its shortcomings. I've opted to give this product an above average mark, because1.) It did what it was supposed to do. It warms bottles fast, and evenly.2.) It accommodates plastic, glass, tin, and a myraid of bottles styles.3.) Warms disposable bottles, and bottle liners, and4.) It saved me from the stovetop hassles.Happy Feeding,Mary	
1. 	I use this little zipper bag as a sort of gadget purse for baby health things.  Even with everything in it I can find room for a Desitin tube, a bottle of Mylicon drops, a bottle of Baby Tylenol, Q-tips, and a little sample bottle of Eucerin cream for baby's exema.  On the side is a net pocket where I keep my pediatrician's appointment cards and medicine instructions.  Also, on the inside are a couple of pockets where phone numbers are kept on a provided card; I keep a pocket-sized record of baby's immunizations (that my nurse gave me) in there as well.  Very handy.	
1. 	This has been the best bath investment we made for our son! He began using this on the countertop in the bathroom at about 7 months. He's 14 months now and it's in the bathtub. The quaker on the duck's bill still wokrs and it has a handy suction cup so we stick it to the back of the tub wall when done. It drains nicely. We've taken several vacations and it deflates with ease. I don't know why the previous poster said it took them a half hour to blow up!? I've inflated this within a couple of minutes with no problem. Their issue may have been that they didn't read the directions regarding the valve. Many inflatable items have a closed valve so when you try and blow up the item, you have to pinch the stem at the same time. This allows a little flap in the valve to open and let air in. The purpose is to keep leaking of air from the valve stem over time to a minimum. My 72 year old mother in law blew this up at the beach with no problems once I showed her the valve trick! We highly recommend this tub as it is durable and fun! We just squeak the duck's bill and our son comes running for his bath!	
1. 	THESE ARE GREAT TO HAVE AS WE DON'T WANT HER TO GET HER FINGERS INTO ANYTHING REAL EASY TO INSERT	
- 1	I bought this based on the - mostly good reviews- however, I am giving a warning.. read the bad reviews and take them to heart.. everything stated... Stiff material that hurts then, sticks in their throat, velrco easily undone.. its all true! beware! this will be like throwing your 12.00 OUT OF THE WINDOW.	
1. 	The three level settings made this tub last for a whole first year for our baby. I have a small tub and it fits well in that. The sling was little difficult to attach but once we attached it, it never slipped. My new born was very comfortable in the sling. we graduated to the actual tub when she was 2 months old. over all its a good product.	
1. 	Not sure why this is listed as a toy; i rated this as functional dinnerware/cups not a toy.I purchased the original First Years cup set with the sippy cup style and moved on to the straw set when my toddler was ready. They are just as sturdy with a non-flexible straw. The colors are very vibrant with matching tops and straws.The only suggestion I have is insert the straw AFTER you have placed liquid inside and capped it. Otherwise the liquid will squirt right out.The cups wash up really well in the dishwasher. The straws fall through my utensil container so i do have to hand wash those, but that is the only hassel.Overall the cups are great for toddlers. My daughter can drop it and as long as it does not land on the top side it rarely leaks.	
1. 	Why I like it very much...Easy to cleanAffordableAdaptable to home, visiting, grandparents' or caretakers' homesOne cover and two trays...great for playing on a tray or eating with a little side cup to hold those precious little morsels that babies and toddlers cutely grasp in their chubby little handsLong straps that attach to a multiple variety of chairsStabilityAdaptability to the older child when trays are put aside and eating at the main table is the order of the dayWell constructed with an appropriate weight and heightA winner!	
1. 	We purchased to have this as a &#34;to go&#34; spoon, and it ended up being a favorite spoon.  Best for ages 6mo-10mo, after that they bite too much and want more substantial spoon.	
1. 	I got two sets of these doublers, one set works GREAT they are super absorbent and did exactly what I needed them to do. The second set after washing lost their shape. They were difficult to lay flat; they still worked but just not as well as the others. For the price they can't be beat - I must have just gotten a bad batch.	
1. 	Our changing table has curved ends, and it still fits nicely on the end! The top is the perfect size for a variety of diaper cases, and diapers fit nicely underneath. The little baskets on the side slide on and off, so you can choose whether or not to use them. It's made from a nice strong plastic, though it would break if dropped like most clear hard plastics, do. I highly recommend it if you need extra storage or shelf space!	
- 1	This is a waste of money. It makes an awful buzzing sound like the motor is broken and it is very slow and soft. I would not buy this ever again and would have returned it if my husband had not tossed the package on me!	
- 1	The Levana Ona+ clip-on seemed to be something I could use with my grandson (who has been ill and had heart surgery.)  Unfortunately, my unit arrived non-functional.  It may be something as simple as replacing the expensive battery or it may be worse.  At the price, I would expect that the product would work on arrival and that I would not be forced to immediately purchase an expensive battery.  I will check with the product customer service and will update this review based on the outcome of that conversation.I gave it two stars rather than one because the product seems sturdy and well-made.  It simply does not work at all.	
1. 	We use this for our 22 month old and it is perfect. We were able to ditch the big heavy high chair and we just use this now. This is super easy to clean and it's very portable too. I like that it can be used as both a booster for the table or with the tray. The fact that it has adjustable height settings is also very nice.	
1. 	My five-month-old loves this ExerSaucer. He will play in it for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. I love the fact that it will grow with him and that he can bounce in it. The toys are great, with many that he can pull into his mouth. The toys can be changed out with Switch-a-Roos (available at baby-Wise). Plus with only one electronic toy (which is pretty quiet), it's not annoying the adults in the room. Evenflo got it right with this one!	
- 1	bought it for my coming baby because I want nothing but the best for her. end up I made a huge mistake by buying this pillow.This thing is not the one I saw in retail shop even the inside foam.After i unzip the cover, I found out inside only a few pieces of cheap foam which glued together.the odor is worst thing. even I expose them under direct sun for many days, the smell still stick.I dont think I will use it with my fagile new born.	
- 1	I do not like this brush- harsh materials, so hard, it spray water everywhere when you use it. And good luck if you can clean any of your bottle or the bottle neck areas. And the handle design make it slips out of your hands easily. I had much cheaper bottle brushes which works much better (dis-continued). Big waste of money given the frustration and completely useless of this brush.	
- 1	This tub was even terrible when my daughter was a newborn. She was either not in the water at all or was sliding down the sling into the water. At 3 months old I still have to use the sling because she slides over the hump on the inside that is supposed to keep her up. And yep! She still slides down the sling and is only half in the water so gets cold very quickly. I hate bathing her and she is liking it less also.	
- 1	For solid foods this container is okay.  I would avoid this item if you want something leak proof.  The lids are difficult to snap down, and even with a lot of effort to make sure that the lids were sealed all the way around, liquid still escaped from both sides.  I would only use this for foods like mac/cheese, cheerios, and items of similar consistency... Cleans really easily in the dishwasher, though.	
- 1	These cups leak a lot. They are terrible. I finally threw our 2 in the trash. Babies are already messy without adding a ridiculously leaking cup to the equation.	
1. 	I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!	
- 1	I love love love the huge basket on my stroller... and hate hate hate all the leaves and dirt that fall into it when I stroll!  I walk the dog daily so this stroller sees the outdoors A LOT.  And I hate how leaves and debris fly and drop into the basket.  I'm OCD and would prefer the basket to be clean!  Since this was the only option available... and I am thankful that Baby Jogger even created it... I bought it but it definitely needs improvement!1. the clasps... they come off easily!  One in particular... is like too tight or something because it will snap off as soon as I clip it on.  SOOOO ANNOYING.  I have been meaning to contact Baby Jogger for a replacement... but with a baby... who has the time?  I am finally sitting down to write a bunch of Amazon reviews now!  The two on the very front tend to come off when I fold the stroller up.  So, if I want to go somewhere and put the stroller in my car, I have to take the entire cover off first (because it will come off anyways).  Another major annoyance.2. there are 6 clasps.  2 in the very front, 2 on the sides and 2 in the back.  The 2 on the sides are attached very low on the bar.  This creates a sagging mid-section.  I really wished they had 4 clasps on the sides and put the other 2 higher up (close to where you would attach the seat).  Because of the sag that the material creates, leaves and debris will just sit in the middle of the canopy.  How ugly, dirty and gross!3. I think instead of clasps, it would be great if they could create some sort of zipper attachment to attach it to the frame.  This way, it would be completely enclosing the basket and would allow you to access the basket a whole lot easier.  Perhaps 2-3 zippers?  One in the back, side and front to allow you to access the basket from all sides.  Accessing anything inside the basket via undoing a clasp is VERY ANNOYING because you have to fumble and feel for the clasp and fumble with snapping it back on (and back on again and again) because they pop off so easily.4. I do like how CHEAP it is since Baby Jogger sells their other accessories at ridiculously HIGH prices! =)Because it is so annoying to access stuff inside the basket with the cover on, I mainly use this to keep the basket clean when I'm strolling outdoors with the dog.  If I plan on going somewhere with the baby, I leave the cover off since I need to put the diaper bag, etc. in there.I hope Baby Jogger reads these reviews and will listen to customer feedback and update their design!	
1. 	My daughters had cups like these when they were young and they were great for playing in the bath tub, wading pool and sandbox.  My 20 month granddaughter loves her set just as much and has gotten a lot of use out of them.	
1. 	I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.	
1. 	I believe that this product would prevent a child from tampering with a power strip, but the plastic is quite thin and I was worried as I used it that it would break. As I was installing it I tried to be very careful as it seemed as though the plastic was quite thin.	
1. 	Oh these are awesome!  These fit the (wide) Ventaire bottle as well as Drop-In bottles.  The Ventaire bottles come with silicone nipples, but our daughter really prefers these latex ones.  They're a bit softer than silicone.  We might have to look into the fast flow ones soon though.	
1. 	I registered for this product and received it at my shower. The nurses tried to show me how to swaddle tons of times, but my daughter always seemed to squirm right out of it. When we got home from the hospital I got it out and used it right away.  It worked like a charm, no hassles.  I  could only use it for about 3 weeks and the she learned to kick her way out of it.  She doesn't like to be swaddled anymore, plus she likes her hands free to suck on.  It was great while it lasted and I didn't have to worry about the blanket coming lose and possibly suffocating her.  I recommend this to all new mommy's that can't get the hand of swaddling.	
- 1	This thing was a pain in the butt to get on despite reading the instructions and watching YouTube videos.  When I did get it on correctly my daughter hated it.  Definitely not worth it.	
1. 	So far we've only used the smaller basket.  It works great for washing teethers and baby spoons.  So much easier than washing by hand!  Probably gets things cleaner too.	
- 1	So, maybe I am doing something wrong but these are terrible.  We have only had them about a week and I hate them. I was really excited about these because I like the idea of the organic cotton, but they have leaked every single time.  My son gets a slight rash with microfiber so I was hoping cotton would fix that.  I will say that has been the only good thing about these, no rash.  But they do not absorb at all. He is 20 months old and cannot even wear these for an hour without a leak.  In the mornings I change him at 8 right before we leave to take my daughter to school, by the time we get home at 9 he has already leaked through these diapers.  I much prefer my Flips and Thirsties AIOs.  I am going to try the organic cotton flip inserts instead of these.  And they take FOREVER to dry.  I find that it helps if you flip the top layer of cotton around the diaper, but even then they easily take an hour and a half in the dryer.  I tried to put them on the drying rack and 24 hours later they felt like they had just come out of the washer.  They also stain very easily, which isn't a huge deal to me since no one sees it but still not very pretty. Save your money.	
- 1	What a waste of $20. I don't know what all the hype is about. It's just a tiny squeaky giraffe, I could have gotten any tiny squeaky toy that my baby put in his mouth and called it a teether and sold it for $20.My baby is 4 months old and doesn't care much for it...	
1. 	I was pretty skeptical just looking at the item before my purchase.  Sure the model looks comfortable in her position but she's being paid!  I was not a side sleeper before pregnancy and wasn't getting good sleep since the beginning of the pregnancy.  Around week 18, I gave up and forked out $50 for this stupid looking pillow.  When I sleep on my side without the snoogle, the arm that is underneath gets trapped and the circulation cuts off and wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Since getting the snoogle, I never have this problem.  Granted I wake up in the middle of the night to switch positions (or pee) but since my arm doesn't fall asleep, I wake up less frequently.  I like sleeping with hugging the long side more so than the open side as initially pictured.  I read some people complaining about the cover, don't expect a high threadcount and you'll be fine.	
1. 	I love this pump! It does just as well as the dual electric pump, possibly even better, since you control the speed of the pumping. I used the medela pump in style with my second son, and while it worked great, it would sometimes make my breasts sore from pumping. I have had no issue with this pump yet. The speed of getting milk is the same as others, and it has the added benefit of being quiet. This is great for pumping while working. Although it is recommended for occasional use only, this could easily be used as the main pump. You will be very pleased with this product, and it works just as good as the electric ones, at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend this pump!!	
- 1	I exclusively pump, so my baby always gets expressed breast milk.  I switched to these bottles from the playtex drop-ins because my baby was spilling tons of milk from the sides of her mouth. These bottles work when they want to. You have to find just the right way to screw the ring/nipple to the bottle, but for the most part they leak. I have not been able to determine if it is the bottle itself or the nipple that makes it leak. If you close it too tight, then I have to interrupt feeding constantly so that I can vent the bottle, if I unscrew it to vent, it leaks all over the place. For milk storage, it is a great product, especially because it is compatible with the breat pump attachments as well as the medela cooler. However for feeding find something else please!	
1. 	Our boy loves his turtle. I makes a nice constellation on the ceiling and includes a half-moon, which is perfect for cloudy nights when he does not get the chance to see the real moon to say goodnight to. The 4 colors and timer are great - he prefers green. It is soft in case he takes to bed, but mostly he does not.	
1. 	Love these pads.  Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside.  They ar small, yet absorbant.  I have had them leak but only when they got really wet.  I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets.  Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.	
1. 	I just love this mirror. I purchased two of them. They are much larger than most mirrors and they attach to the headrest. No suction or tape to worry about. I am able to see my boys very easily.The only problem I have is that there is fog in actually both of my mirrors. I can still see my boys perfectly fine, but the quality could be improved a little. Also be careful when cleaning, they scratch very easily.As far reading other reviews regarding the safety hazard, WOW, I never actually thought about it.	
1. 	These little cars are so cute! The size is perfect (not tiny, like a matchbox car) they're big, but not too big. Easy for the little one to figure out - just pull the car backwards and they zip across the floor (my son loves when they crash into something and I say boom!). Or they could just roll them forward, at their own speed. Highly recommended - lots of fun! I like that they are soft and easy to clean too - just give them a good wipe. A good toy to take along on an outing or trip.	
- 1	We did a great deal of research before purchasing this item, and loved the small size and seemingly unique features.  The main issue with this swing is that it is too SLOW!  Babies like small, fast movements, and even on the highest setting, this swing is very slow. It seems like a baby would like the gentle and smooth movements, but our baby didn't love it. Also the different settings all seem too similar.  It does not vibrate either, which, for the price, I thought would've been a nice feature. We didn't have another swing to compare it to, so we just used it anyway, but ended up mainly rocking her in the glider and doing the 5 S's as Harvey Karp suggests (he's a genius, by the way).  I would just get a traditional swing next time....if this item would lower the price by about $100 it may be worth getting and trying, but definitely not at the current selling price.  I like how it plugs in and is small, that's about it.  Keep looking...	
- 1	We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new upgraded toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The music is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.	
- 1	It wasn't worth the money.  The sensor was not very strong, we basically had to hit the side of the crib to make it start.	
- 1	The way the nipples fit in the top of this is annoying, especially if you have different size/brand nipples. I have it, so I use it, but I wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	I wish these came with the breast pump bag.  There great for measuring how much breast milk is made, as well as storage.Easy to clean with a bottle brush.	
1. 	My husband bought this.  He loved the idea of putting the baby's picture next to her foot and hand print.  He thought that it would be really neat for her to look back at the picture of her at 6 weeks and see how small she was and how tiny her little feet and hands were.  It was so easy to to do.  The material is really easy to work with.  It is so easy to get baby's foot and hand in it.  It isn't goopy so you can bring the material to the baby instead of trying to do the balancing act of getting the baby positioned over the material and then trying to hold her still while you put her into the stuff.  This package you just grabbed the appendage you wanted to imprint, put the material to the foot/hand and pressed gently in.  The frame was easy to put together after the caste was all dry.  The set has the background pink on one side and blue on the other.  It really doesn't get any easier and it is really attractive once put together.  The only problem I did have was that my caste cracked when drying.  Not very much, but just enough to be noticeable.  (This was because my husband didn't lay it exactly flat to dry, this was not any fault of the product)  However, I just filled the crack with caulk.  It worked great.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a special keepsake for their child and anyone buying a gift for an expectant parent.	
1. 	Even after reading a good amount of the posted reviews, I still wasn't quite sure which size to buy for our one-yr old boy (above average height- 78%). Then, following a reviewers suggestion, I searched it on Youtube. I saw even big five year olds zoomin around on the small with no qualms. I cant imagine our little one being able to reach the ground on the large. Very glad I got the small.  He loves it and the cow print is awesome. Great quality product and a perfect first birthday present! See our posted picture above. Black onesie, blonde hair, cow.	
- 1	These are ok but quality didn't impress me and not that absorbent. I end up using cloth diapers as burp rags most of the time. And FYI. If you are a first time mom, you need like 20 burp rags or cloth diapers to use as such.	
- 1	I've owned this carrier for eight months and I'm getting rid of it.  Based upon the positive reviews, it works for the majority but not me.  I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a carrier but based upon much research, I was convinced that this was the one.  After seven children, I've tried many carriers but cannot say that I have a favorite, yet.  Most carriers have cons and this one had way too many for me to continue to use.  First of all, from birth, I could never get my baby's face to stay up.  She always managed to turn inward no matter how I adjusted everything.  That made me nervous because I was afraid that she couldn't breath.  I had to support her head while in the sling with one arm which was very inconvenient and uncomfortable.  As my baby grew, I used this carrier less and now that she's 8 months, I can't bare to have her in this sling longer than 20 minutes.  I'm always adjusting it because it rides up my neck and all her weight baring down over one shoulder HURTS!  I don't see how anyone could carry a toddler in this thing.  The instructions make it seem so easy to pull the sling down a little over the opposite shoulder to tighten it, but it's not that easy.  It's versatile and I did like that I could nurse her while staying covered and multitasking, BUT that alone wasn't worth the price if I really couldn't use it long.  I toggled back and forth between this carrier and the Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier.  The Infantino carrier isn't really useful during the newborn stage, but once your child grows, it's much more supportive,  comfortable and cheaper.  I can't recommend spending so much money on a carrier that isn't comfortable after a few months.	
1. 	I have used many highchair/booster seats and I have to say that this is one of the best. Good quality product for your money. I love that it can fold down and travel. I will be taking it to Pennsylvania with me from Alaska in a few months in one of our suitcases. I will let you know how it does. I have taken it on road trips and it is so nice. You cant go wrong with this seat.	
1. 	This crib sheet is really cute!  It fits snugly on the crib mattress and looks great too.  I highly recommend it.	
1. 	My husband and I LOVE this mixer - we first used the Munchkin one, but didn't like that you had to constantly hold down the button to make it work, with this one you just flip the switch and it stays on.  We use this to make a big batch of formula for the day (daycare mandates we have all bottles pre-made for the day) and it works well.  I like that it helps mix the formula and that there are no clumps left so there is no need to shake the bottles when you're done - so I know the nutrients are distributed evenly/correctly.  This is worth the money!**After 2 months of use, though, the first one we purchased broke - not sure how/why, but the mixer came out of unit when we were using it, so we have since purchased a replacement.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again.*******EDIT: Now the second one has broken as well - it starts making a very high pitched whining sound and then the mixer comes out of the base while you're using it (while it's turned on) and all we're doing it mixing powder formula and water in a mixing bowl - we are not touching the sides or the bottom of the bowl*****	
1. 	It's not that cute, but these function perfectly for little, sloppy eaters. They are so easy to clean and our daughter regularly eats what she spilled in the scoop. Leftovers! We love that we can put them in the dishwasher. A must for toddlers and a great baby gift for first time parents. We get some many cute useless things! These are extremely practical and one of our favorite baby items.	
1. 	I tried the regular version of these bottles, too.I babysit a friend's 5 mo old boy, he tends to spit up.  I thought these would be perfect to try with him.  He definitely spits up alot less with these bottles, there are far fewer bubbles in the bottle, too.  I gave his mom the pack of regular bottles and I keep these at my house to use with him when  he's here.  She loves the bottles, too, and says these are all she uses now.  It definitely makes for far less laundry when the baby doesn't spit up nearly as much!  Personally I prefer the wide bottles, they seem easier to hold but that could be because I'm dealing with my 2 kids at the same time as the baby.I used a much more expensive brand with my last baby who is 4 now.  Wish I had known these existed, they're far easier to clean and much easier on the wallet.  :-)	
- 1	I've had this for several months and have tried everything to keep it secure to the shower wall.  It won't suction and the adhesive won't hold it up either.  BIG WASTE OF MONEY.  Plus, the awkward shape makes it impossible to set it down anywhere...it just falls.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  It's much easier to just store bath toys in a little dish that can easily set down near the tub than this awkward whale design.	
1. 	My daughter is 9 months and this thing scares her. It's kind of cute. I know it will be a wonderful way to dispense snacks once she gets used to it. It is durable and washes easily.	
1. 	We have this over our children's bedroom door.  Their stuffed toys are visible, but they are out of the way and not taking up any floor space, cupboard space, or toy box space.  It's a wonderful, sturdy net that keeps our lovable furry friends right there!	
- 1	This would have barely covered my lap. How I use these now is just for under my baby's butt whenever she gets changed on her changing pad in case of accident. It helps delay us from having to wash the Kushies waterproof pad that we have over our changing pad cover, which are much better for the job. Our baby tends to have lots of accidents so it worked out I guess but I would have never bought these if I had realized how small they were.	
1. 	The best bibs	
1. 	My son was scared of falling into the toilet so this was super helpful when we really dove into potty training. He liked that it tightened down so it didn't slide around like a cheaper model we had picked up. The little lip in the front is very handy for boys learning to aim while seated if you know what I mean. ;) We're getting ready to use it for boy #2 and it still looks new.	
1. 	Very practical because we shop a lot - groceries, etc.  Baby (9 months+) likes to sit up and watch around her.  With this, she stays clean.  I keep it in the car.	
- 1	This high chair is awkward. The belting system is complicated--never a good thing with a hungry baby--and the tray is cumbersome to add and remove. I would not recommend this, but I suppose you get what you pay for with an item like this. We wanted a high chair that converted into a booster and/or chair top high chair, and this met all of those qualifications.	
- 1	These wipes are awful. They do not do a decent job of cleaning my newborn son. It takes many wipes to get him clean. The worst part of these wipes though is their smell. It smells like stinky feet, and after a few days of using my son started to smell like them. I'll spend the extra money and buy the Earth's Best wipes.	
- 1	I was shocked when I read all of the 5 star reviews. These are horrible bibs. They are listed as waterproof, and is very far from the truth. Never have these kept moisture off of his clothing. We would have to double bib him, and even then, both would be drenched in a half hour or so. We will stick with our generic Target brand ones that absorb and wash great.	
1. 	My infant loves lounging for his bath!  It is plush, it helps retain the warmth of the water around him, and is much easier to use and store than a giant baby tub!	
1. 	We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We've had cotton, fleece, and this velboa one. The velboa is definitely the softest and possibly the thickest. It's difficult to tell whether the fleece or the velboa is thicker/warmer. I wish the velboa sleepsacks were more widely available in the larger sizes. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. Seriously, he's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!	
- 1	The plastic screen portion of this product is so flimsy that it ripped a bit while I was attaching it to the window.  After just one accidental opening of the window with this in place it was destroyed.  I replaced this withEddie Bauer Deluxe Roller Shade 2pk. Although the Eddie Bauer version is significantly more expensive, it has lasted for almost six months (with MANY accidental openings and closings of the window) as compared to less than a week.	
- 1	Glad we only got one of these. I've had my fair share of sippy cup reviews with three little ones. I preferred not to use this wobbly, hard to put cap on without spilling milk (handles get in the way). Also its germ infested...you need to pop off the dome slider that covers the straw, otherwise mold grows in there (even when run through the dishwasher). There also is a film of milk left behind (unlike any other cups) and this takes forever to dry because of its shape. Also mold grows in between the weighted base and clear cup...doesn't effect its use, just gross.	
- 1	I received this as a gift and used it with my twins.  They figured out how to escape it within a month.  I passed it on to another twin mom and she had the same experience- her boys could escape shortly after she switched from aden & anais blankets to these. My SIL then had a baby and received one of these (from the same person who bought me mine).  My nephew also figured out how to escape the MB shortly after starting use so she had to switch to alternatives as well.  When my little houdinis figured this thing out, I switched to woombies (I had also received those as a gift) and my girls never were able to escape those.  We just had better luck with them I suppose.  I also like that they were so much easier to swaddle and unswaddle for those middle of the night feedings. When you have more than one baby, eliminating even slightly tedious tasks can really be helpful.  I think this is a great product if you don't have very squirmy babies who are not as likely to foil the swaddling.  Unfortunately, that is not the case with my children!	
- 1	Even though it almost fits my GRACO chair this is Padded as its looks in the picture, this cover has no padding at all, its plain fabric. I needed to change my son's high chair cover badly so I had do it. But look for better options.	
1. 	I went through at least three or four other front carriers, trying in vain to save myself from spending BIG BUCKS on the BABY BJORN carriers.  Alas, I finally gave up and spent my cash on the active carrier to get the back support.  SUCCESS!  This carrier is AWESOME!  My son LOVES this carrier, at least facing forward  (He wasn't keen on facing inward in any of the carriers).  And the back support is a life saver since my 5 month old is already 18 lbs.So...take my advice.  Please don't waste your time with the others-----you get what you pay for in this case.  Pay the extra $$$ and get the Baby Bjorn, even if just the original model.  It's worth it!	
1. 	We use one of these everyday for naptime. My big boy is 17 months and this fits him perfectly and probably will for a few more months.	
1. 	We purchased this booster seat based on a recommendation from our friend.  We are so glad we listened to her.  It's very well put together and was very well thought through.  I love how everything connects so easily for storage.  We keep it in the back of our trunk so that it's with us whenever we need it.  It works like a charm.  My son is comfortable in it.  It's very easy to clean up too.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	I love this so much I've started including it in every baby shower gift that I give. I was skeptical at first, but it makes diaper changes so easy! Keeping everything in one spot is a must. We have one upstairs near the changing table and another downstairs near the pack and play. Wonderful idea!	
1. 	Good price and good product. Fit well with the pack n play mattress.  Mattress cover is a must have when you have new baby.	
1. 	I was looking for some bibs that helped block pureed food from getting on my baby.  These bibs aren't totally waterproof, but they do block so much.  They're a good length and width (6 months old) plus they clean pretty easily.  We rinse them off after each meal and then put them in the wash with everything else.  They are now our go-to item.	
1. 	IT WAS SHIPPED VERY FAST AND FITS PERFECTLY IN THE KITCHEN SINK....MY GIRL LOVES IT..THE SLING HOLD THE BABY VERY SNUG WITH NO WORRIES OF HIM FALLING OUT...I THOUGHT THE PLUG WAS SUPPOSED TO CHANGE COLOR WHEN THE WATER WAS TOO HOT LIKE OTHER TUBS BUT IT DOESNT..ITS VERY LIGHT BUT NOT TOO FLIMSY...IT DOES THE JOB WELL WHICH IS ALL THAT MATTERS	
- 1	I was very excited about these monitors and the ability to talk to my 2 year old through them instead of going in his room every time he called for me.  They worked great and I was happy with these monitors until, after only 9 months, (like mentioned in several of the other reviews) they just stopped working.  They will not reset, they just beep and the screen flashes NOT LINKED. I bought them in Dec. of 2012 and they lasted till Sept of 2013 and of course warranty was up in March. Disappointed.UPDATE 10/3/13Called VTech and within 5 minutes had someone on the line. They are sending me a replacement within 3-5 days.  Impressed with the customer service, just hope this monitor lasts longer!	
1. 	I bought about 4 small size and 5 medium and my son wears them every night to bed.  I stuck with the cotton so he wouldn't get overheated.  LIFE SAVER!  When I first brought my son home, I couldn't bear to put him down in his bed to sleep because I was so worried about SIDS and that he would fling his blanket over his head.  From day one he didn't like to be swaddled and would punch out of his blanket (he was a big baby...9 lb 5 oz).  I remember literally staying awake all night in the beginning just holding him as he slept/nursed.  Finally started using these and I could sleep without peeking over the edge of the bed all night!!	
- 1	Everything about this stroller just irritated me. The instructions were wordless pictures that had arrows pointing in the wrong directions at times. When folded down into a conveniently thin design that could be easily put anywhere, the thing came up to past my knee cap. There were too many parts that didn't end up on the final product, which was just a little unsettling for me. I refused to put my daughter in something that claims to be finished, and yet has 30 bolts, screws, and pieces strewn across the floor all around it. To be honest, everything was just too much. I hated this product, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sorry.	
- 1	So the food gets all frosty. I use three rubber bands to keep it on better and it works well enough.	
1. 	I love the design of the bib,so cute.And its very convinient,also its very easy to clean. It save time for me.	
1. 	very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.	
- 1	We used these when my son was born, and ended up replacing them within 6 months. The fleece pilled up, and the cotton on the other side was rough. He was screaming through changes. They also fell apart rather quickly. They just didn't work for us.	
- 1	I bougth this lamp a few weeks ago and is colorless. My baby is not yet born so I am wondering what is going to happen in the next 5 months.... Expensive and bad product	
1. 	As we all know, you're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent SIDS. The SleepSack is a great product! It keeps baby nice and warm, yet you don't have to worry about a blanket. And there's space down in the bottom for his feet so he's not too restricted. Also, the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom, so you don't have a big zipper poking baby in the face.	
- 1	I know these are cheap, but they didn't help with the horrible diaper odor.  I would not recommend spending your money on these items.  When I opened up our diaper pal there was still a bad smell.	
1. 	Great for no spills and the handle is nice for little guys learning to use the sippy cup. Only issue we ran into was my son kept chewing on the mouth piece and would tear them up and milk would leak everywhere and we'd have to throw them out. Wish we could have bought replacement tops but instead switched to the Munchkin click it insulated sippy cups with a harder plastic top that he can't destroy with his teeth.	
1. 	I've been using this since my baby was a week old. It works very well on cutting his tiny nails. My only complain is it's too expensive!	
- 1	I bought this warmer because of the good reviews it had. I had also purchased Dr Brown's bottles and thought this warmer would better suit these bottles.I have to grant that product 3 positive points:- I like the fact that the screen lights up, it makes it easy to use at night.- It basically fits any bottle (so I didn't have to replace it when I got rid of the Dr Brown's bottles which I hated) - but I guess that's pretty much expected from all warmers... right?- You don't have to refill with water each and every time.But that's about it. Here is a list of bad points:- There was mold build-up in the reservoir within DAYS and there is NO WAY you can clean it. And I am sure no mom wants to see mold anywhere near her baby's food!- Not having to add water every time seemed like a good seller point at first, but was actually tricky for us. You end up not paying attention to the water level in the reservoir (especially at nights), and sometimes just start heating a bottle without water. When you do so you get no warning whatsoever, which is a real hazard for your bottles, the warmer, and YOU!- Because of the opacity and color of the reservoir, and also because of the presence of mold in it, it is very hard to check the water level, which is probably a reason why we keep forgetting to refill with water...- It never warms the bottles evenly. You have to shake the bottle thoroughly after each warming to avoid baby getting burnt.- The plastic basket isn't the best to pick up small 4-oz bottles, you get burnt most of the time. Let alone baby food jars.- Very inconsistent: sometimes you warm a bottle for 2 minutes and it is super hot, and sometimes after 4 minutes the milk is still barely lukewarm... I first thought that this inconsistency was due to the water level, but I can get one really hot bottle and a very cold one the next time, for the exact same heating time and water level.- The average time needed for a regular 4-oz bottle is around 3-4 minutes: it is so slow!! Am I the only mom whose baby won't wait for 4 minutes for her bottle to be ready when she is hungry?- The power cord is too short. I like short because you don't need to have cables all around the kitchen, but this is really, really short...We were so frustrated by this warmer that we ended up ordering another warmer and warming bottles in a water bath until we received the other one. I still use it though, but exclusively for food jars, for which it does an OK job, even if, as I already said, it is not easy to remove the jar from the plastic basket. Having 2 warmers allows me to prepare her bottle and her food jar at the same time, so maybe it wasn't THAT useless after all...	
- 1	I was very excited to buy this clock to match my daughter's mural.The clock arrived with the minute hand a little loose, and needed repairing to work in the first place. A few hours after hanging the clock, the block with the metal hanging loop fell off, and the clock fell too.I feel seriously ripped off for paying for something that started falling apart the day I got it.	
1. 	My crawler/wobbler is now an active toddler and needed more room so I bought this extension. Just what we needed! Word to the wise: once a toddler they will be able to lift & move  the fencing a little, not enough to get out but perhaps enough to get closer to something you would rather they not have access to. this is greatly impeded by installing the adhesive pads included, and/or attaching it to the leg of a heavy piece of furniture with the blue nylon snap straps also included. I don't know if the straps are included for this reason, but this works well for us. between the pads and the straps she cannot push the fencing around the room and has given up trying.	
1. 	I've owned this for about a year now and here's what I like:  LOVE the projection on the ceiling, music volume levels, music choices.  My son continues to love it and use it to calm down to fall asleep.  The only thing I would change is I wish it had a remote to start it over again.  Also, we ended up buying a battery charger because it does use the batteries pretty quick.  But I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.	
1. 	I like the bottles. Have only had trouble with leaking a few times when I had the cap to tight. You just have to take off the lid and start over. Good system.	
1. 	also works with even flo travel containers.  Good to use to store breast milk in fridge and als for transporting	
1. 	These are okay, good for the price. My toddler has figured out how to get the lids off though, so she still spills snacks all over the place. There's another snack catcher by munchkin that has a lockable lid. Get that one instead.	
- 1	This would be a great product if it actually worked - the features are fantastic - it has a great look - and is compact - long battery life - sensitivity setting etc.  But it simple wont work - range is terrible - cant even go 30ft in our apt.  - also says its in range and then for no apparent reason goes out of range and beeps loudly.  Wanted to love - but now I hate this product - do not waste your money	
1. 	This is a great changing pad.  The contours on the side keep the baby from being able to roll around, making for easiest clean-up if the baby has a messy diaper.  It is extra long (34 inches), allowing for baby to have extra head and feet room as he/she grows.  If you buy this product, be sure to buy covers that have adequate length to accomodate this changing pad, though.  I use the ultra plush ones, and they fit well.	
1. 	My husband and I were too nervous to bathe our newborn daughter in the sink and she hates having sponge baths. We used this tub with the sling in it for the first time last night (the night it arrived in the mail!) and she loved it. She relaxed in the sling like it was a hammock. Make sure you adjust the sling before you put baby in it though. We put her in and water got in her ears because it was adjusted a bit low in the water. Also, it could be a drowning hazard. Watch your baby! I am looking forward to bath time now. This tub makes it a whole lot easier and fun	
1. 	The best part about this product is how perfect the size of it to transition sitting infants into tubs. The water outlet is a bit cumbersome to work with ESP with one hand. The duck is great for baby baths!	
- 1	I thought this bottle looked cute, and it seemed easier to clean.  My son did use it, but I found several issues with using it.  There is no good way to warm with a bottle warmer.  If you put it in the warmer with the cap on,  the cap will fill with formula.  If you put it in upright without the cap, the bottom opens up and spills into the warmer.  Trying to mix formula in the bottle also didn't work well.  Even with the cap on liquid leaks out of the nipple.  Because of this, even filling the bottle with ready made formula is messy.  I was very disappointed and returned this bottle.  I'll stick with my Soothies.	
1. 	This mobile is wonderful!  Our daughter loves the bright colored animals, and I love how it is so multi-functional.  Having interchangeable pieces is such an inovative idea, and it keeps our little Amy interested.  She also has several other toys made by Sassy, and we have been happy with all of their products.	
1. 	Don't use the spoons or forks that came with this set.  However, the cups, lips and containers are great.  As another reviewer said: it is pint-sized tupperware.  Cleans easy but doesn't wear easy.  We use these all day long day after day and the whole thing can fit in my diaper bag on a light day to go to Grandma's.	
1. 	I researched all the Babies R Us tub choices before getting this one. I liked this one initially for the durability, easy cleaning, and that it can be used for a newborn, infant, and toddler. I have read other people's reviews and heard mention of problems with the hammock. Our daughter was 9.2 at birth. We did sponge baths on a towel until her umbilical cord fell off (at 5 weeks) and by then she was 12 pounds. The hammock worked great for her. We thought she might fuss about the new experience of being halfway submerged in water, but the hammock cradled her well. I like that it keeps half of her in water, keeping her warm and letting her bottom soak. She is now 12 weeks and over 16 pounds and is still in the hammock, though she's getting a bit long for it. Some people have mentioned hammock instability and having to use 2 people at bathtime. I bathe my daughter on my own most of the time and have never had any problems. Mine's a wiggler, but the bathtub configuration of having all the supplies needed in a built-in at one end makes it easy to keep one hand on the baby at all times. As for the temperature plug that some complain about...spend the extra $3 for one of the floating temperature indicators if you're worried you can't tell what is too hot for your baby.	
- 1	We actually tested these vs the Joey's hemp inserts. These ones absorbed 3 oz of water, the regular Joey's (single insert) absorbed ~5 oz of water (almost 6 oz), and the Joey's premium (a thin double insert) absorbed nearly 9(!!)oz of water. They're all nearly the same price and about the same size, so I wouldn't recommend these. I've been told before that organic cotton (they're all a cotton+hemp mix) is more absorbent than regular cotton, and now I believe it! :)	
- 1	i purchased 4 of these diapers and was excited because of their trimness and colors. They worked great for the 1st 2-6 times, but after a half dozen times, they all leaked like crazy. NOt from the leg opening, or around seams, they simply soaked right through! I have diapers that have been used for 15 months, several times per week, that still don't leak. Unacceptable.	
1. 	I broke this pump down and put it in my diaper bag. I live far out and after rushing home to pump after being engorged for 30 minutes I had to get this. This is perfect for over producers!	
1. 	This dispenser makes life with Baby easier.  Fill the container with the correct amount of formula for a bottle in each section.  When ready to mix the formula, just put the spout into the bottle and empty the measured formula into the bottle.  The lid fits securely on the container and is not difficult to take off.  Quick, easy, and no mess!	
1. 	It's cheap.  It's easy.  My kid's cant reach it.  My only suggestion is to resist the urge to tighten it a lot, because it can be a little hard to loosen afterward.  As long as it's snug, it's not going anywhere.	
1. 	This seat secures nicely, is easy to stow, is convenient for everything from dining halls to the home kitchen to great-grandma's house.  Gender-neutral color, cleans easily (the tray cover AND removeable inserts are awesome.)  I like that it can also be used as a booster.  The tray is VERY easy to snap on and off (for an adult), and doesn't accidentally slip off when the child is in.  Very affordable, and appears sturdy enough to last through several kids.	
- 1	I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.  They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.  I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.	
1. 	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!	
- 1	We loved this spoon set when it was new, but after a few uses and contact with hot food, it's melted and deformed a little.I think it'll be great for salad, fruit and ice cream, definitely not for hot food.	
- 1	I found this to be too silent, not &#34;noisy&#34; enough to be a rattle for my taste (and my daugther's). She uses them to suck but when she moves her arms she can't hear them so they don't motivate her to move more.	
- 1	My daughter loved the sound button and the handles were helpful but the padded part wouldn't stay on the plastic part and pee was constantly underneath it. Don't know if it was the shape or the padded seat moving too much while in use... I got another seat for my daughter and we haven't had any issues with it.	
- 1	Comes folded resulting in creases that are still present.  Suction cups do not adhere to my wooden table.  Scoop is very awkward.  Haven't found this product particularly useful.  Think twice before purchasing	
- 1	This product seemed like it would work so well, but in reality it is terrible!1) Lightweight diapers don't actually fall through hole. You have to poke them through.2) It is really loud when you close the lid. The clamps snap shut and are way too loud.3) Top heavy - it wants to fall over and has fallen over multiple times4) The lid does not want to latch half the time.	
- 1	This is a cute but very small and super thin blanket. I'm not sure there are any functional reasons to have it. You can't swaddle with it and it's too thin to offer any warmth.	
1. 	My daughter is pregnant with twins and it was getting to be very difficult for her to sleep.  This is a very small wedge, but I don't think you'd want something any bigger or softer to support a growing belly.  She was using it mostly on the couch while using a microbead body pillow in bed.  When she was admitted into the hospital at 31 weeks in pre-term labor, this was the first thing she asked her husband to bring.  She has made it another week and this little pillow gets a constant workout.  Sometimes it is under her belly.  Sometimes it is wedged into her back.  Sometimes it just helps to support the arm that has the IV in it.  We are hoping to make it another 4 weeks or more, so I think I got my money's worth out of this.  I'm glad I found something to make her a bit more comfortable.ETA:  Found another use for the pillow.  It makes an outstanding ramp to launch hot wheel cars!  Entertaining a 4 year old in a hospital room is hard, but this pillow has assisted us in doing just that.	
1. 	I purchased two of these gates for the bottom of my stair cases.  They were fairly easy to install even though the instructions weren't that clear.  I had to buy a 5.5 inch extension and the Y spindle pack to fit my stairs.  Once I got it all together I was very surprised at how sturdy the gates were.  They seem to be of very high quality.	
- 1	baby likes it, however when my son was 3 months old, he didn't have good control over his arms, so he hit his head really hard and it left a mark there. i would recommend it for a baby with better motor skills.	
- 1	We had this item on our baby gift registry and just received it. The packaging clearly states that the backing is made of vinyl, not polyester. Only the batting is polyester. This is an essential difference if you are avoiding toxic materials in your baby gear.	
1. 	I received this mobile as a hand-me-down and it has been great so far.  I really like the sound quality of the music and animal noises.  I also like the light projection of the stars and moons on the underneath of the mobile on the night setting; it can even be seen during the day with the blinds and curtains closed in the room.  My 10 week old son seems very interested in this mobile and helps soothe him to sleep when other methods are not cutting it.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet.  The mobile is detachable for when babies start pulling up but you can still use the base.  I know my friend's daughter enjoyed the music on the base as she grew older and could hit the buttons herself.  Also, the remote will turn the mobile both on and off.	
- 1	I do not know who leaves a positive reviews for this bouncer that does not bounce, in addition toys are REALLY HASARDOUS to the baby. The flower almost pocked my baby in the eye ,,, im glad i watched her for the first time in this thin.Design is poor, not too easy to assemble and the whole thing is flimsy...AND the most of the most - BABY HATES IT.... we tried similar thing in the store some other brand and she loved it...this one makes her bored, angry and uncomfortable to sit in.	
1. 	This was the only bib that worked on my toddler. She ripped every other bib off in seconds; it was impossible to keep her clothes covered. This bib covers everything up nicely and the best part is that it ties in the back. Now she cannot just rip it off. Anything with velcro or the hard bibs that snapped or the snap button bibs were nothing for her. This one she just gave up on ripping off. I love it.	
- 1	My husband and I bought 2 jumperoos - one by Baby Einstein and one called Luv U Zoo by Fisher-Price. We have about %95 of our baby's toys made by Fisher Price, so we thought we would for sure like it. We were wrong...The 2 good things about this jumperoo that Baby Einstein is lacking in, are these 2 features:1. The Fisher Price jumperoo has a motion activated music, with the option to leave the music playing for up to 20 minutes. Baby Einstein works only when pressed on the piano's keys (plays cute classic music but for only 10-15 seconds,or you can select it to say colors and shapes in 3 different languages)2. Fisher Price has a rest area for the arms on the swivel seat, which is great for younger babies.Although with the Baby Einstein's jumperoo the assembly took longer, the base was A LOT (!!!!!) more sturdy and didn't giggle from side to side at all. Fisher Price was so wobbly, it truly felt like a safety hazard to put our baby in it. The wobbly part was the 2 arms on the sides, it felt like it could snap off the base.This Fisher price jumperoo was so disappointing, we returned it the very next day.	
- 1	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible.  My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise.  Our baby slept through the night since day one...it was the monitor that kept us up.  I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers...it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it. This monitor is not worth the money.	
1. 	Since my son started sitting in high chairs at restaurants, I've always worried about him eating off the dirty tables (or licking them).  So when I found this rubber placemat, I thought it was perfect for eating out.  It takes up very little space in the diaper bag since it rolls up into its catch tray, it's super easy to wipe clean, and it doubles as a protective guard so my baby doesn't hit his face against the edge of tables.  The suction is pretty decent, it sticks on most surfaces.  All in all, for how inexpensive it is, it is a great product!!	
1. 	This has worked great in our bathroom.  We put all the toys in the frog and then were able to hang things from it's toes.My daughter and son both think it is funny and like to clean up after themselves (the only place they like so far).Recommend it for even small bathrooms as it fits in our tiny one just fine.	
- 1	I can't speak to the quality of these bibs since I won't be using them, but the drop down box on this order page is useless.  Regardless of which color option you select, you will be mailed the pink, girly bibs shown on the photo.	
1. 	This a nicely designed inflatable tub. We use it as portable tub when we go out of town. Grandma loves it. She thinks its very cute. It is fairly large and safe feeling. There is temperature warning disc at the bottom. Our son likes it so much we may use it as an everyday tub.	
1. 	Oh these are awesome!  These fit the (wide) Ventaire bottle as well as Drop-In bottles.  The Ventaire bottles come with silicone nipples, but our daughter really prefers these latex ones.  They're a bit softer than silicone.  We might have to look into the fast flow ones soon though.	
- 1	I have the older version of this dispenser which is still for sale here on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Powdered-Formula-Dispenser-Colors/dp/B0009ET94A/ref=pd_sbs_ba_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=1DKFWMHYP3P5BPBDQ0B5) I received this new version as a gift at my baby shower and its terrible! I thought it was just me but seeing the reviews here, I totally agree with the bad reviews. It's much bulkier and takes up more room in the diaper bag than the older version. Powder leaks into the other chambers. Its nearly impossible to get all the powder out and the lid does not stay on very securely.The final straw was when I dropped the container (on carpet mind you! and not from a height of 2 feet maybe?) and this container basically exploded. Lid went flying off in one direction, the container went the other and there was formula everywhere! So here I am with a huge mess while I am frantically trying to prepare a bottle for a screaming baby. This thing is a huge piece of junk. i have no clue why Munchkin would use this new design when the old one worked perfectly fine. I would highly recommend buying the old version of this container. It works great! I'll tossing this one and using my older one.	
1. 	This is something I often buy for expectant parents; it will be great for many years to come! We use it at the beach because it's easy to get rid of the sand, and we use it on grass if there's been some rain. Folds up easily.	
- 1	I bought this wipes warmer since I thought it would fit nicely in my suitcase when we go to visit family.  It is compact, but honestly it's too compact.  You can change about 2 diapers before you have to refill it, and it doesn't even keep the wipes warm.  Furthermore, since it is so lightweight, each time you go to pick up a wipe you end up picking up the whole dispenser.  This thing *might* be worth it if it came with a rechargeable battery so I could pack it in my diaper bag.	
- 1	This mirror is just pointless.  It has no mechanism to aim the mirror whatsoever.  Strap it on to the headrest and hope for the best.  I did manage to wedge a plastic bottle behind mine in order to get an appropriate angle, but it's still not stable and it's literally trashy.  The way that the mirror works is to be so convex as to include such a wide angle of view that it almost HAS to show your baby (even though it didn't).  The end result is an image of your baby (our car seats are right up against the front seats, so the mirror is as close as possible to me) is so tiny as to not show you any real information.  The image of my 8lb infant's entire head would easily fit on the mirror surface 20 times, it's so small.  If you just want a mirror because you're neurotic and you just want to be able to relieve your conscience and technically see your baby, then this mirror, coupled with some ingenious use of trash, should do the trick eventually.  If you actually want to see useful information (e.g. is my baby turning blue), then you're better off elsewhere.	
1. 	So - We had one of the fancy schmancy Puj baths because of space concerns. The baby hated it.The baby loves this bath! He kicks and splashes and has a grand time. We place it next to the sink on the kitchen counter and it works wonderfully! My mommy group of over 80 women agree! This can be used for toddlers too as there is a sitting spot opposite of where the baby lays.We don't store it in the bathroom - it has a hole for a hook and we just hook it onto the back of the nursery closet door. (A tiny closet - but it fits!)This would be super useful for those without a bathtub and just a shower!	
1. 	Recently, while on vacation I misplaced the membranes for my Medela Pump In Style Breastpump, which are vital for operation. The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4 oz, 9 oz or disposable. I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be plugged in and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed.	
1. 	Great idea for a teething baby. easy to put chunks of frozen fruit or ice into. takes some time to disinfect due to mesh bag but over all i would recommend to others.	
1. 	This play gym has survived through two children and looks just as great today as it did when we bought it. We wash the mat and the plush toys often. The items are easy to clean. The butterflies do not spin automatically like I kind of assumed they might, but they are fun for the kids none-the-less. Colorful with great sounds and great detachable toys.	
1. 	This is easy to install and very easy to use. Only downfall is that you will forget about it and can dislodge from the fridge if you pull the door too hard. We've done it three times, and were able to successfully put it back on.	
- 1	I have had back pain since the third month of my pregnancy and finally gave in to buying an expensive pregnancy pillow at month 6.  I thought this would be my godsend.  I used it for less than one night before I tossed it on the ground and slept without it.  Since I couldn't sleep, I actually got up out of bed to print out my return label because I couldn't wait to get rid of this thing and pop it off at UPS and get it out of our house.  I am absolutely baffled by all of the rave reviews.Pros:One star for being made in the USA (with foreign parts, so take that for what it's worth).Cons:Cheap fabric case.Inside filling feels flimsy and like it won't hold up.Completely UNCOMFORTABLE!!!You can't use your own pillow unless you want your head lifted up super high.It's not easy to switch from left side to right side.  You have to hoist the dumb thing back and forth (try doing that with sheets/duvet on top), and in doing so, it's completely disruptive to one's sleeping partner.  Also, even simple things like turning over in bed are difficult/painful whilst pregnant, and this pillow makes it even harder.I will either invest in a U-shaped pillow or non-pregnancy specific long tubular body pillow (so I can use my own pillow for my head and turn sides with ease) or just stick to having a regular pillow between my legs.  The Leacho Snoogle was a total bust and a complete waste of money.	
1. 	We purchased a few of these and installed them strategically around our house in areas that we often need to use outlets.  These BY FAR beat the little plastic inserts that are in the rest of our outlets, but because of cost, we have both.  The spring is pretty tight, and certainly doesn't seem like it would be easily manipulated by little hands who would need to slide the cover all of the way over and then insert finger into the plug.  It took my husband only a minute or two to change out the outlet plate.Overall-happy with this purchase!	
- 1	I hoped against hopes that this would do well for us.  We ordered this for our infant son and it just never had the same reading twice and that was with my son steadily sucking it and not spitting it out.	
1. 	This is a great first toothbrush. Our son likes to chew on it, but doesn't let us help him with it. So while it does get his few teeth clean, soothe his gums, and provide general merriment for him, it isn't preparing him to use a toothbrush. Overall, a good product. I'm glad we have it.	
1. 	We have roughly ~4 types of bibs and these always get used first. Strong velcro, absorbent, no crinkle sound from a lining. All around great at what they do. FYI the white could be removed and replaced with a different color in my mind - sorta looks rough after green beans, carrots and other food spit up ruins the pristine white.	
1. 	This has been a life saver with our newborn who is very specific about what kind of white noise she likes if she's fussy. We keep this larger one attached to her crib so that when we lay her down in the crib we can flick this on to one of the sound settings and let it play for 23 or 45 mins, we always leave it on 45 minutes to play the longest it can. Four sounds come with the giraffe (which looks so cute in her safari themed nursery).Sleep - sounds like rushing water.Relax - Bubbling stream with occasional quiet nature sounds like tweeting birds.Calm - Slightly louder nature sounds like insects, birds tweeting and an occasional growl over low quiet drum beats.Play - More rapid fun drum beat with some jazzy insect noises and a ribbiting frog.It's very cute and effective, we switch between sleep and relax when she's napping and I know as she gets older the Calm and Play sounds will be fun for her! I also love that it attaches securely to the outside of the crib with a very strong velcro strap!	
- 1	updated review...17 months later. i purchased this because i liked that its a reusable and i love skip hop items i have their diaper bag!!i thought hey i can refill as needed and attach to the stroller etc. however the strap on it broke and it would no longer hang or attach to the stroller and the slider was not the best. It would not hold any moisture for the wipes. i have plenty of those cheap wipe holders you get and they hold moisture better than this thing. Not to happy about this item after all.	
- 1	Omg! Why was it dirty??? I couldn't believe it looked so funky! And, it really didn't look anything like the picture. Very disappointing. It's not even worth trying to return it...I wish I could give NO stars!	
- 1	I got this free when I purchased a Britax Boulevard 70, but do not use it with it. I'm usually driving so it would be useless for me to have this cupholder attached to the carseat in the back. I did use it for a while with my Valco Baby Tri-Mode EX stroller but it did not stay on very well. Any time I had a drink in it, I had to keep my hand on it as I pushed the stroller. Granted, it was not made for use with the Valco baby stroller, but what's the sense in getting a cupholder if you can use it only with a carseat? It's not as if I'm going to push my huge convertible carseat round with me! I've since gotten a Valco Baby Universal Cupholder, and it works much better!UPDATE September 2012----I don't usually reply to negative comments or remarks (for anyone, not only myself) but I feel the need to do so this time, especially since this is the first time I've gotten negative remarks . To all those folks who commented on my review-You're right, the cup holder was meant for the car seat, not for me. I was and still am a very sleep-deprived mama. Moreover, when I wrote the above review, my daughter had just been discharged from hospital after her second open heart surgery then subsequent re-admittance for severe dehydration resulting from the medications she'd been given. I was not paying attention to the name/intended purpose of the product. As my daughter never got her own bottle or cup whilst sitting in the car seat (she was always too weak to do so), it never occurred to me that THAT was the purpose of this cup holder. Therefore, let me rephrase my review: This cup holder was not very useful to me, the sole user of the product. However ,it works fine for the car seat, and offers another cup holder to the passenger sitting next to it.	
- 1	The dimensions of these locks didn't work on any of the cabinets in our house.  I replaced them with some locks from Buy Buy Baby that were (almost) truly universal, which were much better.	
1. 	After 12 months of using cloth bibs that were completely messy after each meal and had to be washed each time, we found these Babybjorn bibs on Amazon. The first time we tried them, our daughter hated them and kept on crying until I took them off. I think the plastic thing around her neck just scared her because she was not used to it (if you start off with these bibs it is probably no problem). We then put the bib on her several times for only one or two minutes when she was in a good mood and did not notice the bib much and pretty soon she did not care any more whether we used the cloth bib or the plastic one during her meals. The bib is great at catching food and it is so easy to wash it after each meal! Saves so much time and her clothes stay much cleaner this way.Also, some reviewers were saying the bib was too small. Our daughter is now 16 months old and on the 92nd percentile in terms of height - a little giant! The bib fits her perfectly and the adjustable strap leaves us room to make it looser when she gets (even) bigger. So we are very happy with this and definitely recommend it.	
1. 	I bought this for multiple purposes and it worked perfectly for all. The only con is that it is a bit pricey.  Overall, definitely worth the price.-Corner pieces used separately on corners of tables without the longer strips:  This doesn't look great but compared to the other clear plastic or silicone corner pieces I have much greater piece of mind with these.  They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he doesn't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step:  I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length.  It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear.  This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal, it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given.  The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product.*FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE:  Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes.  THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables.  You'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar.  I covered a large coffee table for around $3 and some blue painters tape.	
1. 	I am pumping 2-3 times a day while at work and I use these wipes after each time.  I've found that I can use the same wipe all day, saving me money and time.  I usually use a napkin to wipe off any drips and then the wet wipe to clean the various pieces.  You will still need to wash with water now and again, because the wipes can't get into the smaller places, but they definitely do the trick when you're in a pinch. I highly recommend them!	
1. 	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.	
- 1	I was given this as a gift and I am sorry to add to the other one star reviews that it is a completely useless product. With no constant 'on' setting, all it does is wake baby when it switches off, totally defeating the purpose of having the machine in the first place.Also I have had problems with shorting as well, leaving me to believe that this product is not well made and wouldn't last even if I had used it more than a dozen times.	
1. 	My daughter had no idea what this was and now that she is 2 and knows about stars and the moon she loves it.	
- 1	These were not the spouts that I thought they were. Although, the picture looked the same. One side of the spout is larger, so it didn't fit my nuby 10oz cups!	
1. 	These work great with my Medela Freestyle Breast Pump.  The bags, with enclosed adapter, are easy to use and seal.  These are much easier to label and store in the freezer than extra bottles.	
- 1	I fell for the hype of Sophie, so many great reviews, a great name, and a high pricetag..so it must be great right? Wrong! It is an over-hyped dog toy. It is nothing like I expected. I thought the legs would be a bit more stiff to actually allow for teething. But they aren't. It's super soft and squishy and hollow. My son who puts everything in his mouth won't play with this, and I don't blame him. Even the texture is weird. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it does have a cute squeeker (again like a dog toy). But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if it were a fraction of the price.	
- 1	This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the seat or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest.	
1. 	These travel caps are great, I usually fill up all of my son's bottles with filtered water at the beginning of the day and cap them, leaving the other assembled accessories next to them for a quick bottle prep.  These are the only caps that will tightly seal the bottle, I've used the medela caps on those bottles and every single time I am mixing formula in the bottle they leak.  These caps are made for the dr. brown's bottles so definitely get them, if you like to secure the bottles with liquid or make formula in them.  This way you can ensure no leaks.	
- 1	This thing barely sticks to the table and my nine month old baby very easily pulls it of of the table.  I will not buy again.	
- 1	looking for a slim car seat for our small car. The car seat is moving around after several installation. I do not feel comfortable letting me kid sit in it. had to return this product.	
1. 	I must admit that in the past I haven't had the best luck with products containing miracle in their name. However, this blanket is the shining exception!Our son was a very big boy -- 10 lb, 6 oz of joy. We had read Harvey Karp's The Happiest Baby on the Block (highly recommended) and we knew we wanted to swaddle him. We had planned to use a receiving blanket, but we quickly found out that none of them were remotely big enough. Not even close. We spent a ton of money buying bigger blankets, and we tried two other expensive swaddling blankets as well. Nothing worked, nothing held the baby, and all three of us were desperate to get some sleep. We even bought a cheap sheet set and tore it up to get some bigger patches of cloth. No dice.Finally, I ordered this blanket online (Amazon didn't carry it at the time, alas.) BINGO -- our son slept through the night at once! Yes! We had to wake him from a sound, swaddled sleep to change and feed him; he went back down like a rock as soon as we re-swaddled him. He loved this blanket. When he saw us coming with it, he'd try to lie quietly with his arms in his sides in anticipation of the (very simple) process of swaddling him up. And I loved the fact that this blanket was so soft and comforting and had no snaps or any other fasteners that could rub him.I should mention that the two new parents I gave this to as a shower gift were pathetically grateful, and couldn't stop gushing. I understand; for a new parent, anything that grants you sleep is your favorite thing in the world.A note to parents considering this blanket: Be prepared for some of your friends (especially the childless ones) to recoil in horror at the thought of swaddling. You're tying your baby up? What if he suffocates? But he won't be able to move! It's cruel!, etc., etc. These people probably mean well, but their comments are very ignorant. The fact is, your baby has just spent months in the most confined space imaginable -- a womb where he could barely budge at all. And new parents will immediately notice that newborn babies have virtually no control over their newly freed arms -- they'll startle themselves from sleep time and again, then start flailing their hands around and scratching their faces raw. Newborns don't have the neurological control to stop themselves from flailing, so they love it when you return them to the safe, warm, familiar confinement they remember from the womb.Another comment you'll hear from some people is, How do you know when the baby doesn't need to be swaddled any more? Easy. They start to wriggle out of the swaddling. They may not be able to talk, but they'll let you know clearly when they're ready to move on.	
- 1	The cover is not what is shown in the pictureit's hard to keep it open and it's a hassle. I don't recommend it	
1. 	I was going to give it 2 stars because, like some other reviewers, I was sure that the speakers did not work - but I gave another try, and figured out that you have to pull speakers really strongly and make them click. So, after over a month using the silent bouncer my son can finally listen music. He loves it! He listens and tries to sing! This changed my evaluation dramatically. The mirror also attracts his attention. I do not like the cover material - too rough for tender baby skin - my son turns his head and rubs his face against it sometims, so I have to cover it with a cotton flannel blanket, otherwise his facial skin is irritated. At his 2 months my baby is 22 - 13lbs, but seems like in couple of months he with outgrow it, no way to use this up to 3 years! And anyway, such bouncers should not be used for babies able to sit without help. I have to keep the rattle arms down most of time - his hands could stuck under it and it is not very safe. The bouncer itself is nice and good quality - if I was rating just a bouncer I would give 5 stars definitely. My little boy likes bouncing in it and often falls asleep. But I think it's a little overpriced.	
1. 	Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together. He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through! The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily. We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!! It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it. It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too! The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me. It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.	
1. 	I would have given this product five stars, except it took almost a month to sort out a delivery snafu before we could actually get the crib together. This is the first time I've had a problem with an Amazon purchase and they weren't able to resolve it quickly (or technically, at all).The product itself seems great and it was top-rated on Consumer Reports (my main reason for ordering it). We noticed some issues with the (white) finish on one leg being scratched/stained, but since that bit faces the wall and it was such a great buy, it's not an issue for us. Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and didn't take long to put together.However, it was difficult and time-consuming to sort out problems with customer service, so I'm not 100% thrilled with the purchase.Initially, they only sent two legs (instead of four). When contacted, Amazon customer service told us we could either repack/return the entire crib (time-consuming & cumbersome) or request the missing parts from the manufacturer (Million Dollar Baby, MDB) directly.Unfortunately, Amazon had no contact details for MDB, so we had to track it down ourselves via the MDB website. Even then, the only available contact method was via email (no phone). Once MDB responded (about a week after my first email), it took over a week to resolve, and at least another week before the parts were actually delivered.I'd hesitate before ordering another one of these products, at least until MDB improves (or expand) its customer service department.	
1. 	NOthing special going on here with this teether. Its just your normal teether that you can buy anywhere. Its a little bulky.. But it does hold onto a freeze quite well. I wish I knew if I could sterilize it. So if anyone knows..... Please tell me	
1. 	After trying the Brica mirror, the Diono is a MUCH better design. It actually stays in place! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do wish it was magnified more, but overall I am very pleased with this product.	
- 1	wasnt crazy about the product the plastic was making my sun sweat. i would of proferred the inside be cotton.	
1. 	I bought this to keep in our home for when our little granddaughter comes to visit.  It is nicely made and keeps her occupied for quite awhile.  Glad I made this purchase.	
- 1	I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.  They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.  I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.	
- 1	What I like:- Colorful- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining- SmallWhat I Don't like:- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max- Musical part was two 5 second tunes- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.- Pillow is so small its uselessThis will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child.	
1. 	My son can only tolerate ready to feed formula, which means that we have to keep formula refrigerated wherever we go!  We can comfortably fit two glass Avent or Dr. Brown's bottles in the cooler and the cold pack stays cold for a very long time.I was initially concerned from reading other reviews about the height of the cooler, but it's just the right size for us.  So far, we have used it for every outing for about 5 months and it has held up great to a lot of use...no real signs of wear.	
- 1	There was no recommended age on this product so I assumed it would work for my 9 month old who has a lot of hair, but it doesnt. Right  now it is too big and I need to use too much pressue to keep it firmly against her head. This is definitely for a child with a much bigger head that is atleast older than year or 18 months. Also using this product means you only have one free hand to wash the hair, so if you are using a rinser cup thats going to be tricky	
1. 	We've had this rail for just over a week now. My son just moved into a big boy bed and I did a ton of research into which rail would be best for us. This one seemed to fit the bill. We have a mattress/boxspring combo so happily didn't have the issues that the people with platforms etc have in picking a rail.It's certainly sturdy and with that middle stabilizer bar in place, doesn't move ANYwhere near enough to let him fall through. I cannot imagine how kids are going through to the floor if this is installed correctly and using that middle bar.Some pros and cons below. Don't be fooled by that it seems like there's more cons than pros. Not true. I'm just wordier with my complaints. &lt;lol>Pros:--It's sturdy and nice-looking. We DID install that middle bar as other reviewers recommended. I definitely think it's a good idea. I can't see how it's as stable without it.--You can lower it down to make changing sheets etc super easy. I love this. I also lower it when sitting in the rocker next to the bed telling a story or singing to him - otherwise I can't see him, nor he me! It's also mercifully quiet when you raise it back up and snap it into place. I have a SUPER light sleeper and he doesn't stir when I do that.--The mechanism to lower it works smoothly and well, and I can't find a way that a child, alone, could do it him/herself.--It seems quite safe and serves its purpose well. This is my favorite part really - that it is SAFE and stable and keeps him from falling out.Cons:--You need a decent amount of room from floor to top of boxspring (I think another reviewer said 18 inches?) in order to be able to have this flush against the side when lowered. We don't. So it doesn't go flat to the floor, but stays on an angle. As another reviewer note, when like that it makes a ladder for the child to get to the bed. I don't like that - I don't want him climbing on the thing at all, so I mostly leave it up now. I lower it mostly when tucking sheets. Disappointing - I loved that it could be left down, but that's a fault of my bed, NOT of the rail.--We found it a tad bit confusing as to how to properly tighten the anchor thing. In fairness, it had been a long day and maybe if we were fresh it would've been like ohhhhh duhh! or something. Putting it together was a snap, but we hassled with the anchor thing a bit. Got it, though (it's really NOT hard) and now it's nice and sturdy. I also agree with the other reviewers in that you really SHOULD use that middle bar. We have a rather low mattress and that bar falls JUST below it. So we lucked out in that the bar isn't against him in any way.--One nit-picky thing, but one that I think the company really needs to look at, is that after just a week, the mesh in the top corner is sort of slightly bubbled out from my 3 year old putting his foot there. Seems like it should be stronger or better held inside or something.  Now don't misunderstand, it's not ripped, it's not way out, it's just not totally smooth in that area anymore. Again, seems like mine can't be the only kid who puts their foot on it, or elbow, or whatever. (That, primarily, is the reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, by the way.)That's kind of it I think. Works as it should - goes on relatively easily - looks nice - most of all seems super safe. That last bit is all that really matters.	
1. 	this swing saved me in the begining (and still sometimes now-six months later)! we loved it so much that we sent it to a family member in hawaii even though shipping cost as much as swing. it was well worth it, it's been a life saver for them too. if i could rate this swing higher than five stars i would!	
- 1	Nice simple design - just two pieces. It does leak, but most do unless they have an extra regulator piece. For the cost, I can't complain. This is good for my 12-month old - right size, weight and flow is not too fast or too slow. And love that no one else on the playground has this one. And that it is the one cup that does not roll under the sofa.UPDATE:After just a few uses, it broke! The bottom seam opened. My daughter does drop this but I don't think she's rougher than any other kid. I am hoping this is a fluke and will order another one since there are a lot of things I like about it.	
1. 	I love this so much I've started including it in every baby shower gift that I give. I was skeptical at first, but it makes diaper changes so easy! Keeping everything in one spot is a must. We have one upstairs near the changing table and another downstairs near the pack and play. Wonderful idea!	
- 1	I did a lot of research to find a stroller that wasn't loaded with flame retardants and other toxins, and finally settled on this Uppababy. When it came though, it had a chemical smell that was so strong it stank up an entire room, even though it was still in the box. It was clearly not chemical free. I called the company to find out what they use in these strollers and they claimed that it must be defective, that it shouldn't smell, and that they had never received any complaints about the G-series before. I know this isn't true though, because I ended up having to call them twice and both times they insisted that no one else had complained - since I hadn't given them any identifying information on either call, they couldn't have known it was the same caller.On further inspection, I think it may be the packing materials that are primarily responsible for the awful toxic smell, but at any rate if you are interested in avoiding toxins I would cross this stroller off your list. It doesn't belong anywhere near a baby. (I didn't try the stroller out, but it didn't look comfortable and it also didn't seem all that well made. It was super light though and folded up small. If you buy from Healthcheck Systems, know that their return policy is bad, they have a big restocking fee and you have to pay a lot in postage to mail the large package back. )	
1. 	This pump helped me in breastfeeding a lot. At first i thought I would use it once in a while but a couple of weeks into it I used it every day to store extra breastmilk and this way my husband or mother can enjoy feeding the baby too. My son would still get precious breastmilk, and I would be able to rest. Also, Dr. Brown's Bottles screw on right onto the pump!	
- 1	I bought these after a positive experience with a similar product in 2010. I wish I could find that other product again. This is not nearly as good. I bought a lot, thinking it would be like the other product I liked in 2010, and I made twelve ornaments  with this product in spite of the significant problems, so this was not a one time bad experience. I experimented with different kneading times and different amounts of pressure to make the print. Regardless, I was not able create an attractive product. Here were the problems I encountered.(1) It requires A LOT of pressure to make the imprint--more pressure than babies, or most adults make naturally, so you will have to very, very firmly press your child's hand (or foot) into each ornament your make. When my daughter was a newborn, this was impossible. I had another kit and saved it for later when she was seven months. It was still very hard. I did a lot of footprints, because she puts more weight on the feet naturally than her hands.(2) The finished product doesn't look great. From a distance on a Christmas tree, you would be hard pressed (no pun intended) to make out that this was the shape of a baby's hand or foot. It just looks like a white circle until you get close. And keep in mind, this was after considerable work to get a firm imprint from my infant. Even more disappointingly, you cannot make out the adorable, distinctive wrinkles in her foot or hand. It primarily just an outline shape pressed in. Both the other clay product I used, and ink pad prints preserve those adorable wrinkles.(3) The circle cut-out isn't sharp enough to cut the edges cleanly. At least this problem is easy to fix with an Exact-o knife or scissors, but it is irksome. I sincerely doubt the examples on the product box were made with this kit alone.(4) The circle shape is only 4 inches in diameter. My daughter's foot nearly fills it, and she is tiny for age seven months (just over 14 lbs). The average one year old's hand will not fit comfortable in this circle. You could lose their cut-out and make your own, but again, it is irksome to have to use other products after you buy a &#34;kit.&#34;I recommend saving yourself this trouble. If you can't find a better clay kit, buy an ink pad to preserve precious prints and make crafts with. It will look much better and be less hassle.	
1. 	this does take up a lot of space and if you make the bed with it under the covers, it looks like there's still a person sleeping. we have a king bed and so there's room for it. the cover is a little scratchy - like 50 thread count.  It has definitely helped me to make the adjustment to sleeping on my side because I am a back or stomach sleeper when I'm not pregnant.one of the first nights I used it, I had an awful night's sleep because my husband was snoring the whole night. Even though it was a saturday and I could sleep late, I was up at 7:00 am because of his snoring.  I was surprised when I went back to the bedroom an hour later to find my husband silently sleeping in my pillow!  he wants one too now!  I let him use my nest once I'm awake.It can be kind of cumbersome but my tip to get up to go to the bathroom in the night is just to lift one arm of it and go under the pillow.	
- 1	For me my baby still doesnt like it cause his legs have to spread too far to go around you. I wont be using this till he can atleastget hislegsaroundmy waist comfortably.  Hes 2 months now and were using a carrier with a thinner crotch area.	
- 1	What a waste of time &amp; energy!  This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me. Before it did, I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky.  Buy any Medela pump instead.  I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often.  Sigh.	
1. 	I was looking at a lot of expensive high chairs and decided to use this one in the mean time.  Since we started using it, we stopped looking for a more expensive alternative.  It's sturdy and easy to use.	
- 1	These little guys seem cool until you get them. They do not squeek or crinkle as good as they should. The string that they hang by seems like it might come apart in babies mouth. Overall they seem kind of flimsy. Would not recommend.	
1. 	This play yard is not bad but it is not sturdy when the door is open. My son really enjoyed walking while pushing the whole fence across our living room floor. He was able to climb up and around it no problem by the time he was 10 months old. It is light weight which is nice when you need to transport it but not when you need to keep a child in one place. We ended up just using it outside at that point.I would highly recommend you buy the panel extension kit as it is not very big. With the two panels it seemed to be just thh right size for my son and all of his toys.	
- 1	I am really bummed this didn't work out for my daughter.  She is 13 weeks old and I have been working with her and a bottle since she was 3 weeks olds.  She likes nursing too much and the only bottles Ihave been able to get her to take are medela.  But she just takes them from me and no one else.  I am a little scared for daycare in 2 weeks.  I was hoping this would work better...but when she sucks she gets too much milk and she kept choking on it and half the bottle got wasted due to her mouth getting flooded.  Not sure where they get the saying that the baby controls the flow.  She got it flowing...just was way too much.	
1. 	I put this on the corners of my brick fireplace and sticks well.  My one year old son tried pulling on it once and without success and never tried again.  They are large with good cushion and will do its job.  The adhesive is strong enough and after 3 months, they are still there on all three corners.  I would recommend but of course, if your child is persistent, I am sure he/she would get it off eventually. So far, so good.	
- 1	According to 7th gen these are supposed to be the original wipes and not the new ones with all the chemicals but Amazon is sending the new wipes for this so it's the wrong wipes! When I ordered this I got the new thick rough ones with sodium benzoate and other junk!  Amazon has the the new wipes as anther item you can get but this specific item is supposed to be the old ones seventh generation brought back so don't order these until amazon fixes the problem!	
1. 	I love this system because it's so easy. Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple. I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular bag liner colapses easier.I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless. My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out. We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.	
1. 	Overalll I love this sleepsack as it helps my 10 month old recognize nap & bedtimes and she is able to sleep in every position imaginable without getting tangled. It helped her to sleep in positions other than her back, which is great for her flat head! She can also stand up in her crib (most of the time) without it interfering.  I would have given it 5 stars except that I have trouble with the zipper after having used if for a few months... I have now figured out a trick to help zip it closed (holding the zipper tines just so), but it was a very frustrating few weeks with baby sleeping in a open sack! The upside down zipper is key for night time diaper changes.	
1. 	My son loves this pillow! He will nap in it often. It is inclined enough for him to get a different view of what is going on around him, although the incline is probably not great enough for those little ones who have problems with gastric reflux.I agree with a previous poster that this pillow was much larger than I expected. My son is 14 lbs and 25 inches long and he still has a lot of room left on this.The one thing I am not crazy about is the fabric, it has pilled quite a bit in its less than 3 months of use. The pillow also can only be spot washed. It would be nice to have a removable washable cover. Otherwise, great product, would purchase again if ever needed.	
1. 	I have an 8 month old and she started splashing too much to bath her in the sink so we started using this tub seat we got as a gift and it works great.  She sits comfortably it it and can play and splash all she wants.  It's also easier on my back because I don't have to lean over the tub to make sure she doesn't fall back or forward into the water.  It's definately something I'd recommend.  My only gripe is that I wish the water was easier to drain out of it.  It seems like there's still water in it even after I tip it upside down to drain.	
1. 	I got this for a friend's baby because my son loved his so much.  Some babies only like to be swaddled as newborns-- mine was swaddled til he was 8 months old!  He wouldn't sleep any other way.  And it kept him from scratching his face too.  It kept him much snugger than swaddling with a blanket.  For us, this was an absolute must-have.  If your baby is having trouble sleeping, or fusses a lot, try this swaddler!	
- 1	I am looking to by a second toddler seat as we are now on baby number two nearing the one-year-old stage. I wasn't nuts about spending another $360 (I have the Orbit Baby) on a big car seat and I noticed the Maxi Cosi Pria 70 being highly regarded. Amazon had them on sale for near to the two hundred range so I purchased one and thought I'd try it out. I can't believe the difference in quality and how crappy it was compared to the Orbit. The Maxi Cosi Pria 70 is exactly the same as the Cosco Senerca which is a popular extra seat for under fifty bucks. I couldn't believe that Maxi Cosi (actually Doral group) was charging an extra two hundred bucks for some fancy padding. Come on people. Orbit has the highest tech in impact protection with the EPP foam. The Maxi Cosi is a plastic shell and THAT'S IT!And the padding isn't that nice, very polyester-like and slick.  I can't imagine it on a hot day.  And when I took  it apart and compared it to my Cosco seat, nearly the same thing.  What a crock.	
1. 	Very easy to use and blend up baby's food. Put vegis in, add some water, mix. It's that simple. Sometimes some of the bigger pieces won't blend as well, I just run a spatula through the blended stuff and either blend again or just pick those big chunks out and throw them down the sink. So glad I didn't spend 3x as much on the baby bullet, there was no need for that, it's just a brand name that people flock to. Save some money and but this one!	
1. 	I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... just in case you prefer them. I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.OH!! And if you would rather, the bottles and all parts fit in the munchikin dishwasher basket.. even the sraws can be put in the straw things on the side of it!!! just discovered that...	
- 1	I don't like this basket. It's so small.. and, yes, I realize it's only for baby-sized objects, but it's just proportioned wrong. In my dishwasher, there really isn't a good place for this basket to fit, and, if I manage to get it in there, I can't fill it up with very many things to wash.I also have a microwave steam sterilizer.. I'd go with that instead of this basket.Also, when ordering this from Amazon, I didn't realize there are different color choices, so make sure you don't get a pink basket instead of the blue one you really wanted!	
1. 	OMG! I dont know what I would have done without this bibs. Little pricey, but they worth it. Dont leak through, large enough, fit my baby since he was 1 month old,still using them (3 months old).	
1. 	I originally bought these bottles b/c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w/ this starter kit.  I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer.  My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle.  I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her.  I always found myself buying a few more of these.  I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error.  I also use these for storage from time to time w/ the addition of a sealing disc.  It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack.	
1. 	My little one really liked this toy. I got to teach her colors by pointing them out along the ring. The colors are bendy and the loose rings are fun to jiggle around. Definitely a baby toy. By the time she was 12 months old, she had moved on.I still like it.:-)	
1. 	The label states this product was tested for lead and BPA. Since there is no regulation for these things who knows how accurate this is. But the cups are well made and the colors are vibrant. cute simple toy.	
- 1	I bought these to put around the diaper can in my baby's room and they didn't work at all.  I then decided to put all of them in my car which doesn't smell, but I didn't want to waste them and even having all 5 in my car, I would open the door and not even smell a hint of them being there.  Unless you are sniffing these things with your nose plastered up against, them, they are completely useless.  Don't waste your money.	
- 1	This is the second Ergo infant insert I've bought.  I bought this one hoping it would work better than the old infant insert.  It doesn't.  Basically, if your newborn doesn't like the Ergo carrier, it's likely neither insert is going to help.  You should test the Ergo with your newborn before spending the money.My husband and I loved the idea of the Ergo carrier, as the hip belt helps alleviate back problems and is much like our packs for backpacking, so we registered for one.  But however much we like the carrier, my eight-week-old, 10.5 pound daughter hates it. I've been trying to get her into the Ergo using first the old infant insert, and now the Heart 2 Heart, repeatedly ever since she was born, but with no success. The moment I put her (in the insert) into the Ergo carrier, she starts screaming and doesn't stop until I take her out. I've watched the video for the old insert (note: there's no video for the Heart 2 Heart) and am following their technique exactly, but still she just hates the carrier.Neither insert provides enough head support for my daughter, which is why I think she screams. The Heart 2 Heart in particular doesn't work; when she's settled into it as per the instructions, the insert doesn't come up high enough to support her head, and she's not a particularly long child.  So her head flops forward when she tries to look around, which frustrates her.Both inserts feel like a bit of an afterthought -- I'm not convinced the Ergo carrier was designed with newborns in mind. Having the baby's feet out one side in the old insert seemed like a stopgap solution, and the Heart 2 Heart doesn't quite solve the issue, either.  Interestingly, I picked up a used Baby Bjorn as a last resort after having spent all this money on the Ergo and the inserts, and she likes the Bjorn, because it's stiffer and provides more support.  I think she won't like the Ergo until her head's a bit steadier; we'll go back to the Ergo then.So it's worth knowing before buying this insert that it may or may not be money well spent -- it all just depends on whether your child likes it or not, and there's a possibility she won't (as I've now seen multiple reports on various sites saying that their newborns also don't like the Ergo; wish I'd done this research before getting the Ergo and spending the money on the inserts).  It's worth waiting until after your baby is born and trying out the infant inserts before buying them.  Otherwise, you may want to hold off on the Ergo until 4-5 months.	
- 1	We got this step up ladder to help my 3 year old get onto her potty. It is made for a low to the ground round toilet.We have a tall, elongated bowl and the feel swing and wobble on the ground making it not very safe.I try the step up ladder on a low to the ground round bowl toilet and it still had some wobble and slid around on the seat.I would up throwing it away as i deemed it unsafe for my daughter on both toilet types.	
1. 	I got this bouncer for my daughter from my baby shower, I really liked it. I used it daily until my daughter outgrew it at about 5-6 months old maybe? She never really liked her swing, but for the first 2-3 months of her life I could only take a shower if I brought her into the bathroom with me in this seat.	
1. 	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.	
- 1	I am 14 weeks pregnant, still nursing my 15 month old and my milk supply has pretty much dried up. I still try a few times a day though. I am almost to the end of my freezer supply and I just wanted to share a few things about my experiences in using up my freezer supply.1. You can never have enough frozen. There is no &#34;too much&#34;.2. All of the frozen milk I have fed her over the last month has been 13 to 15 months old. In a deep freeze. She drank every drop, not a bad bag. So I question the 12 month rule.3. Double check your bag is sealed before you freeze, keep the seal dry. Many popped open while thawing.4. I used 3 kinds of bags and lots of empty bottles. I will NEVER buy Medela bags again. They are the only ones that the sealed opened on and 4 bags so far either broke or the seal on the bottom of the bag leaked while thawing in hot water. No problems with Lansinoh bags. Not sure if Gerber still makes bags but I used some that were 7 years from my first baby and NO PROBLEM with Gerber bags.	
1. 	You will get a lot of use out of this variety pack. I love the bowls with lids, they are convenient for storage and travel. I don't think you can have too many sippy cups or spoons when your baby starts solid. This was an excellent buy.	
- 1	This seemed like a neat concept, but the product left a lot to be desired.  For one thing (the main thing for me), the night vision is TERRIBLE. I have the camera about 7 feet away from the crib, and while other monitors I've owned have not had a super clear nighttime picture at this range, with this camera I couldn't even tell there was a baby in the crib! One of the neat features of this device is that it tracks and can alert you to movement in the room; however, since you can't see the baby, this doesn't work either at night/in the dark. Since the only times I'm monitoring my daughter is when it's completely dark in the room, this was a deal breaker for me.The other major issue is that it only ever stayed connected for 5-10 minutes. Then it would tell me that I'd lost connection and an attempt to reconnect failed. Sometimes I could go into the app and manually reconnect, but too often it wouldn't even let me. I can hear my daughter naturally from her room if she cries at night, so that's why this wasn't my main issue. If you are relying on this monitor to hear what's going on in your baby's room, that is a huge problem (I used this monitor for 5 nights and it never once stayed connected.).I also realized that I actually didn't like my monitor being on my phone. I like to make calls, answer emails, and do other things on my phone when my daughter is napping, and I didn't like having to sacrifice being able to see her. You can keep the app running in the background, but then it's only sound (so does no good if you are making a phone call), and whenever I did that it disconnected even quicker.  I have since purchased the Infant Optics DXR-8 and am loving it!	
- 1	I bought this after reading all the nice reviews on this, however I hate this product after buying it cz the lid sucks! It is impossible to remove the lid. I literally hurt my fingers opening it or spill formula out. I assumed I need to rotate the lid to move from one compartment to the other, but the lid does not rotate at all! I am very disappointment and am already browsing for a better formula dispenser now!	
- 1	The picture for this product is deceiving. I thought the fabric was smooth. I is actually a cheap feeling scratchy and abrasive type material. I wouldnt want it on my bare skin. I tried my son in it once and he screamed hysterically and I haven't used it since. Its too bad because its a great size and constructed well. I was very disappointed that I couldn't use it.	
1. 	I really like this carrier. I'm on the east coast and my baby was born in late fall so it got cold quick so I haven't used it outdoors yet. But even within the apartment building - checking mail, taking out trash, doing laundry, it comes in handy. I also use it at home while cleaning or getting things done. My son enjoys it. Haven't used it front facing yet.	
1. 	My son has been using this blanket since he was 2 weeks old. He is now 10 months old and it is still big enough to wrap him in (he is over 30inches tall and 25lbs). I use it as a modesty cover when nursing in the car. So many uses. It is incredibly warm, and I've even used it one winter night, when I had to keep watch over him in his room.Pro tip: if you are in a pinch for a towel, these make great ones! They are 100% cotton and absorb water like crazy.	
- 1	We have a number of baby gates in our homes, and this one is my least favorite. I would not choose it for an opening you use often, because it is narrow (my husband and I find ourselves turning sideways to get through it most of the time) and clumsy to maneuver through. I wish it would swing open both ways, that really was the deal breaker for me. I removed it from its first spot and put it in another spot we use less often, but it's still getting on my nerves. I hate how high the bottom bar is, we trip over it all the time. It's cheap, but I would put the money toward another better gate costing 50% more.	
1. 	My baby loves this tub.  I have one question - why on earth would you pay $44.99 for this thing when you can buy it from Target for $9.99?!??  My daughter is 10 months old and we have been using this tub since she was 4 months old.  Love it but would never pay this much for it!!	
- 1	I had heard such great things about the woombie and was so excited to use it but the neck is way too small and chokes baby! I would buy in an instant if there was a larger neck hole. My baby is 14 lbs and his neck isn't oversized and it was waaaay too small. This is supposed to fit babies 14-19 lbs... bummer!	
1. 	I was a nanny before a mom.  The babies and toddlers I cared for had these fleece Halo sleep sacks and so I ordered one for my baby after she no longer wanted to be swaddled. I like that these are generous around the hips and leg area - you don't want to restrict that area too much for growth and development reasons. I also like that they are sleeveless so the baby's temperature is more comfortable. However, I realized once my baby wore her fleece sleep sack (with just a long sleeve onesie) that it was too hot for her in our home. Our California home stays between 70 and 72 degrees in winter, we don't use the heater and she sleeps in her bassinet on a cotton sheet. This is a good sleep sack if your baby or todler's room is drafty and cool or perhaps if you live in a colder climate than we do. The sack can take many washes and will last a long time. Zipper opens from top and bottom. I think I will order a cotton sack to replace the fleece sack. For an idea on sizing - my baby is 7 weeks old, 22.5 inches long, 11.5lbs - I ordered the small and it is long and wide enough or her with lots of room to grow.	
1. 	These disposable diaper sacks are great for at home or on the go. The sacks are durable and have a nice fresh scent. The bags are also designed to be easily tied shut. These bags eliminate any chance of your garbage pail smelling foul. If you&#8217;re out you can tie the sack shut and throw in your diaper bag. Beats other bags in price and quality.	
1. 	I ended up purchasing the Playtex Nurser bottle with the Drop-ins after trying various other bottles that my baby wouldn't drink from. These nipples were a lifesaver and allowed my baby to easily switch between breast and bottle. They are MUCH softer than silicone nipples, which allows for an easier transition. I recommend these to everyone with a baby!	
1. 	Our daughter loves to mess with the stove and these have kept our home from going up in flames. Also she likes to play with them by spinning them around but they still never turn our gas stove on. They work well!	
1. 	If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient.	
- 1	Stopped after 4 seconds--straight out of the package.  I could not get it to go any longer without touching/tapping/pressing on it to nudge it more.  Then my 4 yr old tried to fix it and it went maybe 20 seconds, when perfectly balanced flat on counter top.  The arrow doesn't even line up with the &#34;0&#34; &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; marks.  Looks cute and simple, but SO disappointed, especially for the price!!!  I knew I was taking a risk based on prior reviews, but geez...next time I take a risk on such an inconsequential item, I'll make sure it doesn't cost so much.  Now, if this mom of 3 can find time, I'll see if there's a return policy.	
- 1	I got this as a gift back in January for my third child who was born in March, thankfully with a replacement warranty as this is getting sent back.  I was iffy since the reviews but my husband really thought this would be great due to features and especially distance.  Well, let me tell you this worked for awhile but as time went on it got worse and worse.  The distance you're lucky if it reaches 2 feet and the battery life is a joke.  This monitor constantly loses reception and when you turn it on it shows it is on but there is no sound, and this is when both units are plugged in.  You buy a monitor so you can safely monitor your child when they are sleeping, this will not happen with this piece of junk as you are lucky if it is truly on.  Stay away and do not take even if it is free.....	
- 1	worked great for about a minute....cons:cheaply madebattery dies super quickfoam breaks so easily...clip keeps falling off	
- 1	I recently bought this item thinking it would be ideal for my 2 month old daughter.  It was a complete waste of money. I actually threw it in the trash at an airport because I was tired of it.It's impossible to manage unless you're at home putting it on. In public it just rolls on the floor while you put it on, picking up all sorts of dirt and germs. You can't wrap it on when it's just you and your little one unless you have somewhere to put the baby. When it arrived, I practiced putting it on and tried the different styles.  My daughter was okay with being in it but certainly didn't love it.  I kept putting her in it at home to get used to it. She never did.Also, it does not fit in a diaper bag.  Forget trying to get it back in the little bag it comes in!  You can't wear it through airport security, so you have to wait to put it on.  It makes breastfeeding more difficult  because it takes up your entire chest.  (The breastfeeding hold doesn't make it easier.) It's so big and thick that it makes you hot.You'd be better off buying another sling/carrier that is smaller.  I wish I'd never bought one.	
1. 	These bibs are very liquid proof and perfect for rice cereal and baby food. The pocket catches most of the drips that the miniature human produces and, unless they tip it up or mess with it, that's where the food stays. The Dr. Seuss theme is very nice.	
1. 	I bought this product because I loved the look of it and needed a faucet cover since we are having a baby in just a few days. I thought the ducky and frog covers were bit tacky. As soon as I got home with this, I opened it up and stuck in on the faucet and filled it with bubbles. I love the waterfall and took a bath that night. I was having issues with the bubble dispense when I first put in super thick bubble bath. I then mixed the thick bubble bath with runnier bubble and it worked great. I do wish the bubble dispense worked a bit better as I am not 100% satisfied with it but still love it. It also does not slip off our faucet like some reviewers have complained about.	
1. 	We live in a windy and cold town, and the wind was always blowing my son's blanket off, as well as being bulky and annoying. This perfectly fit his Chicco Keyfit 30 seat, zips on, and kept him warm throughout rain/snow.	
1. 	This was our life saver for our sons first 9 months!!! We used this for ever bottle feeding. Our son was super comfortable and relaxed during feedings. Was especially great those first couple months during the night feedings. I could sit up in bed and feed on this him well I was still relaxed!!! The fleece cover is the best too. Super soft!!! The other covers feel kind of scratchy and are definetly not as soft as this one!!!!	
1. 	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.  I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.  It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!  Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!	
- 1	I thought I would love this bottle, but my baby and I both ended up not liking it much. The disc to help prevent leaking while shaking works, but then it's annoying if you are out and about because it's covered in milk and you can't just throw it in the diaper bag like you can with a lid for other bottles. Then, if your baby doesn't finish the bottle and you put the lid back on, it will leak unless you put the disc back in place. It also seemed to me that the measurements weren't very accurate on the side. Lastly, the flow of the nipple was always too fast or too slow for my baby. The nipple it came with became too slow for her, so I bought new nipples that were faster flow, but then she was drowning in milk and wouldn't eat.	
- 1	I've had this highchair for 7 months now and over the past 3 months my baby has really started to feed herself and make messes they way one year olds do. At first, I loved it for these reasons....PROS:-no tacky colors that make it an eye sore-the chair back has 3 positions to sit up or recline-the tray moves forward and back to adjust to baby's growing belly-the chair has height adjustment (even if it is hard to do for one person)-it rolls easily, even with a baby in the seat-has a crotch plate and adjustable harness for over the shoulders or just at the waist-foot plate for you and foot plate for the baby-infant cushions and harness straps go in the washerHowever, now that my little girl is feeding herself, and of course getting food everywhere, this thing is a major pain the butt to clean. There is a seam that runs along the middle of the main tray that food gets smushed in and it is impossible to clean this out, even with a toothpick. There are also areas on the baby footplate that you have to clean with a toothpick to get the food crammed in the little spots. The base that the chair itself slides up and down from also needs toothpick care to get food from the little spaces there! I can't tell you how annoying it is to have to use *toothpicks* to clean a highchair. What mother wants to detail a highchair with toothpicks after taking care of the baby all day and doing mountains of other cleaning all day long?On another note, my baby has never been injured from this chair; i.e. gotten her elbow stuck or something like that. If it weren't for all the stupid little cracks and crevices in the chair and the seam on the tray this chair would get at least 4 stars from me.****UPDATE****I have changed my 2 star rating to a 1 star because I am absolutely *sick* of cleaning this chair! I hate it. Hate it. Hate. it. I feel bad even trying to re-sell it b/c I know what a pain in the ass it is to clean. I'm going with a booster seat with removable tray now. We'll see how that goes.	
1. 	This sterilizer is so easy to use.  It has three adjustable racks for bottles, nipples or other items.  You just put water in the bottom, your bottles (rinsed with warm, soapy water) in the racks, put on the lid and press the button to start it.  It is done sterilizing within ten minutes.  You have to clean it every so often by running it with citric acid (or vinegar) in there and since it has a coil heater, it should be unplugged when not it use.  Basically, it requires very little maintenance when the alternative is boiling bottles on the stove which takes longer and your bottles may easily be ruined.  The bottles are usually still a bit wet when the sterilization cycle is done, but you can leave them in there to dry, or place them on paper towels (putting a paper towel over the top of the bottles helps keep them sterile).  The sterilizer also comes with little plastic tongs to grab things and keep them sterile, but I just use my clean hands and my baby has not had a problem.  I sterilize Avent and Medela products in it and I have been very happy with the effectiveness and ease of this sterilizer.	
1. 	People told us that this was a heavy car seat.. in truth.. they all are around the same weight --- it is the child who gets heavier... This has been a great item... Would use it again.	
- 1	We really hoped we'd like this swing, as it came highly recommended by several friends. Unfortunately, though, it seems like there was a lot of marketing hype, needless bells and whistles (sound, hanging toys, and the like), and the absence of a quality swinging mechanism.  This may well be true of other Fisher Price models with other designs.This swing is loud (though we may have been dealing with 2 defects, as a local display model was not as loud), and highly sensitive to whether or not it is perfectly level -- a problem when you're on carpet with pile.After our first unit made a terrible grinding noise out of the box, and would not swing well, we obtained a replacement.  While the replacement would run, it would not run consistently. It's frustrating when you're trying to deal with a screaming newborn and a swing that just won't get going at 3 A.M. when patience is thin (The voices inside your new-parent head may ask: Can I do this? I can't stop the crying, and I can't even make a simple swing work!).Other negatives to consider: You're dealing with 4 D batteries (only, no AC option), and you need to use a Phillips-head screwdriver (4 screws) to swap them.  There are other swings out there that offer an AC option.Pros: You can rotate to get swinging left to right or front to back. The Fisher Price assembly instructions are decent, and they included the hex tool required for assembly.In the end, we opted for a different brand.  If, however, you do opt for this swing (or one with a similar FP mechanism) SAVE THE BOX in case you find yourself at wits end.	
1. 	These cups have been perfect for my 1-year old son. I've tried just about every brand on the market & had issues with them all - they were either too small (didn't hold enough liquid), had parts that dislodged, leaked and/or started to fray at the spout when my son used/chewed them. Not these - they are a larger size than most, very durable, don't leak at all & were very easy for my son use. Highly recommend!	
1. 	This is a great gate for stairs!  We live in a 4 level split, and it allows us to keep our toddler in the upper level only and be safe.  The push-and-turn opening mechanism is very easy to use, but kids can't figure it out.  It swings in both directions (if you choose to set it up that way), and opens as easy as turning a doorknob.  The best thing about this gate is that when you're holding a kid in your arms, you just swing the gate closed, and it locks automatically when it's in place.  Also, if baby is sleeping, you can QUIETLY click the gate closed.  Very important!  We're very happy with this.	
- 1	When breastfeeding, these are highly recomended. The problem with a breastfeeding mom is, they do not fit standard US breast pumps. So basicly you have to pump into one bottle, then transfer into this one (this causes a problem for those of us who don't produce quite enough milk --- every drop that is lost in transfer is crutial). Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded! And there you are, wasted milk, and a hungry baby who is drenched, and really mad by the time you get another bottle ready and her clothes changed!!! The day I stopped breast feeding I switched to playtex vent aire, which only leak once in a blue moon, if you dont put it together right.	
- 1	We followed the instruction on charging but the hand held pretty much has to stay on the charger. Kinda defeats the purpose of us getting it.The camera is great. The nighttime vision is wonderful but the handheld is awful. At least ours it. We would return it but our little one didn't arrive until this month and our return option expired in January.	
- 1	Hard to read mark, my son was not able to get any milk out of the nipple, the nipple squeezes in every time he sucks on it.	
1. 	These are some heavy-duty plug covers, which is a good thing. I have twin boys who see everything as an interesting challenge, yet they can't get these covers out of the outlet. Sure, they take a couple moments for us adults to remove, but the benefit outweighs any silly impatience one might feel while wiggling the cover out. These are so much better than the old style plug covers, which my daughter used to just pluck right out of the outlet and put in her mouth.	
- 1	Our pediatrician told us to return this item due to the item being a danger to our child and bad for his physical development.	
1. 	This walker is great and my son loves it.. he can maneuver around in it very easily.. and the tray is great for letting him snack on cheereos.  The only reason I took a star away is because getting the seat and seat cushion in and out in order to wash is a pain.  It is so hard getting the straps inside and under the seat and reattached.. last time I broke a nail!  Other than that, it's a great walker!	
- 1	I thought this would be great to bring along to restaurants etc. but the suction only really works on completely smooth surfaces (like a mirror) and not any restaurant table I've tried so far. and because it is so top heavy it ends up on the floor in about 30 seconds.	
- 1	After using these cups for about 2 months with our 11 month son we discovered they are not completely coming clean. The nipple is designed with four long indentations that run the length of it and come to a dead end at the tip of the nipple spout. Those indentations will slowly accumulate debris from milk and the dishwasher. After noticing that the indentations were not coming clean I had to soak them for a long time to soften the deposits and then spend forever with a bottle brush to clean it out. You may be thinking that I should have just used the bottle brush all along and this would not have happened. However, even with a standard bottle brush or a straw brush the deepest part of the indentations is very hard, almost imposable to reach. Even if I had been hand washing these after every use over time there would still be an accumulation. I hate to think how long it took me to notice this huge design flaw and how many other parents will use these without ever realizing that the nipples are not completely clean! I would not recommend purchasing this product. I am now tossing all of these cups and purchasing new cups. If you are in the market for a cup I would recommend:NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner CupThis cup has a far superior design and comes with handles.	
1. 	I needed bibs that did not soak through to my teething baby's shirt. These are THIN, but EFFECTIVE. There is a middle layer of plastic, but both sides are terry so it's soft. They never soak through, and are worth the money. I save all of our other bibs for eating (fruits & veggies make a mess!) then I take them off and put one of these on for play time, they last throughout the day. These will be one of the things I give at baby showers from now on!	
- 1	I used this product for the first time today and it is already packed to be returned. After one use following the instructions to clean the sterilizer prior to first use, the metal heating bottom part turned brown in two spots and created a strange burnt plastic smell. I saw on previous reviews that this tends to happen after a few months, but I didn't expect it on first use. Will stick to the microwave steam sterilizer which doesnt create a smell or a fire hazard. BEWARE!	
- 1	I thought this bottle looked cute, and it seemed easier to clean.  My son did use it, but I found several issues with using it.  There is no good way to warm with a bottle warmer.  If you put it in the warmer with the cap on,  the cap will fill with formula.  If you put it in upright without the cap, the bottom opens up and spills into the warmer.  Trying to mix formula in the bottle also didn't work well.  Even with the cap on liquid leaks out of the nipple.  Because of this, even filling the bottle with ready made formula is messy.  I was very disappointed and returned this bottle.  I'll stick with my Soothies.	
1. 	It is a bit small but overall good. I like the feel of it. Feels sturdy/ good quality and easy to clean or use. Also soft, lightweight and portable. Enables the baby to sit upright and comfortably as well. Product should only be used once baby can support his or her head. The bumbo has won many international awards and I can see why. Would make a nice gift for a new mother or for your baby. Bumbo also donates nearly 100 percent of profits to charity.Toilet trainer, seat cover, play tray sold separately. 4 stars.	
- 1	Why bother?!  Elastic came off of these things numerous times, and some of the inserts arrived with dirt marks.  Flip covers have too many large, hard snaps that can press against baby's skin.  Sizing is limited for thick prefold diapers (mine were organic unbleached) because it only works as a small and medium cover; legs openings are too tight with prefold diapers.  Shape has a large waist and narrow hips - bizarre.  Cover is thick polyester and not breathable, so it overheats.  The inserts were thick with a synthetic side and worthless - resembles a thick feminine menstrual pad in which poo could slide off once you pick it up.  Elastic is only on back, so the stiff cover (which doesn't stretch much) on the front will not expand or stretch when baby is sitting.  This would be funny if it were a movie, but it's really a Flippin' nightmare!	
1. 	Kid gets to have a tumbler like mom and dad.  Great playtex quality and design.  Love this.  Will grow with my child and will be using for a long time since the design is not babyish.	
1. 	We love this tub and so does our daughter! I read the reviews on this and we are so glad we recieved this as a gift. The tub has been great since she was a newborn, and weighed in at 7 lbs. 11 oz. She fits great in the contoured area and the water level is sufficient to keep her warm and happy during bathtime. We originally bought one of the sponge teddy bear pads to put her on inside the tub, but found it unecessary and uncomfortable for her because she was now out of the water too much. Instead to make the plastic where she lays a little comfier we put in a hand towel to lay on. We are extremely happy with this tub and would have rated it five stars, except for the fact that it is HUGE. It is very hard to find anywhere to store this monstrous tub after the bath when it is damp. That said, the fact that it is so big allows two parents to enjoy giving the bath together to the little one, and allows for the deepness of the water a tradeoff you'll have to decide on.	
- 1	My 10 month old soaks through every diaper.  Thought I would try thick cloth diapers, but to no avail.  Must have some sort of vinyl cover to go over.  I can't stand the vinyl covers since they don't breathe.  That is just a perfect environment for a rash.	
- 1	I bought both these and Spasilk (which are much cheaper). The price was not a big deal for me, but I can hardly tell the difference between the 2 brands now. Satsuma is a bit softer, but it does not matter to me or the baby!	
1. 	What I liked:Firm and has kept it's shape. Provides support for the back. Like the pocket. Great for just having baby sleep in one's lap while reading a book. Simple to adjust the straps.What I didn't like:Could only use it in the cradle-hold position. Had to use pillows for all other positions. Depending on your body's proportions, you still might need a pillow placed under My Breast Friend to bring the baby high enough to the level of your breasts - I did.Great for use while sitting in the bed, on the floor or in a nursing chair but not in a regular recliner/lazyboy - the front slopes up because of the chair's incline.Why the four stars: Overall, would buy it again even though a bit pricey. I had the navy-blue fabric with white flowers - the color bleeds a fair amount initially, beware!Take it to the hospital with you. And if this is your first time, please see a Lactation Consultant/attend a local La Leche League meeting.	
1. 	This was a big hit with both my boys (4&1) they were fighting over it when it arrived and still love it	
- 1	do not buy this potty chair simply for the bells and whistles  they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time.  I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes, my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on.  The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys, but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in.  I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front, rather than underneath, it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out.  There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat.  If I had to do it all again, I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too!	
1. 	The design of these spoons is really great - the handle is perfect for hands that are still learning accuracy of motion. Our son began feeding himself with this spoon after just a couple of feedings. Really worked great!	
1. 	This stroller frame is easy to use, light, folds nicely, has a big storage basket and navigates well.  I highly recommend getting this to use with your infant carrier vs. a travel system.	
1. 	These are fun and fabulous!When you start introducing solids, you can put chunks of juicy food in these bags and let your baby go to town. Watermelon is the best! And they're safe - you, as the parent, get to relax for a moment or two while your baby gets to go to town on something tasty and new! The closure is very strong - our kid never got them open by herself.Teething or a super-hot day? I put ice in it. (supervision is required for all baby feeding!)Peaches, bananas, plums, melons, anything squishy and juicy! Keep the camera ready too!	
- 1	This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks	
1. 	These are a great quality toddler bib and we have a lot - everyone should have them in both long and short sleeve!	
- 1	Highly disappointed that most of the stickers did not stay on the wall. Some did, most didn't. Our walls aren't extremely textured either...so I would suggest going with a different product.	
1. 	With having to shake formula in the bottle on the go these do the trick beautifully.  No milk seeps out the sides when shaking.	
- 1	Our 6 month old boy is tall for his age, but I really thought that this seat would've accommodated him for longer.  In some ways I'm glad he outgrew it because he always seemed uncomfortable in this seat.  He was always smashed in there sitting awkwardly.The car seat is too heavy for me to carry with one hand which means when leaving the house, first I have to bring my diaper bag to the car and then come back in the house for the baby in his car seat.The fabric is polyester, gets burning hot in summer.  The ear flaps also get hot.Our 6 month old hates his seat so much that I avoid driving in the car altogether.At the end of the day, the Peg Perego is about the most uncomfortable seat you could ever force a baby into.	
1. 	This base easily converted my Evenflo Embrace 35 into a sturdy stroller.It's easy to assemble. It took me less than five minutes out of the box with no instructions required.It's easy to use. More easy to store, carry and transport than any stroller system I've used. I've found it much more practical than the combination stroller car seat systems that I've used in the past and much more affordable.It looks great. Once paired with the carseat, it doesn't look any different than any other infant stroller.I would buy again or purchase as a gift.	
- 1	These little musical instruments are simply not worth it.  They are cheap, they don't make much sound and honestly were a waste of money.  They are not infant or toddler friendly either.	
1. 	When my daughter outgrew her infant tub, we went through a few different devices to try to give her a safe bath. She is VERY active so she doesn't like to sit for very long. We first tried the bath ring, that was a disaster. This snug tub has worked wonderfully. She is able to stand in it and splash around without us worrying about her breaking her head if she slips. It's very safe and fits snugly in our shower. I highly recommend this tub, especially if you have toddler who won't sit through baths!	
1. 	I was a little skeptical when ordering these because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I went with my instinct and got them. My baby's nursery currently has all cherry furniture with green/pink decorations and I wanted something that would make it pop so we decided to get white wicker baskets that would fit on her changing table and make it stand out. I was a bit concerned about the sticky and smelly paint that a few reviews mentioned but fortunately/lucky for us, mine did not have that problem. Mine came packaged nicely with no broken pieces and as white as can be and without any messy sticky/smelly paint. The sizes are perfect to put diapers, wipes, lotions or whatever you need at hand for baby and all three fit on the same shelf. (I've uploaded a pic) I think I may eventually decide to change the liners but for now we're going to use the ones that came with it.	
1. 	This is a great starter kit. It comes with plenty of bottles and extra nipples. Prior to these we used Dr Brown bottles. Everyone we knew used those and raved about the Dr Brown bottles. I thought they were great but they were tedious to clean. It had a bunch of parts and little nooks and crannies to clean. These playtex were a lot easier and faster to clean and gave me great results. Babies fussiness did not change and it was like we never took him out of the Dr Brown bottles. The way the bottle is shaped is great too. It makes it easier holding the bottle too. Overall I think these are great bottles compared to the Dr Brown ones.	
1. 	These have a baby powder scent to them and work fantastic in holding #2 diapers! They are a great deal for 200 count (you can compare them to others that come in a roll and these are by far much, much better). I would only use these when baby had a soiled diaper, but am now learning that they can hold 4-5 diapers at once, so I dispose of #1 diapers in these as well then tie up the sack and throw it in the garbage. I can really tell a difference with the way the bathroom smells now! For getting so much use out of each one, I think the price is unbeatable. I keep a stash of these in the diaper bag as well for use on the go :) So glad I found these on Amazon! I would definitely recommend them.	
1. 	Got this in the color ice for my Chicco Liteway Stroller. Fits just fine even with the hood on..easy to install and just what I needed for my toddler. She's all warm and snug bundled up in here and I have no need for extra blankets. Even though its water resistant, I will still pair it with a rain cover for windy days..	
- 1	First of all, I thought the steering wheel was cute. It was advertised as having flashing lights & music, and it looked cute from the box. BUT, no one can get to let alone change the battery, the seat has tiny plastic pieces that slide into place to hold it in, and they don't really want to stay that way. The flashing lights didn't work, then did, and now they don't, and we just bought this yesterday. For the brief what, 3 minutes the lights started working. The music was loud and painful. The lights feature is 2 small red flashing lights on the steering wheel. *so disappointed.It isn't designed well, and it doesn't function properly. It can actually be used as a walker, and it is cute, but we are certainly taking this back.	
- 1	We have a ton of MAM binks but these are the only style that have caused us issues. I wash my little ones pacifiers according to the packaging. These pacifiers develop mold and gunk inside the silicone pacifier tip. I have never had any of the other styles do this - but ALL of my MAM air variety have done this.I do not recommend this variety of binks for your little one. Mine only takes MAM pacifiers and I am unsure why but this variety does not drain after washing. I recommend you avoid it. I did not contact customer service but instead use their other varieties and I highly recommend the other MAM styles.	
1. 	I received this for a baby shower and I love it. It works fast so my baby doesn't get upset. I even went back and bought another one to keep in the diaper bag.	
- 1	Our baby hated it with a vicious passion.  For starters...it was difficult to turn on understanding that it was a 3 second hold the depressed button was difficult to get a finger to press.  Once on, the first setting seemed fine but we discovered that it vibrates way too fast for our baby's comfort...in detail, the item vibration increased with mattress pressure and caused baby to stay wide awake and scream as though an earthquake was happening...there's a song that has lyrics that fit it soooo well...she started crying and sounded like an earthquake.  This item will most definitely be baby specific so do not be discourage when they cry more with this thing, just remove it and all will back to normal in no time...they simply may not like it at all due to it's fast vibration.  I test things like this for baby on myself and if I absolutely hate it...being soo much smaller, they may feel the same and for sure. I placed it under a pillow beneath my head and this thing shook my brain in my skull, chattered my teeth and was uncomfortable so I understand where she may be coming from with her anger when we tried it out.	
- 1	This kit works fine with both the Ameda Purely Yours pump (which I have at home) as well as Medela pump connectors (which I use for the hospital grade breast pumps they have at work; to my knowledge these are the same as the Pump in Style). It allows you to pump milk into a Playtex drop-in bottle liner with the adapter, and cap it off and store it in the fridge or freezer until milk is used. You can then screw the liner directly onto a drop-in bottle, screw the nipple on top, and feed. The package contains six ring sets (so you can store up to six bottle liners of milk at a time) and two adapters (so you can double pump into two liners at once).I got this set hoping to use it for pumping/storing milk at work to make bottles for day care the next day, as we use the Playtex drop-in bottles with our baby. However, after a couple of weeks, I learned that it doesn't have as practical of an application as hoped. First, it is more difficult to tell how much you have pumped at most as it is using a standard pump kit bottle due to the difficult to read labels on the liner. Also, I sometimes manage to pump more milk from one side in a session than a 4 oz liner can hold (I have only used 4 oz liners with this kit) - and it is not efficient to switch sides or liners in the middle of a pumping session when that happens. I think storing milk liners from which you plan to feed is only practical if you have an amount your baby will fully eat in one sitting, so you don't have to switch liners/add more milk mid-feed. Most of the time, I don't pump a full feeding from one breast, requiring me to pour milk from one liner to the other - which is difficult to do from drop-in liners, and really isn't any more efficient than just pouring milk from the pump bottles into a liner. Finally, our day care provides bottles/liners and is very flexible with however we wish to bring in milk - so I have concluded that just bringing in capped bottles is much easier and more efficient than trying to use liners with this kit. When I freeze milk, I prefer storage bags to bottle liners since I can freeze them flat, which makes them more compact to store in our freezer and they thaw more quickly.I have had some problems with leakage when the bottle liners are stored upside down (as instructed on the package), but I think this was limited to a kit I bought and ran through the dishwasher. I don't think I've had leakage problems with the liners that have only been washed by hand. So I do not recommend running the kit pieces through the dishwasher. Bottle liners can be stored upright to prevent leakage, but only on a flat/smooth surface.	
1. 	I can not say enough about this product.  My little one liked to be swaddled.  It gave my husband and I (any my little one too) the gift of many hours of extra sleep.  Without M.B-->she would sleep 4 hours max.  With M.B.-->10+.  (DID YOU SEE THAT!  MORE THAN 6+ hours extra in a row!)  As a working couple...that was priceless.  It was a sad day when she outgrew it.  She is verrrrrrrry long and grew out of it at ~4 mo. which is about when they should be transitioned to free-style sleeping (as I have been told anyway.)I buy this for all my expecting friends.P.S. Ignoring the 'straight-jacket' comments will be easy with all the extra rest you will be getting!	
1. 	They do their job of cleaning out all the holes and crevasses of those darned Dr. Browns bottles.  These bottles really are great for keeping gas and reflux to a minimum, but boy are the a pain to clean.  You can't clean them without these things (and shouldn't, because if you don't get every crevasse, ick will build up on the tan colored plug thing especially - talk about nasty germies!) so buy a pack or two today!	
1. 	yep....mommy got some help. Our toddler liked to lick the outlets so yep, we freaked out! We got thius right away andc they are perfect. Hard to take off,even for me!thank you mommy helper ... u sure helped me!	
1. 	When the doc told us to put cereal in his bottle, we couldn't have lived without the level 3's.  They are the only one with a hole big enough to get the thicker liquid through.	
- 1	I registered for this mirror to use in the car while my baby is in a rear facing car seat.  It gave me peace of mind to glance back and see that baby is ok.  But, in the first week after my son was born, we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected/installed correctly.  The police officer did a wonderful job securing our car seat, instructing us on the safest way to bundle baby in the winter, etc.  But he was adamant that child view mirrors are a safety hazard.  He said that in a severe impact, the mirror could detach and become a projectile object that could hit the baby.  Even though the mirror is break resistant, it could still cause injury if it came flying at his head.As for using a mirror to check on the baby while driving, the officer also mentioned that if you think the baby is in distress, the best thing to do is to pull over.  If you are looking at the baby in the child view mirror, you are not looking at the road (his words, not mine).  He then went on to advise against other things we had in our car, like the sun shade, and a couple of car seat toys (all can become projectile in an impact).So, as a first time mom, I was probably a little paranoid.  And I'm sure he was just doing his job to warn me about possible safety risks. But sure enough, he managed to put the fear of God in me, and I went home and stripped the car of everything that could potentially hurt the baby (my husband thought I was nuts).  Now the only thing we have in the backseat with the car seat is a foam squishy toy that hangs off the back seat - safe during an impact.Now we've been 6 months without a child safe mirror.  There are times when I wish I had one.  And once I even did pull over to make sure that my son was ok.  But, I've gotten used to NOT having this mirror.  So, even though the mirror was a comfort in the 4 days we got to use it, I'm glad we're not taking any chances.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this item. It's made by Fisher-Price which generally means it will stand the test of time. It is bright and colorful and has cute zoo animals on the front which caught my attention at the very least. However, I really wish I had gone with the Baby Einstein mirror or really any other mirror over this one for a few reasons I will outline below.PROS:1) It's bright and pretty2) The songs are entertaining and the lights are cool. The music plays for approximately 10 minutes.3) It has a setting to control lights and music, music only, etc. very handy.4) The mirror part is large--which should help you see your baby better.5) It comes with a remote control so you can turn the sounds on or off from the front seat (see cons--important)CONS:1) The single most annoying thing about this mirror is its lack of stability. It has velcro straps to secure it into place onto your headrest. Sounds good, right? Well the way it has the velcro, if you hit one little tiny bump (say a speed bump or a pothole) the entire mirror shifts and suddenly moves out of place. In a nutshell, it is not very secure. In order to make it truly secure you need better straps or more velcro, or ... something.  It is a terrible design with how they put the straps in the first place.2) The remote is a GREAT idea... only problem is, it works when it wants to. Sometimes the remote works, but 75% of the time, it doesn't no matter how many times you hit the giant button. You should see me, driving down the freeway, holding my hand out behind me trying all kinds of different angles to get the music to turn back on. Up, down, side, upside down--nope nothing. Then I'll wait a few minutes and try it again, and it will randomly work. Oh and they put the sensor to the remote control on the BOTTOM of the mirror, so if you have a high seat or the angle of the mirror is at an odd angle to where you are sitting (so you can see the baby better), you won't hit the sensor. I should note that this is NOT the problem with the remote--I will literally hold the remote next to the mirror when we are stopped and it still suffers from the same problem of working when it wants to.3) The music -- Okay on one hand, playing for 10 minutes is awesome--until it stops. If the remote worked correctly, then you could start it up again and everyone is happy. Instead, my daughter has meltdowns on the freeway when the music stops and I can't get it to start back up again because I'm in traffic and pulling over just to check on her and restart the toy takes away the whole point of having the mirror in the first place. Worse, 90% of the time, I've hit a bump in the road or changed lanes, and the mirror is out of place, so I have no way of knowing if the baby is crying because there is something genuinely wrong or because she's upset the music stopped. Very frustrating.Ultimately, I really regret spending the money on this. I really wanted to like it, but now I'm wishing I bought the Baby Einstein one instead (which you can control how long the music plays for). Instead, I'll probably break down and go pick up some velcro strips to try and make the mirror at least stay put. I would suggest you try it before you buy it and see if it works in your car for you. Maybe you'll have better luck ...	
1. 	As they should be. They work and have all the necessary features. Really not that much to say about them.	
- 1	Pros:-Inexpensive-2 parent units-Good sound qualityCons:-Battery life is aweful - turned off completely, the battery didn't even hold a charge a day.  When on, maybe got a couple of hours tops - nowhere near the 9hrs claimed.-Frequently lost connection at seemingly random times.  It does beep to let you know it's lost connection which is helpful but also very annoying as it would happen half a dozen or more times per day.  You need to power off the unit, power back on and it will reestablish connection which is very tedious.  Range didn't seem to make any difference and my setup is definitely on the low end of the range scale (30-50ft max). After reading other reviews this issues doesn't seem to be isolated but a frequent occurence with this model.Overall, the 2 cons make this product unfit for its intended purpose. Fortunately Amazon is great about returns and I was able to return 6 months later no questions asked.	
- 1	My 1 year old daughter just does not like this toy. I have tried everything to make it fun and it just isn't. Also it does have a moth ball odor which I personally have a low tolerance for.	
1. 	After they outgrow the infant tub this is awesome. We had it for our first and got rid of it thinking we weren't having more. But we had another one and had to have this tub again. It will last well until he is 2 and works wonderfully.	
1. 	I had purchased the soothing dreams monitor ... and the sound quality was so bad I took it back.  This monitor doesn't have all the neat features that the soothing dreams did, but it does something the other didn't - it WORKS!  The sound quality is wonderful.  You can hear the faintest noise in the baby's room, or keep the volume down and just see the lights.  This monitor is really the best as far as sound quality goes, and the low price is definitely a bonus!  Don't waste your money on a monitor with more frills that doesn't work as well - this is all you need!!!	
- 1	I ordered this to transition my baby from a bottle to a zippy cup...needless to say this one did not do or work very well! The handles are too close together and my child can't grasp it and drink at the same time...it would be better if the handles were more far apart. Also, my little girl did not like the nubby nipples. I guess they were too big for her and she just didn't like it. Going to try another brand!	
1. 	I ordered this play yard with the rainbow 5/8 play mat for my 5 month old son.  This play yard (in the hexagon shape) fits perfectly on the mat and I even have 6 puzzle pieces left over.  The only thing is the yard does slide a bit on the mats.  The walls of the yard are a little hard to get apart and together but not impossible.  Once together you just snap around the walls at the angle you need.  The instructions only recommend having the yard in a square or hexagon shape.  I was a little disappointed but it makes sense - any other configuration and the yard may become unsteady and easily tip over if not properly secured.  I'm also a little concerned about the diamond griding of the yard walls - hopefully my son does not try to climb up them when he's older.  It also hard to see out when in the play yard - the fine mesh of our pack n play is much easier to see in/out of.  I noticed this because when I call his name he has a hard time finding me, but in the pack n play he finds me right away.  I guess maybe bars would be better for both these reasons (can't climb and easier to see) but the ones I've seen are pricey.  Overall I give the yard 4 stars.  It's just what I expected and works well for us.	
1. 	This bottle is by far the best bottle I have ever used. I've bought the long skinny Dr Brown's bottles but much prefer the wide neck. One of the advantages for me, these are so much easier to clean than the others. I used the regular Gerber bottles with my first, Advent with my second and tried Advent & Soothie brand with my 3rd with no success. My 3rd has bad gas & reflux, she also wasn't digesting her food properly our doctor suggested Dr Brown's and I was hesitant at first simply because I did not want to wash all those extra parts. C'mon having 3 kids who has time for dishes. I decided to go ahead and quit being stingy on my part and get them for my daughter, what a lifesaver! These bottles were terrific, along with a hypo-allergenic formula and these bottles she could actually eat without screaming in pain & sleep like a peaceful baby. I would recommend Dr Brown's to anyone and after awhile washing the bottles/extra parts becomes second nature and really isn't so bad when your babies are happy & healthy.	
- 1	This was the only cover I could find for this size changing pad.  While it fits, it's not a comfortable fit.  It does make the pad buckle, which happens because the pad is thin, but that's what fits on my changing table.  I would recommend to the manufacture to not make the elastic so tight, or just have the elastic on the corners or ends of the sheet.	
1. 	These travel caps are perfect for bottles on the go. We've never had a leak using these bottle caps, and it's our third time around for Dr Brown bottles.	
1. 	This product was silly to me until my husband insisted me to put on up on my baby registry. I thought it would be silly to just throw away dirty diapers in there where I could just throw it in the trash can to save money. Then again, it was very useful since I have it next to the changing table. One, its holds seal tight of no smell in the baby bedroom. Two, no mess. Three, its very easy to use (all you need is to roll the handle back to dump the diaper and there it goes with a section for your next diaper). Well, my husband and I are very happy to get this in the mail.EDITED: 1/9/06At first I said it was great. But now I'm saying it stinks. It smells after about 3 months if you dont clean the champ itself. Such a hastle right? I think so, so I am going to recomment this item from great diaper champ to NOT SO GREAT DIAPER CHAMP. It's good only for wet diapers not DIRTY DIAPERS! if you dont mind washing the champ once in a while so that it wont stink up your nursery room. I still think old fashion trash can with a lid do much better cause one you know its full, you will throw the trash away. Im giving this a 1 start out of 5 stars.	
- 1	I bought these containers thinking they'd be great to supplement our OXO and Nuk baby food storage containers (we make and store our own baby food and bring it back and forth to daycare, so we use a lot of containers). And they were great -- once.  After one washing virtually none of the lids ever formed a strong seal on its matching container again.  I've given them a few tries even after discovering that the lids don't stay on -- when all of my other containers are in use -- and each time the result has been baby food or yogurt spilled all over the inside of our baby's lunch box.  I think the issue is that the cup units warp.  Whatever the reason, don't buy these.  There are much, much better options out there.	
1. 	Love love love these Blankets!  They wash up well & are so practical.... they can be used in multiple ways.  I've given them as gifts and everyone loves them.  Much larger than the average flannel receiving blankets that you buy in the stores.  Everyone should have at least two!	
- 1	This product is either defective or not very effective. We don't use it very often because the smell seeps out and makes the nursery smell foul. Like I said, mine could be defective because the diapers don't go all the way down into the unit unless you push them and the lid sits kinda funny. Unfortunately you can't return items past a certain time frame with amazon so I wouldn't buy it before the baby is born (like I did). I would probably just pass on this one as there are sooo many other things to buy when getting ready for a baby.	
1. 	Wow, we received this as a shower gift and never dreamed how much our baby would love it.  He loves to hop and jump and dance in this thing and can make it turn in whatever direction he needs. So cute! He also likes the fact that it gives him better access to the dog!We love this product!	
1. 	These are great.  I would rather spend a small amount of money on buying these to put on my Avent bottles than a lot more on sippy cups.  They just fit to your regular Avent bottles easily.  They can go in the dishwasher too, and my son is just starting to hold his own bottle and he loves it.  He can't grasp the entire bottle so these are ideal.  What a great idea combined with the no spill teats he is catered for until he go to a sports bottle and cup.  Love them.	
1. 	Like another reviewer, I picked these up for only $8 at TJ Maxx. They have been selling tons of Boon products lately, which is great! My daughter loved these immediately. The pieces are a good size, interesting blob shapes, and cool colors (includes brown, teal, mustard, etc. in addition to your typical baby primaries). She loves standing up in the bath now (eek!) and sticking these to the wall. They stay on well with very little pressure and water. She has been chewing on them too, and has yet to tear one, so they seem quite durable. They show some teeth marks, but that's it. The scrubbies are a little rough to actually wash a baby with (stick to a washcloth), but they are another tactile item to explore. The balls in the new sets (shiny vs. matte) are PVC-free, and daughter also loves chewing on those. So does the dog for that matter, she's gotten a hold of and destroyed two! Overall, I'd highly recommend them, but try to find them on sale :)	
1. 	I ordered two (2) set of bottles (two 4oz bottles and two 8oz bottles), each set came with one natural flow cleaning brush in them. So I really didnt need to buy these separately it seems. However, the more the merrier I suppose.... haven't had my baby as yet, so i have not actually used it but it looks okay so far	
1. 	These plugs are nice and tight.  My daughter cannot get them out of the outlets.  I also love the affordable price.  Would definitely recommend to others.	
- 1	There is only a small timeframe that this tub is super useful during. When my son was first born, he was too light to push the sling down into the water, so as I was pouring water over him, he was getting goosebumps since he couldnt be semi-submerged. He was born at 8.5 pounds. Now, he is 4 months and about 15 pounds, and is pushing the sling down a little better, so it is working out fine for now. I foresee as he starts getting more and more mobile, that I am going to have trouble keeping him on the sling, because he is already wiggling quite a bit and isn't even sitting up yet. The sling is not adjusteable, but does come off and is washable. It is easy to rinse and get all of the soap off of him with the sling tho, and he seems pretty comfy for now... but as I am looking at the design a little closer, for later use that is, there is a huge plastic BUMP in the middle of the tub, I'm assuming to assist your little one when they start sitting up, but it looks so uncomfortable, and I'm reading everyone elses reviews about how their babies aren't able to stay supported by the bump. What I am thinking that I will try when my son gets to this point is a folded up bath towel completely underneath his butt, for comfort, and grip so he doesn't slide under the water or something. The little plug at the bottom changes from blue to white when the water is too hot, so that's a pretty nifty feature, and I like the side pockets for his baby wash and rinsing cup. Now behind where your baby's head would go, there are two other pockets that I am assuming are to prevent overfilling the tub. Well they defeat the purpose because they don't drain... They hold water, which collects soap residue, so that next time you fill the tub, that old dirty bath water that has been sitting there is now in the tub with your baby. You would have to turn the whole thing upside down after every bath, and who has time for that while you are trying to deal with drying off and watching your baby? I drilled holes in the bottom of these two pockets so that they now work properly. I really wish I would have purchased a different baby tub, but there are good features, and things can be done to make this tub more functionable.UPDATE: Just as predicted, my son is now 5 months old and was too heavy for the sling. He still isn't sitting unassisted yet, and this tub is a NIGHTMARE at this stage. He freaks out a little when the water begins to pool in the tub, and holds his breath while wiggling, and floats right up out of the little contoured spot for their bottoms. So then, the hump in the middle of the tub is jabbing him in the middle of his back and he is just floating in this awkward little bath tub! I refuse to fill it at all now, even though I never leave my son's side through the bath, but it just isn't safe at all! I'm lowering this one star. And the towel idea I had before DID NOT work at all. It just clogged the tub to where it didnt drain, and when my son floats up, the towel does too. Hectic bath time!	
1. 	This warmer has lasted us through hundreds of bottles and jars of food - I had no idea it would be so useful when I bought it!It's small, easy to use, and heats bottles and food exactly the way my son likes them, because I can add whatever amount of water I need.  This is much more water-conserving than heating water in the microwave and then putting the bottle in it - the warmer only uses a few teaspoons.  And it heats FAST!This makes a very economical and thoughtful baby gift - I have already purchased two for friends.	
1. 	We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!	
- 1	This was not meant for a car window. Maybe would work better in a truck or SUV. I had to angle this and it really didn't work all that well anyway. I just didn't have time to return it so I had to make due. It finally fell apart the other day and I gave it and tossed it in the trash. I'll try again soon.	
- 1	We initially really liked the changing pad, but after about a week's worth of regular use (5-8 times a day) the outside ripped where the velcro is sewn in. We also found that the plastic that the baby is changed on stains very easily. It's a good size, but poor quality, someone didn't think the design through	
- 1	They break easily (never ask a man to fill these)! You can't put them in the microwave to unthaw. Useless.	
- 1	They warp, turn all sorts of odd shades and leak like crazy, save your money!	
1. 	This is a great mini crib for the price, and beautiful.  We like that it fits into our master bedroom, as a full-size crib would not.  It's also pretty lightweight.  Our twins are not here yet, so this crib has not been kid-tested yet, but it looks sturdy and solid.  Pieces attach very firmly together.  I gave the crib 4 stars instead of 5 only because the assembly kit was missing one of the specialized bolts, so we had to call the company to get one shipped to us.  They did send us more (several actually), but it took a couple weeks to get them.  Luckily, we were not assembling at the last minute, so it wasn't a big deal.  We would buy this again.	
1. 	We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!	
1. 	I love this sling when I need a quick and easy option for carry my baby when I'm out and about.  It fits her better now that she's older (4.5 months) than when she was tiny (I preferred my moby-style wrap then) and it's comfortable for me as well.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the amount of threads that are left at the end of every row of stitching--a higher-quality product would have gone back to trim these, but instead there are little 1/8-1/4 left overs all over it.  It doesn't detract from the appearance unless you're up close and picky like me, and it's not unraveling or affecting the functionality--but I keep meaning to go back to it and trim all over.  Lovely color though, and overall I enjoy this product =)	
1. 	When researching diaper pails for our baby, I'd heard a lot of negatives about the original Diaper Genie, but the reviews here were good about the new model, so I decided to give it a try. I've used it for 5 months now and have had no reason to try a different brand. The Diaper Genie II is easy to use, it keeps the stink in the bag, and the refill cassettes are widely available in retail stores. It's done everything I expected it to do.	
1. 	I was (possibly needlessly) a little concerned about some of our small lightweight bottles flying around the dishwasher. The deep basket easily holds a few of our 4-6 ounce bottles, keeping them in place and upright. I love washing pacifiers in the bottom section of the two-part basket. I ordered a second set. Love them.	
1. 	I ordered these to use with my Harmony manual pump and they fit great.  I realized I needed a smaller flange when my nips bothered me after pumping for only a couple of days with the 24mm flanges that come with the Harmony.  Well since using these 21mm flanges, I've had no problems.If pumping is irritating you, try this size. Chances are you may need to go down, and not up!	
1. 	We loved this booster seat so much we bought a second one for our second child. It is easy to snap on to any seat available, and super easy to clean. We have put our 5 month old in it a few times, and she is easily supported by the back and tray to sit up in the seat for a few minutes at a time. We love that we don't have to lug around a big, bulky high chair, as we don't have much floor space in our dining area, so a booster seat was a great option for us! Definitely recommend this seat to anyone wanting to save some floor space!	
1. 	We have very drooly 8 month old teething twins. Regular bibs weren't catching all of the drool, but these have been great! All of the colors allow for matching to their outfits (which isn't important but a nice touch). Would definitely recommend!	
1. 	With baby #2 arriving we pulled out all the Dr. Brown bottles but had used the cleaning brushes they originally came with. 2 packages of these later and we're in shape. Great for cleaning all the little pieces and useful for sippy cups with straws too- bottle brushes never can clean those.	
- 1	Ok, two stars because yes most of the time it warms the bottle. But this thing gets mold so quickly it's ridiculous. And the mold smells, and then you try to warm a bottle and the steam spreads this stinky mold almost foot like smell.  We clean it with vinegar, we set it open and upside down to dry, we never leave the water reservoir full and it still gets moldy. Isn't intense steam supposed to kill mold spores? Isn't that why my sterilizer uses steam to sterilize? Or is my sterilizer (also a Dr. Brown product) a piece of junk as well?I'm kind of worried about giving baby a bottled warmed in a moldy pit so I warm a bottle and then switch it to a dry sterilized bottle, which takes time.Also not always but sometimes the water doesn't leave the reservoir and you have to shake it to get the water in to the warmer. I rarely use it for these reasons, baby just needs to get used to cold bottles. It's easier to warm the milk up in my hands.	
- 1	Pros:Digital temperature gauge is very helpful in setting the correct water temperature.Overall size and design. Looks nice.The sponge insert works well on a newborn.Cons:The blue valves at the bottom of the tub in the area where the baby sits does not seem to close properly and hence water leaks through it.  By the time the bath is done, there is a lot of dirty water on my counter since the water keeps on leaking.The water also leaks from the clean water compartment, but at a slower speed compared with when it leaks from the dirty water compartment.Note: I was not able to fit this inside my bathroom sink.  So, I had to use this on the counter.Overall I am not as happy with this purchase, since, I was expecting a better quality product for the price I paid.	
- 1	Boutht this for my twins.  It ends up just sitting around. It's very heavy so not really something they like to play with.  The plastic is hard to so they have smacked it on their heads.  There are plenty of other teethers out there that are softer/lighter.  Not something I would recommend	
1. 	I have to clean mine about once a week with using it for both of my boys. I really love this chair and we take it with us everywhere. It doesn't fit tables that have a leaf stored underneath it, which has been inconvenient.	
1. 	These cots are really convenient. My 2 year old has used one and my 5 year old has used one. NO complaints. Slept just fine using these at grandmas house.	
1. 	So my baby was very frustrated when she was in that awkward &#34;I don't want to lay down but I don't have the physical capacity to sit up yet&#34; phase. It's the phase I hit after 4 glasses of wine. She hit it at 3 months. I brought this with us everywhere we traveled, my dad found it hilarious, called it a baby container. This nest propped her up and gave me a break, she loved sitting in it I would haul it into the bathroom and I could take a shower. A shower! Thank you Galt, my husband thanks you as well. I was getting pretty desperate. And stinky.  Once she got the knack of sitting up and crawling I stopped relying on it so heavily. But, still a nice spot for her to relax when she first wakes up, she's 9 months now and she likes to look at the animals and recline in it. It looks so cozy, I want one in my size. It's bright, colorful, very high quality fabric. This is a very well made and amazing product, those Germans, they know how to make nice things.	
- 1	You don't know how much you hate a particular car seat until you try a better one.I absolutely hate this car seat. I know that it is a good safe seat, but it was so unpleasant to use!  The lower sides are high, so I always had to lift my son up over the sides, and it was hard for him to climb in on his own.  He also couldn't really see out.The absolute worst part of this seat, though, are the straps.  They seemed to always be tangled.  When your child is squirming and doesn't want to be buckled in and you are endlessly fishing around for the straps and trying to get them untwisted it seems to take forever!  Add it very hot temperatures or cold temperatures or a sick child, or any kind of rush at all...and you want to throw the entire seat out the window.  I was so frustrated by this seat.I always seemed to have a difficult time pushing in the release button on the crotch buckle.  I had a hard time being at the right angle or something, and didn't have the thumb strength to just hit the button - again, not fun when you are in a hurry to get your child OUT of the car.Also, if you look under the cover...some of the super-duper safe impact absorbers are just styrofoam.  Very expensive styrofoam.  And one of the head protector wing things in ours broke when my husband leaned on hit while trying to tighten the seat in.  It broke because it is only made of styrofoam.This seat was also very hot. (Onyx)I gave two stars because I do not doubt that the seat meets safety requirements.  It is nice looking, although it is a HUGE carseat.  The material of the cover is soft. It was pretty easy to pull the tightening strap down and to release it.Other than those couple of &#34;highlights,&#34; there was nothing I liked about this seat.Having a car seat you hate to use makes a &#34;quick trip&#34; to anywhere into a chore.  You start avoiding leaving the house!My son was 1 year old when we bought this and he was 18 months old when we gave up and bought a new seat (the Diono Radian RXT, which I love and highly recommend).	
1. 	My baby loves her sleepsacks almost as much as I do.  They are wonderful because you don't have to worry about the blanket falling off or accidentally covering the baby's face.  The cotton ones are perfect for summer because it is light and airy.  My baby knows it is bedtime when we pull out her sleepsack and settles right to bed (typically).  They are pretty long, so they fit for a long time.	
1. 	I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over.  It was especially great while traveling.  At some point functionality takes over style.  This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else.  It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly.  Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should.	
- 1	I like the look of these, the lace on the outer layer is cute, but they don't hold moisture well at all. It's about as absorbent as a flannel burp cloth - if you leak more than a tiny bit,  it'll go right through the pad. I used these at night occasionally because they're soft and they would keep the milk from running down my shirt, but my shirt would be damp after every feeding. They're also very thick, which makes them very noticeable under a shirt. If you want a great cloth nursing pad, get Bamboobies - they're way more absorbent, thinner, less noticeable, and cuter. Don't waste your money on these.	
- 1	I bought this set when I returned to work so I wouldn't have to worry about washing my medela pieces every single day.First of all, these pieces are NOT interchangeable with the medela pieces.  I would throw them all into my bag and just grab a set of flanges, valves and membranes and start pumping.  After a couple days of doing this, and my output decreasing dramatically, I finally realized the yellow valves are NOT the same size as the medela valves and should not be used with the medela flanges.  The valves are slightly larger for this set.  Nowhere in the packaging that came with this set stated not to interchange with Medela pieces.  I only wish I had figured this out sooner--my production went down 2/3's from ineffective pumping and caused me unnecessary grief and anxiety when trying to figure out what was going on.  I was honestly crying after pumping because I felt like my body was letting my baby down.My second problem with this set also involves the valves.  The instructions state the valves have to be put on in a certain position (unlike the Medela pieces).  So now I'm all paranoid about my production and constantly looking down to make sure breast milk is flowing and that I put the valves on correctly.  And as most pumping women know, constantly checking and monitoring and worrying about how much breast milk is coming out, only helps to decrease it.Do to me buying this &#34;extra set&#34; to make my life easier, I am now frantically trying to get my milk supply back up to where it was before and am probably going to have to start my lo on formula.  Hopefully my review will help other women from making the same mistake I did.	
- 1	it broke right after I had used it once. i carry this around as my back up and it's already smashed. it did work well that one time.	
- 1	This may be top 5 most worthless baby products I now own.  Honest.On top of being made of the cheapest plastic available, its completely pointless!  This is they type of thing they push at first time moms who think it will somehow make their baby's life easier...WRONG!My daughter is 8 weeks old (b. Aug 3, 2011), and according to her doctor VERY advanced with her coordination and head control etc.  Her head is also perfect.  She first rolled over at 6 weeks.  My husband and I have made her do tummy time since she was 3 days old, at first she HATED it with a passion but now she almost has fun with it - straightening out her legs and lifting her chest off the ground (like a superman workout pose) while cooing and smiling.Instead of using a flimsy expensive little tummy triangle get a soft blanket fold it and put it on the floor. Voila.  Baby will probably hate tummy time at first, but a couple minutes a few times a day adds up!  I just saved you $ and told you the secret to a perfectly round little baby head..maybe I'll write a book. :)This thing is a pain to put together, has annoying music and is ROCK solid.  I cant imagine it to be comfortable.  My daughter screamed her head off the minute she was laid on it and she isn't a crier.What a total waste of money.  Avoid, and if you really want to give $$ away you're welcome to mail it to me.	
1. 	Solved the problem of our 18 month old trying to turn the knobs on the stove.  She only tries to turn them when she sees me do it but now thanks to these great covers, it is no longer a problem!	
1. 	We have a raised stone hearth fireplace. It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby. It is super easy to put on, works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears, bumbs, cuts, bangs, etc. if this wasnt on our fireplace. We've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well.	
- 1	I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	Great design, my son loved it!  However, he's a big boy and grew out of it very soon.  I found that the closer to the max weight he got that the swing would stop swinging.  The batteries burn out quickly too.  I felt like a slave to diapers and batteries.  Which seemed a little premature to me since he was only 4 months and couldn't play with toys yet. ;o)	
- 1	It just wouldn't fit in our living room because the screws don't extent out long enough to deal with baseboards. I consider that a serious design flaw. we returned it for that reason. it also didn't strike me as totally sturdy compared to a more expensive Kidco gate that we settled on.	
- 1	We've done the lug the car seat through the airport routine a few times and it's not a fun task.  So I was intrigued by the concept of a car seat travel tote.  This tote from Brica gives you the ability to carry the tote as a back pack or to pull it behind you since it has wheels on it.  In my opinion, the only way to use this tote is by pulling it behind you utilizing the wheels.  Wearing it as a backpack is very awkward and uncomfortable.  The straps are set so close together that I cannot imagine anyone carrying this bag comfortably.  I have a smaller frame and even I found it difficult to get the straps over my shoulders.I do question whether or not most seats will fit in this bag.  The Britax Marathon 70 is a very snug fit.  The Britax Roundabout Classic 55 has to be forced into the bag and even then you cannot close the zipper.The bag does boast a rather generous storage pocket.  You could easily toss lots of baby essentials in the storage area.Personally, I think this travel tote is a non-essential item if you are actually using your child's car seat on the plane.  I suppose if you're gate checking your seat then it might be of more importance.	
- 1	I am still using this mainly for the timer feature. [update: I decided to return this a month after I wrote the review]I don't like the water reservoir since it is difficult to clean due to the very small opening.  Even after trying to clean it every few days I see some black spots inside... mold/mildew/gunk??  See the pictures I uploaded.I now operate this without the reservoir.  I just pour a little water into the bottle warmer when I need to use it.This could have been so much better if they simply made the water reservoir easy to clean.	
1. 	I love that this mirror is cute and holds the baby's attention.  I also love how easily adjustable it is to different cars as we switch around on occasion.  I also think it attached the best of any mirror I found.  I like the dome feature because I can see the baby better from the front seat, although I would love to figure out a way that she didn't seem so far away because of the dome.  Maybe the next design they can magnify it or something.  All in all, it does its job and is cute on top of it	
1. 	We got this for our daughters growing stuffed animal collection. We have one in our sons room that is actually mine from years ago that is not stretchy like this one is. I prefer that one. They both do the job, I just like the look of the other kind, it doesn't hang as low. This net keeps stuffed animals off the floor and that's all that I really care about. It works.	
- 1	To be honest, by the time your kid is big enough to fit into this, they are so strong they will be able to claw their way out of it.  I bought this for my daughter because I was addicted to swaddling and couldn't let go, even though my sisters kept telling me to get over it.  She was getting too big for the standard swaddles.  I tried it once and she wasn't very happy in it.  I finally realized she's a big girl and we broke her of the swaddle in one night, where she started sleeping 11-12 hrs through the night.  If you have a big baby who loves a swaddle, go for it.  If you have an unhappy big baby and you're obsessed with swaddling, I recommend just going cold turkey no swaddle, and in a few days they will figure out how to roll onto their belly and will sleep like angels.	
- 1	The patterns are adorable. However, the fabric is very thin, and the stitching on the edges does not appear as if it will last. I have other receiving blankets, so I expected these to be as sturdy as the ones I have used before. They were not.	
1. 	When my daughter was younger,she was a runner, and FAST. She could dart away in a second. Holding her hand tighter never worked, and twice resulted in injury to the escaping child (who would wrench her hand away with such force, she dislocated her elbow and shoulder, on separate occasions). She was able to get out of the stroller and shopping carts as well. My sweet baby was exhausting, in her Houdini antics. To her, it was all fun and games. To me, every outing was stressful in the extreme. Even with a 2nd adult, she'd manage to get away.Enter Mommy's Helper; She had her freedom, and I was able to keep her safely by my side. In fact, with this harness on, she no longer felt the need to run off, because she could indulge her desire for independence while still remaining safe.  Any time a passer-by asked her if she was Mommy's Helper, she would literally beam with pride, and nod, making it very easy to get her to put it on for trips to the grocery store.Her sister never needed a harness, because she was content to sit in a cart or stroller, hold my hand while walking, or be carried, and never left my side out in public. If SHE had been my first (or only) child, I might not have understood why parents use these. But their little brother.... wow - he's not even walking, and it's already clear that we'll be dusting off Mommy's Helper once again, as soon as he is.And to the VERY rare person who made rude comments to me when we used this, I always sweetly replied, better on a leash than a milk carton. Or the grille of an oncoming car.	
- 1	These are fine if you clean one bottle a day. They just can't hold up to regular use. The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too. The bottle brush just simply wouldn't get the bottles clean. Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....	
- 1	I tried the Dr. Brown system but was unsatisfied for several reasons. First of all, the bottles flowed too fast causing my son to choke and gag with every couple of swallows. Not surprisingly, this led to terrible gas and spitting up every time we fed.Secondly, I think these bottles are overpriced. Even if they had worked for me, I would have been hard pressed to spend all that extra money. Bottle feeding is not rocket science and no mother should have to pay that much to feed her child successfully.Finally, although the wide-neck bottles may be a little easier to clean, they also come with more parts than standard bottles, so it all evens out anyway. Additionally, I found the big Dr. Brown's bottles (8-9 oz size) to be very cumbersome, especially when storing them in the fridge or in a diaper bag.Every baby is different and you've got to pick the system that works best for the both of you. For our particular situation, Dr. Brown's was not the answer.	
- 1	There is only one sticky pad in these. They do not stay put in a nursing bra, tank, or stuck to the inside of a night shirt. My cotton reusable pads stay in place just as well! If I pull the garment out of the way to nurse once, it's a fight with these. I like the cup shape and how they absorb, but they don't stay in place. I don't leak much though, so I don't know how well they would work for someone that leaks more.	
- 1	i like the idea of this - something soft and cushy for baby.  but it absorbs water, so after taking baby out&#8230;it weighs about 30 lbs. if you hung it on your shower head to dry&#8230;it would take the shower head down. so, i left it lying in the tub&#8230;and then it became mildewy.  i ended up throwing it away and getting the plastic version. disappointed.	
1. 	We have a gas range and always worry a little helper might reach the knob and leave the gas on. These are simple and easy to open when you need access to cook. This is our second set to replace one we just finally wore out so now I have extras. Great purchase for piece of mind.	
- 1	Even after reading all the reviews with most of them complaining that the seat was too high for the average baby, i decided to get it anyways.  Some reviews said it fit their baby fine, most said it was too high even on the lowest setting.  I thought my average twins (6 months)would fit, because we have a different walker already and they fit it just fine.  This one leaves their little feet hanging a good three inches off the ground! My boys are of average height too.  I should of listened to the reviews, but i went with my own gut.  Now instead of going through the trouble of returning it, we just prop a pillow underneath and hope one day they will actually be able to touch the floor, hopefully before they start walking.	
- 1	I purchased this product while I was pregnant.... But the time my baby grew into it, I tried to put it on her and the rise snap doesn't work. The diaper is completely useless now. Obviously they don't inspect their products before they send them out,	
1. 	PROS:Colors are bright and eye catching! Extremely cute!Keeps EVERYTHING off of my daughters clothes!!!Does not seep through!Easy to rinse! In the sink and hang dry!Drys quickly!Less mess in your kitchen and to have to clean up!CONS :Cant think of Anything YET! Will keep you updated!	
1. 	This gate is much better than most on the market. The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit. The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic. Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to. Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed. Overall, I am happy with this purchase.	
- 1	My son is to big for it, wish it came in different sizes to much of a hassle to return it since I'm half way across the world	
1. 	My baby loved to be swaddled for the first 3 months.  This sleep sak is great because we were able to use it for both arms in and out.  My baby is currently 5 months old now and we still use it on her with arms out.  The fleece is soft and keeps her warm and it's very easy to use given the zipper and Velcro.  It's been washed several times and it's holding up wash after wash.  It's a must  for her bedtime.	
1. 	O.K. As a babysitting Grandma, I have bought 3 sets of these, but somehow they keep disappearing. (My daughter-in-law loves them so much they are not getting returned even though I have bought her a set, too)  Our 8 month old grandson went through his 6 month teeth drooling stage, and now we are at it again.  These are by far the best!!! They are so light weight, but the dampness does not go through because of the super thin plastic lining between the two layers of terry.  When they are drooling and at feeding time (solids) they are the best!  I cannot find them anywhere except on Amazon and many times they are out of stock.  Shows what a great product they are.  They keep their bright color through many washes and you do not have to worry about the red running on the white, for example.  I just throw them all into the wash together.  Solid velcro fastens them at the neck.	
1. 	this is bigger than i thought but thats a great thing cus i can see my baby so much better than those small mirrors n i can attach it anyway i want in any car which is even better.	
- 1	these are very flimsy and really don't hold anything. I took them off my grass and use the grass by itself.  not a very well thought of product	
1. 	This soother is far more attractive than the others out on the market which is what initally attracted me to it.  I didn't get into the fishy stuff.  I only wish that I had this product when I first had my baby.  We didn't start using it until she was about 4 months old.  I can only imagine how much more sleep I could have gotten if I would have bought this earlier.  I went from dreading putting my baby to bed in her crib at night to enjoying it.  I used to have to wind up her mobile at least 4 times & switch between that & a stuffed lamb that plays a lullaby. Even with both of them it would still take 30 minutes or longer for my baby to fall asleep.  Now when I lay my daughter in the crib at night & she isn't quite asleep or even if she's fighting sleep, I just push the button & the light's come on, the music starts,the ceiling show begins & within minutes my once fussy baby is sleeping like an angel!  When my baby wakes in the morning she usually doesn't cry to be picked up, so she will lay peacefully in her crib & find her little toys & play.  She has figured out how to start & stop the soother now too.  She just thinks she's all that now that she will kick the button & turn everything on & kick it again & turn everything off.  This product has just been a blessing to have!	
- 1	Was so excited when this arrived.  But, during assembly I noticed that the battery cover was missing.  When I contacted Chicco customer service, I realised it would be very difficult to obtain one from the manufacturer!  (Needed to sumit forms, photos, etc.)  UGGHHH!  Additionally, I could not find Chicco's phone # anywhere on the product manual.  Had to Google chicco to find that info. (something I find a bit odd...).  Could not keep this item without a battery cover.  Luckily, it was easy to return.	
- 1	I researched extensively before I bought this, so I was surprised it ended up being such a bad product. Doesn't hold 270 diapers; the lid doesn't open easily and comes off the hinges; you have to push each diaper through to make room for more. Someone said this was a glorified garbage pail, but the reality is a normal garbage pail wouldn't cause problems.	
1. 	Perfect weight, has held up to daily use and washed at least once a week for the past 5 months +.	
- 1	The picture of this gate makes it seem as if it would be easy to get by it using one hand to open and close it.  Not true.  We are very disappointed.  You can't step over it and you can't open it with one hand with a baby in your arms.  It is only good for an opening that you don't need to get past easily.  But if you put it at the top of your stairs and you're trying to get down the stairs with a child in one arm and one free arm, it is useless.  I do not recommend it and can't figure out why it got such good ratings.	
- 1	not too happy about this product. it was still a pain to clean. the kiddo can still splash food and drink. and after placing it in storage for a month or two mold started growing on it.	
- 1	I saw the bad reviews, but I love Munchkin products usually, so I decided to buy this anyway.The mirror itself is terrible. You can barely see a thing.The attachment mechanism is ridiculous. It is inconvenient, and attaching the mirror to the back of the rear view mirror is useless. All I could see was the headrest of the passenger seat.	
1. 	The Baby Bjorn Baby Carrier is the best I have seen to date or the old style carriers and it is more affordable that the newer styles that are out there. This carrier can be complicated the first couple of times you put it on so you may want to use an extra pair of hands until you get the hang of putting it on. After the carrier is on it is fairly easy to hold the baby and lock the rest of the straps in place unless the baby is a mover :)  The Carrier has comfortable padded straps and is made of a soft material. Over all it is a very good quality carrier and a decent price. If you plan on using this only till your child is mobile it is a good investment for your money if you want a carrier that will hold up through the toddlers years I would look at an Ergo baby carrier.[...]	
- 1	very hard to suck out liquid.  ended up being a waste of money because my toddler found it too hard to use.	
1. 	I've always been amazed by how the Japanese manufacturers come up with the best products. I have to say, this one exceeded my expectations. It looks pretty similar to my Summer brand nail clipper but the experience is entirely different. With this one, it is so easy to cut my 2 month old's tiny nails. I also cut my 3 year old's nails too and it works amazingly well. I would recommend this product to everyone.	
1. 	We use this for our 22 month old and it is perfect. We were able to ditch the big heavy high chair and we just use this now. This is super easy to clean and it's very portable too. I like that it can be used as both a booster for the table or with the tray. The fact that it has adjustable height settings is also very nice.	
1. 	My son loves this gym. He is eight weeks old and just starting to reach for the hanging toys. It is nice that you can add extra rings to the hanging toys to make them lower. I have laid him on the mat since he was about three weeks old and it is great for tummy time. We have hardwood floors and the padding is sufficient. He loves to watch the sun toy that plays music/flashes lights and especially loves the mirror. I like that the toys are detachable. When he was younger we would place the sun and the mirror on the mat next to him. We have also hung the toys from his bouncer chair toy bar. The mat is easy to fold up and fits nicely in his closet. A previous reviewer complained about the rabbit picture. I like that the frame of that picture is a pocket and I have replace the rabbit with a picture of daddy.The only bummer about this toy is that our cats love it and think it is their toy. I have to kick them out of it all of the time and have caught them batting at the toys more than a few times. The mat is big enough for the baby and one of the cats, but not all three at the same time!	
1. 	We've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus since our baby was born eight months ago. I am very happy with this product. I don't notice any smell and I have a sensitive sniffer. It's very easy to use. The only improvement I could think of is if they designed it so the inside flaps open too when you press down on the foot pedal that opens the lid. This would be good because when it starts to get about half way full you have to push the diaper in rather than just drop it in. That, or, if they made it taller the inner flaps would have more space to go down. TIP - if you roll up the dirty diaper and then fold over the sides using the velcro to secure, you make a little package that easily drops into the Diaper Dekor and allows more diapers to fit inside.	
1. 	My three month old loves this gym. She isn't very good at entertaining herself yet, but she kicks and plays happily in this gym. The toys are easy to move around and keep her attention so mom can get a thing or two done around the house!The music is much less annoying than many other toys & the nature sounds actually sound pretty nice. It also is great for tummy time. This product could replace a tummy time mat, a bouncer seat & many other toys.I'd recommend spending the extra money to get this over a less expensive gym.	
1. 	My cousin let me use her Snugli carrier when I had my baby. I thought it was horrible - there was no support at all. I had to hold onto the back of my baby's head the entire time and he did nothing but cry while he was in it. I gave her Snugli back to her and bought the Eddie Bauer one instead. I do agree with the other reviewers in that the straps slip and there is no way to keep them from doing so. However, it's very gradual (happens more/faster when you're doing vigorous activities) and it's not a huge deal to tug on the straps to pull them tighter. Also, it only took me one time putting it on to have the straps all figured out, and as long as you pull it off in a normal fashion the straps don't get all twisted and you can put it on easily the next time. I will say that the baby likes it a lot. He's seems very comfortable; his head is supported and he falls asleep every time I put him in it. I also find it to be comfortable for me to wear...well, as comfortable as you can be with a baby strapped to the front of your body while you vacuum!	
1. 	I love the sleep sheep. My baby turns to it whenever he actually decides to stay in his crib. There are a variety of soothing sounds to choose from to help calm/soothe baby. Not the mention the sheep is pretty cute as well. This is also a perfect neutral item.	
1. 	As a lot of other reviews have stated...this bassinet has everything!  I live in an apartment so space saving is crucial.  The only feature that I haven't used on this is the bedside sleeper.  The first week or so my baby slept in our room...I really didn't want or need something so big in my way of getting out of bed every morning.  I got tired of pulling the big thing from my room to the living room...I just didn't like my baby practically sleeping on the floor all day when you use it as a portable bassinet, so I just moved the whole thing into my living room.  I only use it during the day now, but it was still worth buying.  (Plus it gave me a chance for me to get baby used to her crib at night.)  She loves to nap in it & the vibration & the song Fur Elise helps soothe her.  (She actually now perfers that song than the one her mobile plays...not a good thing at night!)  I do use the changing table a lot...it is a little hassle to lift of the top since it is a little bulky...but no biggie for me.  I also use it as a portable bassinet sometimes when she is awake & just wants attention.There are a few minor complaints about this bassinet. One of the most important pieces of material on it (the material on the changing table) isn't removable...so I use the Huggies changing pads on it...they are big enough to cover most of the surface area.  Also the sheet isn't a normal bassinet sheet so its not like you can use any store bought one without cutting out slits to pull the straps through, which isn't a good idea because you will get loose strings.  Oh & the part that goes between the legs that the straps plug in to...sometimes that needs to be washed too..but no, that too is permanently attached.	
1. 	This chair is great for a portable - folds easily down to take with you has a carry strap. Seems sturdy on the chair or table.	
1. 	My son is a stuffed animalaholic. He has so many I had to buy this net, and we counted he's got 42 stuffed animals in this netting, and 4 of them are huge! (Taller than my 2' son). I highly recommend this item if you're tired of looking at stuffed animals everywhere. I'm about to purchase another one, because he has since found more! lol	
- 1	I bought several of these for my daughter.  First, she was too small, so I swaddled her using a traditional blanket.  Then, they fit, but the fabric would stretch out during the night and she'd get her arms up and wake herself up.  Finally we spent the extra money for an Amazing Miracle Blanket.  It is AMAZING and worth every penny--instead of buying several of these, buy ONE Amazing Miracle Blanket and test it out.  You'll see that I am right!	
1. 	Others complained about the smell; I think the baby-powder smell helps to offset other odors.	
- 1	This is the most uncomfortable carrier. The baby basically hangs off your neck & shoulders. There is NO back support. I could hardly stand it - and my baby was pretty small. By the time she was 12 or 13 pounds it was excruciating. The baby loved being in it though.	
1. 	We have purchased it when our son was about 7 months old, using the audio monitor before. I guess the price of it was the main thing that kept me from buying it.Now I'm thinking I should have done it right from the moment my son was born. It is absolutely a great idea to have one, as it saves you a lot of time and effort just to look into monitor versus guess work of what was this sound - just a stir? Or going into the  room to check on baby and waking him up.It works fairly good along our wireless network, and lots of other different-frequency equipment, the only spot I have problems sometimes is in my bedroom which was built out of the crawl space underneath the garage - so it is mostly concrete walls there.But still I get a decent picture.The only tip  - if your baby is always sleeping in the darkened room - you might as well buy a black and white one, as the picture is always going to be in nightshot anyways.The bigger screen is a plus too, considering the fact that you're going to watch the whole crib and the picture is going to be pretty small.	
- 1	Ok, I have so many reasons why I dispise this diaper disposal.  When I first bought this diaper disposal, I was happy that it took regular kitchen sized garbage bags...They should point out that you need to use the kind with the drawstring, otherwise they slide right back into the unit! Second, the way that you push the diapers into the bag is by simply closing the lid...well the lid is so loud, it sounds like a guillotine.  If I have to do a latenight diaper change, I let the diaper sit until morning because the sound wakes my son up everytime! Next, I loaded it with 4 D batteries..the green light blinked a few times, but that was it.  I never heard a fan sound or anything like that.  Also, now that my son is eating solids, his diapees are pretty ripe (TMI, sorry), but his room smells like a dump if a few diapers pile up, and I'm talking about a day's worth!  Wasn't the whole reason why I bought this was to keep the stink out of the room??  Don't waste your money.  I'm thinking of donating to Goodwill, and getting a Diaper Champ!	
1. 	My son is just completely in love with this toy! I set up a playdate with a friend of mine and she let my son use her jumperoo... He fell in love... He was jumping up and down and shaking the toy! He was laughing and laughing and that's why I just had to go out and buy one for him. I totally recommend this toy.	
1. 	I bought this crib mattress after seeing it recommended in the book Baby Bargains.  I have now used it for 2 of my children, and my sister is using 2 of them for her twin girls.  We LOVE these matresses.  They are super lightweight, which means that changing sheets is super easy.  That is really nice for the middle of the night accidents!  I would recommend these crib mattresses to everyone!	
- 1	Very rough and dry--scratchyNever even used and the threads were unwinding when arrived.Thankfully I was able to return them.(We instead use the Gerber baby washcloths--good price and very soft and much better quality)	
- 1	We bought the booster seat for a 10 day trip to hawaii, figuring it would be easier to have her sit with us for meals than chase her around.  Unfortunately, we found that this booster seat is quite unsafe for our active 9 mos old.  The first time we used it (after securing it on the chair, and then tightening the harness) she leaned sideways to reach something and then was hanging by a leg, dangling off the chair.  Needless to say, we were thankful she had not fallen but were quite frightened.  The next day we tried again, and this time she literally crawled out of the chair onto the table.  That was more funny than scary, but I packed it up and put it away.  Definitely can't understand the popularity of this booster, but that was our experience.	
1. 	My baby loves this thing.  We started using it at five months and she doesn't use it so much anymore because she has started crawling but I am sure she will use it again when she can stand on her own.  Our older child would walk up to it and play with it from the outside.	
- 1	I had this for a few months and all of the sudden, the turning part of the projection quit working. The actual projection works, but the images don't turn. Not worth the $26.	
- 1	The case material is soft, but it doesn't look very nice once on the pillow. the opening is very loose looking - would be nice if it overlapped - looks sloppy and cheap	
1. 	My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.	
1. 	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!	
1. 	As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****	
- 1	This sheet saver didn't even fit my crib so was totally useless to me.  It isn't wide enough to tie unto the crib and I have a standard crib so not sure what the problem is.  Needless to say I don't use it.	
1. 	These wipes do the job. They are absorbent and attractive. I handwash and air dry them so the stitching at the seams is still intact - I noticed that many parents complained that the stitching comes out very easily. The one complaint I do have is that some of them tend to leave fluffy residue on my baby's bottom - this is an aesthetic complaint really as she does stay dry and has had no rashes.	
1. 	My LO doesn't mind sitting on this at 7 months (we're starting EC) with a toy or a book and we're good to go. Has great support. She was a little hesitant on day 1 but now does not mind at all although I still hold on to her. Easy clean up and very durable. I'm tempted to get one for downstairs for convenience sake.	
1. 	For the price this is a good buy for us. Our 1 year old is now walking and our 2nd will arrive in 4 months. Therefore, we needed something at our steep stairs. We already had one gate by the bonus roomStylish & Secure Wood & Metal Expansion Gatebut it was getting harder to contain her in that one space. I have a review on that product as well.This gate is not as sturdy as theStylish & Secure Wood & Metal Expansion Gatethat I purchased from Buy Buy Baby but it does the job.  The latch is a little awkward to use but I guess that will make it harder for the baby to figure out.My husband reinforced the wall by using pieces of wood to screw it into. I show this in the brief video.In short, I am pleased with the purchase for the price. I gave it a 4 for serveral reasons.Cons- I don't think I will be able to open it with her in my arms. The lack is arkward but we have only had it for 2 weeks.- You can tell the difference in the materials based on price compared to the more expensive gate we have.- It is not as stylish. It is a plain white metal gate.My review of the Summer Infanthttp://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQFG35ZYEIY0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00AQE6Z6I&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=	
1. 	Great 1st year tub.  It is shaped to fit the baby at a size ranging from infant to larger.  Works very well with the baby, gives better control over moment and sliding down. What I really like about the tub it can be used in the kithchen sink (no bending over)!  It also has a plug that you can pull to drain the water out of it for easy cleaning.	
1. 	I'm glad customers have a chance to review these items. Before registering for any baby products, I read every review. The reviews prompted me to either buy or not buy an item. So I feel it just as important for me to review this item as well and let you know what I thought about it....This bottle is perfect for my newborn! It's very true that the shape of the bottle nipple is very close to a women's breast. I am both breast feeding and bottle feeding. My daughter who is only two weeks, does not have any nipple confusion. She takes the bottle without any problems. Also, the 4oz bottle size is perfect for newborns - not too big and not too small.	
1. 	For some reason I thought they had suction cups on the bottom to hold onto the chair, but it does not. But it is great it does stay in place really well, until the child decides to scoot forward to get out. I think the child has to be a little older to seat a little more quietly at the table, but for the price it works perfectly.	
- 1	Wanted to love it, but the smell was horrendous, and then I think our cat walked on it. Dead within a month.	
1. 	My 11 month old twins get into EVERYTHING.  These cabinet locks work for us, in large part because of the reclosing protection feature that actually keeps the cabinets slightly open about an inch and a half (depending on installation).  This means everything to me, as the twins working together have still been able to get their little fingers caught in hinges and cabinets with other locks.  With the Safe-Lok, I actually always leave our cabinets open that inch, so that they can never open OR close the doors on each other.  I just make sure to never have anything in the cabinets that could fit through the small opening, which is pretty easy to remember.As for installation, it took my husband a half hour to install locks on all 8 bottom kitchen cabinets.  He definitely used a ruler, pencil and drill to do so, but with a modicum of engineering smarts these were no problem at all to install.	
1. 	I first purchased this pail at Baby's R Us for my first (for slightly cheaper).  We loved this pail and used Glad Febreeze trash bags with it.  Works like a dream.  Just purchased my second for my second baby.  We use one for our cloth diapers and one for disposables.  Works great for both.  We use Planet Wise pail liners for cloth.  They fit perfect.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product since it was easy to install and did not radically change the look of our coffee table. (Dark wood, dark foam corners)Unfortunately, my 1 year old  daughter is curious and she notices EVERYTHING. Needless to say she noticed the new foam corners in her toddling travels and made a B-line for them.  Between trying to eat them and pick them off of each corner, they lasted about a week before the adhesive became weak from repeated removal. It had become a game for my daughter to make a grab at them any time she was near the coffee table.I spent more time trying to stop her from removing the Toddler Korner Kushions than enjoying the piece of mind that she wouldn't crack her head open falling into the corner of our coffee table.In the end we replaced the Korner Kushions with one of those padded elastic covers that wraps around the whole table. Ugly, but more effective the the Toddler Korner Kushions.	
1. 	After hearing a story from a friend about a preschooler turning on all the knobs on the gas stove and then going to bed I began my search for a solution and came across these simply knob covers.  They are easy to install.  You simply slip off your own knobs, install these with the front latch open, then close the case over the knob.  Toddlers can hit the knobs and spin them but they can turn the knobs themselves or accidentally turn on the stove.  They are easy to cook with.  With one hand you can pop open the top cover, reach inside to turn the knob and then close it again.  We have a commercial style oven.  The knobs are a simple, non-intrusive baby proofing tool well worth the investment.	
1. 	I have this sleep sack in small and medium and I plan on buying it in the large, if my little one isn't standing up by then.  Our daughter liked to kick her blanket off in the night and then would wake up because she was cold.  We got the small sleep sack and she would sleep soundly through the night.  She's 6 months old now, and 18 lbs. and the medium sleepsack has been equally wonderful.  I don't have to worry that she's getting cold now, and she actually likes to be zipped up in it!  I also don't have to worry about blankets coming untucked and being pulled over her face.To wash, I just throw it in the washer and then the dryer and it comes out beautifully.  I highly recommend this item!	
- 1	Somehow missed the memo that not all Boppys are created equal.  Apparently I have the &#34;nursing pillow&#34; and this cover does not fit.  Since it's clear on the packaging, after the cover arrived, I checked the description to make sure I wasn't crazy.  While it says, &#34;Cottony cute slipcover designed to fit any Boppy Feeding and Infant support pillow (sold separately)&#34;, I guess the nursing pillow (which is more square, has a detachable strap, and a rubbery insert) doesn't count.  To my disappointment, Boppy doesn't make covers for that pillow.	
- 1	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.	
- 1	Granted, I know this is a soft mirror and given that... they can get scratched, dented, and the like... BUT the quality of this mirror is terrible.  I bought one recently to see if I could replace the Fisher Price one I had been using (the Fisher-Price Deluxe Auto Mirror With Mirror & Lights... which is a great mirror but sits a bit high so the view out the back window of my Subaru Outback is blocked more than I'd like).  At first I thought the Baby In Sight mirror was a decent mirror (3 stars-ish) -- not as secure as the Fisher Price one I have but not bad.  However, as soon as my baby managed to sneeze on the thing and I had to clean it... well, my impression changed completely.  Even using a soft cloth (as directed), I managed to scratch the mirror.  Before I did any more damage, I grabbed a camera lens cloth to clean the rest of the mirror's surface.  Well, the whole thing ended up scratched -- so bad that it looked cloudy!  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, how much softer of a cloth are you supposed to use?!!  No matter how carefully I tried to be while wiping it the silver mirror surface came off easily.  Thankfully, BRU has a great return policy and so I returned it *immediately* for a full refund.  My recommendation -- don't bother with this brand/style... go with a Fisher Price type as they are much more durable products.  (And believe me, chances are that at some point your baby will sneeze, spit up, or the like in their car seat and the mirror will get it!)	
1. 	My baby loved looking at this mobile from a very early age. I could lay him underneath it, put on a little music and he would be entertained for a while. At least long enough for me to fold a load of laundry. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it's kind of tough to change out the pictures, and because of the way it's made, you can't use all the pictures interchangably - some have to be the uprights and some have to be the flats. I would also recommend the Car Seat Gallery made by the same folks.	
1. 	I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy.  This makes my snap n go indispensable.  It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light.  One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller.  If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat.  I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint.  It handles pretty well.  It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated.	
1. 	I received this as a Christmas present and my daughter just loves it.  I don't know what I would do without it.  We have a bouncer and she prefers the swing a 1000 times over.  I had a premie and it fits her fine.  It's great for calming her down and for long naps.  She sleeps in the swing longer than she sleeps in her bed.  I highly recommend this.  One downfall - have plenty of size D batteries handy.  But to me it's well worth the money.	
1. 	Waterproof, and large to cover most of my son's clothing.  Pocket catches some of the crumbs and chunks, but not all.  We LOVE these.	
1. 	with my first born we used one of those baby baths, I hated it uncomfortable it was hard to keep him warm i love this product, so much easier to use and just wring it our when yo are done.	
1. 	I have used these bottles to supplement nursing for the last eight months. Since the liners are steralized, all I have to do is wash the nipples and other parts in very hot water and let dry.  These are convenient and easy to use. Try the rubber nipples as well as the bottle series with the solid color tops that close down on the nipple - I like those the best because they are so compact.	
- 1	THESE ARRIVED BROKEN AND WHEN I TRIED TO INSTALL THEY DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL.  SO I DECIDED JUST TO RETURN THEM INSTEAD OF EXCHANGE SINCE THEY DIDN'T WORK.	
- 1	I tried this product instead of the more expensive options out there. I realized that comfort is worth the extra money. I tried it on for only a few minutes with my 28 pound son and my shoulders felt like they were going to fall off. Not enough shoulder support. I was so glad this happened in the first few moments and not after a hike. I immediately made plans to return this item (which is wonderfully easy with Amazon). Everything seemed to fit fine other than that, I am 5'5 tall, medium built woman in relatively good shape. Thank goodness for EBAY, I was able to get a used, better supporting pack for cheap. Maybe a lighter child would fare better in this pack.	
- 1	These are ok but quality didn't impress me and not that absorbent. I end up using cloth diapers as burp rags most of the time. And FYI. If you are a first time mom, you need like 20 burp rags or cloth diapers to use as such.	
- 1	These were not the spouts that I thought they were. Although, the picture looked the same. One side of the spout is larger, so it didn't fit my nuby 10oz cups!	
1. 	We had initially purchased 2 3 in1 alpha omega elite. We were happy with them. However, after 2 years i stumbled upon some info that stated you HAD to use it as a bel positioning booster at 40lbs. While this is considered legal, i just cannot imagine that a child wouldn't be thrown out with just a seat belt i ncase of a major crash. The regent is the one car seat (if you did not start with a roundabout) that can be used as a 5 point harness until 80lb. yes it's more expensive but isn't your child worth it?	
- 1	In theory this is a great monitor.  When it worked, it was awesome.  Parent units can intercom between one another and good sound.  But then it stopped working and I emailed v-tech customer service and never heard back.  The baby unit suddenly started intermittently transmitting sound, so sometimes you hear the baby and sometimes you don't... no matter what sensitivity setting you have it on.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  I can't rely on these monitors now to alert me when my baby is awake or crying.	
1. 	We love this potty chair (bought one for each bathroom).  The design is simple.  It is comfortable and easy to use.  My 2 year old son has had no problems with it.  Very portable (we keep it in the back of our vehicle for longer trips).  We also have the BabyBjorn potty seat which is great as well.  I like having both so my son can choose whichever he wants (he likes both equally).  Made in the USA too!!	
1. 	My triplets were born at 33 weeks and from the beginning they did great.  Except that the biggest (4 lbs 9 oz) had reflux almost after every feeding.  It was so bad that when it happened he would scare himself and would not be able to go back to sleep without being held and rocked.When you have to feed 3 babies every 3 hours, holding a baby and rocking him back to sleep, cuts down on your sleep.We bought the Inclined to Sleep.  During the first night, after his first two feedings he was reflux free and at his last night time feeding he had a minimal episode, which he quickly returned to sleep afterwards.We did cover the head area with a cloth to catch any spit up.  He did slide down after having an episode of reflux.  When babies get reflux it hurts.  Babies arch their backs to try to get away from the pain and that is usually when they start to slide down the wedge.  I never have any concerns with my baby sliding down and pressing his nose against the side barriers because I am right there to clean him up.  .I would highly recommend this product to parents that have babies with reflux.  It may not prevent your baby from having reflux but it does cut down on the episodes and brings comfort to your baby.	
1. 	This shade really does work but it does not roll off the foam cylinder smoothly as advertised.  Maybe I am doing it wrong but I did struggle a little bit to get this shade on.  It still ended up with bubbles that I just couldn't smooth out but it really didn't affect my field of view.  I used it on both rear side windows and the rear window itself because our baby is still rear-facing.  It looks pretty cool as well and is fairly discreet unlike some of the other brands that are out there.	
1. 	As an FYI, the product dimensions Amazon has for this product are incorrect.  It is NOT 33 wide.  The correct dimensions are found in the product images.  The indication of 33 is misleading and may prevent people from buying this product.  The product is a standard size and regular crib sheets will fit.  Hope that helps someone.I haven't used the crib/mattress yet, but it seems like a standard, firm, coil free mattress, hoping that it lasts us awhile.	
- 1	My son was obsessed with toy story so these cups were a must for us!We have had them for 5 months. They do not leak, but the picture have totally worn off! I only handwash since we don't have a dishwasher so I am not sure if they were put in the dishwasher what would happen.Not worth the money.	
- 1	I got this chair for my boy when he was only about a month old so I didn't try it right away but it did look cheap and way too much plastic exposed. I started putting my baby in it when he was 3 months old and this chair is horrible the back is completely flat which lets the baby slide from side to side and down, the cover is way too thin not even soft enough to let the baby sit there for more then a few minutes. The sliding and the cheap cover turned out to not even be the worst part when my baby began eating solids this chair is even worse since the straps are hanging in from of the baby and he prefers to eat those instead of the food! I wish we didn't throw the box right away I would've retuned it.	
- 1	Wasn't high quality and didn't really like it.  Didn't put off much light anyway.  Removed it from my son's room.	
- 1	Me and my 3 babies have tried out 3 playmats (Precious Planet and Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym) and this is the least favorite.I don't like it because quite honestly, it's ugly.  Certainly not something I liked having in my living room.  We actually have some of the other Rainforest products and they are much more attractive.More importantly, the bars are flimsy and don't stay in place.  After only a few minutes the bars lean to one side or the other (despite being held together at the top) and the entire set-up looks like a very large person sat on it.I thought this would be a great mat because there are lights at the top where the bars connect. My son seemed to like this and the music, but I couldn't stand having to fix the bars every ten minutes.Most of the toys that come along with this seem cheap and uninteresting to my babies. (As opposed to the Precious Planet Playmat, which came with higher-quality toys). I ended up tossing them and using other toys to hang.We had this in our house for barely a month before I gave it away. We'll stick with the Precious Planet Playmat.	
- 1	Our son is just turning 3 months old and has started teething.  He hasn't started putting toys into his mouth yet, just his hands, so we were worried that he wouldn't take the normal teething toys, but he used to like his pacifier so we thought these might work.  Let me just clarify that our son USED to like his pacifier.  He only takes it once in a while now, however, and we still thought he might like this.  They seem to be a wonderful design, I like that they come in cases, and can be put in the freezer to chill.  They have little nubs on the front of the chewy part, so it's perfect for teething the front teeth, although I don't know how much use it will be for the back teeth.When we gave it to him, he would kind of gnaw on it a little, but really didn't know what to do with it so he'd eventually pull it out with his hands or push it out with his tongue.  We are hoping that if we wait a little while, and he learns that putting things in his mouth actually HELPS the teething, then he'll be willing to take this teether.**UPDATE:  It's been several weeks now, and our little man still doesn't like this chew toy.  He much prefers his Sophie or Nuby that looks like a peanut.	
1. 	My wife and I were deciding between a Fisher Price two-way swing or this two-way glider as our tool to help put our newborn to sleep when she's less than cooperative.  In the end, we decided on this glider because of the ability to pick it up and move it around. Here are my thoughts: (1) at first, I thought it was more like a solid infant car seat with a motor attached beneath.  It is not.  It's just a hammock draped over a tubular metal frame--quite flimsy.  But it gets the job done.  (2) The arch from which the toys dangle is NOT a handle that you can use to move it; it's just a non-weight-bearing tube from which the toys dangle.  To move it, you grab two handles at the ends of the seat. (3)  The motor is much quieter than what I expected after reading some of the reviews here.  Maybe in a very quiet room, the motor noise may be noticeable.  But the noise is never annoying or intrusive, and it doesn't disturb baby.  (4) The faster of the two movement speeds is probably about right; any much faster and baby's head would get jolted back and forth.  The slow setting is very slow.  (5)  The seat is rotatable 360 degrees, so the back-and-forth movement is not just limited to 2 positions.  (6) The music tends to be on slightly louder side even on the softer setting, but it's not a big deal.  (7) As with all such seats, baby's back is slightly arched, and I'm not sure it's healthy for baby to sleep long term day in and day out in this posture.  But for calming baby to put her to sleep, it's fine.	
1. 	I love this pillow. I am 5 months pregnancy and this is helping me with my lower back pain.	
1. 	These wipes are great for moms who have returned to work and are pumping!  It saves some of the embarrassment of lugging all your equipment to the break room to wash and rinse.  After a pumping session in my office, I use a wipe to clean up and then take the pump parts home at night to do a full wash down.  They are alcohol-free as well, so no worries of contaminating the milk and they are completely scent-free.  A must have!	
- 1	Pros: great material, tough but soft, very well made and stays putCons: mushes breasts completely flat, which is quite a feat for someone breastfeeding, flange holes super close together, uncomfortable.	
- 1	We chose this booster for the latch capability and crotch strap, the latch some others have, I hadn't seen the crotch strap on any other. Britax has some of the best seats on the market, we have has boulevards, frontiers, and ow parkways. They are all great seats. The crotch strap adds added security by keeping the lap belt from riding up and causing injury to belly, it keeps it where it belongs over hips/thighs. The latch is easy and works great. Fabric is great, removable and washable of course.  The side of head cushions are nice, the armrests and cup holders as well. The stature of the seat is awesome.  My son is 5 now and of average height and weight. He can buckle himself, thou I suggest checking their work every time.Revision - my son and I hate that crotch strap (secure guard buckle). It's very uncomfortable!  A lot of manufacturers have redone their seats in 2013 and no one else has incorporated them into their seats. The width of the seat is not enough to need the extra buckle, and it is a hassle. The sides and armrests of the seat position the seatbelt over the lap correctly on boosters. The secure guard buckle was also threaded through the metal buckle on the underside of the seat incorrectly and the strap and buckle loosen and lengthen each time it's pulled when being used, so each week I have to take the seat out and fix it. I think I will cut it off the seat altogether.  The cloudburst fabric is horrible, it looked disgusting after a week and didn't wash real great either. As I said above I have had a lot of good experience with britax in the past it this seat is horrible. My son rode Ina friends recaro vivo and loved it, we bought one for my husbands car. It's great. He also tried out my neighbors turbobooster and claims it is more comfortable. Boosters are unfortunelty getting wider as a trend, not too great if you have three kids Sitting across a back seat.  I am on the hunt for a new booster to replace this one. The worst part about this experience for me has been the britax customer service. I had never had to call because the seats have been nice and the website has manuals and video on there you can access. I started by emailing since its hard to call for me during day hours. They wrote back says to call the num er. Well I did and got a very useless lady. I knew more about the seat than she did, she couldn't keep up with what I was saying, she was obviously reading from the computer screen, she insisted I could take out the secure guard buckle, not listening to me when I said I tried and it wouldn't, didn't understand why I thought it was wrong in the first place, offered me another one...  And could only offer me replacement fabric of the same color, I asked for something different, I told her why would I want more of the same horrible fabric?  She had no answer for me.  It was a waste of my time and I got no where. I am stuck with a seat with a useless buckle that makes the seat uncomfortable even when the buckle isn't being used, and fabric that makes me look like a complete slob. I would not recommend this seat at all!  The vivo FYI nice seat but only is you have bucket or contoured vehicle seats!  Otherwise I would get more. Guess I am don't buying britax.... Sad thing for me since I have one more boy who needs a combination seat for Christmas.  Now what to buy....	
1. 	I bought this seat because I was disgusted at how my 3 year old had to put his hands on the toilet seat to steady himself on public toilets. I am SO HAPPY with this purchase, it fold and fits right in your diaper bag..even a smaller one like a ju-ju-be between! The storage bag it comes with is just a large zip lock style bag so I'm going to be looking into a cloth wet bag to store this in instead so I can wash it when needed :)	
1. 	I originally bought this for our RV. My son's regular high chair just took up so much space when in use that you could hardly walk around it. Well, when I received this in the mail, I figured I'd just try it out real quick, then stick it in the RV where it would stay. HA! Not so...it's still attached to the dinning room table, he LOVES it. He's finally sitting at the table like a big boy.I've seen these chairs in the past, but have always been very nervous about them. After seeing the great reviews this had, I couldn't pass it up. I'm so glad I went for it. It clamps VERY securely to the table...I leaned on it, pulled on it, the entire table moved and tipped, but that chair didn't budge. It's super easy to attach and remove should you want to take it to a restaurant or friends house. If your looking for an alternative to the big high chair, but you child is still to young for a booster seat, this is a great buy. I only wish I'd purchased it sooner!	
- 1	I have this monitor and it has really bad interference. It makes loud popping/cracking static noises at night that would take me up for nothing. I even hear some strange man talking for 5 seconds once.Tried several channels, simply can not find a channel that is interference free. This product will go back to SONY tomorrow. I totally would not recommend this.	
- 1	I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews about this product before I bought the postpardum girdle with side zipper.  At first, it was great and I loved how my clothes fit.  However, after less than the week, the boning in the girdle had developed permanent dents that dug into my skin.  It left marks and became increasingly uncomfortable to wear.  It isn't made for anyone who sits for any period of time, and as a new mother, I have to sit in order to feed my daughter.  Too much money spent for only a weeks use.  I did notify the company because it is not a good product for new mothers to wear.  Maybe the pull up support is better but there is no way I am spending more money on a new girdle to find out.  I do NOT recommend this product.  I will probably go out and buy a good pair of spanx.  Much cheaper (and more comfortable).	
- 1	For the other reviewers who mentioned that this item is able to stick well on highchairs or other surfaces, please provide us with the secret trick! I bought this little toy with the excitement of being able to stick this on the highchair and entertain my little one during meal times. However, after trying various tricks, this toy still refuses to hold on to the highchair. I have tried moistening the end with some water, or simply by pressing the toy firmly down, and none of these tricks work.Also, I wouldn't call this an engaging toy. It merely spins around, with little beads in it to make it sound like a rattle, and has the little things inside the wheel that would turn.  I got this for my baby girl when she was 7 month old and she wasn't intrigued by it at all. Even now, at 15 month old, she would play with it for at most 5 minutes before throwing it back into the toy box. With this price, I believe that I can get better toys such as Baby Einsteins toys that would play songs to better engage my baby.	
1. 	I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.	
1. 	This is a great carrier! It is half the price of the Baby Bjorn and it is so conveniant. I read a lot of the other reviews and read how other buyers complained about the straps but really, there aren't that many and it's super easy to adjust. The other great part is that it's a one size fits all so you and your partner can use it without having to buy two that are different sizes or worry that you bought the wrong size. My only complaint is that the front doesn't fold down. My little girl is 3 months and she is really curious and likes to face out but she can't because she's not tall enough. The front comes up to the middle of her face. She is little for her age. (She's only in the 15% for her height) but if it folded down like a lot of the others she would be able to. That's it though. Don't spend the extra money, buy this one and save. Don't be scared by other reviews saying it's complicated to use because it's not. We didn't even look at the directions and we figured it out!	
1. 	I decided to order this because you got a bit more for your money over the Mustela Creme and although pleased with the product be forewarned it does have a different scent that the creme.  You also have to squirt about 4 pumps into a baby washcloth and use your other hand to rub it into a lather...that amount seems to wash my 33 lb. granddaaughter just fine and it takes about 2 pumps to wash her short haircut.  My granddaughter is not a normal rambunctious toddler so my comparisons in cleanliness would be comparable to an infant that is not sweating.Mustela Bebe Dermo-Cleansing Gel for Hair and Body 16.9 fl oz (500 ml)Each bottle seems to last about a month and when the product is a bit low and more difficult to pump, I add just a bit of water and get several more baths worth out of it.	
1. 	I started with Dr. Browns bottles but since I don't have a dishwasher I was ready to shoot myself when cleaning them. These are so much better.Super easy to clean (I just soak everything in the sink with hot water, dish soap and a little white vinegar) and the bent angle has been great. My baby is a super fast eater and I can actually slow him down by twisting the bottle while in his mouth after a few gulps and letting him suck on the empty nipple, then twist back again to give him a little more, repeat the process until he's done. He has a fit if you take the bottle out of his mouth. I thought that would make him super gassy but it hasn't at all.I haven't had any leaks (I have 12 bottles) and I even use a warmer although they recommend not using one. I found the condensation from the warmer does collect in the bottom lid gap but I just cap the bottle, turn upside and tap the bottom on a kitchen towel to get the excess water out.Highly recommend these if you have a fast eater!	
- 1	The sizing is completely incorrect. I say go by your chest size because a small barely fit me for my newborn- once he gained a pound or two there was no way this would fit and I'm bigger than a 34 ddd. I should of gotten a medium but besides that my baby was extremely uncomfortable and unhappy even though his small size initially fit in there. I returned it and got the moby which I really like and it is easy to use.	
1. 	I used these in the first year of my daughters life to store expressed breast milk.  I have the Avent pump (which I LOVE) so with the adapter I could pump right into these, very convenient. I had a lot of milk stored in my freezer I really appreciated how nicely they stacked and that they didn't take much room.  I never had problems with spilling.  As a disclaimer to that, I will say that I didn't transport milk daily and that I rarely filled the cups completely.I appreciate them even more now that I'm done pumping.  While bottles and plastic bags are either causing clutter in my cupboards or have been thrown out, these are still frequently used.  They're a perfect size for on the go toddler snacks.  I also use them to store sides for my husband and I when we take lunches to go or to store small amounts of leftovers (usually headed for my toddlers lunch the next day).Overall, these are a good choice for milk storage based on their potential long-term usefulness!	
- 1	We only use Avent bottles because we had invested in so many nipples and accessories and harder plastic bottles. We liked the brand even though we always had small leaks on the bottles and had to open and close a couple of times to get a good grip.We purchased 6 of these from Amazon thinking it will be the same clear hard plastic we had. Instead we received a set of soft white color plastic bottles, that all leak. By leak I don't mean small leaks/drips like before, I mean if you hold the bottle sideways the entire thing will empty in a minute. They're all unusable.The bottles didn't come with any adaptor, and I'm amazed of how Avent and Amazon would sell a junk like this.Don't waste your money and buy these.	
1. 	We love love love ours. We have used for two years, and it is in as perfect condition as when we bought it. No sharp edges a fabulous size, and easy to clean. It is also more attractive than many others we looked at. Could not be happier.	
1. 	After trying many other brands and styles of bottles, my wife and I agree that the Playtex Ventaire are the best.Less pieces than Doc Brown, excellent venting system, inexpensive nipples to replace as your baby grows and you need higher flow.	
- 1	We bought this seat for our 8 month old son to use at our cottage because we didn't want to buy a second high chair. We liked the toys and thought they would keep him entertained and give us some time to eat, but it didn't work. The toys are probably made for older babies since none of them were close enough to be chewed on. He seemed to think they were pretty boring. The tree doesn't spin very well, and the critters are a bit hard to move. What made us return this seat is its very hard plastic and straight back, which seem very uncomfortable, even if our son is able to sit properly. He would tend to fall a bit on the side when tired, and there are no shoulder straps, so it wasn't safe enough for his age.We'll just pay $25 extra and buy another[[ASIN:B005IWM99K Fisher-Price 2012 Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug], which we are very satisfied with.	
- 1	Maybe I'm just new to this parent game and haven't built up my tolerance for things to be difficult/annoying but... the adapters (yes, I have them installed correctly) are a really awkward fit between my Maxi Cosi Mico and my Cameleon stroller. Like, I can't really get the seat OFF the stroller base by myself.So, I'm faced with 2 options:1. Not leaving the house without my husband. This has been my strategy for 3 weeks, leaving me bored enough to write this review.2. Buying a different car seat and hoping it fits better with the stroller since it is the less expensive of the 2 itemsVery confusing that these adapters are considered a solution to my situation (quote from the FAQ section of the Bugaboo website, pretty accurate)Update: after thinking maybe our carseat model was too old we went to Babies R Us to try the adapters with the newest model seat but alas, same terrible fit. I gave up and bought the Graco adapters on here and a Graco carseat used and the fit is INCREDIBLE comparatively. The 2 remaining stars are because Diapers.com was great about letting me return these Maxi Cosi adapters.	
1. 	I used these bottles for my baby until she was about 5 weeks old.  Everybody complains that the Stage 1 nipple flow is way too slow.  It is, but that was a plus for my baby, because she is very prone to spitting up.  I found that these bottles were slow enough that it made her keep everything down.  I tried the Dr. Brown's bottles at first, and they were way too fast and made her spit up very badly.  So I went back to the Vent Aire bottle, and my baby kept all formula down at every feeding.However, now that my baby is getting older and demanding more formula at each feeding, these bottles just don't work for us any more.  It was taking my baby 45 minutes or more to take 3 oz. of formula, which was driving me crazy at 2:00 a.m.  It was taking so long for my baby to eat that she was becoming disinterested in eating only 1 oz into a feeding, then she would just do the &quot;non nutritive suckles&quot; on the nipple without taking in formula.  It was so frustrating, because I know she was still hungry, but she was using the nipple like a pacifier because the flow was soooooo slow!  They were also giving my baby nursing blisters on her lips from having to suck so hard to get the formula out.I recommend these bottles for the first month, then after that, switch to a different bottle, or switch to a different brand of Stage 1 nipple (even though they say to only use the Vent Aire nipples).  The Stage 2 nipples are way too fast, it seems like there is no in between with these Vent Aire nipples.  I recommend the EvenFlo Stage 1 nipple.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
1. 	Very good toy. first time my baby was in it, immediately started playing with it and loved to playing with the monkey.	
1. 	My 7-month-old son really enjoys playing in this toy.  He has this one at grandma's house and the Einstein at home.  He got bored of the Einstein and it's useless puppet quickly and fusses when he is in it. Not in this one.  He get's so excited being in it.  He loves the book.  I haven't had any problem with durability.  A friend gave it to me after her son outgrew it and everything still works.  I can see where it can be overstimulating for a baby under 4-months though.  My son didn't get it until he was 5 months.  I don't even think that babies under 4 months should be forced to sit in such an upright position anyway.	
- 1	It worked fairly well, starting out, then the bristles began to fall out this morning. I've only had it a couple of days, but the bottles have at least 6 pieces to wash and maintain. I was hoping it would stand up to the constant use. Perhaps I just managed to get a bad brush, but it didn't last; at least not for me.	
- 1	I'm one upset mommy right now. We had this monitor for our 2yr old and it worked fine. I wasnt as impressed asI thought I would be but was ok with it so didn't return it. Then we had baby #2. This system is capable of multi camera but isn't really set up for them. There is NO sound if you have it on split screen so unless you look at it to see the sound indicator you have no clue one of the kids needs you. Which doesn't work if you plan to ever sleep or get somethi g done. My poor baby was crying for prob 5min before I walked past camera (was working on laundry after I layed kids down) and saw movement and pushed it to look at his camera only and he was really upset ( he is one who doesn't cry when he first wakes just babbles). Also there is no way to darken or sleep monitor so at night it lights up room or you have to lay it down against nightstand. Then I also have another issue once I set up 2nd monitor it goes out of signal all the time no matter what room or how far/close it is. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more for better quality because I just had to buy another one so I can actually see/hear my babies and get rest not worring I won't be there for them.	
1. 	I had a few plastic bibs for my baby that were trimmed in ribbon/cloth even at the neck area. That meant that every time I fed him and food invariably stained the cloth trimmings, I would have to wash the plastic bibs and wait for the cloth bits to dry. These babybjorn bibs are great because they are all plastic, very easy to put on and take off, and can just be run under the sink or washed out with soapy water after the meal Great purchase.	
1. 	My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.	
- 1	I have purchased other one piece lid cups and loved them. But these ones leak so bad. They look adorable but they leak to much for me to want my kids to even use them.	
- 1	I didn't realize that those bibs are made of some plastic-like material when I purchased them; they look really cute, but I don't know if I can trust the material! It smells very strong.	
- 1	These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!	
1. 	I love this bib!  It is so durable, yet cute!  My favorite feature us the adjustable neck. Now food is actually going where it is supposed to!	
- 1	This is definitely a cute bouncer.  That being said, it is a piece of crap!  It's flimsy as can be.  The first one I got didn't ever work so I returned it.... and the second one was also defective!  It's made of cheap materials and just can't stand up to the quality of other bouncers.  For just a few more dollars, you can get something your baby will love that won't be a wasted purchase.  I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	
- 1	Not so much. My pack hardly had any of the beads in it that get heated or cooled so it had little impact. Great idea, though. For a heat pack, I ended up using a tip from an all natural blog instead: heat up dried beans or dried rice in an old (clean!) sock in the microwave for a few seconds and presto!	
1. 	This is great!  I used to boil water to have my first child's bottles sterilized.  Then I got this for my 2nd and 3rd children.  I read the other reviews that it's much easier to just pop it in the dishwasher.  But what about for some of us who don't run their dishwashers daily(maybe because it's not a full load yet).  This sterilizer only takes 7 oz. of water and it takes 4 minutes in the microwave and your bottles, nipples, pacifiers, breast pump, etc. are sterilized.  You can't beat 7 ounces of water and 4 minutes of time.  You can't always wait for the dishwasher, which can take 30 minutes of more, plus all the water being used.  So for me, I think this sterilizer is great and it is very convenient.	
- 1	The vibrating works well and the chair is really cute but having to pull the handle to get the 15 second music to go on is pretty pathetic. How many baby that are old enough to pull a music handle will be sitting in a vibrating chair? None. That motion is pleasant for little babies... and they can't pull a handle to hear a little tune for a 15 seconds. It was durable and cute but not worth the money. Spend a little extra and get a fancy chair that you know you will use for all your babies. I will be selling this one and buying a better one!	
1. 	I love it but I thought it would be a little lighter in color not tan color (it does say natural so can't complain). Seems nice and cozy for the winter. Love and can not wait to put it on my baby!	
1. 	I purchased this brand because the Medela pumps are what's provided for use at my job.  The only thing I would change is I would provide different type flanges with the order or give the option to select your flange size when purchasing the item, but I guess if Medela did that it would decrease their revenue.	
1. 	The good: It works well and does exactly what I bought it for: pureeing food from the table at home and while traveling so I don't have to deal with jarred food. I've used it successfully on peas, all kinds of fruit, pasta, rice, cooked carrots and brussels sprouts. I'd recommend it.The bad: I need to stick a fork in one of the holes in order to take the top off. I need a dishwasher or veggie brush to clean the holes. The crank started wobbling after a few uses. It doesn't puree meat.	
- 1	My daughter has the tiniest nose you have ever seen, but this aspirator tip is so small there is no suction at all. it can't create any kind of a seal at the infant's nasal opening (nurses will say don't put it up the baby's nostrils). I threw it in the garbage. You are better off with the one they give away at the hospital. Save your money on this product.	
- 1	I really thought this was a clever cup until a few months in when we figured out all the weaknesses...  Mostly thanks to my little guy.  He had no problem drinking from it, but I got fed up with the mess!- If the liquid inside is cold and then warms up, it will push its way out of the straw- If your toddler pinches the straw, the drink streams out- If your toddler throws the cup, the straw inevitably gets hit and leaves quite the spray pattern on the way/floor- On its side, liquid works its way out- If your toddler pushes on the top, it will sink in and allow the drink to pour out that way- If your toddler hits the straw top, there's a spray- There is always a little liquid above the seal after your child drinks--drops that will fall out when tipped	
1. 	Both of my kids love it!  I just get nervous because my son (6 months) keeps trying to eat it. :)	
- 1	These are absolutely adorable tub tatoos!  I have both the fish and the turtle - both are cute and my kids like them.  Unfortunately, they are so small that the do not do a very good job to prevent slipping in the tub (even with two packages of them in the tub).	
- 1	I was excited when I ordered but as soon as we got them and put them up everything kept falling out the front kids and I were bummed. I grabbed 3 one for each of my kids and they have about 6 teddy bears a peace would not recommend	
1. 	Awesome smock.  Great for mealtimes and craft/art time.  Durable and easy to clean.  Fabric is comfortable (not too plasticy feeling) to the touch.	
- 1	The first time I put this diaper on my baby boy, he made a regular sized poop, and it leaked up and down! I haven't had a diaper blow out since we switched to cloth! (at 3weeks old he's now 3months)Poor quality... if this did work well I would probably consider sewing in some new Velcro as well because as baby gets bigger I don't think this will hold well at all!	
- 1	When we received this item, everything looked fine and dandy. Linking went fine etc. But the problem was that the baby unit was only picking out sounds (me talking at regular volume) from within 3-4 inches. We did keep it in the little one's room, and realized that we couldn't even hear it when she was crying, unless we kept it right next to her face. And we played around with all sensitivity levels etc.So unfortunately, this item didnt work for us.As most reviewers have good things to say about this baby monitor, it could just be that I got a defective piece. But given that reviewer D Clark had the exact same experience, a little more QC would be nice.	
- 1	I have gotten several different kinds of these bottle brushes and thought since I use the Dr. Brown bottles this would be good to have.  However I found that it doesn't work as good as others.  The metal part it really bendy so when washing it would almost bend in half.	
1. 	We began using the Munchkin deluxe bottle brush when our daughter was born about 5 years ago, and still use it today even though our kids (5 1/2 and 3 1/2) are out of bottles and sippies.  It is still very handy for water bottles, water bottle spouts, etc.  As long as you use common sense (don't leave it standing in water, shake it out, etc.), it is very durable.Pros:  Only brush we have used that doesn't spray when in use (like crazy), tiny nipple brush has many uses for water bottle spouts, etc, suction cup keeps it standing up automatically, attractiveCons:  noneI have read a lot of the negative reviews and just don't agree with them.  After having used many bottle brushes for baby bottles (we used mostly Avent and BornFree), we never had an issue with these brushes.  They were a life and time saver.  All in all, highly recommended!	
1. 	med were to big, this was the perect size, no air went through and pump worked perfectly with the small shields. no local baby store carried this size, not even babies r us	
- 1	I was very excited to purchase this product but that lasted less than 10 minutes. I received the item, opened it up, inspect it- everything looked good. I put wipes in then i open and closed the main compartment a couple times and noticed it had already broken. The clasp that holds the main compartment shut was cracked and was being held together by the press to open sticker. I didn't even get to use it one. Very disappointed.I also did notice the wipes flap flops open when you open the main compartment but i could have lived with that but if the whole thing can't close that is a problem. High hopes completely dashed. If anyone knows of a similar product i would love to purchase it, maybe one a little bigger to fit a diaper in there as well.	
- 1	Kudo for the design as a breastfeeding mother I was very excited about a paci that close to the natural shape of the mother's nipple but when I received this pacifier from amazon it felt a little waxy so I wash it and it still felt waxy. After washing it for about 10 times it feels better but as soon as i give it to my baby he spit it out. After so many time trying it. I try it o myself. It taste very weird. Pacifier supposed to be taste-free... and the smell is not something you want to smell for a long period of time. I threw these away and stick to the soothie that was given by the nurse in the hospital.	
- 1	The way the pocket hangs, it closes up on itself, so it doesn't catch spills very well. Stick with the OXO roll up for travel.	
1. 	My daughter is a big time drooler and cannot be without a bib, ever.  Regular bibs allowed her clothes to get soaked in drool in a matter of minutes.  These bibs are great at keep her clothes dry and fewer changes are a big bonus as she hates having her clothes changed.	
1. 	THIS IS A GREAT PRORUCT. It seemed a little long but helped my daughter get used to silicone bottle nipple before I went back to work.	
1. 	This is as easy a manual pump to use as I could hope for. The pumping action is smooth and easy to operate. My hand doesn't get tired. I get good milk from it, too. I also have a Medela Swing (electric single pump) and a Medela PISA (electric double), and I interchange what I use depending on the timing and situation, and I never have to worry that the Harmony will pull less milk than the electrics. I can get 5 ounces from one side in 10-15 minutes, same as the electrics. I wouldn't want to use the manual as a full-time pump, of course, but this is ideal when I'm trying to be particularly quiet with my pump.	
1. 	I got this when musings started crawling so I would be ready when he started walking and I'm glad I did. This product works great on my entertainment center and my lower window sills. The product sticks great and my little one can't pull them off. Just this morning he walked over to the window and fell and hit his head on the sill and he didn't get hurt. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones.	
- 1	Works well to keep my little one out of drawers and cabinets now that they are installed.Cons -- screws are cheap and strip out easily while trying to install.  They should include extras as we ran short on screws during installation due to stripping out a few of the threads.- they do not swivel to the off position without unscrewing partially.  I assumed they could just be turned to the side when you don't want the cabinet to lock.  Since the screws are cheap, you don't want to have to unscrew to swivel as that will further strip out the screw.	
- 1	What a waste! they are so tiny!  it takes 5 or 6 of these things to cover a changing table in a public restroom - and they are so thin (like a sheet of paper or papertowel -  that they blow around as you put them down and if your kid moves... it just did not work for me at all.  I can't even think of a useful way to use up what i have left.Much better to buy wee wee pads they make for puppies/kittens - they are sturdy and large enough to cover a changing table.	
1. 	I use this in combination with the Chicco Keyfit 30Chicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat, Adventure. They work really well together. It makes those first trips out with the new baby so much easier for a first time mom. I go to run errands, take the carseat off the base and place in the Snap and Go, and the baby stays asleep. She is six months old and we still use the combination. There is ample space underneath. I can fit a diaper bag, a purse, and things that need to be purchased or returned. We also use this for walks around the neighborhood (That's about all the exercise you get for awhile after the baby is born) and the cupholders and closed compartment on the handle are nice for drink, keys, pacifier, etc. This is one of my most used purchases, and so much less expensive than some of the other options out there. It also folds flat with one quick button and fold movement and fits in a fairly small trunk. Great Purchase!!!	
- 1	We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment. That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles. When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack. It has just become more annoying than useful.	
- 1	This thing is a piece of junk.  It isn't shaped well for little fingernails, and it doesn't work well when you can get it positioned right.  If you want to file the little one's nails, use a baby emery board.	
- 1	Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...	
- 1	The bib stained after the first use. My son was able to take it off and I found it for for half the price at a different store.	
- 1	As other reviewers noted, these can be easily removed by a motivated toddler in no time flat.  I have these installed on 4 doors in my house and most she doesn't bother, but when there is a door she really wants to get in, my 2 year old has no problem removing these locks.  I'm not exactly sure how she does it, because it takes her only a split second and they're off.  I definitely wouldn't use these on a door with your child unattended.	
- 1	We have a Moby wrap which I absolutely love, so, for comparison:The Moby is extremely soft cotton.  Like having a thick t-shirt on.  The downside is that it is a LOT of cotton, so it's heavy & hot.  However, both baby & mom are comfy overall.  This one, in comparison, is more of a net material (maybe nylon?)  It's NOT stretchy at all, and itchy/rough.  My baby hates it touching his skin, and I'm not a big fan of it touching mine either.  Because it's not stretchy & soft, it digs in everywhere it crosses the body, and stays extremely tight.  This kind of defeats the reason I got it instead of a standard baby carrier (I hate them digging into my shoulders).  So, for comfort, I'd give it a low 1 on a score of 1-5.  I WILL give it this: it's very lightweight, and breathable because it's mesh, so in that regard, it gets maybe a 3 for that.I wouldn't buy this again.  I used it once, and it was not a fun experience.  I'll suck it up & deal with the heavy hot Moby any day to keep my son and I in comfort.	
1. 	I have recently started having a problem with my 12 month old kicking everything off of the end of his changing table while I am changing his diaper. His changing table is a dresser than came with a wooden surround that is removable once you are out of the diaper changing stage. This easily slid onto the rail and remedied the problem we had with him kicking the diaper changing supplies to the floor.I like that the little side compartments are removable. DIsposable diapers are so thin now that the slot you pull the diapers out through could be a bit thinner. I do often have two diapers come out instead of one. Even with that issue, this product is well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it.	
1. 	My mom helped me to wash the bottles and pump accessories, and these little white pieces seem very naughty, they either disappeared or teared .........so I found these on amazon~ hoooooray.........P.S.  My mom no longer do the washing now~	
1. 	These are a great fit, easy on, easy off, colors are not ridiculous and obnoxious, it is a great little bib.	
1. 	We have this and the smell form dirty diapers escapes to easily when opened. I supposed if used for garbage same problem.  In addition the foot pedal is to close in so its hard to get normal size foot on it to press it.	
- 1	This nipple shield was extremely large for me, and I would consider myself a medium size. The baby had difficulty even getting it in his mouth. I prefer the Medela sheild which provided a better fit for me.	
1. 	This playyard was a great investment for us. I do not understand how a one year old was moving it around... Our kid never cried in it and she loved pulling up on it and cruising. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, sounds like nothing will ever please them!	
1. 	I bought a new play mat because my daughter didnt enjoy being in the other one, it had only 3 toys hanging and was really boring. I bought this one and she loves it! There is a setting and you can make it so the music only goes off when they kick it or play with it or you can have so that is plays for 20 minutes. It was worth the money. My daughter also likes tummy time on this and she hated it on the other one. My daughter is almost 3 months old so i think it is good for even for newborns.	
1. 	Baby loves this and has used it every single day since birth till now (hes 8 months)	
- 1	It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles. It's very cheap flimsy plastic. The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used). I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me. I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day.	
1. 	This is better than a Bassinett for the following reasons - when you bring your newborn home... you want to keep an eye on the baby, every breath and noise your baby makes you want to be able to quickly look over to see whats going on. This co-sleeper makes that possible. I baught a bassinett first and the next day i made my husband get the co-sleeper. I was constantly sitting up (straining my fragile post-birth abs) throughout the night. It doesn't look as 'pretty and fluffy' as a bassinett but it is the best purchase. We use the bassinett during the day in the living room or when I am up and walking around anyway. But for sleeping at night this is the BEST. Porta crib sheets fit right onto it too. It doenst come with music or anything but your newborn doenst need that for quite a few weeks. It has great storage underneath it aswell.	
- 1	Once again the world of baby gates shows that they have very little grasp on how real live houses are built. I bought this gate for the adjustable feature - I have baseboards throughout the house and needed a gate that could handle those. I thought I had found the gate. Brought it home and discovered the adjustment is available only on one side - rendering it useless. How difficult would it have been to make both sides adjustable? How often is there baseboarding on only one side of an opening? This design strikes me as a good idea but the execution is ridiculously bad.  The designers apparently sacrified the 'adjustable' feature of the gate in order to make it both pressure- and wall-mounted.  That was a very poor trade-off in my opinion.  It's so hard to find gates that can handle uneven fixture points; this gate should have stuck to that feature alone.Most irksome is that the product's packaging intentionally obscures the non-adjustable side so you can't see it's non-adjustable. I thought that was sleazy. This gate is going back tomorrow.	
1. 	This was so great to use for my son when he couldn't sit up by himself without support. It honestly gave me the tool I needed to take him out and run errands by myself. The big pillows on the side were great support for him. It fit traditional small and bigger (Target or Costco) sized carts. No complaints!!!!	
- 1	The only other cover I could find wouldn't fit my power strip so I ordered this one. It seems sturdy and does fit fine, but the opening is way too big. My 8 month old could definatly fit at least a few fingers all the way in and touch the plug in no problem because I could. I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening.	
- 1	I'm thinking this pail should be used for babies with diapers under #4.  Anything bigger/heavier and you can't fill it half way without the lid putting up a fight to close which causes the gears to strip past themselves which are what are to close the bag at the top.  We'd love to replace it, but it looks like NO ONE makes anything better.  We gave up on the backing soda dispenser on the top, and bought some A&H; pucks and stuck them under the bag.  This actually seems to have helped with the smell somewhat.  I've gone as far as cleaning the thing with bleach.I wish someone would make one out of metal.  If this design was made with some solid metal gearing it would cost considerably more, but it'd last for years.Good design idea, BAD execution.EDIT: OK someone emailed me about one made by Ubbi that's METAL!!!  OMG it rocks!  So far (2 weeks) and the room is relatively poop smell free.  Our son is 20 months old and MAN do his diapers smell.  Not cheap, but WORTH IT!  Check them out peeps!	
1. 	My son would not sleep without this!!!!!!!!!!! It was a life saver for me and when he grew out of the size small I got this one in large and it worked perfect!!!!!!!!! It is the only kind he couldn't wiggle out of :)	
1. 	Woke up one morning to my 8 month old falling off my bed. I caught her, but was thoroughly scared. I bought this and haven't had an issue since. The rail is sturdy and my baby is safe.	
- 1	Legs wont click into place and keeps falling down when my little 25lb daughter sits on it. It squeezed her fingers as it fell down and now my daughter refuses to use it. Its a great idea but if the legs don't stay in place and falls, its useless. This is going right back to amazon. I am disappointed as I really think its a good concept. Hopefully I just got a lemon.	
- 1	I've used these before and loved them, which is why I ordered more.  The first pack I purchased was from BuyBuy Baby and I didn't have any issues except that we lost them on vacation.  I washed this pack before using and the seam at the top around the front neck of the yellow one tore.  Unfortunately, this was very disappointing.	
1. 	I bought this shopping cart cover because it was cheaper than the other name brands out there that was $45!  It works just as well.  The only little complaint is that the sides are not elastic or secure onto the shopping cart so sometimes it flips up.  Often times it's just fine and works very well!  There's two little side pockets, but don't expect to put too much in it.  It will only fit a small bottle.	
1. 	I will start out by saying that I usually HATE using nursing covers but I do use this one when I nurse in very public places.  I like that I can see my baby easily, get good coverage for privacy and that she doesn't seem unhappy about being underneath it.	
- 1	Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least. My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so. I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless! Totally crazy I know!These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places. The tape is pointless as they don't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried. If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place. One other issue is and at the same time it's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer, you don't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it's completely soaked through for who knows how long! It's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish, but you only know this when you check it. I would not buy these again.	
- 1	This was a gift but if I had bought it myself I would be returning it for a refund.  She barks and play music but only walked the first time I tapped her and never again.  Super dissappointed.	
- 1	It definitely doesn't work with mine. The mattress is now pushed up on one side - we'll probably have to return it. It was pretty easy to put together thought - about 20 minutes.	
1. 	This is a great product!  Buy two and put them both in the crib.  When your little one leaks in the night, just unsnap and toss the dirty one aside, and you'll have a clean one underneath.  As far as the snaps falling off, my son had pyloric stenosis (severe vomiting requiring surgery) and I washed these 3 or 4 times a day for weeks.  Never once did I have any of the permanent snaps fall (there are two completely detachable snaps on the ends that I don't even use).  I even washed and dried on the normal cycle (not gentle) in warm water (not cold, as is recommended).	
- 1	I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.	
- 1	This thing is pointless.  You can SMELL the dirty diapers through the lid.  We had previously just been using a open garbage bin with individual plastic bags for smelly poops.  I guess the seal on the diaper champ just isn't effective.ALSO, last night I just opened the lid for the first time.... OMG- I think I burned off all my nose hairs and scalded the back of my throat with the horrible, horrible, pungent stankvapors that rose up out of the bin.  BEWARE!!!!!!  This thing will trap just enough air IN the bin to ferment dirty diapers in their own horrible smell, creating a highly potent uber-stank.I appreciate companies that try to create nifty gadgets to make parents' lives easier and more pleasant... but these people need to go back to the drawing board.	
- 1	I loved these bibs, I ordered 2 sets of them. After a few months (maybe 2 or 3), 2 out 4 bibs are out of commission, the snap just came right out of the material! One was broken by my son himself trying to pull the bib off, the other one by my husband when he was taking it off. Seams around the snap must be pretty weak.	
1. 	This pillow really helps when breast feeding and provides a lot of support to both me and the baby. The only thing is it slips out of place quite easily. Other than that, it's absolutely great.	
1. 	This tub is great to use for infants, but definitely not for newborns (unless you provide extra support, which defeats the purpose of this tub with a built-in support).Also, very big in size, so take it under consideration when purchasing.	
- 1	Too small for the car seat and I have a jj cole car seat it wasn't what I was expecting I thought the front would open up easily but it's not like that the material was cheaply made it ripped at the seams	
1. 	I started having my son sit on this and the potty chair when he turned 14 months and he actually prefers sitting on this than the potty chair that is low to the ground.  This is great for me because it is less clean up!Would highly recommend!	
- 1	ok so the only one it does not work with is BRITAX which is the car seat I own. so I buy the britax adapter and it does not work with this car seat adapter. it works with the other citi mini adapter only. if you own a britax car seat and need a converting double stroller like I do, this will not work for you.	
1. 	This is the perfect bath for an infant. I love fact that it's soft instead of hard plastic which allows is to soak up warm water fast and is comfy for baby.It dries out very quickly and doesn't mildew.	
1. 	We bought these for the play room - and we're now buying more for the rest of the house.  I'm way too forgetful of a person to always plug those plastic ones back into the outlet after using it - so then that means there's not only an open outlet, but something that my son is immediately interested in chewing.  I only wish I could find this product in a quad option!!!  We have 2 of those in the playroom...it would be so much nicer to just have these on there!!	
- 1	This item was bought for my grandson but you can't hear the sounds it makes but it was already given to my grandson so it can't very well be taken away from him to be sent back.	
1. 	Arrived as expected and in great condition.  Comes with a blue sheet.  My son, who is 4, set it up by himself and slept great.  Easily fits back in carry case.  Compact and easy to transport.	
1. 	Works alright. Bought some from ToysRus and had to return them because they didnt work, thats why i turned to amazon for these. These worked much better and hold	
1. 	We chose to use these bags over a diaper genie, and glad we did.  Each little sassy bag can hold about four or five used diapers before needing to be thrown out.  This provides the convenience of not running to the trash with every diaper change (especially at night) but also forces you not to keep a weeks worth of dirty diapers in the nursery (as you would with the pale systems).  As an added benefit, these bags work very well for travel and we always keep a few in the diaper bag.On the negative side, these bags do give off a strong baby powder smell.  However, for me, it is only an issue for a few moments when I open up a new bag.  The smell quickly dissipates. But, I can see how it could bother some people more.Overall, this is a good cheap method of dealing with dirty diapers.	
1. 	I love medela bottles, I love that they are BPA free. I love this product, I like the way it looks, the only thing I HATE are the bottle nipples. They look horrible and my two month old daughter does not like them at all. I went online and got other medela nipples, those she likes.	
- 1	I got this as a Christmas present for my then 2 month old. He is now almost a year and we have played with this thing maybe twice. Literally. It's kinda annoying. We bought a leap frog dog that's awesome and we play with that more. I was looking for extra Christmas presents to buy and thought this would do. It's much smaller than expected. Maybe it would work great for some people, but if I had the choice to do it again, I wouldn't buy it.	
- 1	We love the lifefactory bottles!  Our daughter loves them so much it is hard to wean her away from them so we bought the super expensive caps to convert them to sippy cups.  She is used to other types of sippy cups so the transition should not be a problem but these caps are almost useless.  Both caps came with the hard plastic caps and a silicon insert.  The instructions say to loosen the cap on the bottle to adjust the flow.  The issue that we have is that when the caps are on as tight as possible, the flow is zero.  We tried as hard as we could to suck water out of this bottle with the caps fully tightened and could not get a drop and neither could our daughter.  We then loosened it up a bit and we could all get water out of the bottle but it leaks all over the place beneath edges of the collar on the cap when just tilted slightly.  When you take the gasket out, the flow is so good that it isn't much of a sippy cup.On the positive side, the caps that come with the bottles fit perfectly on them.  We haven't had an issue with them breaking but then again we haven't had much use of them either.On the whole we are really disappointed with these caps.  We continue to be very impressed with the bottles and wouldn't trade them for anything.  So we really assumed that Lifefactory would come through with a good product for their caps and they didn't at least not for our purposes.	
1. 	I really love the bjorn, It made my life a lot easier and I have no regrets.  Here's my 10 month use report.  However, at this point my daughter is approaching 11 months and 22lbs and we can no longer use this, she's simply too big and heavy and this isn't functional for us anymore.  Keep in mind she's in the 90th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight, I, her mom, am 5'6 and 120lbs.Months 1-3:  My baby would not sit in this at all as a newborn which is too bad since you can hold them close at that age and they're so little that the extra weight is nothing.  She cried everytime.  She didn't want to be confined but then she also didn't like to be swaddled so I think it went hand in hand.Months 3-6:  Got the most use out of this during these months.  She never wanted to sit face in and look at my chest, that was no fun!  She faced forward and loved exploring the world and I equally loved that I could get out now.  I did everything with her in the bjorn including walking, hiking, going to the beach, shopping etc.  Around month 4 she stated teething so I bought the terry cloth cover from the bjorn website so she could put her mouth on that and not directly onto the bjorn.  This was perfect except there's no way for it to stay on i.e. velcro or anything so keeping it on was very hard when trying to load and unload baby.Months 6-9:  Also got a lot of mileage out of the bjorn during these months but stated using it less due to her weight.  At least for long periods i.e. walking.  Now I could also face her in and breastfeed discreetly sometimes and even put her to sleep in it.Again, after month 9 use went down slowly.  With her height her legs hung too low so my husband couldn't use this safely for months before.  Since the carrier doesn't expand width wise she started feeling crammed in there as well.The weight factor is huge as this is not an ergonomic design so your back and/or shoulders will really take a hit as your baby gets older.  And I would say if you already have any injuries or back/neck pain to not even both getting this in the first place.	
- 1	I have not tried the bottles yet, but I just received this item, and I should have done some more research - I received them shipped directly from Target, where they are only $8.39 on their website currently, so I paid way more than I needed to.  But the cost of shipping the glass back is not worth it at this point.	1. 	I bought this and had it sent to my niece for her baby shower, so I can't really say much about it as I never actually saw it, but she told me she really likes it!!	
- 1	Thin but not invisible. Flat with no shape at all. Hurt nipples cuz of weird surface and material. Dont buy! Safe your money. Buy Evenflow!	
- 1	I love the concept of a pad that fits over a changing table.  Only the waterproof pad has to be changed when baby pees or poos during a diaper change, or when a very messy diaper leads to baby's dirty bottom leaving skid marks on the changing surface.  In fact, starting about two weeks into having a baby, I had a contoured changing pad, covered with a pretty fabric cover, then a waterproof pad over that.  A changing accident meant, I just swap out the waterproof pad.  Because it's flat and lies on top of the changing table, it's much easier to change out than the fabric covers with elastic that pull completely over the changing pad.  And, if I wanted to take photos in the room, I could remove the waterproof pad and just have the nice fabric cover showing.I usedCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, EcruandCarters 2 Pack Keep Me Dry Quilted Crib Pad, Whiteand some off brand quilted pads.  All of those measured 18 inches by 27 inches.These pads from Munchkin measure 11 1/2 by 23 inches.  But, really they are a little smaller than that.  The corners are rounded, so there is less coverage.  And the pad fabric is so light that the edges curl up.  This not large enough to cover the spray range from my baby boy, even when centered under his bottom.  Also, because it's light weight material (terry cloth bonded to thin vinyl), it curls up and slides around.  None of the other waterproof pads I use have problems with curling up or sliding around.My husband, who also does diaper duty, agrees that these are too small and are not useful.I see from other reviews that some people are using this as a portable changing pad.  This is not large enough to protect your car upholstery.  This is also not large enough to protect your baby from a dirty changing table in a public restroom.  My 9 week old is too large to be protected by this tiny pad, and I think his arms and legs would have been off the pad even as a newborn.  For carrying in the diaper bag, I use a receiving blanket, since I got several of those that fold small and wash with bleach.  I had also used a lap pad, which is a small waterproof pad (still larger than these Munchkin ones).  In the restroom changing tables, I just want a surface between baby and table to not get germs on him.  I don't care about protecting the table from baby, so I don't need a waterproof pad.  For a portable changing pad for your car, I recommend,Invacare Extra Reusable Bedpads-Size 24 x 34 Capacity Absorbs 1200 cc - Each 1.  That is a huge 24 by 34 inch pad that can protect my car seat and the back of the seat.  And since I just leave it in my car, I don't have to worry that it's huge.Overall, these changing table pads from Munchkin are the worst waterproof pads I have encountered.  They are waterproof, but they are so small that it doesn't matter.  They won't catch spills from your baby, and tend to slide around a lot.  Every other waterproof pad or lap pad I have purchased is a better buy than these.  Save your money and get anything else.	
1. 	My mom bought this for me when my daughter started liking sitting up. I couldn't hold her up as much as she wanted to sit up so we thought this would be a great idea. I wanted one without the seatbelt because it just gets in the way. I NEVER use the belt. The seatbelt is pointless and my daughter always sit on the buckle part. There is no way to get it out of the way. My daught is kind of a chunk and I can see that in a few more months she will not be able to sit in this any longer due to small leg holes. It's a good product but not the best.	
- 1	We Didn't try it yet, looked ok but came broken so we had to return it. Quality looked good otherwise.	
1. 	I have the larger, double Pump In Style but I wanted to leave that at work and still have something at home.  I used this to pump in the morning before going to work or if I was unusually full.  It's small and light and perfect for travel.  I'm now onto baby #2 and use this occasionally since I'm now home full time, but this works so well when I need it.  It's efficient and has lasted through 2 babies - Medela is a really great brand!  I wouldn't recommend this if you're pumping often from both sides - get a double pump, but it was a perfect supplemental pump for me.	
1. 	This pillow I awesome! I use it in addition to the boppy cuddle pillow. I have one on each side so it is easier to flip and have on on each side. It offers the support needed to allow the belly to feel supported, not strained, and relaxed. Easy to travel with if traveling late in the pregnancy and nice to take to lay on the couch at night etc!	
- 1	this is the same thing i posted on another 1 star review's comments: I don't care if it is made on corea, china or venus, every time I lay on that mat to read a book to my child I have to stand up. Im very sensitive to chemicals, can't be in new cars, etc. This doesn't mean Oh, well, then you have a problem. No, it means I can smell things most people cannot. and i get nausea every time I get on that carpet. It was outside airing for a month, I washed it twice with cold water and soap, and it has been in my living room for 5 months and it STILL smells when you get close to it.-I am a veryfied buyer, you can read all of my reviews.-I'm very sensitive to chemicals, this carpet makes me dizzy!!!I read people's comments attacking other 1 star reviewers, save your time. put your baby on the mat if you want to, I don't care. But i will say what I think.	
1. 	I freeze breastmilk in small ice cubes (don't fill all the way to the top) then pop an ice cube in them for my teething baby. He loves them. They work great and he hasn't been able to get them open... actually I don't think my 2.5 yr old has gotten them open either and he gets everything open. I've heard certain foods are really icky eaten out of these and hard to clean, but I'm doing baby led weaning so I won't use them for food.	
- 1	UPDATE:  After three months, one of the parent units stopped working.  All the lights came on and no sound registered.  When I contacted the customer service, I was told that the unit was defective and to contact the store from which it was purchased for a refund/exchange.  After six months, I am fed up with this monitor.  The blue light is very bright.  We have to hide the parent unit under the bed, and it still lights up the room.  The parent and child unit seem to lose connection quite frequently, resulting in either no sound received from the child's room or a loud beep until you turn the unit off and on again to reset.  A frequent clicking sound also grates.  After nine months, the other parent unit went kaput.  I definitely do NOT recommend this monitor.Initial review:  We've been using the monitor for about a month now, and it seems to work well.  We haven't noticed any interference.  Our old Sony monitor had channels, which this one does not have, but it doesn't seem to need them.  We've even used the parent unit in the same room as the old Sony parent unit without a problem(one monitor in each child's bedroom).  The parent units are nice and slim with a handy clip.  The monitor does have a bright blue light that blinks when the parent unit is not turned on, which seems a little annoying for the child, so the monitor is better placed out of sight in the child's room.  Also, when you turn the child unit off, the parent units beep if they are on.  The feature is intended to help you find the parent unit, but it has the unintended effect of encouraging you to leave the child unit on at all times and waste electricity.  When the battery runs out of charge on the parent units, the only indicator is a light that turns red, so if the battery runs out in the middle of the night, you would never know.  My old Sony monitor made a beeping sound when the battery was running out.  While it was annoying to be awoken by the beeping noise, at least we knew when the monitor was about to stop working. It doesn't seem to pick up sound quite as well as our old unit in which we could hear baby breathing from several feet away.  With first child, I wanted to hear every breath.  With second child, I can appreciate NOT hearing every breath as long as I hear stirring and sounds occasionally, which the monitor definitely picks up.  The two parent units is very nice because I'm not always backtracking to find the unit before bed--I can leave one downstairs and one upstairs.	
- 1	I bought this for my 6 week old for car rides. I am disappointed in the sound. This device is not loud enough.	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
1. 	We've been using this tub since our son was about 6 months old.  At first we used the infant position which worked great.  We got this when he was younger but since it doesn't have any padding we used instead a different tub until he was able to somewhat sit up (maybe he wouldn't have cared, but it looked painful).  After a year, he is still using it and fits perfectly in it. The tub went through a lot of banging, crayola drawing and stuff like that, but it looks great, and works like new.  The stopper has never leaked!	
- 1	This did not work for us. The mount did not stick well and out 10 month old could easily pull the whole thing off the toilet. We just found it easier being diligent about closing the door.	
- 1	The design for this mirror is good, it's flexible and helps view little ones facing forward in their carseat.  It attaches by velcro to the back of your rearview mirror, which works out fine.  But the problem is the mirror, it's not really a mirror at all but a mirror-like piece of paper.  It warps along the edges from the get-go and causes a very distorted image. It literally gives me a headache to look at and it's hard to tell what's going on in the periphery.  I'm going to buy a better product with a real mirror.	
1. 	After reading some neg comments abt this I wasn't sure what to expect but all I can say is - get it and you won't be sorry. Works great - DOES have plenty of volume contrary to some reports and is easy to use	
1. 	Not only does this mirror not distort the face of your kids, but it's extremely adjustable. You can leave it strapped to whichever backseat headrest you prefer and pretty much adjust it to see anywhere in the backseat from the front seat. The peace of mind of being able to check in on small infant's and unpredictable toddlers with this product is priceless. However, if you don't have headrests in the backseat (newer car models all do, since it's a safety feature), you'll have to find a way to attach the mirror without using the Velcro strap that comes with it (...and you should really get a car with headrests as soon as you're able).	
- 1	If your kid will chew on it, like almost any kid ever, do not buy these. They are not made in the USA, the packaging clearly says made in China. I was very disappointed, because their other products are made in the USA and the listing show it as such. Who knows what materials/dye are actually used, since you can't trust things that come from an unregulated country.	
1. 	I used this tub with my 1st son almost 4 years ago and now I bought a new one for my 2nd son born this year.  Living in an apartment, this tub is great for small spaces.  I use it in the big tub and when I am done, I just rinse it and leave it to dry.  When dried, I fold it and put it in the cabinet.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I had to buy a sponge to use on top of this in order to keep my son from slipping.  But considering it folds for storage, that was not a big issue.  It's a great tub otherwise.	
1. 	I hadn't planned on getting a stroller.  I think they are too heavy and bulky.  My friend recommended this one to me.  I love it!  It's so lightweight.  It's also very sturdy and high quality.  I love the snap-and-go functionality.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	I ordered this gate because I already own one that is very similar to it and it has worked pretty good. I do not want to wall mount it as it doesn't need to be up all the time and would just be in the way then. So, I bought this with the intended purpose of pressure mounting it. Bottom line, it does not pressure mount AT ALL! There are 3 slots to adjust the pressure and in order for it to be tight enough not to fall. Unfortunately it needs to be latched beyond the last slot! I read the instructions and it gives no trouble shooting help if the gate won't pressure mount tight enough. All in all, I do not recommend this gate unless you enjoy wasting money on a complete piece of junk. I am extremely disappointed.Fast forward two weeks later and this piece of junk gate completely broke! The latch snapped off and now instead of being useless, it is completely useless! This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased on Amazon. It is going out with the trash tomorrow. What a waste of $25.00!!!	
1. 	The point of this isn't fun so it's kinda difficult to rate that and it has no educational value as that's also not the point. I have had this for 4 months now and it's a godsend at night!  In the crib he'll wake up every hour & a half fussing, but if he's in the chair he'll wake up for the first time after sleeping for 4-5 hours straight! Makes a gigantic difference! You can turn the chair so it rocks froward to back of leave it in position so it rocks outwards and back.  Have had no issues w/ the headrest. Doesn't squish my babies head or press against his ears as others have mentioned. The upright postioning of the chair is really ridiculous cause it's at such an extreme angle that he'd have to be super strapped in (and very uncomfortable at that!) to not fall right out. The angle is so so stupid and dangerous!Other issues I do have are the 7 min timer (that's not adjustable) for the music and mobile. I have to go back to turn it on all the time and it's really annoying! And contrary to another persons review I read...I motor does make noise and it's really loud! We could never have this in our bedroom cause we wouldn't be able to sleep so we have to only use it in our living room. If the dial is turned anywhere past the first few notches you here the motor going back and forth. Also w/ each swing one side of the contraption at the back of the leg moves slightly up from the floor. Not dangerous as it's just barely but that also causes it to make more noise so we have to place something under it all the time. It's very annoying this thing only runs of batteries as we have to change batteries every week it seems. We just started usign re-chargables cause the cost of D's is far too expensive to keep buyign packs of them constantly. This really should have a plug option. Overall it's great though we are looking for another type of swinging chair that doesn't take up so much room and that's less noisy so we can have it in our bedroom.	
- 1	I was looking for a side hip carrier that was comfortable and attractive. This is not it. I am constantly rearranging myself or trying to straighten out the waist band and shoulder cushion from riding up in order to be comfortable.	
1. 	We have been storing my 20 month daughter's toys in an open box in the living room since she was born. I finally got sick of looking at them at night and wanted something that I could close after she had gone to bed. This fits the bill perfectly. My daughter likes to climb and she likes to climb into the toy box. So I like that the box is soft. I also like that it has an organizing compartment that I can put all of the little plastic random toys that we seem to accumulate. It has a side compartment to put books or puzzles and a fold down playmat that we don't use, but I think I would have when she was younger. But the best part- it closes! So my living room looks much neater at night or when we have company. My husband always complains when I buy things that he feels are unnecessary, I thought he would complain about this purchase, since we already had a toy box. But even he likes it and feels it is much better than what we had before. I highly recommend this toy box.	
1. 	Once you figure out which way your carseat goes in, this product is AMAZING!  I was able to fit a large carseat in it as well as some other junk that would not fit in my suitcase.  I LOVE this item!!!!  Very durable, and keeps your carseat protected from abusive handling by the airlines!  Don't hesitate - buy this!	
- 1	The first one worked nicely for about 2 weeks. Then the battery died. Unfortunately we had the old version. It was glued together. IE you can not change the battery. We contacted customer support @ Potty Time inc. They sent us a new watch free of charge. Only it was defective. The screen is angled and only displays when you hit the button.A little disappointed I forced open the first one only to find that it was all rusted out from water via hand washing. This is a great idea that is red flagged by manufacturing defects. Great customer support only goes so far. Its like the newest designed Xbox 360 still has a 50% failure rating. Who wants to buy that?If you cant make it water resistant put a Velcro strap on it. Its not easy putting it on or taking it off.If you get one that works take it off to wash their hands.	
1. 	I love this high chair.(1) Set-up is a snap.  You just take the high chair out of the box and it is ready to go.(2) Love the neutral design.  The beige works great in our home.(3) Great Features - height can be adjusted & seat reclines at different angles & tray can be set closer or further from the child.(4) Fabric has great cushion and is reversible.  When reversible side is used there is no picture of the palm tree/animals and the outer frill edge is hidden.(5) The back of the seat is high enough and cushiony enough so if my son throws himself back - he is still safe.(6) Legs fold up for easy storage.(7) Removable dishwasher safe tray.(8) Has wheels and wheel-locks.(9) Have washed cushion several times and still looks great!(10) 5 Point Harness - a must!	
1. 	If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow!!! they are awesome and easy. you can wash them, they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere.Love it!!! ++++	
1. 	I am please with the product. As stated in other reviews, the toy does not come with a bell as pictured. That does not detract from the overall desirability of the toy. I am actually glad that there is no bell. I am picturing food and other goo stuck inside the little bell. I think that without the bell it is more sanitary. The bell is not necessary to a baby's development. There is enough to do with the rings and different shapes and colors.I bought this item as a gift and would do so again.	
1. 	I love this in a cherry finish but the crib I already had was in the natural finish.  I love the changing table up top.  When the baby gets older and it is no longer needed it still looks nice.  I saw some people complain about the cheapness of the drawers.  Children's clothes aren't that heavy and the drawers are spacious.  If you know what you are doing you can add extra support in the drawers but I'm perfectly satisfied.  Nothing missing/Extra parts actually which made me second guess myself at first lol.  For the price and decor you can't beat this deal.	
- 1	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.	
1. 	I bought this bed for my 2year old grandson for traveling. I thought he was too big to use the pack and plays. He loves his big boy bed It is so easy to set up and take down, much better than a pack and play and it's low so if he does fall out he won't get hurt. He also likes to stand on it and it is very solid and doesn't tip easily.Update May 2012 This bed is still going strong after use and abuse of 3 kids. All of the kids used it for naps and for traveling when they got too big for the pack and play.Plus I often find the kids playing with it in the playroom for their stuffed animals. I definetly recommend this bed!	
- 1	These spoons turn HARD after a few washings in the dishwasher. I guess the thermal plastic reacts bad to hot washing? They got stained right away from the bright colors of baby food, and after about 3 months they have turned hard. Like, I might as well be using a metal spoon. My baby is a teething machine right now and she does NOT like these spoons. I will throw them away they've become useless. Get the regular ones that aren't thermal!	
- 1	I received this as a gift and it has stopped working 7 months after use! It would periodically make a staticky noise too! Registered for it bc it had pretty good reviews. Very sad about this!	
1. 	I had this in an older version (didn't have the radio feature) for my 2 sons. Well, I thought I was done with it and sold it. Now I am expecting a 3rd boy...back to my Buggy! I had to have this again. But even better, is the new features it has...a radio, cell phone, cupholder, and traffic signal. Love this buggy. It kept my 2 older boys busy for hours. I expect and HOPE it does the same for my new son. I love that it bounces, rocks, and spins. I think it is cuter than the traditional saucers and is more entertaining. I dont care for the traditional walker either ( I also have carpet so, they don't really work anyway). I got one as a gift and it was smaller than the Jitter Bug and I had a hard time getting my son in and out of it. OK, so this doesnt fold compact like the new saucers advertise to do, but I don't mind b/c I happen to like this type of entertainer much better, so that may be the one and only downside. This is not just for a boy b/c it is a car...girls like cars too! Highly recommended A+	
- 1	ok these is nice looking but all the cirles come out and its just a pain to clean, and move around, all the cirlces fall out when you move it maybe when my son is older he will enjoy this puzzle mat but for now i do not like it and prefer the abc 123 ones that i found at toys are us lol	
1. 	I love nuk products and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby's skin soft after bath time!	
1. 	These are hard to use - to get on and off, even for adults, which is what we were looking for.  We'll see when our little girl gets interested in outlets...	
1. 	We've been using this since our baby was a week old, and he's really starting to enjoy it.  For the first couple of weeks we just used the vibrations to help him sleep, but he's now (at a month old) starting to watch the lights and bubbles.  A great buy, and I love having somewhere for him to nap in our living area.There are 2 battery compartments: one (takes 1 D-cell) for the vibrations and one (takes 3 D-cells) for the toy bar.  The battery lasts a surprisingly long time for vibrations-only, but the toy bar drains them within a couple of days (when using 1-2 hours a day) so get 2 sets of rechargeables!The only thing I really don't like is the design of the battery compartment.  You can't change the batteries while the baby's in the seat: you have to unbuckle the cover from underneath, and use a Philips screwdriver to open the hatches.  But apart from that, it's been a sanity-saver!	
1. 	I love storing homemade baby food and her snacks in these little containers. They are small, children eat small. They don't take up a lot of space. Beware the cups if a child is very young. They can pop the lids off with their teeth.	
- 1	This bathtub is big, not space saver, and not safe. Baby slips in it. It is dangerous. Would not recommend it	
- 1	These bottles get 2 stars from me for being decent quality - no leaking or other issues, volume markings are clear on the outside.  Unfortunately, they were not at all natural in my (primarily breastfed) baby's mouth and did not work for us.  Just because it looks like a breast by eye doesn't mean it will work for every breastfed baby.  Make sure to check that your baby's latch on the bottle nipple looks just like it does/should on the breast.  For my 6 week old daughter, her latch on the avent natural nipples caused her lips to curl completely in/under instead of flanging out.  The transition from tip to base is just too abrupt, it's too sharp of an angle.  Worst of all, she frequently choked while drinking from these, which was rather scary.  I assume, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, that these must work for many babies.  Just don't make the mistake of assuming they will work best for every baby; try multiple bottle nipples until you find the right one for your baby.  For us, it was the Lansinoh mOmma bottles.	
- 1	I gave birth in July and I live in the South, so it is unbearable hot to wear this, add the wrapping technique and you get a very very very frustrated and sweaty me (I don't sweat almost at all). My daughter hated being in the Moby wrap. Thanks to a friend of mine who gave me Over the Shoulder Baby Holder I get to carry my baby around other wise I wouldn't have. I hope I can sell it to at least make something out of it, I have worn it maybe 5 times in 3mo :( I know it works for some people but not me...	
- 1	We had to get some of these for the bottles.Like: 1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it. 3) LEAKS! - No valve except the hole in the cup spout. 4) No valve except in the cup spout. Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year. Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options. I recommend anyone investigate those first	
- 1	Basically you get what you pay for.  These are really thin and not absorbent at all, I can't really use them for anything other than maybe wiping off the baby's face after a spit up.	
1. 	I wish they could get a more precise fit so they don't move around on the toilet, but otherwise, my 18MO stays out of the crapper... finally.	
- 1	The paws rattle, the ears crinkle and the nose barks and pants when you push it.... the barking is hardly recognizable the sound quality is so bad.  I bought it because of all the stars it has on amazon but if I saw it in a store first I would have just put it back on the shelf.	
- 1	Worst play mat ever. I can't even believe what they charged for this piece of crap. The toys are super lame. The lights are off to the side. The rods won't stay level. The tummy time cushion is so cheap I tossed it in the trash.  This entire line just screams Made in China GARBAGE!	
- 1	We will be returning - went with the Baby Bjorn original instead. This was so stiff and uncomfortable both for her and us.	
1. 	I held off on buying these until my son was two and his original cloth bibs were tired and too small. I thought this one seemed a little silly and indulgent (since two cost more than 10 cloth bibs). I wish i had bought this a year ago! It is a hard shell and catches everything my son drops as he painstakingly pulls the spoon to his mouth.  Things were getting so messy a few months ago that we were throwing shirts out all the time because of permanent stains. No more! Best part -- he uses his spoon to dig out the fallen food at the end of his meal for one last mouthful!	
1. 	I had a hard time picking a bed rail since reviews seemed all over the place on all the ones I looked at. Ended up with this one, and am happy with my decision. I am using it for co-sleeping, which they tell you not to do, but it's really only insurance in case my little one does a crazy fast barrel roll and I don't catch her in time:) It took me about 1/2 an hour to put together and install, not too bad, but being a single mom I put together stuff all alone constantly. Pretty easy to hide under the mattress, but in order to do that I have to drag the nightstand way out of the way, so it just stays up most the time. It's reallllly long, which I like for safety, but dislike when I am getting in and out of bed. I sometimes try to go over it, but I'm pretty short so can't do that gracefully. I think for just under 30 bucks and free shipping this was a great deal.	
- 1	I've had 3 other monitors, and this is by far the worst. And the others were even less expensive, so you can't say it's good for the price. There is always a loud static sound, no matter where you are, and the 'out of range' beeping is super annoying and went off when I was in the next room! How is that out of range? This monitor is definitely being returned asap.	
1. 	Great lid.  Our little one has no trouble getting liquid out and can hold the cup on her own.  Great product.	
- 1	We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment. That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles. When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack. It has just become more annoying than useful.	
1. 	This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.	
- 1	I originally LOVED this crib but not anymore. it has big potential to cause serious harm. I think this crib is dangerous! The metal spring frame (that you set mattress on) has moveable arms so the mattress can tilt. I found my 3 month old smashed against the side rail on his tummy with arms tucked under. He had no way of rolling back due to the incline (approx 10 degrees). He's able to roll on his side (flat surfaces, and can roll from tummy to back if arms are out and on flat surfaces) but due to incline- he was able to roll all the way over but could not get back. The problem? He could have totally been stuck face down!!!! I contacted the company- they are sending a replacement box spring without moveable arms... Makes you wonder if this has been an issue for others as well. I do not think my infant alone caused it to tilt- I think me pushing on mattress while we &#34;played&#34; BUT imagine as he gets older and can stand/jump/weighs more. Scary!!	
- 1	My toddler son received this monkey lunch bag as a gift and we both loved it.  It's really adorable and just the perfect size for his lunch.  The zipper works well, and I like the pocket on the inside.  His school has a fridge that the kids can put their lunches in, so I cannot attest to the insulation of the bag.After a month of use, however, my love for the bag started to diminish.  The bag is fabric, and the fabric isn't coated either on the inside or outside.  So anything moist or liquid that comes into contact with the fabric soaks right into the fabric and you can't simply wipe it clean.  Spot cleaning does NOT work.Fabric bag + young kid + food/drink = gross and smellyUnless you have time to thoroughly wash the bag every other day (or even weekly) with soap, water and a good scrub - but if you have a small child, I'm doubting you have the time for that.  Or the energy.Not only does it start to look grimy after a few weeks, but I'm sure it is teaming with more germs than the average parent would find acceptable for their kid's food storage system.After a couple months, I ended up getting theCrocodile Creek Classic Lunchbox - Solar System 10 x 7.5, which you can spray with cleaner and easily wipe down with a wet dishtowel to get it reasonably sanitized and cleaned.  However, the Crocodile Creek isn't perfect either: the zipper often gets hung up on the bottom corners.  It might be frustrating for young fingers.  But overall, it's a better choice than the Skip Hop in my opinion.	
- 1	I gifted this to a friend. It worked well for all of 1 day, and completely stopped working after that. They have since bought a simple one (unknown brand) which is working just fine. Amazon was amazing and gave me the refund even though my friends had thrown away all the packaging. I returned it in a sandwich / freezer bag.	
1. 	I bought these to shake the bottles and to put on the bottle to prevent them leaking in the diaper bag. They never leak and they can be sterilized over and over. I use the Dr. Brown's steam sterilizer. Great product...worth every penny!	
- 1	There are several things I like about this toothbrush, such as the length of the handle, the comfortable grip, and the bright colors.  However, on every toothbrush we've used the bristles have fallen out after just a couple months of use.  When it first happened, I thought it was a fluke.  I threw away the second toothbrush in the pack (mine was a multi-pack) as a precaution and purchased a second toothbrush from a pack of one.  After a couple of weeks, this toothbrush lost another bristle from the head!  This is clearly a problem that needs to be addressed, and I no longer feel safe cleaning my baby's teeth with brushes from this company.	
- 1	Don't bother with these.  I used to like these a lot but then they discontinued them and then came out with these ones that like exactly the same but the quality is crap now!!  The large sponge tore after 3 uses.  (FYI, I have the Medela bottles.)  And the little nipple sponge is not as resilient any more; it's a cheap sponge. If you want something similar, I llike this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Rotary-Spinning-Sponge-Bottle-Cleaner/dp/B00JQSO1L6/ref=sr_1_28?ie=UTF8&qid=1405008036&sr=8-28&keywords=bottle+nipple+sponge	
1. 	You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a hospital grade breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE	
- 1	While the seller was great on this item- great service, and fast shipping, I ended up throwing these spoons away.  I know the label says BPA free, but there was DEFINITELY some nasty chemicals in this spoon or the packaging.  I washed them multiple times and the chemical smell never went away.  I couldn't help but think my baby was eating poison if I let her use these spoons, so I just threw them away.  A waste I know, but they were so yucky I saw no other option.  I don't recommend purchasing these.  I found some other white spoons, BPA free and made in the USA and those have been SO much better than these nasty things.	
1. 	We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails! I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her! It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only two downfalls I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static. Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room...  The other the cord from the camera dangles on the wall next to the crib- presenting a safety hazard for curious baby.None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews. I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product. However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy! It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!	
- 1	I read so many reviews before deciding on my pump and went with this one because it was slightly cheaper than the Medela and sounded great. It is HORRIBLE and like others have posted, deserves 0 stars.Forget that you have a million parts to clean, that's not important. If the pump did its job then I wouldn't mind cleaning so many parts. The only thing that matters here is that the pump doesn't work right. I used it several time and cried when barely any milk came out. I thought I had a problem, no, it was this pump. This pump constantly has to be held with two hands and it still falls off. The suction has to manually be manipulated and is never consistent. If you stop or slow it down, you have to pump it back up. It basically memorizes your pumping for that given time, but does not have its own ideal pumping settings. Such a hassle.I tried to find a hands free pumping bra that would be compatible with this machine. Nope, nothing works because the &#34;horn&#34; doesn't come off like the Medela flanges. I even cut up one of my own bras to try and make something useful. Didn't work, this pump should be taken off the market.After a week, I desperately ran out to Babies R Us and purchase the Medela Pump in Style. OH MY GOODNESS! Within seconds, milk was flowing. I didn't have to manually adjust my pumping rhythm. Just turn the dial and you are done. Put the hands free bra on and it works like a charm. What a life-saver! I wish I bought it sooner, but thank goodness I found that pump. It has been reliable for months. The only thing I like about Avent is the bottle, so I bought a pump converter so I could pump directly into Avent bottles. Other than that, stay away from the Avent pump and buy the Medela. You won't be disappointed!	
1. 	Everything good the reviews are saying is completely true!  But I noticed everyone was using them on young babies and I wanted mine for my two year old.  I was desperately trying to get her to fall asleep on her own with absolutely no luck.  She would never sleep in a crib even as a baby so at 1 we put her in a big girl bed.  Now that she is 2 we wanted her to fall asleep in it on her own around 7 p.m. and then stay asleep through the noise in the house.  We thought this was impossible since we have tried so many things.  The first night we got this, it worked like a charm. I put it own the sound it automatically starts on and turned it up as far as it would go and tucked my little one in and left the room.  It miraculously worked! We have been using it for a few weeks now and I can't believe I didn't try this sooner. So just know, it works with older children too! Happy sleeping!	
1. 	Best bibs ever. Easy to wear for baby, sweet to machine wash, still look great after months of abuse&#8230; Solid recommendation!	
1. 	Bought this to use with the scalp brush and it cleared my son's scalp almost instantly. I will definitely continue using this! Awesome product!	
1. 	we are using this one more at home to give our LG a &#34;place&#34; at the table.  Seems like he really enjoys sitting at the table with us instead of by himself in the high chair.  With the tray table in tact, I can slide him under the kitchen table and feel that he is protected from falling out.  This is a 3 point harness and not a 5 point like the high chair.  We only have him in this when we are around.  the biggest bonus of this is the restaurant, very light, simple to use and carry and I can set it up in about 1 min in a restaurant chair.	
1. 	Worth every cent! I thought about trying to make a cover myself ... SO glad I didn't! It is super easy to put on and it keeps the wind completely out. My daughter seems really happy and warm! Great purchase that I do not regret one bit.	
1. 	I really like how organized this set is. The one thing that I absolutely love is the bulb because there is no way to stick it in too far and it cleans easily by opening the top and then rinsing the inside with soap and water. There are alot of emory boards for filing baby nails and the clippers are absolutly safe. I have not yet used the other things but really, the bulb is the greatest thing in the world. Even if the other stuff ends up being worthless, I'd just go out and buy a better model to put in it's place. The case is pretty useful, you can even fit a small bottle of medicine in it.	
1. 	This Light Green hamper has really came in handy for my nephew bedroom...we can just thorw his dirty stuff in the hamper...then take out the mesh bag and thorw the stuff into the washer and take the mesh bag back up to his bedroom the only problem is the bag (hamper part) i wish it would be removeable for cleaning.. like if a little dirt got on the bottom from carrying it up and down the stairs.... over all i love this hamper! makes it much easy on me! i just carrying the whole hamper downstair and fold it up and set it on top of the washer and/or dryer!! i really enjoy this hamper!	
1. 	This fits our 3&#34; Colgate mattress very well with plenty of room to spare.  I imagine it would work perfects for thicker (5-6&#34;) mattresses also.  The fabric is very soft!	
1. 	I read a lot of the other lower reviews about it being over priced, it's just a step stool or the grip is bad or it tips over...........Did you buy the same product?This is a clean looking great stool with good traction and easy to use for little onesIt's a trusted brand which I would highly recommendWhen you pay a little more you get better quality	
- 1	I purchased this for our newborn so he could sleep on the bed beside me.  This sleeper has no support and you really need to have it on something perfectly flat and really firm (like a piece of plywood) otherwise it is saggy and twisted.  I was also expecting that the sides would be taller and also that it would be wider as it didn't fit our baby for more than 2-3 weeks.  Buy a bassinet instead of this silliness.	
1. 	Our little girl is now 9 weeks and she's been sleeping in this since we brought her home at 48 hours.	
1. 	I really have nothing to complain about these.  I bought these in hopes that my nursing loving daughter would like them better over the other bottles/nipples we've tried.  So far, not so much.  She would still rather nurse straight from the tap.  But these seem to be of good quality and the fit the Playtex nurser bottle just fine.	
- 1	This piece of junk was defective and crooked.  While installing it, one of the upper brackets didn't touch the wall, while the other one was so tight that when I tried to open the gate, it put a huge hole in our brand new wall.  Not sure if just this one was defective, but you can see that the bottom of the gate is completely crooked.	
- 1	The item you get is NOT what is pictured.  The two sides are actually sewn togethere so you really can't stand the mirror up on its own...you have to prop it on something.  It is made out of cheap material, like ugly nylon.  The mirror is hideous and not worth the $10.	
- 1	I used this on my son once and a few hours later I noticed that he had raised red spots all over his diaper area.  I love Amazon for letting me return this diaper spray.  Obviously I wouldn't buy this again and we'll just continue to make our own diaper spray since that doesn't seem to bother his skin.  I wanted to give this a try because of the ingredients that it has listed and the fact that it's promoted as something that would aid in keeping things like yeast away.  The smell is also kind of strong but my husband says it smells like it's working which I guess works out...I didn't find the smell off-putting but the rash and sleepless night from my uncomfortable baby were definitely a deal breaker.	
- 1	I have 2 kids, ages 10 months and almost 4. All and all I do like the stroller, I have not used it a ton in the few months I have had it but when I do use it, it works fine. I had a single BOB and the BOB is STROLLER HEAVEN. Phil and teds quality does not even come close to the BOB quality. The BOB is a real rugged, tough, smooth as a dream (with built in suspension), comfy seats, nice hood, nice storage, etc... My friends and I had our BOBs for 4 years (my friend is a exercise nut and a jogger and hiker and uses hers daily). Not once did we have to replace a single tire or anything at all, everything still works and functions like it did the day we bought it. I can already see that the Phil and Ted quality is not going to stand the test of time. Even though the Phil and ted costs more, it is more cheaply made. I wish BOB would make a tandem double!!!!The pros...It fits 2 kids but is the size of a singleI like the rear seat recline, it gets a good enough angle for my baby to nap.I like the foot brake, it is easy to engage and is strong.I like the follow the sun hood (though I prefer an oversized hood that comes all the way down to cover your kid like the BOB.Cons....My kids are large in size, around 95th percentile each, and they fit okay in the stroller (they could have more room, but it is not awful). My oldest's legs and cramped in the front seat, and he would have been too big for the back seat by 1 1/2. My youngest is tall and lean... and his legs in the back are already cramped. But, it is not AWFUL, they could just use more leg room. And I worry my youngest's head will hang off the back seat in another 6 months. And he only has about another 5 lbs before he hits the weight limit... so he will probably outgrow it before age 2.No shocks, so the ride is bumpy and not very smooth. It does not handle or turn as well as even the HUGE and heavy double BOB.NO STORAGE AT ALL. You are lucky in you can fit a water bottle in the storage basket... and this is with a 10 month old in the back seat.The quality could be better... something about it screams cheaply made in China and I know I will have problems with it sooner than later.Another HUGE annoyance... the front seat pad slips down over 12 inches and bunches up behind your child EVERY time then get in... the liner is not snapped or attached to the seat, it just sits in there over the hard plastic... so you always have to pull it up after your kid gets in.Also for 700 dollars, they need to have a longer and better warranty!!! If you pay that much money on a stroller, you should have the product guaranteed for at least 2-3 years!!! Phil and Teds... what is wrong with you??? Give your customers at LEAST a 2 year warranty and STAND BY your product!!! I have paid $30 on toasters with better customer service and a better warranty.It does NOT fold with the doubles seat, I called phil and teds directly and only the vibe and verve do this.All in all, there are better strollers on the market.UPDATE: I purchased the stroller from Along Comes a Baby around 3 months ago and already had to go in for the warranty. So I decided to sell it after getting it fixed and decided to get something better. I was right in my opinion that it would not last and was not rugged and able to take regular use.	
- 1	Food gets stuck in the masher part, and in the grooves on the bottom.  Also, the product details say it is 'imported' but doesn't list the country of origin.  I should have known that it was made in China.  :(	
1. 	Hands-down one of the best purchases we made.  My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2.  The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect, and then how to combine melodies.  A really fantastic gift.	
- 1	My husband is incredibly adept at putting the hardest stuff together, and while it only took him 2 hours to build this dresser, there are a million teeny, tiny parts to use. I would not suggest this item to anyone who sucks at putting together things, like I am.It's a really pretty dresser/change station, and matches our crib but the drawers are not solid wood, they are made of flimsy particle board. Boo on that. The wood itself is also pretty chip as there are dings and scratches in it just from shipping.I wouldn't have been disappointed looking at and maybe buying something else. There was one piece that was broken so we have to call and get that replaced. The changing table part doesn't fit a standard changing pad so that kind of sucks too.PROS- It looks prettyCONS- Cheap material, broken parts, hard to put together, changing table top is small.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	
- 1	With all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this product. Upon assembly, my husband pointed out that the slits made to take the cards apart are actually just slightly too small and will cause ripping. Poor design.Secondly, and more importantly, the mobile wouldn't fit on our crib or changing table as it is apparently designed for a crib with a short bar at the top. We have a Babyletto brand crib and changing table, so nothing weird or unusual. So sad. Now we have to return it.Before buying, make sure your crib or changing table has only a thin bar at the top in order to accomodate this mobile! I'm sure if this weren't the case I would have otherwise been quite happy with this product!	
1. 	These are really great even though they do not protect from spills as well as some other brands. The reason I prefer these is because there is nothing left in the cup, unlike the other spill-proof cups which have a bulky seal on the inside. The bulky seal tends to trap liquid inside and my son gets frustrated when he can't get the last little bit out of the cup.These are also great for mixing medicine with juice. Since there is no liquid left in the cup, you know that your little one was able to get all the medication along with their drink.	
1. 	We have a raised stone hearth fireplace. It was the greatest feature of our family room until we had a baby. It is super easy to put on, works really well and I KNOW we would have had lots more tears, bumbs, cuts, bangs, etc. if this wasnt on our fireplace. We've also used it on some other wood furnture and it works well.	
1. 	I have 0 complaints about this gate! I purchased it from our local W*l-Mart for 34.97, and didn't have to wait for it to be shipped to me. I would suggest checking at your local store before waiting for it to be shipped. (Super-saver shipping takes forever) We use this gate to keep our Sheltie in the kitchen when she is eating, and to keep our 4 year old and our 13 month olds out of the kitchen. We love it! Perfect all around! Our 13 month old uses it to balance when watching me cook, and she shakes the door, hard, and it is just as sturdy as it could be! Opening it and closing it is very simple, and it has the slam shut feature, so you don't have to push the button and pull back the handle to shut it, that would be a pain. We will get many years of use out of this, considering it can keep our 4 year old out! It is just great!	
- 1	the red part is way too big for baby's mouth. my baby does not like it at all. she occasionally tries to chew on the leaves part, but that is it. i don't recommend this product.	
1. 	We use this every day. I love that it covers her entire lap! Might even buy another one. Easy to clean, too.	
- 1	my baby would not latch starting day 3 so I started using the nipple shield as a temporary solution, because the baby latched right on to it and the &#34;contact&#34; is definitely the best one out there. however, he would not ween off of it and latch to my nipple after weeks of trying. breastfeeding also became extremely painful with the shield on or off. my boy is now 8 weeks, i have seen multiple lactation consultants, my midwives & doctors, i have gotten his tongue tie clipped, been treated for everything under the sun and still no latch! i think that the nipple shield delayed proper treatment and allowed him to develop a preference for artificial nipples. although i'm still trying to breastfeed daily i usually use a bottle... still hopeful!	
- 1	This case is very poorly made and doesn't really close all the way.  It just feels like fabric has been glued to a cheap plastic box.	
1. 	This came in the mail pretty quick to me which was great. I ordered this for storing my breast milk that I will be pumping at work. Its a nice size but I wouldn't think it could hold as much as it says it does. But since I'm just going to be storing milk storage bags in there I'm not worried about it. It comes with a reusable icepack but I'll probably be adding another one in there that way it will be colder in there. But other than that it seems to be a good bag so far.	
- 1	This unit was pretty good until the toggle power switch broke. It is fairly intuitive to use, picture was decent (a lot of people have complained about the video, but I thought it was good enough), but the battery life, even when new, wasn't remotely what is advertised. When I purchased it, it promised eight hours on battery but was beeping at us after four.A little more than a year after we bought it, the toggle power switch broke. Motorola offers no support after one year. For a monitor this expensive to break at a year of normal use is ridiculous, and that Motorola clearly doesn't stand behind its products (don't get me started on the Razr...) is pathetic.At this point, we can still use it, as at least it was already on when it broke, but it has to stay plugged in, because when the battery dies and it powers off, we won't be able to turn it on again.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	
- 1	Even after watching the videos online, we couldn't figure out how our newborn son's legs were supposed to fit into this. So we waited a few weeks and tried again, once he was a little bigger and didn't require the booster cushion. The bottom of the insert has a confusing strap that doesn't seal the bottom of the insert. You can't put the baby's feet in the bottom, because they slip through the holes on either side of the strap. You can't put their feet outside when they're still tiny, because they're not big enough to straddle you yet. So we had to wait until our son was big enough that he didn't need the insert, and we basically never used it.	
1. 	Not only is this bib super cute...it is super easy to clean. Literally just wipe it off and its good to go for next time.Awesome bib...much better than the other wipe clean bibs out there. Will definately be buying a couple more!!	
- 1	It worked fairly well, starting out, then the bristles began to fall out this morning. I've only had it a couple of days, but the bottles have at least 6 pieces to wash and maintain. I was hoping it would stand up to the constant use. Perhaps I just managed to get a bad brush, but it didn't last; at least not for me.	
1. 	This bottle does have a lot of parts to clean but if you weigh the options of spending about an extra 10 minutes per day cleaning bottle and your baby having less gas, it is worth it. This bottle has 5 parts to clean and others usually have about 3. So if you clean 8 bottles per day and the Dr. Brown's bottles have 2 extra parts, that is like cleaning 16 extra parts per day. Really, it takes maybe 10 seconds per extra part. So, what is an extra 2-3 minutes. Nothing!! Everyone says, yes they are great bottles but there are so many parts to clean. Really, think about it. It doesn't take that much longer to clean! I will stand by these bottles all the way...less gas, less smacking when he eats and a happier baby in the end. And, I have tried every bottle including, Avent, Playtex vent air, MAM and others. Also, get the 8 oz bottles right away. If you spend the money on the smaller bottles because you baby only eats 4 oz now, he/she will be eating more in a few weeks/months and then you will have to buy more bottles. 3oz fits into an 8 oz bottle so why not just get the larger bottles right away.	
- 1	If your child likes open and close the door this product is not going to last for very long. It cracks so be careful and watch it so your child does not hurt themselves.	
1. 	By far the best bib I have found to date! Excellent quality and the most adorable prints. I know others complained about the quality but if you wash and dry by hand per the instructions they will last forever!! They keep my children dry and food, drinks, markers, playdoh, etc... Off my child. They wipe off very easily. My child would get sick in the car and we would put the bib on before leaving the house and this would catch most of what came up. We are so thankful for these bibs and highly recommend them.	
1. 	This is a nice option for those without electricity or if you want a silent pump. It took me 30 mins to pump 3 oz. With the electric version it takes me 15 mins. Would definitely recommend to all if you are looking for a hand pump.	
1. 	We bought Playtex bottles for the first 2 kids, and just in time for the new baby, we received this set free from Amazon. My wife is a Family Nurse Practitioner and she considers this type of bottles the best for our kids. The main reason? When the baby drinks her milk out of the bottle, pressure builds up inside. With regular bottles, it is very easy for the silicone/plastic nipple to contract so it makes up for the milk that was taken out. That in turn makes it hard for the baby to continue drinking. One solution would be to constantly turn the regular bottle or just take it out and pull the nipple out once in a while. With this Playtex set, you do not have to worry about it. It is very convenient and the nipple does not get stuck to the bottle. The only potential downside is having more pieces to clean - as each bottle has 2 extra pieces to help with the pressure flow on the bottom. This is definitely recommended. For kids 1-year and older, we prefer thePlaytex 3 Pack BPA Free Ventaire Crystal Clear Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce, as they have a smaller diameter and easier to hold.	
1. 	Bought this for my daughter's first birthday.  Nice educational toy and good for her Physical and occupational therapy as well.  I recommend to others.  Everything fits nicely inside the cake.  My only surprise was how small it is.  It's smaller than I had assumed it was.	
1. 	This is definitely the pump to have if you are going to have to pump much.  I had to pump the first month of my baby's life while she was in the hospital.  I had a lot of trouble getting my supply up since she wasn't on me, and I wasn't even able to hold her much.  I used the hospital pump during the day, and at night this one after I got it.  At first I had a single pump (Medela), but it took twice as long.  Plus, the lactation consultants say that double pumping stimulates your production better.  I got as much from this pump as the one at the hospital.  Pumping is not fun, breastfeeding is so much easier, but if you have to pump this is the way to go.  Medela pumps are much better than the rest. Breast milk is so much better than formula. Whatever it takes, it is worth them getting the breast milk.	
1. 	Bought it for my 9 month old baby girl, she can sit resting her feet on the ground and her back and arms are well comfortable too. This potty will grow with her.	
- 1	I bought this after purchasing the Bugaboo Donkey but unfortunately it does not sit right on the handles. It flops down & is very cumbersome. I wish I still had to packaging to return it because we don't use it at all. Just attach your diaper bag & use the pockets in that because this doesn't sit right at all.	
1. 	I received 2 packages as ordered and on time.  One pack was blue and one was pink. The pacis differ slightly from the photo. Not sure if it makes a difference, but the ones I received the rubber part is pulled through and clamped under the paci. These seem to expel water from inside the nipple easier, which is good.  Because I have had some that looked like the one pictured and it is difficult to clear the water after washing.  Then baby makes a squishing noise when sucking and makes it hard for him to sleep. My lactation consultant recommended these originally because the angled tip ones can cause tongue thrusting and we were having issues.  These tend to help baby get his tongue under the bulb. This is the second time I ordered from here and received the same style.  Last time I got two packages of pink.  I have a boy.  But it is okay, as we use these for sleep at home only.  Since these are so hard to find retail (only at Wall***t)and often out of stock, we have been using a similar shaped paci from avent? I think on outings. I wanted to get him used to a different type in case we ran into a situation where we couldn't find this paci.  Overall I am happy with the product and the shipper (preferred mart), I just wish we could pick our color or they sent neutral colors.	
- 1	Even when the gate is lined up properly, it is difficult to open and close with one hand. If you lift it by its handle, it does not lift easily. I end up sticking my foot under it to lift it from the middle.If I were to purchase another gate, I would get something that I could swing closed like a door without having to line up holes.That said, as a gate, it does fine. It attaches to the wall with screws, so it's very secure. I used longer screws, because the provided ones were not long enough to hit the studs.	
- 1	I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better mouse trap.To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers)	
1. 	Not only is this Sleep Sheep super soft the sound is great!!  Volume is easily adjusted and gets pretty loud even tho the speaker is inside the sheep.  I really like the different timers you can set but for our little budndle of joy I wish it were longer. Regardless our 4mo old sleeps so much better with a little sound and we use the Rain and Ocean regularly.  This is a must buy for light sleepers since it really does a great job of hiding outside noise from cars and neighbors and even if your baby sleeps like a rock this Sleep Sheep is a great for calming down those fussy moments !!! &#60;3	
1. 	I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.  I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.  I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.  It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.  Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.  If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.	
1. 	We bought this when our little one was about 8 months old.  She is now 3 years old and still uses it every night.  I have now purchased one for my nephew and my niece.  They love theirs too.  It's a must-have for young children.  I've replaced batteries only twice since we bought it.	
- 1	I purchased this because the price was right. It's terrible. The video part works great but it has constant static and if you walk between the imaginary line that link the monitors the static gets louder & the video is interrupted. And battery power is dead after 15 minutes.	
- 1	Before you purchase this product, please look at the updates other reviewers have added to their initial review.  I was coming back to update my review, but realized the review I'd written was actually for the monitor I'd purchased to replace this one.At first, this video baby monitor was awesome.  My wife and I would bring the monitor upstairs so that we could watch television for a little while before we went to bed, and we always ended up just watching our son over the monitor instead.  The night vision was not bad for low-light, and when our son took daytime naps, the color picture was very good.  The sound was good quality, and we liked that we could turn a few lullabyes on and off from upstairs.  The range was also very good.But.When we went to visit some family about two and a half months after buying the monitor, we set it up and I realized about half an hour later that the picture looked as if it hadn't changed at all.  I went to go check on my son (the room we were stayign in was on the other side of the house), and he was crying miserably.  You'd never know by the picture frozen on the screen!We tried repeatedly to use the monitor after that day, but it never worked well again.  After reading several other reviews here, it seems as if the same thing happened to several other consumers.  For well over $100, this unit should be working as well as it did at first for several years, not 75 days.  We were (and remain) very disappointed with the product.I give the BABYVIEW20 two stars, but only because it has such great potential; it worked great at first.  But in no way would I recommend anyone purchasing this product.  It's just poor quality, and is now a baby toy for my 16-month old.	
1. 	I tried using a baby nail clipper to clip my son's nail.  They could never really cut his nail short enough and always leave a rough edge, so I ended up spending an hour trying to file it smooth (hard to file since baby nails are so soft).  Using a scissor to cut baby nails sound very dangerous to me, but I'm out of options, so I gave it a try.  It worked better than I thought actually.  Of course I did it when the baby was deep asleep.  I found a comfortable position, have enough lighting, then started cutting away very slowly.  It take a little practice at first, and got easier after 2 to 3 nails.  I found for each nail, cutting the corner, then middle, then the other corner works pretty well.  Since every finger is shaped a little different, this works on some better than others.  The scissor is sharp enough that the edges are not rough after cutting.  I've only used it once, but so far I like it.	
1. 	i was not fully awake (caring for a newborn and all) when i ordered these and thought i was ordering extra breast cushions for my pump (which would be nice) so clearly i did not read carefully and was surprised by what i got. However, i am thrilled because i also was looking for something like this (a different name was recommended) and these work great. when i pump or nurse i leak on the other side. When nursing i would soak myself and my daughter and pumping was not much better, at least my little girl wouldn't be soaked. :-) using these i typically catch an ounce in them which is worth so much to me. my daughter doesn't seem to notice that she isn't getting soaked, she didn't seem to care before but i sure did.i'm so happy with them that i came back to order an extra set for my emergency pump kit for the car.i do enjoy saying its my best accidental purchase so far :-)-Traci (using shared hubbys account)	
1. 	I loves this swaddle me!  It works really well, once baby gets a little older he can start to wriggle out but if wrapped nice and snug it works really well.  Our baby slept in this until he was almost 6 months old and he slept so much better than without a swaddle.  Unlike swaddle clothes this stays snug longer and prevents escape better!	
1. 	I bought these to replace my leaking Avent bottles.  I've been using them a 4 months and I've not had any problems.  No leaks.  However I wish they made more rate flow nipples the #2's are too slow so I pokeed 4 more holes in them. Now my daughter drinks her bottle quickly instead of sucking for 15 mins and getting a red face.	
- 1	These were another excursion in my never-ending quest to find good food storage containers (currently betting on the non-baby product, standard Glad-ware 4-ounce little round containers). They don't work. first of all, they have no give so if you fill them just a tad too much and put them in your freezer (where the food will expand from the water that is in it) the top will pop off. Second, the tray is useless: the containers do not twist into them, they just stand in their gooves - until you hit them even the slightest bit and then they fall out. The tops twist - sort of but not very much so they are don't actually stay on. They are also not leak-proof.	
- 1	The first negative is that this potty is cheaply made in China using low grade plastic. Ours came with cracks already in the plastic where the two halves join. Not enough to ruin the potty, but enough to suggest it won't last long and wasn't made with quality in mind.By far the worst thing about this, however, is the extremely poor design choice to join the two halves (the colored top and white bottom piece) with the seam open UPWARDS. (Look closely at the piectures and you'll see what I mean.) Think about it: you've got a potty made for kids who are just learning to use one, and you design it so that any liquid that spills on the outside will get trapped in a tiny seam that you can't separate? Brilliant. The two halves aren't designed to come apart to clean it. Good luck getting urine completely out of this unless your kid is some sort of urinary genius that never has a miss. You'll need to spray it down in the bathtub to get everything out of the joint between the two plastic parts. We've had two other pottys, and neither was so poorly designed as to have that problem. I recommend the Baby Bjorn, the potty we used with our first-born, but pretty much any other company you choose will probably sell a better one than this. The Bjorn, for example, is made with a one base piece, and no parts have difficult to clean crevices.I'd think you would have to try hard to screw up the engineering of a piece of plastic to pee in, and yet Prince Lionheart has managed to. Royally.	
- 1	These are not very absorbent and they smelled so bad after a couple uses.  I hate that they're filled with polyester instead of more cotton.	
- 1	What genius decided to make this thing so SHORT?! A lady who just delivered a baby doesn't need the added back ache of having to bend over nearly to the ground to throw away a diaper.Not only that, but the handle sticks (and then pops off the side) on a regular basis.Also, when you open the chute to dispose of a diaper, you get a giant nose full of everything that's in the bin.  In other words, the awful stink that is in the bin is scooped into the disposal chamber and wafts out into the room every time you throw a diaper away. This is definitely NOT odor proof.The old model was taller and didn't hurt our backs.The old model did not STINK every time you threw away a diaper.WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY CHANGE THE DESIGN?!	
- 1	Ok, Sent this back for a few reasons. Main one - small buttons hi tech almost like an iPhone. Now if you have babies you know the house will be a mess things fall and this looks like one of those devices that if falls ...dies. The stand is small and awkward.(does not feel secure)  You can choose if you want this monitor to beep or to vibrate. Why cant I just have video on and the sound of my baby crying instead? No I get this loud weird beep that will wake up everyone THEN you get sound from your baby. The video was descent but nothing special . Really 2 stars is fair.I got the levana instead. Much better.ps. I love other samsung products but they should do some research before putting this out in the market,	
- 1	Bought these because my boy has acid reflux and is supposed to eat upright.  I was hopful they would work well.  However they leak.  No matter what I tried they leaked.  Had others try them for me, they leaked for them.  They are not worth the money, I won't even attempt to sell them at a yard sale because I dont want to burden anyone with the frustration of a leaky bottle.  DO NOT BUY.	
- 1	This thing is terrible. I burnt the crap out of my hands because the thing doesn't close all the way. I also picked it up by the handle and the whole bottom part fell to the floor. God forbid it falls to the floor while your little one is around. I had to rewash those bottles. This is a very cheap, poorly made product. Please buy something else.	
- 1	I was bummed but this product did not work at all.  The mane fell out all over the place. The back was too thick so my daughters head was forced forward in a bad position.	
1. 	I tried 6 different cup holders for my Baby Jogger City Versa (LOVE the stroller, by the way) and none of them worked until I tried this one. It was relatively easy to install and it fits great. The cup holder is big and feels sturdy. I was also able to easily remove the stickers so the cup holder looks like it belongs with my stroller. The stroller folds easily with the cup holder attached so there is no need to ever remove it.	
- 1	I read some great reviews about how much babies like this product so decided to buy it. I was incredibly disappointed that it was such a pain to put together. They do not give you a screw driver and  two of the screws which are meant to hold the main unit that attaches to the crib just would not screw tight because a regular sized screw driver would not go deep enough to tighten it.	
- 1	I gave the review 4 stars for a great product.  However, I subtracted a star because the small is too small for our 5 months old, weighs 13 lbs and 23 inches long (small for his age).  He can't stretch his legs out and looks very uncomfortable.  Halo does not make a swaddle blanket larger than small (took off another star for that).  I'm lucky that we were able to last as long as we did.  My friend's kids sized out at 3 months.  Yikes!	
- 1	this towel is too thin. i would use it on the  beach as a light and bright towel but i don' t need a beach towel, i need a bath towel for my baby. i am returning this item	
1. 	We purchased an expensive and highly rated newborn to toddler bathtub when our first daughter was born.  What a joke! I gave it away after two baths and we ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub instead. Older and wiser, we purchased this EXTREMELY CHEAP sponge when our second daughter was born. It keeps her fairly submerged, supported, and warm, and makes baths easy as pie (and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did).  Sure, it may wear out sooner than later, but who cares?  At this price, we can afford to go through a couple of them.	
1. 	When people ask me what to get a friend who's having a baby, I point them to these bibs.  They are really well designed and fit my little guy perfectly from 2 months on up.  He's 21 months now and we still use them every day.  2 is good but i'd rather have 4 so one could live in the diaper bag.Pros:LightweightEasy to fastenCatches everything!Even water!Easy to pull food out of and eat - less waste!Fits inside a high chair - not stiffCons:It wouldn't work as a drool bib since it's not absorbentWhile he was learning to drink from a cup I could literally pour the water back into the cup from his bib.  If he drops something in there, he will pick it up and eat it.  I love love love these bibs.	
1. 	I use cloth diapers and was anxious to at least get the BM's into the toilet instead of having to wash them. I bought this for my son when he was 8mths old and we have been using it for BM's. I am fortunate to be able to stay home with my son so I am in close contact with him and can tell when he is trying to go #2. As soon as I see his BM face (starts pushing, and eyelids get red) I quickly take off his diaper and sit him on this potty. It works great. With him being so small you do need to sit directly in front him and entertain with a song or a toy as he does his business but it is worth it. I don't always catch the BM's but have to clean a lot fewer ones by using the toilet.This seat is comfortable and I like the back part because he can sit back without falling over. If he is not positioned quite right he might pee outside but for the most part if you are watching closely it contains everything just fine. :)	
1. 	We bought this mattress after some research and on the recommendation of a very handy review book.  I think this is an excellent mattress.  We inherited another mattress from my brother that was a tradition inner spring type mattress and was not impressed.  The springs could be felt through the top of the mattress and it was Very heavy.  This foam mattress is solid enough and well built enough to stand up to my toddler's bouncing and best of all, is light enough for me to very easily lift the mattress one handed and change the sheets now that there's potty training going on.	
- 1	Could not get these to stay on. Edited to add - I was using these on sliding glass closet doors, indoors, on pre-cleaned glass, etc.  No paint, nothing to interfere with the adhesive.No matter what I did - they fell off.  I got really sick of picking them up and trying to re-stick them.If they would stick, they would be a nice product!But as they are, they are gracing my local landfill.	
- 1	I returned this changing pad cover. It didn't fit the changing pad well at all. Material felt cheap, not impressed.	
1. 	1. My toddler does not mind wearing this harness, which was my biggest concern when I purchased it!2. I can take off the leash and leave on the straps when I need to put my child in a stroller.3. I find it useful to hold onto the straps while my baby is learning to walk. This way he will not fall all the way every time he stumbles.4. This harness can adjust to go over multiple layers of clothes.	
1. 	My son hates tummy time and until I got this item he would cry from the moment I put him down for tummy time until I picked him up.  It was really a struggle for me to encourage tummy time when he disliked it so badly.  This item has improved the quality and enjoyment for my son.  He now rolls over to his tummy on his own to play with the mat.  The product is simple to use and effective.	
1. 	We love this for background noise for our toddler to sleep with. He has had a ocean waves machine since the hospital where he was born, and I swear he sleeps better with it.  It has really helped us establish a great sleeping pattern with him, which means mom and dad sleep better.  I love that this one plugs in, our previous one worked on batteries which drove me nuts when they died in the wee morning hours and I would have to stumble in to replace them.  I only wish this had a better way to mount it on the wall out of playful fingers reach.	
- 1	We currently have four of these gates installed in our home. Personally, no one in our home has tripped over the bottom support rail. I don't see how you could unless you drag your feet when you walk. These gates do have a couple of potential downfalls. When you allow them to auto close, it's really loud. Like wake your kid up from her nap at the other end of the house loud. Also, the other day I was a bit aggressive lifting up on one of the gates when I opened it and the screw that holds the top hinge together popped out and the whole gate came up out of the frame. Let me say though, I was trying to open it quickly and jerked the gate up much harder than a person would with normal use. I like that you have to lift the gate to open it. Keeps our smallest child from being able to open it but the older kids can manage it just fine. That lift to open feature is one reason why I wouldn't recommend it for the top of stairs. It would be difficult.Update: February 2013. I was a fan of these gates in the beginning. After a lot of use, they are losing their auto close function. Not that bid of a deal, my hands aren't broken, I can certainly take two seconds to close a baby gate. What I am becoming irritated with is the failure that I wrote about in my initial review. We have now had all four gates come completely off their frames multiple times. Other than the instance I wrote about previously, I am not strong arming these gates, this shouldn't be happening. The problem is that the post on the top of the gate that fits into the frame is made of plastic. The screw that hold said gate post in the frame is metal. The plastic post has cracked on every single gate and the metal screw is popping out, thus allowing the gate to come completely off the frame when opened. The gate comes off, the metal screw goes flying one way, the metal spring goes flying another and I am left on hands and knees looking for these two pieces before the baby finds them and chokes on them. Not impressed.I don't see a way for this to be fixed. We can't uncrack the plastic post, the only way to fix it is to get a new gate. Unless Munchkin can figure out a way to reinforce the plastic post or make it out of a different material, I don't see how this won't happen after time on a replacement.	
1. 	The biggest problem with it is the smell that escapes from the diaper into the bin.  There is simply no way around this.  It might not be too bad while the bin is closed, but once the bag changing time comes, you'll be in for all of foul odor.  One way to mitigate it is to use Munchkin nursery fresheners or any other form of the deodorant/baking soda and place them at the bottom of the bin.  I use two and they help the odors coming from the bag into the container.  I would not use this diaper pail in any room other than a bathroom, where the smell can be captured and gotten rid off through ventilation.PROS:- It is large so no frequent bag cycles are needed- Offers flexibility of frequent or infrequent bag changes without wasting the plastic.- Offers a very convenient foot pedal to open the lid- Has an attractive look especially in many offered colors- Does not require for the diaper to be pushed down - if the diaper is soiled enough and is heavy it will fall through by itselfCONS:- Because it is large and the diapers just fall through it is hard to judge how much diapers there are in there.  A lot of diapers in there mean there is a lot of smell, and the bag can be pretty heavy- Mediocre at containing the odors coming from the diapers; especially evident when bag cycle times comes	
1. 	I wanted a pot for boys and one that could be used for a healthy (chunky) child. My son used this pot for the entire potty training process. He had one at home and at both grandparents houses. The pee guard did its job and the size was great for my chunky little one.	
- 1	When I first recieved it, it looked really pretty and thick, but after a few washes it started to tear. I wouldn't recommend it.	
1. 	I'm struggling to come up with even one negative thing to say about this swing.If I could make two suggestions for future versions it would be to put an AC adaptor on it so we could plug it in (I think the toy manufactures are in bed with the battery makers!).  After all this isn't a small portable swing, it pretty much stays where it is.  The second suggestion would be to allow the music play until I turn it off.Otherwise, this swing is perfect!  My baby loves the mirror over her to look up and stare at the other baby above her.	
- 1	Too big and bulky for little ones, and it didn't get totally clean in the wash.  The leg holes are gathered and collected poop in the folds even after the prewash etc.	
- 1	They don't seem to stick very well.  Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table.	
1. 	This is a great item for little tots who have just potty trained and aren't quite ready to sit loosely on the big toilets.  We got this for our recently PT'd 2 year old. I like how it conveniently folds up in my purse (I keep it in the zip lock bag it came in).  I just unfold it and plop it on the toilet.Some reviewers complained about it not fitting right. I have not found this to be true on any toilet we've used so long as you make sure and put it at the front of the toilet with the lips on the outer edge of the seat.  If you try to put that part in the middle/center hole, then it won't work.  So I'm going to chalk up other users' problems to user error, not product malfunction as we've had zero issues.My only complaint is that because it's foldable, if my daughter tries to push down on the sides and lifts up, it will start to fold in a little.  But this is a very minor complaint as it really does work great overall.  I've just had to teach her not to do that.	
1. 	This is a really fun toy/teether--even the adults like to play with it!  But, while our 7 month old likes to play with it--the bright colors and easy twisting motion of the toy are a draw--he doesn't really &#34;teeth&#34; on it as much as he does some of his other, simpler teethers.	
- 1	I agree that it came incredibly creased, but it didn't matter because it was too small anyway. My toddler wears a 2T/3T hat.	
- 1	I have leather headrests in my car and this product slipped all over the place. It never stayed put while driving. I also hated the installation design and directions. You can only loop it around one way (over/under) and it is just slippery on the leather.  There isn't a way to stabilize this mirror. I returned it and am trying one by britax back seat mirror that has way more features and costs the same on amazon.	
1. 	This bib is super cute, and washes nice, but I really did notlike the velcro fastener.  My baby got a cut and a scratchedbeck of the neck from this velcro.  It is sharp and I was nothappy about that.  Make sure you secure the velcro overlappingit to prevent scratching.  I am not liking velcro bibs anymore.	
1. 	This is a nice rack to place bottles on.  I use Avent bottles for my baby and they fit really well.  Just wish it was a bit larger to fit more stuff on it, especially the nipples which are larger than regular bottle nipples.  Overall, it's nice and I would buy it again.	
1. 	The Happy Hippo Travel Gym is a great buy for anyone. It is fairly inexpensive and provides lots of entertainment for your little one. It is colorful and has a hanging mirror, rattle and toy that are all detachable. All of this is packed into a convenient carrying case that zips up.  The gym is great to unzip and lay on the floor for tummy time or back time. It has just enough padding that your baby can play or nap comfortably on it and still not take up a large amount of space. The only down fall to this product is you have to make sure the levers are turned so that the overhead wire that holds the toys stays in place. If it is not tightened it will start to droop towards the floor. It is not harmful to your baby in any way it just does not stay in place unless it is screwed in.  We have two of these, one for our home and one for Grandma's. My baby absolutely loves his tummy and back time on the Happy Hippo.	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these for 2 separate openings.  They arrived promptly and packaged very well to avoid any shipping damage.  One package contained all parts, however the other was missing one of the hanging brackets (but gave me 2 of another part) needed to attach to the wall.  I could have gone through the trouble of shipping back to Amazon.com and ordering another, but instead decided to contact the manufacturer directly.  Within 2 days, I received the correct piece and now have both gate units in full use.  My grandson is 13 months and he has attempted to push it to dislodge it, but it held its ground!  The gate is very easy to set up, only needing a drill and phillips screwdriver.  I think this was a very smart investment and you can't beat the price.  It folds up compactly and swivels so you can keep it attached on one side and have it out of the way against a wall...but you can easily detach the entire unit and just keep the hinge and lock pieces on the wall.  The color is not intrusive whatsoever.  Although this product is made of plastic, it is made very well.  Our entryways are from removing 2 French doors each entry, so I was limited as to what gates would fit such a large space.  These fit the bill, and we still have a good 3-4 inches left for full extension.  I am contemplating on ordering another gate for another area around my kitchen...but will wait and see if I really need another one to replace the piece meal gate I am using in that area.  I highly recommend these gates.  Great price, great quality, and the customer service with the manufacturer stands behind their products...and of course, Amazon.com is the best way to shop too!	
1. 	Smells so good and seems to work well for cradle cap!  It's a good amount of the money, too. Love it!	
1. 	This does a great job of converting small to medium quantities of food into a consistency that is perfect for our 6 month old daughter.  We had used the hand crank thing but that was a pain.  This is also preferable to a blender because when preparing smaller quantities as the results are more uniform and there is less lost to the equipment.My only reservation was the comment about the lack of an on/off switch.  I was about to run to the hardware store (quick as a bunny) and buy one to add to the line cord.  However my wife, no stranger to a kitchen, pointed out that this food mill works just like... a food mill.  It only goes on when you place the motor housing on top of the container *and* press down.  That is the on/off switch.  Adding something else would only make the thing more difficult to operate than it needs to be.  In fact, we leave the motor housing plugged in all the time.  When it's our daughter's dinner time we fill the container with stuff, set the housing on top of the container, and press down.  A few seconds later we have a nourishing and freshly made meal for her.  (We usually make a little extra and add it to our dog's food because she likes it too.)As we go through our parenting journey we are learning there are certain essentials and this, imho, is one of them.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.	
1. 	I gave it at the birth of my grandson. My daughter is using them daily and likes them. It has a good reputation and fit the need.	
- 1	I bought this set hoping that despite the low price, it would work based on the reviews on this site. Well, not for us- we get horrible static reception/feedback despite moving the monitors to several different areas in the house. I really like the light sensor option on the front, and wished these would have worked out for us. And yes, battery hogs they are- I think my batteries lasted a day and a half with the monitor being on maybe a few hours each day, before they went out. I'll be returning this back to Amazon...	
1. 	This set contain all the bottle that you need for the first six months. good product and I had been use this over six months. Highly recommend to other first time mom.	
1. 	We were very happy to be able to install these easily in our windows, which are fairly new.  My 2.5yo toddler cannot remove them and then open the windows.  When he is not home, I do take them off certain windows if I want to open them all the way (or more than 4 inches, which is where we set them for our own peace of mind.)  We are using these in a 2nd floor for safety, not so much security.  I like that they can be removed quickly in the event of an emergency. We consider these a safe alternative to window guards that look like gates across all your windows.	
1. 	Great product, we use it quite often. Its easy to put on and take off. Baby falls asleep in it. Small quirks though, the only issues I have is with the bottom part where the babys bottom sits. It just doesn't seem ergonomic to the babys legs. It spreads them apart and is tight on the legs, especially when hes facing forward. Also, the top part that folds down is another issue, he puts his mouth on the fabric, which is fine but also on the plastic part that secures him to the chest, another design flaw. Other than that, I've been pretty happy with this carrier.	
1. 	I got this pillow early in my 2nd trimester and love it!  It's great for side sleeping and back support while sitting up in bed.  I followed other reviewers' advice and air dried the cover then had my husband put it on.**update** I was inspired by my chiropractor office where they have belly pillows so you can lie on your stomach so one night when I had an extremely achy back around 28 weeks, I made a donut with this pillow and gently laid down.... Amazing!  First time I'd been able to lie on my stomach in bed.  My amazing hubby proceeded to give me a back rub :)	
1. 	We purchased these to secure a large mirror and bookcase to keep our toddler safe.  My husband said these were pretty easy to install (and he's not the handy type) and that they took no time at all.  They are secure to the wall and piece of furniture and I'm confident that the furniture will not topple over when my toddler is pulling and leaning on it.	
1. 	Simple, soft, and washes well, we have a few of these, they are very soft, wash well and seem to wear well.	
1. 	This is a genius product, we always have one of those right on top of our changing pad (we still use a changing pad cover of course) and we also use it on the go when we change our baby outside. This disposable pad saved us lots of trouble in those times when accidents happen, it is just does not let anything go through it so the underlying changing pad remains clean, just finish the change and throw this paper away. We keep using the disposable paper until it gets dirty and only then do we throw it away, so that we do not use too many of them, but when an accident happens at 3 in the morning these are a saver!	
1. 	I have bought 3 diffrent cradle swings for myself and other people. This is the only 1 so far the motor has not died in. I really like this swing. The seat is nicely padded with the head rest and I love the globe mirror on the bottom. The animals around seem like they are more for others entertainment than the baby's because they are mounted to the sides and move and do not hang down. I also really like the nature sounds. My daughter and nephew seem like they enjoyed the sounds. The toy bar on the front is fun nothing fancy but they entertained my nephew. This would be the perfect swing if it had an a/c adapter because it does eat batteries even the expensive ones.	
1. 	I have a few packs of these bottles and I love them for storing my milk in the freezer-- 2.5oz containers, allow me to freeze with more peace of mind than the plastic bags that many others use.  I've just heard too many stories about bags ripped/broken and milk loss.  I work too hard to make it to see that happen!My only reasons for not giving these 5 stars:1) I wish they were bigger, but that's Medela's product team's issue, not Amazon's.2) The description on these says they're sterile, but I've gotten sterile ones that were individually shrink wrapped, and these were NOT.  So I don't fully trust that description.	
1. 	I love this bag.  Have not had any problems with zippers, it frees up my hands and it sits comfortable on the shoulder.  My husband likes it too, as it is not too childish.  It has lots of space, for extra set of clothes, 6 or so diapers, blanket, burp cloth, bottles, bib, etc.  We also have the larger messenger style for longer trips, it is great too.	
1. 	Awesome product, a little loud but overall does the job, we rented a machine from the hospital tht did the same for twice the money we paid for this, after realizing we needed additional time and they required additional fees, we opted to purchase this and keep rather than spend it on rental, great choice we made, highly recommended.	
- 1	i am submitting a picture with this review. I counted 13 errors where the cards are out of sync and the letter does not match with the animal depicted. The cards cannot be moved around to make this correct or I would keep them. Surprising for abc flash cards and disappointed I am dealing with return of this cheap item.	
- 1	Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.	
1. 	This was absolutely fabulous for my family.  We used it with frozen fruit for teething, and just about any snacks my baby wanted to eat.  I never had to worry about her choking and it was so easy to clean.I truely reccomend this product for worry free feeding!	
- 1	I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom.  Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel.  The concept works but the design is worthless.	
- 1	I used these bottles and loved them with my first child who was formula fed. Since then, the design has been changed (they added the ring)as well as the materials used. Everything I loved about them with my first I still love. The problem is with the nipples. My second is exclusively breastfed and the flow is just too fast. We are still using newborn nipples (baby is 4 months old) and it drowns him. Hes used to the super slow flow of eating on the breast and this just doesnt cut it. He ends up eating too fast and then throws up a good ounce of precious milk, only to be hungry again in 30 minutes. Needless to say, I am now in search of a new bottle.	
- 1	Ordered these by mistake, so I thought I'd give them a try anyway. Bad idea. The tabs that you are supposed to remove have a terrible perforation and need to be cut off. The liner doesn't fit right around the Playtex Drop-In bottle like it is supposed to. 3 out of 4 leaked when feeding. 1 out of 2 gave us milk explosions when squeezing the air out of the bottle -- and it was a very slow low pressure squeeze too. Wasted way too much breast milk that had me nearly in tears. Stick to the Drop-In style!	
1. 	I do in-home child care.  I bought one for the hallway on our main floor to block off the bedrooms to the kids.  This product is high quality.  I like it so much, I bought a second for our lower level to put at the bottom of the stairs.	
1. 	So, I was looking for good reviews on sippy cups and came across these Cars Insulator sippy cups and they are great. I love them, they do not leak. My son likes to play around with sippy cups when he's drinking from them and these are great for toddlers. Shipping was fast, price was a little high but so worth it. I would reccommend for parents.	
- 1	These toys are extremely hard and do not allow comfort for my teething baby. There's no give when you squeeze the toy. The plastic material is just really tough.	
1. 	These are the only bottles my son will use and of course this design is discontinued. I took away a star because I got a pack with 3 pink bottles. Figures. FYI - the Dr. Brown's nipples fit these bottles exactly the same as the Playtex and you can still get those in the store. Way cheaper than trying to find the Playtex ones.	
1. 	While watching my friend lug her whole travel system out of her trunk, I can pop this baby open with one hand.  It's a great product, very maneuverable and light with an excellent basket underneath for all that baby stuff.  One drawback: the cup holder is small and shallow - won't hold a thermal mug, but holds a standard styrofoam coffee cup.	
1. 	My daughter has a rotation of these Sleep Sacks. I wish these were a little tighter around the neck and arms, but it seems pretty comfortable for her. I especially like the pattern of this one. The animals are cute and work for a boy or a girl. She's on the tall side for eight months, so she is about to max out the length of the medium. I've tried theaden + anais 4 Pack Muslin Swaddle Wrap, Jungle Jamand the Merino Kids Baby Sleep Bag, 0-2 years, Oatmeal. Both are more generously sized and seemed a little too heavy for summer, but I'll probably use them again for fall and winter. The Merino Kids bag has some interesting features like adjustable snaps under the arms to make it tighter and a slot so you can run a car seat harness through it if need be. But, for the price, it should be special. The Halo Innovations Sleepsack is a much more affordable option and a great weight for summer.	
1. 	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!	
- 1	Very cool idea, but we can't use it because it doesn't fit our chairs correctly. The backs of our chairs are too high for it, because there's not enough material for the seat part to reach the seat on the chair-- it keeps my baby pulled up so there's a gap between her bottom and the chair. I've only used it once so far because of this. May try using it again when we go out and see if it fits chairs at restaurants or relatives houses better. It's been pretty useless so far...	
- 1	It did not get to the corners of my baby's nails so it left a weird angle and a sharper end to the nail. Needless to say, I had to buy the regular baby clippers and it worked like a charm. I got the safety 1st grooming set	
1. 	This toy hammock certainly is jumbo, fits the description perfectly. For some reason, it never occurred to me that even though this item is clearly billed for STUFFED animals, that items such as Beanie Babies or other bean filled animals are much heavier and the item will sag a lot or will break under the stress of all the weight. Either way, the stuffed animals that my son did have are in there, off the ground and it has stayed up perfectly.	
1. 	We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.	
1. 	My baby falls asleep quickly and he is very comfortable in it. The only thing i don't like is that it is not very sturdy.	
- 1	I bought these sippy cups based on the great reviews, but I'm disappointed. Yes, they don't leak, but my daughter (2 yrs old) has a hard time sucking the milk/juice from them, like the spill proof seal is a little too tight. And even when she does get the milk out, there is always about a half inch left that she can't get out because the spill proof insert sticks out too much and doesn't allow the milk to funnel down... even when I tried to drink from it to see why she was struggling with getting that last bit out, I couldn't. Bad design... wasteful and it frustrates my daughter because she can see more in the cup but can't get it out.	
1. 	We have the good fortune of taking our 8 month old daughter to work with us at our family owned business. The first one of these we bought was the blue/green version. We liked it so much we came back and bought a second chair for home. Cleanup is super easy. The only bad thing is that my daughter has already figured out how to remove the top tray. No big deal, we just take that off and feed her in the bottom tray attached to the seat. It also seems that she will have plenty of room to grow in this seat.Great chair and Great price!	
1. 	This is the perfect changer/dresser.  We love it - it's easy to put together and compliments any room.  The only con was the chaning pad...so we just bought a changing pad to put on top...which we will take off when he's ready to use it just as a dresser.  The drawers glide well, and are roomy.	
- 1	I wanted to love these because my favorite brand of pads, FuzziBunz, is no longer making overnight (super) pads. But I don't. They seem to slip more, bunch more, and although they are pleasantly thin, they absolutely hold a LOT less and lead to leaking - a problem I haven't had with other brands. These are are not even my second-favorite brand. I'll use them as backups or panty-liners, but I'm disappointed.	
- 1	I have 2 kids, ages 10 months and almost 4. All and all I do like the stroller, I have not used it a ton in the few months I have had it but when I do use it, it works fine. I had a single BOB and the BOB is STROLLER HEAVEN. Phil and teds quality does not even come close to the BOB quality. The BOB is a real rugged, tough, smooth as a dream (with built in suspension), comfy seats, nice hood, nice storage, etc... My friends and I had our BOBs for 4 years (my friend is a exercise nut and a jogger and hiker and uses hers daily). Not once did we have to replace a single tire or anything at all, everything still works and functions like it did the day we bought it. I can already see that the Phil and Ted quality is not going to stand the test of time. Even though the Phil and ted costs more, it is more cheaply made. I wish BOB would make a tandem double!!!!The pros...It fits 2 kids but is the size of a singleI like the rear seat recline, it gets a good enough angle for my baby to nap.I like the foot brake, it is easy to engage and is strong.I like the follow the sun hood (though I prefer an oversized hood that comes all the way down to cover your kid like the BOB.Cons....My kids are large in size, around 95th percentile each, and they fit okay in the stroller (they could have more room, but it is not awful). My oldest's legs and cramped in the front seat, and he would have been too big for the back seat by 1 1/2. My youngest is tall and lean... and his legs in the back are already cramped. But, it is not AWFUL, they could just use more leg room. And I worry my youngest's head will hang off the back seat in another 6 months. And he only has about another 5 lbs before he hits the weight limit... so he will probably outgrow it before age 2.No shocks, so the ride is bumpy and not very smooth. It does not handle or turn as well as even the HUGE and heavy double BOB.NO STORAGE AT ALL. You are lucky in you can fit a water bottle in the storage basket... and this is with a 10 month old in the back seat.The quality could be better... something about it screams cheaply made in China and I know I will have problems with it sooner than later.Another HUGE annoyance... the front seat pad slips down over 12 inches and bunches up behind your child EVERY time then get in... the liner is not snapped or attached to the seat, it just sits in there over the hard plastic... so you always have to pull it up after your kid gets in.Also for 700 dollars, they need to have a longer and better warranty!!! If you pay that much money on a stroller, you should have the product guaranteed for at least 2-3 years!!! Phil and Teds... what is wrong with you??? Give your customers at LEAST a 2 year warranty and STAND BY your product!!! I have paid $30 on toasters with better customer service and a better warranty.It does NOT fold with the doubles seat, I called phil and teds directly and only the vibe and verve do this.All in all, there are better strollers on the market.UPDATE: I purchased the stroller from Along Comes a Baby around 3 months ago and already had to go in for the warranty. So I decided to sell it after getting it fixed and decided to get something better. I was right in my opinion that it would not last and was not rugged and able to take regular use.	
- 1	It's not that I don't like the mirror, I like how big it is and the design however it does not fit in my 2012 Nissan Altima. My infant's car seat is behind the passenger seat and when I attach the mirror to the headrest, it doesn't show my child. It is too high. I have tried everything from connecting the  bottom hooks to the car seat to try and pull it down to attaching it dangerously loose around the head rest and still it does not hang low enough nor does it angle down so I can see what is going on. The only image I get it the top of the car seat. Unfortunately I will be returning this item and trying to find a new one	
- 1	was told to buy this is in my breastfeeding class for supplementing bottle feeds to breast feeding.  flow is way too fast, not slow flow at all.  disappointed.	
- 1	These are very small in size and paper-towel-like, kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper. We bought a pack and just couldn't use it because it is so small. I'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these. For us we now use the babies R Us brand, they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it, which is much more durable.	
1. 	Cute. Wasn't the material I was expecting it to be. It's more fabric ish than plastic, so I'm not too sure how waterproof it really is but it serves its purpose at preK I guess!	
1. 	The layout of the hours are a little tricky but it does the job.  The print on each page is a light grey, so trying to journal diapers, bottles, meds in the middle of the night is a challenge.  It is detailed in slots to make notes and I would prefer a journal that does not take space for breast-feeding if one chooses formula only.  I could use the space to make more notes and comment on something cute that day.	
1. 	This is a wonderful product! Baby is snuggly and warm at night.  We've used many of these sleepsacks in the past and have always been happy with the quality of HALO products.	
1. 	I love these bibs.  They work well for catching food - lots of good coverage but still fit nicely.  They easily wipe down and launder up nicely.  I highly recommend these.	
1. 	Love this bib!  Great for catching crumbs and puke (ich, I know, but this has saved me from cleaning high chair straps many, many times!).	
1. 	These are great, we actually have them in a couple different sizes so my son can grow into them.  (NOTE: We got him the blue one, but they make you review them separately)Here's what I love:1. Our house gets chilly at night, and even with a little space heater in his room, I worried about him being cold with no blankets! The sleep sack is snuggly and warm.2. Our son moves constantly, awake or asleep. Any blanket you did use (even if it were safe) would never stay on him. The sleep sacks have never tangled or bunched up under him.3. This is silly, but it just looks so darling. I love to see him all ready for bed, in his PJs and sleep sack.Our son HATED the sleepers that were sacks at the bottom, I think they felt restrictive because he would kick and kick at them and cry. He has never minded the sleep sack, maybe having his PJs on under it helps him feel more comfy.I recommend this, and recommend getting a couple in each size so that you can throw one in the wash and have another ready.	
- 1	Wouldn't stick to my oven no matter what I tried.  Complete waste of money.  Even if it had, I have a hard time believing the adhesive would have withstood any amount of pulling or yanking by a child.  Wish I could return it.	
1. 	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.Love it!	
1. 	I am glad I got these and love the price. I think this is a great quality product and we are happy with these bibs.	
- 1	Our 3 month old found the gym a bit too overwhelming. He just did not like the gym at all. But he did enjoy playing with each of the toys individually when detached from the gym. Also sometimes babies hold up the rattle/toy and lets it drop...it may fall on their face and hurt them.	
- 1	I washed it once when I initailly recieved it and it was fine. I washed it again after the first use, and it came out from the dryer shredded into pieces! Not worth the money, buy something else.	
1. 	I like the ones that come in one package better, but these are great for when you are traveling and don't want to carry all of that (I'm thinking business travel, flights, etc.).  So while I would buy the ones that are not individually wrapped for everyday use I found these to be useful as well and felt that they deserved a 5 star rating because of that.	
1. 	We have two of these toilet trainers: one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Love it! Easy for my two year old boy to use, non-slip, and does not attach to the toilet, so you simply lift it off to use the regular seat. The raised part in front is great--we don't have any aiming problems with this potty:)	
- 1	Dont like the fact that when baby pulls on the mirror or butterfly or handle the whole thing comes on her face. Then its too close she cant see and she starts crying... If i put it farther out so it doesn't fall on her face, its too far and she cant reach..	
1. 	This is well worth the money! My daughter loves this and it keeps her entertained for a long time!!	
1. 	Love these, I've bought six now for six different car seats.  They tuck into the seat so they don't move around.  They have cuts to make sure they don't get in the way of the LATCH set up and do a great job at protecting leather and being easy to clean.  A must have if you have kids!	
- 1	I bought this for an upcoming trip because I wanted something that could pack in my luggage.  Once I got it, I tried putting it on my kitchen table, but wasn't able.  I think our table might have been too thick for this chair to be compatible.  So we ended up returning it and instead got the My Little Seat Infant Seat.	
- 1	These crib pads do help keep sheets dry but they wear out quickly.  They looked awful after the first time I washed them and have started falling apart after 6 months.  I wash them with natural baby detergent and hang to dry so I am surprised that they have worn out already.	
1. 	This is great.  Unlike other car seat protectors this is heavy duty and won't cause the car seat to leave marks on your seats through the protector	
1. 	Good sponge, compared to the 5$ one we got. Much more fluffy. But takes a while to dry. We bathe every night and hang it in the tub in between to dry - which it does! Getting small/short for my 4mo old tho...	
1. 	I thought the price was a bit steep for a step stool, but man is it well made!  This step stool will not budge, with all the rubber grips it has.  It's also a lot nicer looking after it's been used a while because the black rubber on the top wears so nicely.  I looked at another step stool in the BRU store when I bought this, and its rubber already looked icky just from people testing it out.  This Baby Bjorn one is also very strong, even for heavier children.  I'm very pleased!	
1. 	I had checked into all of the pails before I had my little girl.  I heard great things about all of them, but wanted what would be most cost effective for us.  When we decided on the diaper champ, we won!1.  No refills to every buy.  you can use a standard trash bag and you don't have to spend the extra money for those refills.2.  I empty mine once a week on trash day and it is full.  However, there is never a smell eminating from my champ.3.  No stinky smells in my home.  Even though my daughter is only 2 months old, she has some of THE stinkiest diapers I have ever smelt!  But, there has never been any leakage of smell and it does not stink when I open it to change it.4.  I clean it every other week with Clorox wipes and they keep it nice and fresh.  Since those stinky diapers camp out in there for a week, it needs to be freshened up every now and then.Verdict:Get the champ....it will save you tons in the long run!!!	
- 1	Too bad I was so busy as a first time mom that I couldn't get my act together to use this and then return it within the time allowed when I discovered how disappointed I was with the performance of this product. The biggest problem is the suction cups do not work. I have tried different table surfaces. I have tried moistening the suction cups. One or two might work at a time, but only temporarily. The mat surface worked well for eating, and the trough did a pretty good job catching dropped food. If the mat would stay flat on hard surfaces, or have an alternative grip method for more table surfaces, I would like this better. Basically, I found this product a waste of money. I do not recommend it.	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
- 1	I LOVE the Ergo. I had a Bjorn with my first daughter, and it was fine and uses daily. I decided to try and Ergo with my next one and literally cannot live without it. My 8 month old still uses it. However, I found this insert to be unnecessary. I read the directions and did it correctly, but it just felt cumbersome. My daughter didn't like it either. She fit much better in the regular Ergo, even as a newborn. She weighed 7.5 at birth but lost weight and has been the 5th percentile since. So, she wasn't a huge newborn. I just don't think this is necessary. The regular Ergo is amazing enough on its own.	
- 1	I'm really upset about the quality of this bag.  We purchased it to keep our Chicco Keyfit Carseat safe during a flight from Seattle to California.  After the first flight, we found a large rip near the handle (almost 6 inches long).  We've had to repair the bag with duct tape in order for it to be usable.I know this is the cheapest option out there for carseat travel bags, but I would caution others not to get this product.	
- 1	I registered for this thinking I'd use it for nursing. Well, I've been nursing for almost a month now, and I've found this pillow to be a bigger nuisance than helper. Here's why:1. The way it's shaped allows the baby to slip down towards your belly button. Rather than being flat towards your stomach, it angles downwards, allowing the baby no support. I end up holding her anyway.2. It doesn't stay on! No matter where I'm sitting: couch, rocker, chair, etc., it falls off! How annoying.3. I'm tall. I have to slouch over.4. Because of problem #1, I use a blanket to stuff in between the pillow and my belly. What a complete waste!It really should be shaped the like the pillows used in hospitals: flat the whole way. Totally a better design.	
1. 	Boy do I love this product!  Easy to get on and super easy to open and shut.  Hard for guests- we have already had 2 ripped off the toilet and broken by guests too shy to ask how to open the toilet.  Our newest one has instructions written on it (by me) and the plastic piece on the lid has plenty of room to write these!	
1. 	These wipes are perfect if you're a working mother that wants to continue to nurse. It's inconvenient to water wash your pump parts at work after each use, so even if you have the option to do so, these wipes are a much better and faster solution. They are large enough to clean all parts after each use, are odorless, and leave no milk residue on your pump parts. I've been using them for six months now and love them.	
1. 	My daughter and I have thoroughly enjoyed the Boppy.  I haven't used it quite as much as I thought I would but I am definitely glad that we have one.	
1. 	This bag is perfect for my two-month old baby's daily feeding at day care.  I put my pumped breast milk bottles in there (6 five ounce-bottles) and the cooling gel on top or in between the bottles.  I can also add two or three more bottles if I lay them on top. I looked everywhere for something practical, given that I also have a toddler at daycare, for whom I tried different types of bags that would smell as soon as milk would get in the bag...  I would recommend it.  The strap is long enough that I can carry this bag, the toddler's milk bag, the two diapers bags, etc.	
- 1	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic Diaper Depot by Prince Lionheart.	
1. 	I got this monitor as a baby shower gift and I couldn't be more happy with it.  No matter where i am in the house, or outside, i can hear my baby girl crystal clear. I also love the built in night light, so when i go in to check on her i don't have to turn on the lights. This product is great, and i'm so glad i didn't have to spend a ton of money for the best!	
- 1	I am a baby wearer. I loved my Ergo with my son and was going to use it with my daughter from birth. This insert is awful. It is hard to position properly, and most importantly, it is HOT, and that defeats the point of an Ergo. There is no airflow and it is thick with padding. My daughter is wet with sweat within minutes. I'm currently trying to sell the thing on Craigslist, with no takers. The only good thing is I'll be able to use the pillow it came with once she gets a little bigger.	
- 1	Be careful with this old model. It only has a THREE point harness. My 7 month old son fell on his head when he leaned over without the tray on. The right strap came undone, the left strap held him suspended for a second, and then he slipped out and fell on his head. We called 911 and went to the emergency room. Tomy has a newer model with a FIVE point harness. They should not be selling these old ones anymore when they know it is an inferior product. I sent Tomy and the CPSC an email about the fall. I will destroy the chair after they contact me. Also note that in 2007, this similar high chair was recalled because the straps came apart from the chair.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEDecember 6, 2007Release #08-120Firm's Recall Hotline: (866) 725-4407CPSC Recall Hotline: (800) 638-2772CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908RC2 Recalls The First Years(tm) Children's Feeding Seats Due to Fall HazardWASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product.

- 1	When i ordered this i was hoping it would save me from always using a blanket over my daughters car seat and keep the sun off her face. The print was nice and it fit on the car seat fine (i have chicco car seat) But i thought it opened all the way down so i could get my daughter in and out with out having to take it off but its a very small opening and its just to hard to try to get her out without taking it off, my daughter is 3months old and 10pounds 23in long shes a small baby and i cant imagine how it would be for a bigger baby,, My advice order the jj cole car seat canopy instead.	
1. 	Awesome hand pump. Very easy to use and clean. Great for pumping On a regular basis or for expressing milk when engorged. Medelas high quality as usual for a great price! Love it!	
- 1	We have a ton of MAM binks but these are the only style that have caused us issues. I wash my little ones pacifiers according to the packaging. These pacifiers develop mold and gunk inside the silicone pacifier tip. I have never had any of the other styles do this - but ALL of my MAM air variety have done this.I do not recommend this variety of binks for your little one. Mine only takes MAM pacifiers and I am unsure why but this variety does not drain after washing. I recommend you avoid it. I did not contact customer service but instead use their other varieties and I highly recommend the other MAM styles.	
- 1	If I could give zero stars I would. I should have followed the advice from other reviews, but I wanted to experience this for myself. The product looks nice and appears to work for maybe the first few bottles, but by day two the unit would not stop dispensing formula. I followed all the directions for setup, but in the end I had to send it back for a refund. The only way to kept it from dispensing formula was to unplug it. Pass this product over. Not worth the headache.	
1. 	We used this extensively when our daughter first started solids but didn't have the ability to grasp small pieces to feed herself. It was nice to allow her to feed herself and try new things without constantly picking up little pieces of food from the floor or worrying about her choking. We used a tether to clip it to her bib, so it couldn't fall on the floor. Only downsides- we didn't use it for very long- probably only 2 months, so the extra mesh bags I purchased were never used. Also, I don't think the little water reservoir they claim can be refrigerated to keep items cold actually does anything.Bottom line- very useful for that brief period after starting solids and before a pincer grip.	
- 1	I registered for this item and received it as a gift, why, I don't know.  I never really even travel by car too often.  I decided to try it out the one time I did travel, my son was 4 months old.. I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up.  It just remained cold.  I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back.  My advice on this item is, don't buy it, even if it does work, you will probably never use it.	
- 1	I bought this cover thinking what a great deal until I got it and was SO disappointed.It is so small, that if you're baby moves or wiggles even a little bit then you end up flashing everyone anyway.  Not only that, it's a struggle to get on, adjust your baby, and stay covered up.  I found it's easier to just use a receiving blanket than it is to hassle with this darn cover.The stiff collar on it to let you see you're baby while you're nursing is a struggle too!  It flops over or falls down...the whole thing is just a mess.  Knowing what I know now, I would've picked a cover that I knew for sure was larger and had a collar with a better design.	
- 1	I'm disappointed. I got these for our baby shower and loved the idea of an all-in-two system where I can swap out the inserts. There were a couple problems. First, the flap that holds the insert is very short, only a couple inches, so with a squirming baby it will be tough to get the insert to stay in place. Second, after one wash under normal cycle, the nylon on the flap (which holds the insert in place) had ripped. The rip is going to get larger each time I stretched the diaper, so these will be useless after a few uses. I think I'll try other systems b/c the quality of this one is really lacking.	
- 1	The string constantly gets stuck so I have to smack it to make the music continue. Defeats the purpose of a pull string music toy. Pretty disappointing.	
1. 	I've installed about a dozen of these throughout my house and am impressed with the quality.  They don't stand out and they are much easier to use (plug something in) when necessary versus the standard plastic babyproofing plugs which can also pose a choking hazard.  So far my little one has shown little interest in these and hopefully it will stay that way.  Careful when screwing in the plate as the screw head is made of very soft metal and strips easily (the paint chips even easier than that!).  I definitely recommend these over plugs if you have the budget.	
- 1	I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back.  They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit.  These are unecessary and really a pain.	
1. 	We used this on a full size bed.  Our house was for sale and had showings, inspections, etc continuously for a month so I had to make sure the bed was made every day.  It was very easy to lower the rail to make the bed.  It stayed securely in place.  I'd recommend it.	
- 1	I liked this at first. I admit I bought it because it was cheap. I did tons of research on baby carriers. I wanted something that did front carry (facing in and facing out) and back carry. I added the Beco Baby Gemini to my Amazon baby registry, but no one bought it. So try to save money, I bought this thinking it would be comparable. It is not.I've only used it as front carry, facing in. You have to wait until your baby has head/neck control before you can switch him/her to facing out. My baby has been at that point for a while now, but I barely use the Infantino Flip because it is painful to me and seems uncomfortable to my daughter. The padding near the top clip actually rubs/digs into her cheek. If I make the straps on that clip looser, she seems insecure. After wearing it for 10 minutes, my shoulder is killing me. The padding leaves a lot to be desired.I found I could easily put this on though; clip the back piece then dive into the carrier (put your head in, then put each arm in). It was much faster than the Moby Wrap a friend gave me. It beats lugging the carseat into stores. My baby plus my carseat (Graco snug ride 35) is just too heavy now that she's getting older (and she's only 14 lbs).I broke down and bought the Beco Baby Gemini. I tried a Ergo Baby (original) on in the baby box store. The straps on it were amazing, but I really want to be able to have the option to wear my baby facing outward (the Ergo baby carriers do not allow for this). I can always bring her back facing inward if she is overwhelmed, tired, wants to nurse, etc.You really do get what you pay for. If you don't plan on babywearing, or don't plan on baby wearing very long, this will do. If you want to wear your baby often, spend the money on something better; don't waste it on this.	
- 1	Not sure why monitor companies make monitors that don't provide clear video in the dark. Isn't that when you need it most? Don't be fooled by the daylight pictures. The night vision picture quality is truly awful. Skip this	
1. 	Easy to use. I like being able to pump right into the bags. Just make very, very, very sure the seal is closed. It's sometimes hard to tell. I wish they were more ecofriendly but otherwise they do the job well.	
1. 	What can you say about these plugs?  I thought it was a good value, I had more than enough for myself and some to share.	
1. 	I was worried this would not fit well and in fact it does very well. Very happy to have this during the cold winter!	
1. 	My son's aunt recommended these to us.  They're user-friendly and perfect for little toddler hands.  Although the cereal does fall out, there is a much smaller mess than there would be with a regular bowl.Sometimes a piece will get stuck in-between the flaps and if my son is shaking it (upside down usually), cereal will fly everywhere.  But that's to be expected.  Overall, it's a great invention.  The plastic lids are also super soft and flexible, being gentle on my son's soft hands.	
1. 	I purchased two of these (8 segments each) in an attempt to babyproof my kitchen and living room.  I like that I can move them easily and reconfigure it in minutes. This is particularly useful when we have company and I need to designate a safe play area for all the children.  It is also great to contain the mess!	
- 1	This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the seat or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest.	
- 1	very adorable but did not fit our tub. I am not sure if I was supposed to stretch it our more or if just not the right size for our bathroom.	
1. 	Those are great bobs, no more washing stained bibs every day, you just rinse those well and they are clean.	
1. 	These hold up pretty well, but the lid can be pulled off by a small child with some work. Good price though, so it was worth it to me.	
- 1	My baby loves this swing because of the lights and stars, but the motor is terrible, it barely moves and I've only used the swing a little over a month.  Very disappointed, Its also very bulky.	
- 1	I had the unit before and we loved it. But this one started leaking from the bottom after a few days of use. I might just have gotten a defective product but some of the reviews indicated the same issue as I was having	
1. 	Like many other users, I also have problems with the lid, it just never closes.  I have to use a paper weight just to close the lid.Other than that, I've had no problems with it.  I use Huggies wipes and it dispenses well from the Prince Lionheart Wipe Warmer.  I have to add a couple ounces of water into the unit once a week to keep the wipes moist.I like the little light that comes on to let me know that the warm function is on.My baby doesn't really care whether her wipes are warm or cold.  But it did make difference when she was a newborn and we had to do diaper changes throughout the night.  We noticed the regular cold wipes jittered her.  The last thing we wanted was for her to be more alert from her half-asleep state.  So I plugged in the wipes warmer and it helped!  By the time we were done changing her she was almost alseep again.  Once she got her milk, she was definitely out.So I would say I got this wipe warmer more for us than for the baby.It's been 8 months since we owned ours and we're still using it ... with the paper weight on top of the lid, of course.	
1. 	Covers the arms and most of the body when the toddlers are learning to self feed and the food goes everywhere.  Helps to lessen the stains in the loads of laundry!	
1. 	I love that Medela has changed the design of these bags. With my first, you had to use a tape to strap the bag to the pump in order to directly pump in to.  The best part of this new design is that it now comes with an attachment that hooks the bag directly onto the pump and milk is directly pumped into this.  The other benefit of the new design is that the milk drops below the seal, where the previous bags did not do this, thus possibly contaminating the milk. I haven't read the other reviews, but I know from my personal experience, I love these and I especially love that I can pump directly into the bag, eliminating the need to pump into another bottle and then transfer to the bags.  These are the best!	
1. 	much longer than the 24mm shields. it is  not a big deal but just a little awkward sticking out so far.	
- 1	The folding mechanism broke on it, but we did use it a lot. Very poor ride/manueverability.Pros:lightweightbellybarCons:Not built for medium/heavy useVERY poor manueverabilityfolding mechanism breaks	
1. 	I bought this for cloth diapers and so far its holding in the smell really well. It holds two or three days worth of diapers which is perfect. The lid DOES come up easily so it won't keep kiddos out.	
- 1	pads are ok size wise and I liked the packaging. but that's about it. they are soaked thru too quickly and I end up washing them every other day. You would need to buy a lot for a week supply. I use them at home only and use disposable pads when I'm out.	
1. 	This pump is simple, efficient and less expensive. I like it so much that I bought a back-up one of the exact same model.I like the drop-ins system of transferring breastmilk to bottles.I have only tried a Medela pump in addition to this one, and I didn't like it because of it's initial complexity. This pump is sooo easy to just throw it together and get pumping.My one complaint is that there is an area that is hard to clean in the 4 piece nipple apparatus. You need a pipe cleaner to really get it (unless I'm missing something.)	
1. 	I purchased several of these and used them constantly. They washed well, were durable, warm, pretty, and a great size for swaddling. I loved the fact that these were larger than the usual blanket since our baby was 9 lbs and 19 inches at delivery - he was no small guy. He's also a pretty sensitive and picky little man, but these were great. Even now, at 7 months and over 29 inches, he still uses this for nap time and in the car, or just to wrap up with mommy on the couch. I would definitely recommend this product.	
- 1	I don't recommend these at all.  If you're looking for a washable trainer, spend the extra $ on something that works and get some from Little Beetles or Imse Vimse.  These are no more absorbent than a pair of regular cotton underwear.	
- 1	Based on a recomendation from a friend whos son is the same age as mine, I bought this for my one-year-old's smoothies. It doesn't work for us. Nothing comes out of the thing - not even water.	
1. 	This warmer is great. I looked at many reviews before I bought this one. It warms from the top which is a good feature. I have went through about 10 refills in wipes and so far so GREAT! It says you should add up to 1/2 cup of water everytime you put new wipes in. I have no idea why!! The wipes stay perfectly wet with no water added. My baby sleeps through the night so I go from 8pm until 7am without using the wipes and they don't dry out one bit. No browning either. I didn't use a warmer with my daughter and my son is now 3 months old. I was always told not to get one because then the baby would cry and scream when you had to use a cold wipe (traveling, shopping, visiting, etc.). Then, I used some wipes at my brothers house from a warmer. The expression on my little guys face made me have to have one. He loves it. Before the warmer he never cried or fussed with the cold wipes, but he would jet his arms out to the side and his legs out straight at the first touch of the cold wipes. Not any more. Worth the cost!! One thing though...don't rely on the built in light to give you a lot of light. I don't need to use it b/c as I said earlier my baby sleeps though the night :) but I do use it to check how many wipes are left. I can turn it on and see how many wipes are in there. That is another benefit of this little machine...being able to see when you are running out of wipes. I purchased the Wal-Mart one ( I think it was Lionheart or something like that). I brought it back right away. It is very handy to see how many wipes are left.	
1. 	We love this monitor. The video quality is better than expected. The audio is very sensitive if you have the baby further away from the monitor. You can control the volume, which is great. Night vision is very good. Of course, you can't see exactly what the baby is doing, but I can see whether he has opened his eyes or is just wiggling in his sleep.I have two complaints:1. There is no way to know whether your baby is in the picture without having the mobile unit. Then, I worry about positive feedback and noise if I bring it into the room. Not to mention I forget most of the time. So, I always end up going up and down the stairs to adjust the tilt.2. When you turn it first on, it goes into the video only mode. You can't hear even if the baby screams. I learned it the hard way. Make sure you turn the dial just a little past the on position.I know some people mentioned that the security is bad, everyone with a base can see the picture. It is not a problem in my neighborhood where houses are far apart. I tried to take the monitor to the neighbor's house and it did not work there. If you are living in an apartment though, I would be wary. Countless times, I walked passed the transmitter not in appropriate clothing...	
1. 	This fits well and is so soft.  I haven't found it to be the best with waterproofing, though.	
1. 	These bibs are perfect for my 6 month old.  I wanted a waterproof bib but not one that was so full of plastic that it warped after washing/drying.  These fit the bill.  I actually ordered 2 more packages after this one.	
1. 	What a wonderful find!!!  I was able to install this gate on my own at the top of our staircase within 30 minutes.  It probably could have taken less time but I ALWAYS read the instructions from start to finish and probably spent too much time remeasuring things before installation.  My 1 year old no longer has to remain in his room when upstairs.  He is now free to run up and down the hall and explore the other rooms without us worrying about him taking a tumble down the stairs.I love that the gate swings both ways and was pleased to see that this gate came in the extra tall option.  The two extensions that are included are a great perk even though at the present time we are not using them.  However, we plan to continue to use this gate even after babyproofing the stairway is no longer necessary.  As others have already mentioned, it can also be used to keep pets out of specific areas.My only recommendation would be for the company to use metal instead of plastic for the spring latch that locks the gate in place at the top.  We haven't had any problems thus far but it just seems as though plastic would break/snap more quickly over time.	
- 1	I'm not crazy about this pillow. It had great reviews and was recommended over a Boppy, which is why I chose it. Maybe there's a learning curve to using it, or maybe my baby is just too small right now (8 lbs.) and it'll be more useful when he's bigger, but when it comes to nursing, I find it much easier to just use a plain old pillow to support him. This pillow tends to slide away from me when we're using it, and then he ends up sort of sliding down between me and the pillow - clearly not ideal. Half the time I end up just holding him up with my arms, or using a standard pillow. Hoping this works better for us once he's a bit older.UPDATE: Now that our baby is a bit bigger (13 pounds), it holds him better during nursing than it did when he was only 8 pounds. However, what I didn't realize upon purchasing this pillow is that you cannot really use it for propping up the baby (he slides down the side), tummy time, or sitting like you can with a Boppy. If you are looking for something that has all the uses that a Boppy has, I would not recommend this pillow. My only other criticism of this pillow is that when baby is ready to switch sides, you have to flip the pillow AND the baby. I've found this to be a fairly difficult task to pull off gracefully.	
1. 	I never get to use the cleaning bags, but i love to have the extra set of bottles and valves. They are absolutely necessary.	
1. 	I used this for both of my kids (16 months apart) and the wipes never dried out. This is great during the newborn phase when it is the middle of the night, they are drowsy and almost asleep but soiled their diaper during feeding and need a diaper change. Nothing wakes up a newborn like a cold wipe and the shriek screams that are amplified in a quiet home once they have awoken. I used this until they started to sleep through the night.	
1. 	I didn't think I needed a mirror for my car but after stressing with a fussing baby I couldn't see while driving I quickly changed my mind! This mirror works great! I have a newer Toyota Camry and it fits around the backseat headrest great. The mirror is a little stiff so it takes a moment to get it to swivel into place but that is good, on bumps it doesn't loose it's adjustment. The size is great too, just right.	
1. 	Great for inexperienced mothers, lets you have both hands to bathe your baby. Babies get really slippery when wet ( and soaped). I found the insert to be really helpful.	
- 1	These got the job done, but as others have commented they don't fit as well as the original parts. It's probably better to just replace the whole cup, but I had an issue with throwing away otherwise fine cups so I tried these. When hey didn't work well, we moved on to the Sassy Grow up cups, and we love them.	
1. 	I have three children.  For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky. I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far. I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it. I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.I would recommend it over the others on the market.	
1. 	This Play Yard is brightly colored which my son loves, it takes a bit of getting use to for breaking it down and putting it up. And i love how the mat in it is easy to clean. When my son spits up its very easy to wipe up off the mat it doesn't soak in. And we love how it has more room than most that are from the stores where we live.	
1. 	I got a bedding set from ABC and the jersey sheet it included was great.  I wanted to order extras and came to Amazon, only to find there are two choices:  regular and value.  The price is about $5 difference.  I went to ABC website and their PDF product info didn't even list any real variation in the specs... so I ordered both.  The differences is in the weight/thickness.  I could immediately tell the regular sheet package was thicker, but I got nerdy and decided to weigh them.  I took the sheets out of the package and weighed them on my digital scale.  Here are the results:ABC Value Jersey Crib Sheet - 8.3ozABC Jersey Crib Sheet - 9.5 oz  (this is the one I'm reviewing here)The difference was visible when I put my hand behind a single layer of fabric.  I could see through the Value Sheet much more than the standard.  Both are really soft though, so if $$ is an issue, the value sheet would still be a lot softer than most other baby crib sheets I've run across.  I just think the standard will be a little plusher in the long run!  It really does feel like a soft old tee shirt.  Recommend!	
1. 	We love this tub. It fits well in our kitchen sink. The sling was a great feature for the first few baths when baby was new. Light but sturdy. Easy to wipe clean.Update: We recently took a road trip and after being without this tub for a few days, I now appreciate it even more. The grooves in the tub accommodate a growing baby so perfectly at each stage (the sling for the first few baths and then two sides of the larger tub...one for infant and one for toddler.) The grooves of the tub fit the baby's body perfectly and make it easy to wash baby with only one set of hands and the padded head portions provide just enough cushion but are still easily wiped clean. I used a few different tubs at grandma's and even a dish pan at another relatives house, but nothing compared to this tub at home. Bath time is so much more relaxed and fun for both of us when the baby is in this tub.Pros: Easy to clean/sanitize, fits well in double kitchen sink, sturdy, has multiple stage stations for a growing baby, convenient drain for emptying.Cons: Too bulky to take traveling, not easy to store.	
- 1	If I had written this review when I bought the cup 6 months ago, I would have given it 5 stars. Now, my baby is 14 months old. We try and give her a regular cup as much as we can. Sometimes, though, we need to give her a drink in a cup that won't spill - and these are perfect for that. The problem now is that she has teeth and she bites on the end of the spout. We do our best to discourage this, but it only takes a second and POOF - she's bitten a huge hole in the end. (Check out the pictures of this listing - someone posted an image of EXACTLY what happens when the child bites off the end.) I've started to get worried about giving her the cup, as I found her chewing on a piece of silicone she got off of the end. It wasn't enough that she would have choked, but still not good for her. Thus, I've had to buy replacement nipples ALL THE TIME. I bought 5 of these cups in different styles and I am about to go buy replacement spout #6 & #7. Bottom line: this is a great cup for a transition from the bottle. But, once your baby has teeth, you'll be buying replacement spouts until the cows come home or you switch to a cup with a hard spout.	
1. 	We purchased this item because our 3 week old was spitting up every time he laid on his back. The item came in two pieces with a zipper case. It wasn't difficult to manipulate the second piece so that the two angles matched. If you're having issues, make sure you put in the second piece right-side up! The zipper does go down the middle but is not noticeable once you place the wedge under the mattress or sheet protector. Would absolutely recommend to anyone having spit-up issues!	
1. 	My baby loves these cups! (6 months). Right now she just likes to chew on them and throw them on the floor and watch them spin, but I am excited that she can still learn to stack them later. I like that each cup has little shaped holes (stars, hearts, triangles, etc.) according to the number it says on the bottom of the cup. Great price especially compared to other brands!	
1. 	We have this chair in another pattern but we love it!  We started putting our son in it when he was about 3 mos. old - I tilted the seat all the way back and could roll him from room to room with me.  Even now, at 10 mos., when he's not feeling great, I put him in the chair and recline it so he can relax while I clean up. It was very easy to put together and I love that it folds up out of the way.  Now that our son is eating cereal, etc., we just roll it right up to the table so he can join the family dinner.  There are a lot of cracks and crevasses that stuff gets stuck in but it cleans up easily enough.	
- 1	Using the clip, I attached it to my visor since the car seat is facing forward.  For me, the mirror jiggled to much, even though the roads were rather smooth.  Even after trying to reposition it, just never could find a spot where it was satisfactory.  It is useful for seeing the child, but after awhile, I started feeling a bit motion sick because of the jiggling.  My husband tried it briefly, but didn't like it all for the same reason.Did not try it with the suction cups since we are not using a rear facing car seat.	
- 1	I got this hamper as a gift. I returned it the next day. The white paint chips off all over.	
1. 	My baby just grew out of this swaddle (tear), but we used it every night for 3 months. I love that it wraps around the baby a couple times that way she really can't get out of it. And she seemed to love it. I am getting these for all the baby showers I have to go to!	
1. 	Like the way is set up. Easy to install and very safe for kids and for parents step ahead of preventive an accident.	
- 1	I had ordered this blanket a few months ago, and wanted to order a third for my baby to have at daycare. The Taggies I received, sold from The Pro Store, is not the real deal.  First, the material is fleece on this blanket, not boa as stated in the description.  There are also only four tags on each side, not five (16 total).  The product tag says &#34;my taggies&#34;, where the authentic item says &#34;Taggies&#34;. I will be attempting to return this item and will report to Amazon if possible.	
1. 	It's really simple to use and put on, just rinse with some hot water and put on your nipple.  The lactation consultant at the hospital gave me a nipple shield to help my baby start breastfeeding.  What she didn't mention is that it isn't supposed to be used long term because it decreases milk supply.  Initially this worked great, but after about 4 weeks I was told by another LC that if I wanted to maintain my supply, I'd have to get my baby on the actual breast.  Trying to transition her from the shield onto my nipple was hell because she was so used to the plastic; I eventually gave up trying to transition her, but I continued to use the shield even though my supply was dwindling.  Just a few words of advice to anyone who wants to breastfeed:  it can be VERY VERY difficult- it's amazing how something so natural could feel so unnatural sometimes.  I went through so much pain and discomfort. I hated it for the first 6 weeks, but then I fell in love with it.  I felt such a deep bond with my daughter when I breastfed and all the pain and discomfort disappeared.  I actually looked forward to breastfeeding her instead of despising it!  But over time she began to reject my breast because she preferred the bottle.  I breastfed for almost 3 months with the shield, it's definitely worth it. Even if you only use it for a month or two weeks, it's worth it, the benefits are amazing and you can't complain about the price.A few more words:  anything that is artificial will DECREASE your milk supply-formula, pumping, pacifiers, using bottles (they confuse your nipple with the plastic nipple and they will prefer the plastic over you because the flow is much easier).  The best thing to do is nurse (although that may not always be realistic).  To help increase your milk supply: nurse often in the first few weeks, don't give pacifiers, bottles or formula. Also, try taking fenugreek supplemnents (or mother's milk), they worked very well for me.And last but not least, if you've tried and tried to breastfeed and it's just not happening, do NOT feel guilty.	
- 1	I bought these to use as burp rags because I was unhappy with the quality of the gerber cloth diapers I was using as burp rags.  My 3 month old spits up a lot. While these were much softer than the gerber diapers, the absorbency, at least when it comes to spit up, was not good at all.  The spit up just sits on top of the rag instead of being absorbed inside.  Not sure how these work as diaper inserts, but I would not recommend them as burp cloths.	
1. 	these are great bottles. I got them for my great-grand son who is due in March. Mother was very pleased to receive such good bottles.	
1. 	You absolutely cannot wear these out in public!  This is for home use only!  They do not match the contour of the breast at all so there's a totally weird bulge on your boob when you wear them.  So with that being said, if you do just wear these at home, they can be great!  If you have really raw nipples they offer a much needed relief and the ability to get air.  I use them at night so that they catch anything that I leak, and I can then just pour the milk into the baby's mouth via a little spout on the edge.  I find that I go the longest without nursing through the night, so this offers a great way to never waste a drop!	
- 1	Purchased this to fill with pureed baby food but found it difficult to use. Its actually is relatively easy to fill (wish it would stand up on the counter though) and cleans up great, but my daughter (started trying to use this at about 10 months and is now 15 months) just cant make it work. Its hard for her to get all of the food out (and not much fits in!) so I keep having to come over and help her. There are other pouches on the market that she can use on her own, these and the silisqueeze versions are the only ones that I have to help with (I've tried them all!). Conceptually its a great product, but it just doesn't make my life easier since I basically have to sit there and feed it to her.	
- 1	I bought these for my newborn. He moves around too much and they fall off. One time, the urine stream made it fall off. They are cute and a great idea, but just not worth the money. They just don't stay on.	
- 1	I purchased a similar crib sheet at a local store a while back and decided to get another sheet (from who I thought was made by the same company), but this one is not the same quality. The seams don't line up with the mattress so it doesn't fit properly and several seams actually lay several inches over onto the mattress itself, making it look very awkward. It's soft, but very thin. I don't expect it to last long and have only been using it as a back-up sheet when the others are in the wash.	
1. 	We got this for our daughters growing stuffed animal collection. We have one in our sons room that is actually mine from years ago that is not stretchy like this one is. I prefer that one. They both do the job, I just like the look of the other kind, it doesn't hang as low. This net keeps stuffed animals off the floor and that's all that I really care about. It works.	
- 1	I RARELY give a product a bad review.  I tend to read both the high and low reviews before a purchase and usually assume user error on most of the negative reviews.  This one really doesn't stick as folks have claimed.  I tried it several times in several locations on my new and very clean ceramic tile and it doesn't stay.  Let me be clear, it will stick for a few minutes with the frog attached, but not with any weight in it.  It slowly pulls away from the wall and falls within 5-10 mins of being installed.  I have tried reducing the weight.  It didn't work.  This is unfortunate because I love this frog pod but I am not sticking double sided tape onto brand new tiles.	
- 1	We had no idea which monitor to register for & picked this one b/c it had two receivers and was reasonably priced. It always has static and background noise (including our neigbors! but I'm told a lot of monitors do that), so the red light is always on. My son is still sleeping in our room so we hardley use it, but for my own piece of mind, we'll probably buy another monitor when he goes into his room. One that doesn't have so much background noise and static.	
- 1	I thought I found a great solution for my daughters tummy problems when we first tried the windi.  When using the product she would pass gas and poop easily, yay!  Then I told our pediatrician about the windi success. She advised not to use it except very rare occasions because babies become reliant on rectal stimulation and have to eventually be retrained on how to poop. It's an addiction for babies I guess:).  So, instead we switched my daughter to Nutramigen formula and it has been pure magic, no more struggles with gas or poops and one happy baby!	
1. 	This gate was easy to install in our banister posts, the gate itself seems very solidly built, and it operates pretty smoothly, so I'm happy with it.My only complaint is that the little plastic &#34;catch&#34; that locks the gate shut is very shallow, so if you pull up fairly strongly, it will pop open. I'm not sure if a toddler could generate the force needed, but it may be possible. It's only a slight concern for me, though. I think it will work fine, and tweaking the screws might provide a little more hold.Side note: I noticed other reviewers saying that the included screws were junky, so I used my own &#34;gold finish&#34; screws, and have had no problems.Recommended, just test the &#34;catch&#34; and make sure it's holding to your satisfaction.	
1. 	I haven't had this blanket long, but have already used it a couple of times.  The size is nice for 2 adults and 1 little one to use.  It folds up and packs very nicely.  I wouldn't pay a lot for it (since my closet is full of other blankets), but think it is worth the price that I paid.	
- 1	I bought the Discovery 5 because it looked bigger than what we had... It is bigger, and even lighter, but it is too hard to snap into the base to start. You have to push the front in first before the back locks (the other one I had just snapped right on top of the base), so it's quite hard to line up when you're carrying a heavy baby. Also, the straps on my other one adjusted from the front with a simple latch and pull. This one supposedly you can adjust from behind, but no matter what I do.. pull hard, pull light, pull with the buttons pushed, etc.. I can NOT get the straps to budge.I've had the seat get stuck in the base in the front part that you have to snap before locking the whole thing down. It is such a headache, and I hate this seat. I'm considering it $60 wasted, because I've had it 2 weeks and I just can't stand it anymore and I'm going to have to find a new seat.	
- 1	It's a nice toy, well-made and pretty, but baby got bored with it quickly (after just a couple of days). Now he only occasionally hits it, most of the time accidentally. Maybe we introduced it too late? (at 6 months)On the good side, I didn't have the technical problems other reviewers had: ours attaches well.Considering the outrageous price for it, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it would work for such a short time.The two stars only is mostly because of the price, and also because it doesn't really work for us.	
- 1	We had high hopes for this product.  After receiving it, we attempted to take off the bumper piece that goes between our childs legs, after following the directions (turning 30 degrees and lifting), a piece of the plastic locking it in broke off.We returned and ordered a 2nd one, thinking it was a fluke, but the same thing happened, only this broke on the 2nd attempt.We will steer away from this product, buyer beware	
1. 	I've tried a lot of different bibs and felt resigned that none would do a great job of keeping the kiddo as clean as a bib should be able to do. Thank goodness I got one of the Bumkin SuperBibs in a recent CitrusLane box! After just a few uses, I knew I needed to order a set from Amazon. I got the three pack of Keith Herring print bibs and just love them.These bibs do a great job of keep food off of the kiddo. They have great coverage. They are wide and long (for a 10 month old at least). That they are flexible makes it easier to cover the kid. The neck also stays relatively clean because I can get a good fit with the velcro without choking him.I am a convert and can't recommend these bibs enough.	
1. 	We have several of the fruit and veggies- I love that they are organic- I'm a bit obsessed with that sort of thing.  I love how cute they are...and I love that my son loves them.  This pea is his favorite- I think because he can hold on to a pea leg with each of his hands and chomp away.  Definitely a winner- this is a toy I will get for preggo friends for sure.	
- 1	I received this today.  Took it out and turned it on, not impressed.  Like other reviewers stated, you really have to have just the right place to put this.  I would say a high dresser right near the bed.  I couldn't make out any of the constellations.  The only thing this product really does, is show some stars on the ceiling.So, for me personally, and this is just my opinion that I am leaving this review on:Pros:  Shows stars on the ceiling if placed just right.  Colors aren't very bright, but if you have a pitch black room, you can make out the different colors.Cons:  That's all it does.  No music.  The stars don't revolve.  The constellations don't really make sense.  Also, I don't know why, but I guess I thought the shell of the ladybug would be softer.  It's just hard plastic.  In addition, you have to be careful how you look at this thing because if you catch it just 'wrong' it shines into your eye.  Not something to put into bed with a child, or at eye level.I feel for this much money, it should do more than show some star shapes on the ceiling.I am going to purchase some glow in the dark plastic stars and attach those to the ceiling.  They won't need batteries or lights replaced.  Will also buy an inexpensive nightlight.	
1. 	I was worried this would be a cheaply made cover but it's actually quite soft and durable. I definetly am happy with this purchase!	
1. 	I wish I had bought something before he got his little teeth marks on his crib....but I found this product by reviews and I do think its a great product. I wish I had known it was only one strip and not the whole crib. Im pretty sure they sell it by the whole crib. But for the price, it should be the whole crib.	
- 1	Whoever thought that this bathtub can be used for a 4 year old needs some serious eye exam. This bath is very small and narrow. I have a 3 year old son who is on the tall side so far we have been using the One step ahead inflatable bathtub with two major downsides-they last from 2-5 months tops and get punctured and deflate- I already went trough 5 of them. And at the same time one step ahead greedily charges 8$ shipping for this super light item, not to mention that last time it took about 10 days to arrive. So I decided to buy this one hopping it will last but no luck.This bathtub is suitable for a baby that can sit up by itsefl and can last the most up to 2 years so if you are buying it for an older child don't bother.I ended up buying a similar inflatable bathtub from amazon that wasn't only 3$ cheaper then the one form one step ahead but it also shipped for free and arrived in 3 days.34 BABY SAFE INFLATABLE BATHTUB	
- 1	I do not advise getting this gate if you plan on putting it up and taking it down often.  It's a hassle to secure in place, and most times it is pretty flimsy if you can't get it's spring locks to lock into place.  It's also difficult to get a good grip on the smooth, teeny handles that you need to twist to lock/set it.  And sometimes it's almost impossible to unlock it to take it down, and you just have to pull it out from the doorway.Only really good for rolling/crawling children; Definitely AVOID this gate if your child is starting to pull up onto things, or is up walking around. It would probably give way if a child tried climbing, leaning, or pulling on it.Not very good at all; definitely not worth the price.  You could find something much better for around the same cost.	
- 1	This band does not stay in place- keeps moving around the tummy!! It is very irritating since i really wanted this to work.. cannot keep trying to move this in place for an already crying kid! The herbal pouch smells great when warmed up... but it is not warm enough to be effective. Also, it is a little too wide for 2 month old kids.	
1. 	this is a  great bib for messy meals! the elastic cuffs keep most everything out of the sleeves. it is great!	
1. 	This gate system is great for oddly shaped rooms or doorways. We used it to wrap around the entrance of a basement with a curved stairway and it worked GREAT! Each piece comes off individually so you can make multiple gates using just this product. The gates are sturdy but they are plastic so the little ones can push them pretty easily.	
1. 	love love love diono everything amazing quality. so happy to have found this !!!!!!!!!!! will buy another for other car	
- 1	Not sure why monitor companies make monitors that don't provide clear video in the dark. Isn't that when you need it most? Don't be fooled by the daylight pictures. The night vision picture quality is truly awful. Skip this	
- 1	I'd go with the tie points you put on the wall.  I think these things suck and don't work all that well.	
- 1	Our 3 month old daughter has horrible GERD since birth. She's on meds, special formula, cereal added, we keep her upright for feedings and for an hour afterwards, etc. We were able to raise the head of the bassinet which she quickly outgrew, but not the new crib. Our pediatrician whose son also had severe GERD basically said good luck because she's going to probably have to sleep in her swing until she's a year old. No way do I want to do that! It's fine for a nap, but she never sleeps as deeply in her swing and she really needs to be trained on good sleep habits like all other kids or she'll have problems all her life (and I'm speaking from experience, I had her same issues as a kid and have had lifelong insomnia -- now I know why). This under the mattress is working well for us for right now. During the transition from the bassinet, we had to put this in the middle of the crib for a few nights with a towel around her to keep her from sliding down and from freaking out. The first night we didn't do this and it was a disaster even though we'd introduced her to the crib earlier with no problems. She moved in her sleep and when she couldn't figure out where the heck she was with all this space and even with my picking her up immediately (we co-sleep in the same room with her) she screamed and fretted for a good hour (staring at me as if she wanted to make sure it WAS Momma and nothing else had changed! so sad but adorable at the same time!).When I went to remake the crib once she was used to it (we just kept spreading the towel around her until she was used to the extra room, it took 3 nights) and I moved the wedge up, there was a VERY unsafe gap. While someone (MIL....sigh) suggested that if I *had* to 'mess with it' to just roll up towels, but this is so not a good idea. Very dangerous! Instead I put this under the mattress and it solved the problem even if the angle doesn't seem to be quite as high. As far as wedges go, this is a decent price although the price fits the cheap quality (two pieces and it off gases terribly). We're going to replace this as soon as we find something that works better (and is safer and made with better materials).So yes, it works, but I can't recommend it.	
- 1	As if feeding baby wasn't messy enough already, these spoons have such long heavy handles that no matter what you set them in (little bowls, cups jars...etc.) they flip out of them. Now you not only have food all over the baby and tray, now it is all over you and the floor and you are left with a dirty spoon. The upside is that the dogs like them!	
1. 	If I ever have to contain a potential bio-hazard, this is what I use.  Quick to set up and easy to put away or take with you, this little baby has enough room to give your baby some play space in the middle of the most hazardous locations.	
1. 	Just got this bag via Amazon, first I LOVE that it's a messenger type and not flowery or pink.  Maybe I'll change my tune as my baby gets older, but I've seen friends/family lugging around a whole house-full of gear/toys/clothes/blankets/food for their kid in massive diaper bags, most of which they never seem to use - I have no intention of doing any of that.  This seems to hold what I think I'll actually need, a few diapers, wipes, a bottle or two, change of clothes, a toy, my wallet/keys.  Only annoyance so far is the cell holder, considering how many people have smartphone/iphones now I can't understand why they would include a holder for a flip phone.  I also don't love the changing pad, it doesn't fold as nicely as I think I'd like, I want to pick up one of the wallet-style changing pads that are more compact and fold nicer.  All in all I see this as a perfect urban bag.	
1. 	A must have when breast feeding.  These are however a little on the thick side.  You need to be wearing a heavier shirt or sweater/ sweat shirt to conceal pads in place.  Comes with nice small nylon bag to wash them in.	
1. 	I bought this for my son when he was just a few months old.  He loved it.  It has a lot of different textures along the sides to keep him occupied.  The only &#34;negative&#34; is that it can only be used for a few short months before your child outgrows it.	
- 1	One friend recommended this for our baby registry  as a must-have. I can use it five times in a row in the exact same spot on the baby's (or my) forehead and get five different readings. Our pediatrician actually said not to use it, which we found out after buying it. If you want an accurate result or are truly concerned for an infant's temperature you should be doing a rectal temp.	
1. 	The waterproof layer is the best feature.  Our baby drools all the time but it never gets through to his shirt.  Regular bibs just won't cut it anymore.  The neck size is good for a child probably up to 16 lbs.  After that, it gets quite tight.	
1. 	I have been able to use this chair beginning at 4 months due to the adjustable settings and straps.  I always supervise of course but as soon as my son could hold his head up he loved this chair and off we went to the restaurants, grandparents, etc.  It is so portable with the handy over the shoulder strap that is attached.  Just a wonderful babyshower gift but keep in mind that this is possibly not for a large child. My son is in the 50% percentile weight and height wise so this chair will be used for awhile but I can see how it could be outgrown too soon for some babies.	
- 1	I've been disappointed with every Munchkin sippy cup I've purchased.  This one is no exception.  Liquid collects outside of the valve where the liquid comes out and once tipped over it sprays everywhere.  It's definitely not spill/nor leak proof as stated.  It's fine for using outdoors with water so we'll continue to do that, but in the house I'll have to rely on something better.	
- 1	I bought this item because of the Sealy Posturepedic name, the price, and the fact that the positive reviews outweighed the negatives. Well...I should have paid attention to the customer who said that the mattress indented where her child was lying down. This is exactly what happened to me. After only a week, there was an indent in the mattress where my son's head and torso lay. I turned it over and the same thing happened. I think it's because of all the air above the springs, but I can't be sure. I returned it due to its very poor construction. I'm surprised, but at the same time I'm not because the mattress also had the Kolcraft brand name on it and I'm not particularly impressed with that brand.	
- 1	We encountered midew problems only while using this pail liner, it leaks, and is also the smell does not come out of the material.We got one a few years ago and some one gave us another one (both brand new) last year from our new baby, both times we have had the same issues.Planet Wise is way better.	
1. 	Love this playmat! We also have the baby einstein ocean playmat and they are both great... We love the sounds and effects on this playmat and our son has loved it since day one (about 3-4 months old)..Now that he can crawl he will lay on it for a few minutes and chew on toys, but we like to leave the music and lights on for him while he crawls around and plays.. He can flip it over now, and he thinks that it is funny, but it is sturdy and he never could flip it when he was younger..	
1. 	(...)So I switched to the Platex Premium nurser.  She really likes the softness of the nipple and I think it is similar to that of a real breast nipple.I was totally against buying the bags and having to go through the hassle of changing bags and thought it would be messy and expensive...but I only have 5 bottles -- they clean easy, and I just toss a new drop in bag in and it's fast and convienant.	
- 1	This mattress is just foam.  I would not recommend it.  The only upside is, it is not squishy like another mattress we ordered than promptly returned.  We have also returned this one too.	
- 1	Didnt fit my cabinets. I am so glad I only bought one to try to make sure it fit before buying for all my cabinets	
- 1	The mirror comes with two different methods of attachment - suction cup or clip onto the visor.  I am using the suction cup and it seems to be sticking very well, though I've only had it up for a few days so far.  However, the image it gives me of the back seat is incredibly small, much smaller than my regular rear view mirror.  I'll be able to see general motion and that's about it.  I guess this is a side effect of the wide view but I don't need to monitor three kids, just one, so it doesn't need to be wide.  There is also a small amount of distortion, right above the center of the mirror, which is annoying.If I can find the packaging I'm going to return it, but I may have already discarded some or all of it.	
1. 	I looked really hard for a tub that can grow with a baby.  The headrest of the tub is great for a newborn and I love that I can wash the entire tub and not worry about detaching and washing the support fabric that other baby tubs have.  The only thing I don't like about the tub is the size.  It's huge.  Takes up 3/4 of the size in our bathtub.	
1. 	If I could I would give it 6 stars! Boy do I love this chair!We are urban, minimalist, no nonsense people. I always dreaded the ugly plastic baby chairs I used to see at other people's houses. So we registered and got Eddie Bauer wood highchair for our baby shower. One word of advice - don't buy products such as chairs until you meet and get to know your child.We set up the EB chair and realized right away what a mistake it was buying it. It was gorgeous but totally unsafe and difficult to use. It had 1 point harness, the strangest contraption I've ever seen. We could imagine our kid hanging off the chair in a year or two. So we took it back and after much research and testing, we chose Malawi. We are so happy!1) We got both the vinyl and cotton covers, so when the baby is small we can use cotton, than later we'll move on to vinyl.2) Malawi has the wheels so we can move the baby with us when we're cooking, cleaning, or just moving out and about. We can even take the baby to our deck when we dine outside. EB chair was VERY heavy and no wheels so I had to lift or drag - a major pain in the you know what. The wheels can be locked or omitted if you don't want this feature.3) Unlike hard, uncomfortable EB chair, Malawi gives the plush, armchair type dining experience for our 8 month old kid. We put the cotton cover on top of the vinyl so it's extra padded and comfy. I used to have to put rolled up towels on both sides in order to keep our baby upright.4) Malawi reclines, where EB doesn't. Major plus with the tiny ones who don't sit on their own yet. Also the fact that it has different hights is a wonderful feature. We can play real low or dine real high.5) My only issue is with the tray. Tray is not really one-hand release. It's heavy and bulky and it took me some time to get used to it. Unlike Fisher Price Healty care chairs it doesn't really slide into place with one hand. However, the dishwasher tray is large and covers the whole tray which makes cleaning a snap, plus you get an extra one in the box to use when the first one is in the dishwasher being cleaned! How cool is that!Also, the tray is a bit too high for our kid, but we'll just keep it in the closet for now.6) This chair is by far the most comfortable out of all the ones my baby tested. I like that unlike Fisher Price Healthy Care chair it doesn't have reclining lever in the the middle of the head rest. Also the chair cover is longer than on any other chair. I was under the impression that Fisher Price vinyl cover sharp edging would be cutting in my kids legs.7) Malawi is very pretty green and blue color, but if you don't like plad you have a choice of solid blue or solid green covers. The 5 point harness is nice and tight and you can remove it to clean it.Hope this helps and you consider this chair.	
1. 	good thing i only bought one package because one pack had enough to cover all the outlets in my house.	
1. 	these are much better than the 2 piece shields that came with my medela pump, they are easy to wash and very easy to use.	
1. 	I couldn't wait to put my daughter in her papasan chair. Unfortunately, she didn't fit into it well until she was about two months old (about 9 lbs.) I wish it had different reclining positions, it just sat too upright for a small baby. But now, she loves it. She can sit and watch her videos or take a nap. It also has the perfect setting of vibration and the music it plays is just beautiful, not like cheesy, cartoony lullaby music.	
1. 	I have tried several other kinds of bottle brushes & this one works best for me.  It fits well into most sippy cups as well as the Playtex Drop in bottles.  The nipple brush is great for cleaning the nipples, which I do by hand every day.  It only lasts a couple weeks with heavy daily use (the nipple brush is first to go) so it would be awesome if there were replacement nipple brushes.	
- 1	I bought this because my 10 months old are starting to open up cabinet doors and drawers. I tried using this to keep them closed but it has failed on me. I even tried putting them on differently thinking maybe I just did them wrong. But nope. Nothing worked. I got so frustrated that I wanted to just throw them away.First, it was very hard to get it to close tightly so the doors don't open up. Even after I have almost broke my fingers off trying to close it to as tightly as possible. The doors would still open up. That was no good because my daughter can end up closing the doors on her fingers and hurt herself. Aside from that, it was VERY hard to open/close this. To pull it close was kind of easy but to open them back up was hard. There is a small button on the side to press and at the same time, you have to push the little button up in order to release and allow you to pull it open.I don't have fat fingers. I actually have tiny hands and I found that to be very hard to do. It's a positive thing because that means LO won't be able to open up the lock herself. But, it was PAINFUL for me to open it. When I was trying to lock up the doors it was so hard for me.I tried any possible ways to do it so that it wouldn't be hard and close the doors tightly. Nothing worked.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. I might give these a try in the future maybe...But for now they're just stored away. Eventually it might even become garbage.	
1. 	This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure. It also covered as well as the other plugs :) Easy to use and sturdy.	
1. 	This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.	
1. 	I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier.	
1. 	I purchased this for my daughter when I also got her a car seat for her baby.  After all, she had just gotten a new used Lexus with leather seats and I sure didn't want those seats torn with the car seat.  I had that happen with my old car and wanted to help her prevent that.I don't personally use it, but I sit beside it (in the back seat!) often and see that it seems to be doing the job nicely.  Each time I look at it I feel a sense of happiness that this beautiful car's seats are being protected as best they can.We have not yet figured out how to connect the seat to the latch system, only because we haven't had the time to read the instructions on the seat.  I think there should be no problem with using this AND connecting to the latches, but I cannot vouch for that yet.	
- 1	This is only my 2nd Amazon review, EVER, and I shop enough to get the Prime. But with this product I HAD to review it.... I struggled with the ANNOYING childproof lock that makes it virtually impossible to take it apart and it hurts to open it. I have to soak it EVERY time to get the food out so I can open it, but I would deal with it. But that is NOT why I am writing. I just discovered that this product will fit perfectly over his mouth and nose, like a match made in heaven. Which is pretty bad because it could easily suffocate him. These lids are going in the trash. I will continue to use them WITHOUT the lids (lest someone else let him play with them. However, given the hassle that it is to open it I think we may just go with the Munchkin ones. Very upset about this.	
1. 	This tub works real good for our baby girl. After 2 months, the new was off though. Works well! Excellent	
1. 	I love medela bottles, I love that they are BPA free. I love this product, I like the way it looks, the only thing I HATE are the bottle nipples. They look horrible and my two month old daughter does not like them at all. I went online and got other medela nipples, those she likes.	
- 1	The produt came on time and it looks like how it is in the picture and product description.  The problem is, the sides deflates overnight, even when it wasn't used.  We have to constantly pump air into it.	
1. 	I LIKE THESE DIAPERS A LOT!  THEY FIT WELL AND LEAKS ARE RARE...USUALLY OVER NIGHT IF IT HAPPENS.  WE HAVE FOUND THAT IF YOU PUT A WASHABLE LINER INTO THE DIAPERS AT NIGHT IT ALMOST ELIMINATES LEAKS ALL TOGETHER.  THEY DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DRY, SO YOU NEED TO CONSIDER THIS WHEN WASHING THEM.  ALSO, I HAVE NOTICED SOME BREAK DOWN OF THE COVER BY THE WASTE BAND AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF USE.  THEY STILL WORK;  BUT CAN CAUSE AN IRRITATION ON OUR SONS ABDOMEN IF NOT WATCHED.  I HAVE NOT TRIED ANY OTHER BRAND;  SO I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO.  BUT I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO DO EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND THIS IS A GREAT START.	
- 1	This toy has a good concept. It has a suction cup base and the toy spins and plays music. I bought it for a trip via airplane and it worked well during the flight. But then we loaded into the rental car and this thing played its music every time we hit a bump or turned a corner. It is extremely sensitive and I eventually gave it away because it was driving me nuts. If you can handle the constant music, it&#8217;s a good toy but I got sick of it.	
1. 	Originally bought to go with the baby changing table I purchased from Amazon.  They were actually recommended to go with it.  Well they didn't fit in the cubby holes, grrr!!  I kept them anyway as they came in useful in the nursery and they look good.	
1. 	I highly recommend this product for a kid that hates wearing a bib..my son (11 months) couldn't take it off like all the other tens of bibs we tried and he actually treats it as of it's t-shirt or sth :D	
- 1	My nipples are difficult to be latched for my baby.  And I feel very pain when I feed her everytime.  I really hope this one can solve my problem but it disappoint me.  It is hard to stick tightly on the breast, when my baby latched rubber nipples, it will become warped up on both sides, then it sticked on my baby's cheeks, it's so funny.  The other important thing is it smells not good after I sterilize it even thought the ads said it odorless. I only  tried once and will  not use it again.	
1. 	These have served their purpose pretty well. I used them to freeze breast milk, and now for homemade babyfood. All in all they have worked out great. They actually yield a little less than an ounce though. Maybe you have to fill them to overflowing to get a whole ounce. Also, sometimes the lids don't seem to fit quite right or stay on well. But most of the time they do. I always wash them by hand, as other reviewers had said the lids warp in the dishwasher.	
- 1	I was satisfied with this product (good padding, easy to use) except my son was able to rip them right off table corners.  It needs a stronger adhesive, otherwise it is worthless and baby then tries to teeth on it, and it can be ripped apart with teeth and cause a choking hazard.  I never put them on anything after trying one table.	
1. 	It looks great in my sons room and perfectly matches his Graco crib! The cubby holes are perfect for storing our cloth diapers and other diapering needs!	
- 1	Fun toy in theory. We have a Britax roundabout and there really wasn't a great place to attach it at. Every place was just kind of awkward. My son liked it though so I kept trying! It's pretty inconvenient having to take one side off every time you get your baby out of the seat. Anyway, one of the clamps broke within two months so it went in the trash!	
- 1	I really wished they made these in a larger size. This size would be great for a newborn, but that's it.	
1. 	I used this on our first trip to Disney. I have a three year old and a three month old. I used this product with my Combi double stroller and it worked great. It kept my little ones protected for the hot Florida sun. It also worked really nice when it rained in the middle of the day. It isn't water proof, but it worked for a short period of time until we could get under some protection. It folds up nice and small and I keep it stored under my stroller at all times. I'd buy again!	
1. 	We have a one year who has been wearing these bibs since her 8th week...  got a bunch of them as hand me downs, along with the usual outfit coordinated bibs (which always seem tiny) and have exclusively used these over all the others.  The colors match every shade of pink in her wardrobe, and the other colors match when you don't want so much pink.  Stains come right out with Shout for food matter, and never had an issue tossing in the dryer on low heat.  Since we got them without the original packaging, never knee they were hang dry recommended.  Still, as long as the velcro ends are matched up, they don'get stuck to other items.  And the velcro is such a great, strong one that our daughter can't rip these off like she does the wimpy decorative ones.  And they are the perfext thickness for using with the Playtex Binky tethers--clip on easily and remove easily without marring the bib material.  I swear, these are the only bibs anyone needs.  Buying more because a few have gotten misplaced at daycare (aka put in another kid's cubby and the parents didn't want to return them because they're that good!).  May buy the boys colors too for even more color matching potential to outfits.	
1. 	This product has been wonders for my 1st grand child.  She loves all the activities she can hear and do.  Very stimulating.	
- 1	This product is terrible. We bought it looking for a less-crazy, more modern-looking alternative to the noisy, pastel-printed alternatives. But there isn't really any part of this mobil that works. The cross bars are prone to breaking (we had to superglue them twice while setting it up). The cards are supposed to be interchangeable, but I spent 20 minutes trying to swap out a single card, only to give up and spend 20 minutes undoing what I did. Even if you leave the card alone, they don't really hang flat. And the attachment mechanism is worse than other mobiles that are in the same price range. Terrible!	
1. 	We purchased this for our daughter's nursery and have been using it for almost nineteen months now--and it still is in perfect condition!  I was nervous about potential tears to the inside mesh liner (the removable laundry bag part of the hamper) but have had no problems whatsoever.I love that there is a lid (a flap of cloth) that folds over the top of the frame to hide the laundry inside--it is the perfect spot for me to keep a small mesh bag (lingerie bag) to put my daughter's dirty socks in...that way we never have to worry about losing socks in the wash!This hamper is very convienent, relatively sturdy, and doesn't scream baby--so if you need to keep it in a room other than the nursery, it won't look too out of place.Now that we're expecting our second child, I plan on purchasing another one of these hampers.	
1. 	THE BEST. totally washable/wipeable. adjusts to any chair. easy to take to restaurants, babysitters', grandmas', picnics, etc. I've started giving this at baby showers because it is THAT awesome & useful.PS I've seen it at target & walmart in a nice cream/tan/maroon color scheme this year.	
- 1	Like everyone said, these are WAY to big. I bought them for my almost 4 year old that weighs 35 pounds.After reading reviews, I bought the medium size (rated for 20-25 pounds) thinking those would probably fit him the most accurately, and he was still swimming in those. That being said, I'm not sure if they work or not as there was so much empty space between the cover and his legs that OF COURSE the pee leaked out the sides when he went.In my opinion, these are a total waste of money because of the sizing issue. Who wants to buy something like this in every different size to see if they will fit your child since the sizing guidelines are so completely inaccurate?	
- 1	While my son is drinking from the cup, the part where the plastic spout meets with the lid comes apart and leaks all over the place.	
1. 	These are for the *tall* bottles, and are blue like the reservoirs that come with the original bottles. Be sure to use the Dr. Brown's cleaning brush in the stem part... these and the inserts can grow loads of germy funk if you don't.  Good replacement part.	
1. 	This is a great simple toy. My son loves the veggies and the crate and I love that the materials are natural and organic. He is learning about vegetables and about putting things in and out of the crate--which is also a great teething toy. The wood/fabrics are not treated with any chemicals so I have peace of mind that he is not exposed to anything harmful.	
1. 	Looking at baby toys is so overwhelming. This set has all you need (of course you'll end up buying more toys, but really this is all you need!). The toys are high-quality, colorful, and they encourage exploration in play. I highly recommend this set.	
- 1	I returned an earlier order because of erroneous information about sizing.  But I received a Thirsties prefold recently to try out.  The dense, heavy fabric - almost twice as heavy as a 100% cotton prefold - takes forever to dry.  It has a strange design in which double layers wrap around in a cylindrical shape, and it's too short unless you use it as an insert (but, then why call it a prefold?).  This isn't a true prefold.  It's one giant 2-layered sheet wrapped around itself and sewn closed in an infinite loop, so it's essentially 4 layers when laid flat.  It stains easily, and bleach doesn't even remove it.  However, if you have plenty of sunshine, the sunlight will gradually fade the stains.  It becomes stiff when wet - like cardboard; so it's not comfortable for baby.  Whichever way you fold it or use it, the combined 4 layers is too thick and stiff.  It's not organic, and the hemp is chemically processed.	
- 1	These flow WAY too fast.  Our breastfed infant was choking on the milk it was coming out so fast.  On one occasion when I had left our other bottles with the sitter, I came home to find my husband attempting to feed the baby by letting the milk drip through one of these nipples into another nipple to slow it down for the her.  For those looking for an alternative, we ended up using the Avent bottles.  They have been great - the flow is just right and our little girl doesn't get too much gas from them.	
1. 	This tub has really been great!  In the beginning, the sling feature was fantastic because you can't get baby's belly button wet.  The sling allows baby to sit above the water but still be in it.The other feature that I really like is the recline position for infants.  My daughter (now 8 mos) still sits in the recline position sometimes.  I will admit that when she was smaller, she did slide around a little in the tub.  But, I fixed that by putting a hand towel behind her - that seemed to keep her from sliding.  Now that she's bigger though, sliding hasn't been a problem for sometime.I really like that I don't have to fill up the whole tub/shower for bathtime.  I can just fill up this little tub inside the shower, or my husband likes to use it at the sink.  Either way works fine.  I also like the water release at the bottom of the tub - it automatically drains for you.Overall, this tub is great.  My daughter is still able to fit in it just fine, with plenty of room for toys.  And I think it will last for some time to come!	
- 1	I wanted to return it because in the description it said the large size was larger than it actually was.  I was trying to fit a training toilet seat in a bag, and this one did not work for the size I needed.	
1. 	I purchased these for my 11 months old grand daughter to use in our water table outside, pool and bath. She loved them. They are so colorful and she loved squesing the water out at her cousins. Her older cousins ages 7 to 15 had just as much fun with them as her. They all float and seem to call for you to play with them. They also have a tecture that seemed to please my grand baby as well. I would recommend this to my friends.	
1. 	We bought these when our son was about 4 months old.  He started drooling up a storm and I just wanted to prevent him from getting soaked all the time.  Then he started spitting up a little more frequently, and these were great for that as well.  All in all, I love these bibs.  They aren't bulky but are waterproof.  And they aren't too tight around his neck (and he has a rather large head).  I wish I had bought 2 packs when they were on sale!!  Great colors too.  Just make sure when you wash them that you attach the velcro otherwise they will attach and possibly ruin other items in the load.	
1. 	My 4 month old, although he can not sit up on his own yet, loves this bathtub!!  We use it for him to splash around and play in.  Since I have to hold him upright, I can't bathe him in it yet.  The suction cup for the duck to hang and dry from is useless; it will not hold the weight of the duck.  Really this is not an issue at all, we just turn the duck upside down in the tub and let it drip dry.  The HOT indication disk in the bottom of the tub stays indicating HOT even after the water has cooled.  Again, not a big issue - I can stick my hand in and tell if it's body temp or not.	
- 1	The Belkin WeMo Wi-Fi Baby Monitor for Apple iPhone looks pretty cool.  It's sleek, compact and modern looking. The hardware looks and probably works pretty impressively, probably. I say that because I haven't taken it apart to see for myself, haha.So... the App is exceptionally frustrating. I installed - uninstalled - installed, uninstalled and got the app to work once for about a minute before it locked up my phone.  I'm hoping that Belkins does something to rectify the app soon because being just an audio monitor at the price point of ~$70 is already a steep handicap. Being an expensive audio monitor with a beta stage app is unforgivable.Not recommended.	
1. 	I had purchased this before my daughter was born and used it often to BF.  After about 6 months of use, some of the plastic tubing in the neckline poked through the fabric and began scratching my neck.  I was disappointed and decided to reach out to Bebe au Lait.  Within 24 hours of my email to customer service, they responded with an apology, a pre-paid UPS label to send them the defective one, and a confirmation email to send me a brand new cover.  I love when companies make sure their customers are happy!	
1. 	I'm so grateful for this monitor. The price was just right and it's just the item I need to quickly get to my baby when she awakes from naps, etc. The clarity is perfect for our large 3-bedrm apartment.	
1. 	I LOVE Avent products. I only used Avent bottles with both my kids and I own both the Avent iQ24 Steam ELECTRIC sterilizer, as well as the Avent Steam MICROWAVE sterilizer. I like both of them ... and RECOMMEND them over boiling water in a pan any day. However (if price were not an issue), I do like the iQ24 a little better, simply because you can just plug it in, add water, and don't have to worry about taking something in and out of the microwave. It is very easy to use and the digital display tells you the status, so no guessing. You do pay for that added convenience and the bells and whistles of the digital display and alerts.As for boiling water ... when you first bring your baby home from the hospital (whether it be your first, second, etc.), you are generally sleep-deprived and not exactly thinking at your best or clearest. The LAST thing you want to be doing in this state of mind is BOILING water on the STOVE TOP to sterilize bottles. You cannot/should not walk away from the boiling water to do other things (which is hard to do as a parent of a newborn). In a sleep-deprived state, if you walk away, you WILL at one time forget you had the bottles boiling. There is no safety mechanism ... the water will eventually evaporate ... and that is dangerous. This is why I like the Avent STEAM sterilizers ... they do the job without supervision, so you can do your job as a parent.The GREAT thing about the iQ24, is you plug it in and put the bottles in to be sterilized. You can remove them in 6 minutes, or leave them there (where they will remain sterilized). You don't have to stay with the iQ24 to supervise it, as you do with boiling water. You can pick up a crying baby, change a dirty diaper, or just sit down and get some much needed rest. To me, that was the priceless part of the iQ24 ... that ONE less thing to worry about.The Avent MICROWAVE steam sterilizer does essentially the same thing, but with less bells and whistles and less expense.It also works great to sterilize pacifiers.I give it 5 STARS ... just wish it weren't so expensive. :)	
1. 	this is such a good price for this base. It was easy to assemble and I love how easily it folds to fit in my car.	
- 1	This thing worked for about a month, then it stopped working completely! Shame, I thought I'd finally found a wipes warmer that worked! I've tried the munchkin and had to send that one back to! I recommend just staying away from wipe warmers at all, and warm your babies wipes with warm sink water, none of the wipes warmers I've given a chance have delivered! Buy at own risk!	
- 1	I guess I might like this chair when my son is 2 years old and I want something for him to sit in that's more to his scale than a regular dining chair. I hope so for what we paid for it. Because for a 9 month old infant it fails. Without the cushions the baby slides all around and the straps do almost nothing to hold him in. And the clips are cheap and difficult as somebody else said. You could never walk away even for a moment with an infant in this chair. Then when using the cushions the straps are too short; it's just bad design, the straps should go through the cushion not around the sides. I called the company to ask about that, nobody bothered to return my call or email me, they just put some more straps in the mail and why I don't know because they're the same length straps that are on the chair already. Gee thanks. I also agree with Matt's review about the tray. Very flimsy attachment to the chair. I don't know where all these positive reviews come from. I'm wondering if they had all the employees post them. If I could go back in time and do it over I would buy or get free on Craigs List an ugly plastic comfy cushioned Graco high chair perfect for babies, who cares what it looks like, then maybe get this chair later to use for age 2-5. Meanwhile I'm feeling like a fool for having put modern hipster aesthetics over functionality and hello, SAFETY right now.	
1. 	I have no complaints about the Diaper Genie - sure you have to buy refills - so what - yes, it may stink a little when you open it to dispose of them - diapers stink - I think the product is great & I highly recommend it.	
- 1	Break off the doors. Kids just ripped them off with in hours of them being installed. A 2 and 3 year old. Sad. And only one key??	
- 1	I haven't opened the packaging so cannot comment on the functionality as I will be returning these spoons.  I did not realize that these were disposable spoons - I found that description in the very small print at the bottom of the item page.  Very disappointing. I already create enough waste to not add these spoons to it.UPDATEIt was more trouble than it was worth to send back the spoons so I have been using them, or that should be I used them.  Once.  The plastic is scratchy around the spoon (you can see the seam) and I was not comfortable scraping the excess food off of my 6 month old baby's face with them as they looked very uncomfortable on her skin.  I think I was lucky not to actually scratch her delicate skin.  I will still pay the $7 odd to get the OXO spoons which I love, though whilst I only get 2 for $7 compared to the 10 for $8, I will be happier with them and I won't have to throw them away as they break down.	
1. 	Used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center.  Works great.  We used it horizontally, unlike the suggested vertical method.	
- 1	I bought these with the intent to put them in a diaper pail. They do not have any type of attachment or adhesive to do so. The package says they are specifically refills for the attachment, but the online description does not specify this. I had to put my own adhesive on these so not to waste my money on them.	
- 1	As neat as this looks, it is hard to use.  The red ball sits in the water as a pump, and you press the blue star to make the water squirt out of elmos mouth.  I thought it attached to the spicket, but it does not.  The star is hard to press, even for me.  My 2 year old can't do it at all.  And it is not constant.  One push just gives you one squirt.  Was disappointed	
- 1	I bought these after great deliberation and scrutiny. Well, they disappoint. The lid is very tricky to ensure it is closed.I bought a pack of 12 4oz mason jars from Walmart for $7.98. I love them, their glass	
- 1	I am 5'8 and it just does not work well. If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled.  I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great. I had high hopes for this but just not long enough.  I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding.	
1. 	Ordered this product about 5 days ago. Must say that I am impressed. It is durable, sturdy and is a companion for my 2 year old. She seems to take it all around the house (even climb up the sofa from the armrest side) just to go up the sofa.It has been very easy to have the young gal adapt to using it. She gets up and gets down smoothly from her regular activities (brushing, using the toilet, etc).Highly recommend it to anyone whose child is about to be potty-trained or can wash hands or perform simple hygenic chores.	
- 1	My son doesn't care for this toy at all. It doesn't do too much and is a it bulky. I had actually bought this for the plane ride, but it was too big to take.	
1. 	If there is one baby product that was a game changer for us this was it! Amazing and very effective especially when your baby constantly wakes him or herself up with their movements(hands,legs). Seems to work best until about 3 months of age after which ours learnt to take out her hands.	
- 1	Bought this product for my granddaughters highchair, but her chair is an older model and sadly did not fit it.	
- 1	Would have rated it higher if:1. They were pre-folded smaller...I can fold them up myself but they just get smushed in my bag, when they're already creased from packaging they tend to retain the original shape better.2. The two teenie adhesive stickers on it are awful! Might as well just make one big strip. I couldn't even find them, they're just two small stickers that don't serve much point. I wanted them to replace &#34;PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.)&#34; which are no longer available (THOSE were fabulous).So...it'll do the job, but they're still crummy.	
1. 	I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)	
- 1	I was unable to use these as expected because of static.  One had low-level continuous static and the other had loud static.  It unnerved me listening through the static and I simply stopped trying to use them.This was a regrettable purchase, a waste of money.  I don't recommend this product.	
1. 	This seems like this would fit different size pads and it is very soft and the color was as shown.	
1. 	The good?* It's inexpensive* It's very sturdy* The lid stays closed/locked* The formula doesn't mix with other compartments* You can fit a lot of formula in each section (at least 6oz, I haven't tried 8oz yet)* The cup will be good for snacks when formula is doneThe bad?* It takes a bit of tamping and shaking to get all the formula out (and even then you might still miss some--but it's not usually that big of an amount to worry about)* It's a bit bulky.	
1. 	I love, love, love this play pen, its money will spent, it roomy and colourful, would defin. recommend. it makes noises as well.	
1. 	This pillow made me more comfortable at night and I could sleep easier.  Around my fifth month, I had a hard time sleeping.  I could not get comfortable and was awakened by frequent leg cramps.  I put this pillow under my head, around my back and between my legs.  It kept me on my left side during the night and the extra support between my legs lessened my leg cramps.  The cover washed up very nicely and the pillow rolled up and fit right back into the plastic bag after my baby was born.My only complaints are that it takes up so much room in the bed when the sheets are tucked in, the pillow case is difficult to get off and on when it needs to be washed and the pillow doesn't fit me as well as it does the woman in the picture.  I am 5'10 and my head just fits on the top end and the bottom end goes between my thighs instead of my knees.  But overall, I was very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I searched high and low for a shopping cart cover for my daughter. She is just under 6 months old and isn't quite sitting up on her own. I asked a lot of friends and family about their covers and what they liked and didn't like. I read numerous reviews on here and I was hesitant to order this cover because the of the negative reviews regarding its size. I took this to Wal-mart and got a big size cart (in my area they are all large).  I put it in the seating area and my oh my it fit perfectly! It covered everything! I just can't say enough good things about this cover! I have no idea what those negative reviews are talking about. It is very cute, soft and feels like it will easy to clean. I love the toy hooks too. Just so many great things, possibly one of my favorite baby products I've bought so far.	
1. 	I really wasn't sure about this when I bought it, but my 9 month old has six teeth so dental hygiene needs to be incorporated. Other items I've offered him to chew have been touch and go, which is why I was hesitant about this product: just because it is designed for a baby to chew doesn't mean he's going to chew it. In fact, while I was opening the package he was already chewing on something else he seemed to find wildly satisfying. Yet when I handed him this toothbrush he became immediately intrigued, set down the other object and went to town on the toothbrush! I could hear his little teeth squeaking against the nubby bristles, and it seemed that the shape was able to get good coverage on both front and back.Rad item. Totally glad I bought it.	
- 1	We bought this item as an alternative to another silicone feeder which we really liked. However that other silicone feeder just wasn't big enough for our growing boys. We like that this one was bigger and held more fruit. The bad part is, this feeder has no method for locking handle to silicone. It has a plastic ring that clicks everything together, but within seconds of using it for the first time my (at the time 11 month old) sons were able to take it apart and mashed up banana was everywhere.In addition all feeders for infants/toddler should have some opening for a tether or lanyard so that the feeder can be held/attached in place. As soon as my sons are done with their feeders they are thrown or just dropped and when we are using them in the stroller that means the feeders are generally. After the few times this happened and we lost feeders we finally started looking every 5 minutes or so to make sure the boys still had them.Overall I was disappointed in this products use, but the size was good.	
1. 	I have used this stick from day 3 of my baby's life and I absolutely love it. It is a must for anyone who lives in a remotely dry climate and wants to protect their baby's cheeks. It smells like vanilla - far, far better smelling than any other Mustela product (which I always find way too perfumey).  It's kind of like a solid deodorant in texture, you just swipe it across the cheek and it adds instant moisture. Now that my little one is older and more wiggly, I can still get those cheeks moisturized without fighting.  Buy this now - you will not regret it!	
1. 	this is an amazing waterproof porta-crib pad, makes it more kushy and nice!American Baby Company Waterproof Fitted Quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad Coveramazing fit for dream on me 3'' mattress! Very happy for grandma's house!Dream On Me 3 Portable Crib Mattress	
- 1	I have purchased several other American Baby Company products in the past year and have been pleased with the quality.  So I was very disappointed to open the package and find such a skimpy piece of material.  Sure, the price is a value but you get what you pay for I suppose.  Still, I thought I could look past the cheapness of the fabric if the sheet fit the mattress.  Wrong.  I have to fight to put this sheet on theDream On Me 3 Foam Playard Mattress, Whitebecause the tight elastic makes the side seams pull up over the length of the mattress, causing it to bow in the middle.  It's just not worth the hassle.Yet all is not lost.  I found a new purpose for these sheets - changing table pad covers!  They fit like a glove on theSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  Here's to silver linings.	
1. 	We bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. We were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. This fits the table perfectly, and I love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. Many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. They all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. I also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. I also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. The only thing I didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. The pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once I had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. I would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. Overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon.	
- 1	I really lovedc the Chicco car seat (Key fit 30) so I thought I would love this little caddy! I don't know if I got a defective one, but the back wheels pop out constantly and to me, this feels cheap. I wish that for the price, I would have put the money toward the regular Chicco stroller. I do like that it's light but the quality is not good.	
1. 	This is baby nail clipper #4 that we've tried, and our search is finally over.  It's sharp enough to cut nails on the first try and the white bulb is pretty comfortable to hold.  What more do you need in a pair of baby nail clippers?The losers:- Safety 1st model 49539 (has the holder for emery boards) - the grip is comfortable but the clippers are blunt and therefore useless.  The emery board is useful.- Dubon baby nail clipper (the kind that you wear on your finger like a ring) - has the safety guard so you don't catch the baby's skin in the clippers, but that makes it almost impossible to clip the actual nail.  Plus, it's not sharp and therefore worthless.- Nuby infant nail clipper - not bad in terms of sharpness, but something about the way it's designed makes it really difficult to get at the baby's nails.Search ends here, thank goodness!	
1. 	The Daycare workers were offended by the book at first but after explaining its usefulness they realized how handy it is becoming.	
1. 	My grandson is starting to self feed and drink on his own and I have tried several different brands of cups.  The Playtex sippy cup is the best that I h ave found.The colors are nice and bright and the lid screws on nice and smooth and lock tightly for no leaks, but is still easy to take off.  The handles on the cup are great for little hands to grasp.  The price is a lot cheaper than retail stores and they were delivered right to my door.I can safely give my grandson something to drink while in the car and not worry about spills in my car or on him.  They work great!	
1. 	We purchased an expensive and highly rated newborn to toddler bathtub when our first daughter was born.  What a joke! I gave it away after two baths and we ended up using a towel on the bottom of the bathtub instead. Older and wiser, we purchased this EXTREMELY CHEAP sponge when our second daughter was born. It keeps her fairly submerged, supported, and warm, and makes baths easy as pie (and it dries a heck of a lot faster than the towel ever did).  Sure, it may wear out sooner than later, but who cares?  At this price, we can afford to go through a couple of them.	
- 1	I don't understand why not more people are complaining about this, but the volume on this monitor is really low! I've seen some other reviews that are saying the same thing, but it seems most people aren't bothered by it!? Maybe we did something wrong and should have placed the baby unit differently or done something differently on the parent unit - but I tried all kind of different constellations and locations and it didn't seem to make a difference. We were without a monitor for a while until we got this one and during that time we had to listen out for our baby when we were in the living room at night. That worked ok, but I preferred using a monitor just to make sure we'd hear him even if the tv or dishwasher was on. But when we turned this one on it make NO difference at all! The noise we heard on our own, by listen out for him across the hallway was pretty much as loud as what came out of the baby monitor! I'm sure the reception and other features are great and it seems like a good quality monitor - but all that seems pretty pointless if you still can't hear your baby! I returned it for a Graco monitor that didn't have as many good reviews - but I can hear my baby on it!	
1. 	~BACKGROUND~I purchased this as part of a set of 4 fruits for my 5 month old son who has really started teething.~PROS~- Organic cotton- Soft Egyptian cotton- Feels sturdy and well constructed- Bright color- Good size for infants to grab and hold- Fair Trade Product - socially and environmentally sustainable~CONS~- No so far!~TIPS~If you are going to purchase organic/natural products for your child, use non-toxic cleaning products to clean the toys such asCharlie's Soap Laundry Powder, 2.64-PoundsorSeventh Generation Powder Laundry Concentrated, Free and Clear, 112-Ounce (Packaging May Vary).Washing instructions: Machine wash only. Tumble dry until toy is completely dry. Do not immerse in water and leave out to dry. *Tip: Place a bath towel in the dryer with the toy to dry faster.~CONCLUSION~With so many products on the market that have unknown dyes, BPA, toxins, etc. in them it is great to find products such as these that I know are safe for my infant.	
1. 	I agree, if your kid has some muscle and determination, s/he will be able to push it around, especially on a hard floor.  However, my kid never got into that, and it was great for having a playpen-type area for my son that was much bigger than just sticking him in the pack in play.It's not good as as one of those doorway gates, or for something like walling off the TV area, unless you get creative with ties and furniture.  It isn't secure unless it's attached to itself, so your two options are a hexagon and square.  If that's what you want, it's great.  I also like that you could use it outdoors and that it folds up well.	
1. 	I bought two of these about two months ago. At the time I thought they where a little thin and wondered how long they would last.ProFits both my 2yr old and 3yr oldwipes down easilyTies in backThe print is prettyConsmaterial feels like it could rip easily or stretch.One of the two I have is already coming apart at the seams.Still like for the price I got them at.	
1. 	Nice soft covers.  We use it on a foursided pad with no issues.These are to prevent the changing pad from being to cold rather than protecting it.  Any fluids on other thing will go right through it but they will be somewhat contained.	
1. 	This seat has been super helpful in our house.  I got it when I was pregnant and having back problems and couldn't lift a 25lb potty trainer onto the toilet without hurting myself.  Definitely fit the bill.  My son loves that it's soft (and he's had problems with hard seats in the past) and he loves that he can do it himself.  The steps are made of a cheaper plastic that's super lightweight.  The hinge is designed so that when you grab the blue handles on top the seat will drop down and you can set it aside quickly (again good for pregnant mommy).  But that has meant that sometimes he likes to sit on the seat and then bang the legs of the steps up and down on the floor.  They haven't broken which is to their credit.  And he's very stable on the seat even when the legs of the steps are up in the air.  That's all very good.  This has been in our house a year now and I would buy it again if I had the choice.  Oh, and my son is now 30 pounds and the steps have still held up to his weight.  A note though- this will not enable most little boys to stand to pee into the toilet.  The cushion of the seat is too tall so that as they stand on the step they still are not high enough to reach over and into the toilet seat.UPDATE- We have had this seat two years now and it is still going strong.  My younger son (20lbs) has started sitting on it and is just as comfortable on it as my 4 year old (32 lbs.).	
- 1	I love the concept, too bad the product wasn't very durable.  Unfortunately, my tray cracked after two weeks of use.  I moved on to silicone and haven't looked back since.	
- 1	I have the previous version of this baby monitor, and we really liked it. While the picture viewed over the internet was not the greatest, it was still a real treat to be able to see my little one while I was at work and my parents enjoyed being able to look in on her at night.I don&#8217;t remember exactly how old she was when the monitor stopped working, but I clearly remember that the entire unit was extremely hot. I had another (non-internet) monitor at the time, so I didn&#8217;t really pursue a refund. It wasn&#8217;t until later when I heard about the battery recall that I realized that it had to have been the overheating battery that caused the monitor to go out. I was very happy to think I could get this very expensive monitor replaced, as we currently have a second baby on the way. Turns out not to be the case.This review is of my customer service experience with Summer Infant, and not a review of the monitor itself.When I found out about the battery recall, I dialed the number and they happily agreed to send me out a battery. I told them that the overheating battery also damaged my monitor, so they send me to a second number as they only deal with the battery recall. I called this number and explained that even plugged directly into the wall that my monitor no longer worked and I believed it due to the overheating battery. The CSR did some troubleshooting with me and told me it was the cable. I didn&#8217;t think this was the case, but I agreed to give it a try. Once the new cable was received and the monitor still didn&#8217;t work, I tried to call again. After waiting on hold for over half an hour, the second representative told me that my monitor was out of warranty and they had no way of knowing that my issue was caused by the battery. Basically, if the battery would have exploded instead of just overheating they would be able to help me. My frustration didn&#8217;t come from the inability to get a new monitor, but with things the rep told me. She actually said it was my fault, because I should have called Summer Infant when the problem first happened. My argument here is that I didn&#8217;t know why my monitor malfunctioned &#8211; but once the battery recall was evident it all made sense to me. Since she was clearly not going to send me a new monitor, I asked her if there was anything that could be done. I offered to send the broken monitor in so they could see if the problem was due to over-heating, and she again told me I should have called when the monitor first malfunctioned. She mentioned possibly bringing the battery to a Radio Shack type store to see if it had malfunctioned. I asked her if I could confirm that, would they then replaced the monitor. She said no, so I&#8217;m not sure what the point of that line of conversation was. In the end, she offered me a 30% discount on a new baby monitor before reminding me once again that I should have called when the monitor first malfunctioned. I declined her discount offer &#8211; I have no desire to give this company more of my money after the frustrating customer service I received.	
1. 	After getting the fisher price whale tub I realized the sling comes in very handy for infants who can't yet hold their head up! I returned the whale tub and got this one. It's perfect. First of all my daughter didn't like just being put into the whale tub. I guess she feels secure in the sling and never cried. It saves our ears the screams of our little one and now she actually looks forward towards bath time. All smiles from our little girl with this tub. Buy It. Save your Ears! Save her Tears!	
- 1	I was disappointed in these. Unfortunately after being used for a few months in a large rotation these started to tear and fall apart along the seams. I was disappointed because I had heard a lot of good things about FuzziBunz. This has made me hesitant to try their diapers.	
1. 	I love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. They fit great and arrived in record time.	
1. 	I ordered these because I wanted the BPA-free newborn size, but I was hoping not to have too many that would be pink for my son.  The listing says Colors may vary, you may receive in one of the following colors: white and green, pink and white or blue and white, however, we received purple and pink entirely from several orders and they were very vibrant colors, not pastel.  Just be aware that the colors may not be the same as what was posted.  Amazon, however, has excellent customer service and offered me a refund for the inconvenience!	
1. 	My baby says they feel just like the real deal. He enjoys them almost as much as the real ones. He would definitely recommend them. They have great flow that doesnt leak yet the baby doesnt collapse the nipple from extreme suckling.	
1. 	We have a boy and its missing a higher lip upfront for sure. That is the one thing this design is lacking but if you have a girl this should be prefect.I like our BJorn seat a big better bc of coverage up front.	
- 1	Doesn't unroll flat easily- have to really work on it.  We have yet to get it to stick to a table so it is always falling off.  The genius little food catcher sticks out and is right where the toddler leans; leaning on it causes the food to dump out, so it is less than genius.  Would not recommend this product.	
- 1	I bought this mirror so my baby would be able to see herself when she was laying on her back, but it slants up when you open the mirror prop so she can only see what's past her head. So then, I tried to hook it to the toy arch over her play mat, but it only includes two velcro loops that are at the bottom, so it slants away from her. Why there aren't four loops or even three, with at least one in the top or middle is beyond me. Also, the mirror is like a fun house mirror, which is weird since the packaging states its an accurate reflection as one of its features.	
1. 	A lot easier to use than some of those fancy diaper pails. Also, you can use any generic bags for them.  I felt that it kept the smell contained just as well as a much more expensive diaper pail that we had used for my older child.	
1. 	The cotton Halo is perfect for warm summer nights. I've washed it (cold water) and dried it (very hot air) dozens of times, no problems whatsoever :)	
- 1	It's nice but I personally think its a bit bulky and heavy for a smaller baby. I have to keep taking him from my nine month old cause he will smash his face with it and cry.	
- 1	I bought this set at IKEA and it's a lot cheaper to get it there. 6 bowls are $2.50, 6 cups are $2.50, and 18 utensils are $2.50. So you can get the entire set shown here for $7.50 at IKEA.  If you don't have an IKEA nearby then $15 isn't bad, but I almost bought something on Amazon once but I read a review from someone about buying it at the actual store and I saved a ton of money.  Since, then, I always try to pass on the tip.The product itself is awesome, so buy away if you can't get to IKEA.	
1. 	This playyard was a great investment for us. I do not understand how a one year old was moving it around... Our kid never cried in it and she loved pulling up on it and cruising. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, sounds like nothing will ever please them!	
1. 	The only problem I really have with this brush is that the nipple cleaner doesn't really seem to clean bottle nipples very well, it takes a bit of work to get them clean with it.I was glad to fing out, however, that this brush also works great forMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 80ml Bottlesthat I was so tired of trying to clean without a dishwasher but were the only bottles I could pump into before I bought the Avent pump conversion kit to use my Avent bottles with my Medela pump.	
1. 	I bought this product when it became apparent that our very colicky newborn needed to be in bed with us in order to be able to sleep.  I think she felt very secure in it and began sleeping through the night right when we started using it.  We also used it in her bassinette and then eventually in her crib to transition her into her own room.  She stayed in it for over 5 months and was a little long for it by the end, but was still very comfortable.  Definitely keeping this product around to use with our next baby!	
- 1	I don't know if it's just my dishwasher, but the caps and nipples did not come out clean. The OXO seems to be a better one.	
- 1	The head on this thing was MASSIVE. I tried pinning it, folding, angling different ways, but it was just huge. Not the right size for a newborn.	
1. 	Love  this lady bug!!!! Got it for my soon to be grand-baby . The stars, especially the white setting are so bright and vivid !I can't wait until my daughter unwraps it for Christmas and the lady bug will definitely light up a room. Not to bright but just right. Five stars all THE WAY !!!!!!!!!!!!	
- 1	This is a cute product but definitely not as cool as what is pictured and described. There is no trapped water; the sides are just plain plastic. I ended up returning it because without the water-trapped sides I felt it was pretty overpriced.	
1. 	Perfect lock.Much better than those door chains, and looks better too.I test it on my garage back door.  I only used one there, and I could not break open the door even if my life depended on it, and I'm 5'9&#34; 220 pounds pretty fit.I put 2 on my front door and now have a great piece of mind knowing that probably only a car driving through my front door will break it open.I recommend this lock to all my friends and family.Also looks great with any of the finishes it comes with.	
1. 	I bought this product because I know babies grow fast. It could be a rocker then be put into a toddler chair. Its has beautiful colors and the designs are cute. My son also likes to fall asleep in it. I wish they toys were a lot better and more pullable, and have more songs then just one.	
- 1	I will say upfront that the picture on the monitor is fine for the money we spent on the monitor. It doesn't pan or zoom but I knew that going in to buying it. My problems thus far:1) VOX and Auto Mute don't really work. It comes on and off when the sound in the room hasn't changed. We run low-decibel white noise that other monitors do not pick up. This monitor picks it up off and on, causing the monitor to turn on (and me to wake up!) when nothing is happening in the room.2) Wifi interference. This is a major problem. My phone cannot connect to Wifi when the monitor is on and it causes my computer to drop the Wifi signal over and over again. It hogs the 2.4 ghz bandwidth. We've had to resort to putting an audio monitor in the room for daytime so we can actually use our electronics before we go to bed (you know, the only time we have time to do this since we have a baby...). We then turn the monitor on after we get in bed and we have no need for Wifi. It's such a problem that I'm considering just donating the thing to Goodwill.I would not purchase this item again and I would not recommend it to a friend.	
1. 	We love this nightlight.  I got it for our six month old (now 15months) and he loves looking at the stars.  When we first turned it on he was looking all over trying to see them all.  We recently moved him from our room to his own and I might have to buy another one for my room because I really liked looking at the stars as I was falling asleep too :)  The battery lasts a pretty long time and it has a timer on it which is really nice. The only things that would make it better is if there was an ac adapter so it doesnt have to run on batteries and if it rotated.  Other than that we love it!	
- 1	We tried these when my todder started to be able to pull out simpler socket protectors. First, they wouldn't go into all the sockets. Sometimes they'd work on one socket in a pair, but not the other, so I don't htink that was user error or some problem with the fixture. Second, my 2 year old was able to figure out the mechanism and strong enough to pull them out within 20 minutes.	
1. 	These blocks are perfect. We actually purchased them to do a maternity photo shoot & will also use them when the baby is born for to play with. Them seem to be great quality.  The yellow, orange, green, & blue letters are embossed. There are symbols & animals. And they're made in the US!  I'm happy so far!P.S. Baby is 5 months old now & she loves them!! She loves to pick up the blocks in her hands & just hold them.	
- 1	This product is so flimsy with the 2 piece extension that my husband is joking that it wouldn't keep a gerbil in. Really regretting purchase and will have to get something else as I don't even want to put my child in this. Only reason it gets 2 stars is that it was fairly easy to put together. Panels shake, gate drags on ground. Would not recommend!	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to clean, my daughter loves them. We have used the Dr. Brown bottles before, which worked very well (however, I got tired of cleaning them). I feel bad using the plastic liners, but especially when we are travelling, they come in so handy and I do not have to worry if I washed the bottle well enough.	
- 1	It is near impossible to suck liquid from the straws. I could barely get anything out and my son definitely couldn't. The parts are near impossible to clean as well. The only positive thing I have to say is no they don't leak but that doesn't matter if you can't drink from it. Don't waste your time with these.	
- 1	The combi cup is very cute and baby has no problem using it. I used it to feed my baby water, milk, and juice. All is well initially. After a while, black mold started growing in the straw and soft plastic parts. It's disgusting. To wash it thoroughly I need to use Q-tip and the tiny brush from Dr. Brown's bottle. I do not recommend this cup to busy moms.	
1. 	My daughter used to refuse the bottle, even with my breastmilk in it. My mother, who has been working in a nursery for 30 years, suggested the problem could be the material the nipple was made of and the slow flow. These nipples work with Medela bottles once screwed and they flow nicely for my 4-month-old daughter. She now takes the bottle when I am not around!	
1. 	At first I didn't like this step as it wasn't tall enough for my then 2 year old son to get to the toilet seat on his own. At nearly 3 years old, he can get up-and-down from the toilet seat on his own, but he's still not even close to reaching the faucets on the sink. However, after several near miss falls on a small, sliding two-step Rubbermaid ladder, I realized that the BabyBjorn one is a safe choice. And I like the way that it looks too and the fact that ours was made in Sweden (I believe it's now made in the USA).	
- 1	Okay, I bought it thinking it's easy to take temperature readings, especially for infants. My baby was sick and we measured temperature using this at multiple times during the course of 1-2 days and it never showed above 98-99 degrees (i.e. normal body temperature for babies). The following day baby was really sick and we took her to a hospital nearby and baby had really high fever (over 102). Even on that day this thermometer showed around 98-99. The doctor and nurse there said the readings on these things (scanners) are never accurate. They recommended the in-ear thermometer and ended up getting one from CVSBraun Thermoscan Ear Thermometer with ExacTemp Technology, IRT4520USSM. It was a pain to take readings using those in the beginning but now the baby is much more accommodating and so far we've found them reliable.Reading other reviews here shows that this deviation can be either way, higher or lower. Skip this one and get one which is accurate (aka with better reviews).Avoid this at all costs!!	
1. 	We absolutely love this crib! It's small enough that we can fit it in our bedroom but large enough he has room to grow. At eight months and twenty one pounds that is really important to us!	
- 1	We got each of our toddlers one of these for Christmas. One turtle and one ladybug.  One of the colors on the turtle went out the 2nd night and we returned it and got a replacement.  It's been working ok so far.  But then last night, 2 of the colors on the ladybug stopped working.  We haven't even had it 60 days!!  I wrote the company and they said the LED lights should last up to 3,000 hours...but they don't and you can't replace them.  I can understand one bad egg but two?  I'm sad because my kids love those and they are so cute...but they're turning out to be a total waste of money...	
1. 	I bought these with high hopes of using them with my son. I honestly never remembered I had them on the shelf and hardly used them. My friends love them and got a lot of use out of them.	
1. 	At first my 7 month old could not initiate the vibrating on her own. However after only a day or two she figured it out and seems to enjoy it but still seems to prefer Sophie over anything else. Actually her favorite thing to chew on (she's just now getting her first tooth) is my little coach wallet- I guess she likes the leather or something but she is quite obsessed with it! This massaging teether does keep her busy in the car seat though.	
- 1	We got it and it was so cheap.  I ended up just throwing it away.  Don't bother.  Waste of money	
- 1	I was pretty disappointed when we got this - the padding is fairly thin and for some reason, the back was not on straight. It's hard to describe, but pretty much, the back was slanted (in a front to back direction), even though the chair otherwise felt solid. The slant of the back, however, meant that the padding did not cover certain parts correctly, so there was just fabric over wood.  My husband and I kind of puzzled over it for a bit to see if we could remedy the back, but we returned it. The green is brighter than you would expect based on the picture, but just more of a spring green, not quite neon (as described by another reviewer).	
- 1	Ok its not the worse idea ever, but seriously be careful with your luggage as it may damage it.  I followed the directions carefully and placed it on a high quality Samsonite suitcase with telescopic handle.  We have a Britax Marathon child car seat.  The weight of the chair combined with the weight of the full suitcase, plus the weight of the child (27 lbs) resulted in completely damaged suitcase.  The telescopic handle was bent to such a degree that it would not go back into the suitcase.  This happened at the beginning of a 5 week trip across Europe.  As you can imagine this resulted in a huge problem as we were unable to return the handle to its inside the bag position as we boarded planes, trains, cars, etc.  Keep in mind that we had a high quality, sturdy luggage too.  I think most regular or cheapy luggages would have broken the handle completely off.  Dont bother with this.  I suggest you buy yourself a wheelie carrier for your car seat and then push you child this way instead of trying to do an all-in-one seat/child/luggage combo.	
- 1	My twins were too big for this once they were able to use it- we returned it. I've seen it work for some infants, just not ours.	
- 1	So while I loved these spoons the first time I used them (after hand-washing them out of the package), once I used them to feed my little one and then cleaned them in the dishwasher, they warped. I thought that it was because I had put the two spoons I used in the utensil rack of my dishwasher (on the bottom shelf), until I used the other two new spoons and put those on the top rack, because they also warped. And not a little, but a LOT. The spoon part (where the food rests) melted, and the handles became twisted and bent. So disappointed because these really worked great otherwise. I am debating whether I should get another set and just hand-wash them, but then I'll have to be vigilant about it (as will my husband) and with a little one, it's hard to remember small details like that.I am also annoyed that it doesn't say on the package that these are hand wash (and no, I don't have a super duty dishwasher, or a heat sterilizing one - in fact, it pretty much doesn't clean my dishes at all - just dries them after I wash them in the sink and put them in there). I would call it a dishdryer instead of a dishwasher at this point. :)	
- 1	Like several other customers/reviewers, I have also received multipurpose scissors instead of the baby nail scissors.  Although Amazon customer service is excellent, this item is only fulfilled by them so they cannot send a replacement - you would have to go through the hassle of returning the item and then hoping they send you the right thing the 2nd time.  Beware!	
- 1	I thought this was a neat idea until my little guy started manipulating it and collapsed it into the figure 8 and pinched his fingers--hard!  Not using it with my youngest.	
1. 	These come in a set of 2.  I ordered because I was sick of washing the duo that I had and wanted a spare set, works perfectly, no problems!	
- 1	We use the GroVia Hybrid diapering system and love it!  I have almost nothing poor to say about Grovia...except maybe about these bags.  They are the only GroVia item I have not been perfectly happy with.  I'm not even sure what it was about them that they just didn't live up to what I was expecting.  They were very small and I wasn't sure I would trust the draw string to dirty diapers.  I have ended up with Plant Wise bags instead.  A couple different small sizes for the diaper bag and two large ones with elastic for the diaper bins.  --  I still love GroVia just not this product.	
1. 	had these for my daughter when she was born and they were the best baby item we received. still same high quality 2 years later. washed very well. true to size.	
1. 	We went through several brands of bibs before settling on the Bumkins brand  These are far and away the best. Where we had issues with the others of developing some pretty bad stink, these ones are super easy to wash and clean and take a ton of wear and tear, coming out victorious.  Bib 1 - toddler 0.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and it worked well for my baby's first 4 weeks or so, but once he hit a certain weight (maybe 10 lbs.) the thing stopped swinging even on the highest level. Now we have to push it manually, which is stupid. The bar in the middle also falls down and won't stay in place. My son really likes watching the things swing and those flowers were some of the first objects he focused on, but the bar topples on him easily. It's soft so it doesn't hurt or anything, but again it is poorly designed. I wouldn't waste your money on this glider at all!	
- 1	Way too big for a baby just starting to use a cup or a toddler. Disappointed because exactly what I was l	
- 1	Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it.Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.	
1. 	I have to clean mine about once a week with using it for both of my boys. I really love this chair and we take it with us everywhere. It doesn't fit tables that have a leaf stored underneath it, which has been inconvenient.	
- 1	This stroller toy is just awful.  I wish I had read reviews before buying.  If I hadn't already trimmed off the many large and obtrusive tags (on every little part of this toy) I would be returning this.The clamps are a joke and never stay in place.  The weird ratcheting angle system constantly falls & nearly fell onto my baby's face.  If you even attempt to pull on a toy, the whole thing topples.My daughter & I both enjoyed the little music from the lion, but it only lasts a few seconds each time.  I ended up getting the Baby Einstein World music album & a new stroller toy...  Much more satisfying!Go with one of the Tiny Love stroller items.  We just received the Tiny Love Take Along Mobile and it is Super!  We (the baby, my hubs & I) like it so much the TL Musical Nature Stroller Bar is on order.	
1. 	This product is genius and it doubles as a teether.  Our baby frequently flips it around and naws on the handle.  We use fresh organic pear and frozen organic strawberries, blueberries & raspberries (the cold is great on the gums).  It is challenging to clean and would just say mush up your bananas and feed with a spoon - this doesn't work well with bananas.  Pear comes through the mesh very easily along with the berries.  Our little one loves this and it's a treat for her.  This is a must have for all new mamas and a very cheap purchase.*Baby may initially reject because of mesh but express some food out and they will love.*Great for teething babies.*Great transition from super pureed foods but before lumpy foods (this makes the food have some texture).*Can be difficult to clean but just buy a baby tooth brush to get into all the nooks.*Buy it, it's wonderful!	
1. 	These have been our favorite cups for quite some time as they are valve free. They don't drip or spill and do not gather debris and mold in the tops. We throw them in the dishwasher everyday and the graphics stay for a long time.	
1. 	I really love this product. it was perfect for my changer topper and most covers fit that I bought for it. one thing is though the picture looks like the changing cover vynil is alwyas flush against its surface but actually it is not. The pastic vinyl is loose and hovers above the surface. No big deal since the cover does the same thing.	
- 1	the zippers on this suck. Seriously they can't afford some YKK zippers on these suckers? I got the Halo fleece sleep sack instead	
- 1	The kneeler is not very sturdy.  I was not comfortable kneeling on it, and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion.  If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning, I'm not impressed.  I might as well kneel on a folded towel.  I was hoping for something that would be soft.  Also, the construction of the item is not very sturdy.  It is made of plastic, and it does not seem at all durable.  The elbow &quot;cushion&quot; is also not very soft.  It is not secure, either.  When I leaned against it to test it, it slid right off.  If I'd been busy bathing my baby, I would have tumbled into the tub with him.  I don't recommend this product.	
- 1	horrible product -- condensation runs down lid, through hinge holes, into bottom compartment with exposed electric heating element.  eventually stopped working and rusty water poured out the power jack!  opened it up and it was all rusted/corroded.  the company claims this is impossible, well, reports of it are all over the web.  returning for refund, lucky it didn't burn our house down!we switched to just using a glass bowl of water sitting on this, works great:Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer	
1. 	I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!	
- 1	What a waste of money. I am so bummed that I threw away the box & can no longer return it even though I only used it once. Seems great in theory but does not work at all! Soap did not dispense and I swear after using the brush it actually GAVE my baby flakes on her scalp! This is totally going in the trash	
1. 	I have no complaints about this bag at all. I use the small, front zippered compartment as my purse (and it does have coin compartment, credit card slots, etc.), I love the little clip on the outside... I use that for spare pacifiers for quick access. Avent bottles and Playtex sippy cups fit well in the side pockets. (The bottles have to go on the mesh side, though... that side's slightly larger.) The bag is stain resistant and has stayed clean over the past year.	
- 1	This play yard mattress cover is a joke. It makes the mattress of my safety first pack n play and graco wayy to small to use. even with the mattress velcro-ed to the bottom it will pull in so there are 3 inches of gaps on either end of the mattress. I followed the care instructions to the T. I can't imagine this working on anything other than a mini play yard or co-sleeper.I'm so disapointed b/c the print is just adorable and the quality seems high.	
- 1	I knew better and I couldn't help myself. I could just look at the picture and tell that this was a goose egg on the forehead waiting to happen. Before I had the baby I even remember seeing one in the store and thinking how dangerous it looked.  I blame first-time mommy brain.  I bought this in addition to the large activity bouncer to add variety.  My son (6 months when I bought this, now 10 months old) loves his activity bouncer.  He could happily bounce away the day.  He jumps so hard that I thought he might enjoy the freedom of being able to move around a bit more.  The problem is that the Johnny Jump Up is so wide around the seat that he either has to lean forward or backward.  It has to do with the angle of the leg holes and how his weight sits in the seat sling.  The child in the photo is upright, but to get my very normal sized child to be upright (even when he had great head, leg, and body control) I had to stuff all kinds of towels around him.  I could live with this except that when he jumps the thing swings around and bangs into the door frame.  This caused my child to pinch his arms and fingers between himself and the door.  He also swung his head into the door frame.  He's fine, but it's no fun to have to hover over him and make sure that he doesn't actually jump in a toy called Johnny Jump Up. I tried putting pillows between him and the door frame but that's a lot of trouble for something that essentially does what an activity bouncer does but not as well. The spring was also so tight that it had very little up and down bounce so it was mostly a swing.  Finally, after it hung in the door for a couple of months and blocked my path, I took it down for good.  My parent's house has a very large opening between the living and dining room so there's no chance of bouncing into the door frame or any nearby furniture.  I'm going to try it there. Here's hoping it earns the one star that I had to give it.If you can, I recommend getting an activity bouncer.  They take up space and cost more but they really are great at entertaining a kid.	
- 1	We had a Foscam at first and maybe it spoiled me with its resolution but this camera's night vision is a joke. I can see that my baby is IN his crib but that is about it, it's so blurry and flickery.	
1. 	This protector does the job on preventing dents in leather seats.Remember that these days any type of professional is afraid of a lawsuit, and do not want to use any type of aftermarket product that could interfere with their professional installation. That is why no one will approve these mats, or even cupholders on strollers anymore!!!As a carseat safety fanatic, and being pretty educated on carseat installations I felt confident that I could make a decision if this was inhibiting a proper installation. I see no problems. To be sure the carseat is strapped in super tight, I sit in it as I pull the straps. It doesn't budge one centimeter left or right, or front to back.This saver was easy to put in the car, and did not need to be adjusted a million times as I tightened in the carseat using LATCH & tether (we use the Britax Marathon). A previous saver bunched and made installation impossible, but this one is very thin, firm and stays put. The add on back was the perfect height, and did not block the tether strap in our F150. It also stayed upright as I put the carseat into place.This blends in nicely with our black seats and looks good. It's available in three colors - black, tan, and grey. Let's face it - if you're interested in this product it's because you care how things will look long term!This saver is a great combo of safety and function. While it may not perform perfectly with every single carseat/car combination - if your seat is moving more than an inch in any direction it's not installed correctly whether you are using seat saver or not!	
- 1	I thought I would see for myself on this one, shouldn't have wasted my time. Spend the extra money and get a better one.  It was constructed of cheap materials, the seams were not complete in 2 places and the sun shade was not centered. I returned for a refund and ordered one from one step ahead instead.	
- 1	This was such as waste of money.  I should have just invested in an electric pump.  First of all the suction is horrible and I have to continually fix it as I am pumping.  Also the piece will fall off if you pump too fast.  Secondly, it takes forever to pump so it is not convenient.  You need to have an oversupply for this to be an effective pump.My main complaint is the suction.  It is weak and makes pumping ineffective.  I get more milk by hand expressing.	
- 1	Poorly made and it does not hold heavy objects.  I returned this right away.  Don't even bother wasting your money.	
1. 	The deluxe booster seat (DBS) is a lot more compact that its big brother, the space saver high chair (SSHC), and I actually prefer it. I removed one star because the tray is a little difficult to get on and off. I have also found that the add-ons to the tray are pretty useless (they are the only difference b/w the deluxe and non-deluxe versions), so you can save a few dollars by going with the non-deluxe version. What follows is a comparison between the DBS and the SSHC.Features of the SSHC:ReclinesRemovable Padded Cloth CoverRemovable Upper Straps for a 5-Point HarnessRemovable Seat BackFull-sized Tray with One-handed RemovalThe seat in the SSHC is rounded to allow for the chair to recline. When in the upright position it seems to make my children slouch because of it. The reclining feature, the cover, and the upper straps were used for a very brief period of time (only about a  month). If you need your child to be reclined when first feeding them, I would recommend putting them in a bouncy seat or in their car seat instead so that you don't have problems with slouching later on. The seat is also very deep, and has a large pommel. The pommel prevents my three-year-old child from being able to easily climb into and out of the chair. The deepness of the chair means that my child sits low relative to the tray, making it difficult for him to feed himself (especially when he was younger). The back is very high on this chair and makes it difficult for him to tip back enough to drink from a sippy cup, and even though it is removable, I hesitate to remove it because of the way the chair makes my child sit he usually leans back and so uses the back for support.The SSHC tray is huge. And while it advertises a one-handed removal, you almost always have to use two hands. The size of the tray makes it difficult to wash (while dishwasher safe, it's so big it's not going to fit in your dishwasher so plan on washing by hand), and it won't balance in our dish drain, so we almost always end up toweling it off immediately. To attach the tray to the seat there are two long &#34;arms&#34; on either side of the seat. These arms make the booster seat very wide (even without the tray), and prevent the chair from being able to be pushed up to the table for an older child's use as just a booster.Features of the DBS:Compact and Fold-able for easy transportThree-Point HarnessAdjustable Seat HeightAdjustable Snap-on Tray with Inset and CoverThe seat in the DBS is right angled, more shallow and narrow, has a small pommel, and a much lower back. My child sits much more comfortably in this chair, and the tray is at a great height for him to be able to easily feed himself. The DBS tray is much smaller, yet still has plenty of room for my child's food and drink. It is much easier to wash. Its only downside is that it is not as easy to put on and remove as the SSHC tray. The DBS chair can be pushed up to the table, and it is height adjustable, so I can put my child at the right height for the table.Basically, all the extra features in the SSHC seem like they are a great idea so you can transition from feeding a four-month-old to a four-year-old, but in reality, it makes the chair awkward and not good for any age. The tray is way too high for a self feeding child, and you can't pull the chair up to the table so it is useless as just a plain booster. The simplicity of the DBS helps it to be a better seat for any age. I have read some reviews that complain that the chair is too small and that their child outgrew it quickly. However, my children are on the lower end of the charts, and the DBS works well for both my one-year-old and my three-year-old.	
1. 	I love this. It folds up very well into itself into a carrier pack, has convenient pocket for extra items (I toss a book, my phone and keys in), looks good, is a great size and adds just enough cushion while providing a waterproof area to sit on. I keep it in our car and have found opportunities to use it I otherwise would not have noticed w/o having a blanket to use. I often grab it for little walks to the park with my 18 month old (I wear her in my Ergobaby carrier & am 8 months pregnant - so obviously it is an easy size to manage!) to sit on - plenty big enough for us to both hang out on and keeps us both dry (it seems to rain overnight here often). I wish I had purchased it sooner!	
- 1	Don't plan on your kids actually being able to scoot around this on their own.  This also tipped over once.  We used it as just the play station without the seat	
1. 	Must have. It has space for bottles (standard neck), a pouch for my phone, space to throw in pacifiers and what nots.	
1. 	We're expecting a baby boy this October, and I've been looking for a nightlight for him - then I stumbled upon this Lady Bug nightlight and ordered it on a whim based on the reviews and the fact that I loved having colorful dim lights in my room as child.The lady bug arrived about 2 months ago, and my husband and I have claimed it as our own! We love falling asleep cuddled up and dozing off to the starry bedroom ceiling every night, and will be getting one of the turtles for our little boy so he gets the same enjoyment.Definitely a good, relaxing buy, no matter your age!	
- 1	We used these on our 10 pound infant and tried them for about a week. The double leg gussets did their job - no issues with leg leakage. However, our daughter is a tummy sleeper and we OFTEN had tummy leaks, even during short naps. The solution for us was to switch to the Bumgenius 4.0 diapers. They have a layer of PUL waterproof material on both the outside AND inside near the tummy - rather than the outside only. With the Rumparooz that lack of waterproofing on the inside against the tummy meant constant leakage. I love the rumparooz sizing, appearance, and colors - but the design just didn't work for our family.	
1. 	Our daughter was extremely fussy and gassy for the first two months. When the screaming started I would put her in the swing and within minutes she would relax and go to sleep. At times the swing (and baby Bjorn) was the only thing we could do to console her. She of course grew out of her fussy stage but she still loves being in her swing and we still use it everyday.She is now 4 months old and really gets a kick out of the spinning mobile and mirror above her. She will smile and coo at herself in this swing for hours if we let her. We now only do the swing for 5-10 minutes at a time since it's time for other activities but when she's fussy she wants the swing.I am thoroughly impressed with this swing and would pay $500 if necessary to have one. The swing itself is very sturdy and the seat itself seems to hug daughter where the other swings almost sit to upright causing their heads to wobble. This comes with a toy bar but we've never actually used it since our daughter is so fascinated with the mobile and mirror. There are different music and nature sound selections that automatically turn off after 7 minutes. This is a turn-off for some but I like it since it saves battery juice! This does swing side-to-side and front-to-back but we've never even used the front-to-back since she's so content with side-to-side.There isn't anything I don't like about this swing. The only thing I recommend is purchasing the rechargeable D batteries. We replace batteries probably every 5 days or so...Thank you FP for making such a fantastic swing!!!	
- 1	Please Please PLEASE do not use this aspirator without a back up!  It works great fresh out of the box, but six months after purchasing it I have laid it to rest in the garbage can.  It has multiple design flaws, the largest of which is that it requires fresh batteries every 2-3 days for frequent use.  And if your baby is congested, you need to use it frequently!  Thank heavens I ordered theBabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue)and it's arriving later today...since this one died 7 hours ago, and my poor baby is so congested he can't drink his bottle without throwing up!  :(	
1. 	Our youngest daughter, Essie, is 17 months old and is still postively mesmerized by the lights and pictures swirling on the ceiling. At bedtime she grabs her snuggle blanky, lays back and drifts off to sleep watching the birds go round and round. When she wakes in the morning or occasionally in the night we'll hear her turn the music and lights back on. It keeps her occuppied for a nice long stretch every morning which gives the whole family a bit more rest. It does take 4 D batteries and we go through them but I think it is worth it. The music is soothing, the birds are sweet, it has different settings for sound levels and Essie can work all of these features so it is truly baby friendly. We have been using it since she was born and I don't forsee it being retired for years to come.	
1. 	I am a 1st time mom and have conquered breastfeeding all thanks to the shield. My baby had completely rubbed the skin off my nipples and breastfeeding was painful. I have started using the shield and thankfully, am now healing. We use the shield with each feeding. Now I don't feel any pain during feedings. This has helped so much.	
1. 	While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies (my little guy HAS to have it vibrate), this was a life saver for me when both my kids (one 4 years and one 6 months) were/are teething. And for my youngest, it's just about the only thing that works.	
- 1	I really didn't care for these. They were soothing at first, but once they warmed up to your body temperature they didn't really seem to do much of anything.  Wish I had saved my money.	
1. 	This was a gift for my now 13 week old son. He is just starting to grasp objects and loves the raised bumps on the teether-handles. The Square toys holds a cat ball inside and is a huge hit as well. He loves watching the ball turn as I rotate the toy. There are different fabics on the sides of the toys to stimulate infants (satin, felt, ribbed, mirror, ect)I love that the objects are extra large, so they are easy to grab and play with. Furthermore, there is plenty of the clear plastic top for him to be able to see the objects inside. (Some toys only allow a small hole and if difficult for that young age to see inside.) I was thrilled that someone gave this to us for it is defintely a Keeper!	
- 1	This was a waste of money, but mostly because I  bought this because I love strawberries. It's a great nursery decor item, but really nothing more.	
1. 	Stays on, easy to clean and quick to dry.  Will buy another.  Great gift as well.Fun prints to choose from.	
- 1	I'm pretty sure I have a standard-sized doorknob, and this thing did NOT work well. It was impossible to lock & unlock the door with this thing on it.It seemed too big for my doorknob. We had to remove it.	
1. 	For our review, we choose the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. This is a wonderful choice for babies and even older children. He is an adorable little plush turtle with a hard shell. Kids can play with him by day, and at night he turns into something truly amazing. A night light that not only keeps all the scary monsters away, but turns your child's bedroom into a whole new world. The back of the turtle's shell has a star and moon pattern and when the light are out, that pattern is reflected on the wall or ceiling. You can choose between white, green and blue stars. My  toddler was amazed by it, and even my older kids loved it.***I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review on my blog, New Age Mama***	
1. 	Classic toy that my daughter plays with all the time.  When she was younger she loved to knock down the stacks of cups we would build for her.  Now that she is older (15 months) she loves to nest the cups inside one another.  They are great in her water table as well and I'm sure will be just as fun in sand.  The 2 smallest cups are pretty small and will most likely get lost under furniture, but such is life with a toddler.	
1. 	On second week of use and love it. I did not want a huge pail or genie that held a month's worth of dirty diapers. This holds about 4 days worth, and is sealed tightly enough that I do not smell anything when it is full. The little lid has a compartment for a deodorizer. I use the nursery Arm and Hammer ones and I think it gives it enough weight to shut tightly so no odor escapes. I use medium trash bags (8 gallon) and they fit perfectly. For the price and size, you cannot beat this. If odor ever becomes a problem I plan on throwing a scented fabric softer sheet on the bottom of the pail. So far, a great purchase.	
1. 	I bought this for my 5 year old son. He was always afraid of the dark, and would always need the hall light on in order to go to sleep. As soon as he got this, he allowed me to turn the hall light off and slept with this on every night for about 2 months, and now he will go to bed with no lights at all. I also like that this goes off after a certain amount of time as to not waste the batteries.	
1. 	This is my favorite bouncer.  My daughter was mesmerized by it from the very beginning.  At 3 months she still stares at the fish swimming about.  The vibration feature is great to relax and lull your little one to sleep.  The only negative thing I can comment on is the motor is a little loud, but not enough for me not to love the product.  I especially love the variety of music and nature sounds.  The Ocean Wonders line is truly wonderful!	
1. 	These do just what they're supposed to: they fully close the Dr Browns bottles to be air tight. They're great for when I use the larger Dr Browns bottles for milk storage in the fridge. I also plan to use them to keep bottles fully closed when traveling. I'd highly recommend them.	
1. 	Better by far than the wire ones that rust and break!  bristles are soft.  wish the nipple brush worked better; couldn't they put some bristles on that end?	
- 1	I have only been using this diaper pail for 7 weeks, and I hate it. I have two boys in diapers - one about to turn 2, the other 7 weeks old. The pail is so tiny, I have to change the bag daily. When it gets more than half full, the top won't close, letting out all the poop odors. Because the second inner door flap goes inwards, it prevents you from being able to fill a bag completely because it runs into the diapers. This also causes that inner door flap to get a little gross. The pail is insanely expensive, as are the refills. I have started using my own bags, but they are a pain to put in and take out. I really expected more and am very disappointed! I'm glad this was a gift - I won't feel TOO bad when I toss it!	
- 1	I always felt like the &#34;bad mom&#34; for only having an audio baby monitor (yes, I'm being a bit dramatic) and I did see a lot of benefit in having a video system.  So my husband hooked up a basic security camera to connect to the computers and voila!His redneck system is superior to this.  For despite the attractive camera and handheld monitor this is less than decent and drowning in its perk of dual-system viewing.  So I can watch Baby on the monitor and/or my phone.  I'd trade in one or the other for better quality.I was excited to get this all set up. I tore open the box, plugged in the parts, and went to the Google store to download... an app that was rated with 2 stars.  Hmm.  I began to panic, then thought &#34;people can be harsh critics.&#34;  I continued with set-up.  Connecting to the internet took forever and the connection, perfectly fine on all other household devices, was shaky at best.Okay, so the viewing app wasn't all it's cracked up to be with its bad imaging and whatnot.  What about the monitor it came with?  Surely that will work.  No, I wasn't impressed.  Horrible imaging and there always seemed to be a delay.I was happy sticking with the sound only.  Video-wise, no matter the device, I found myself frustrated and fiddling much too hard with the system.It's an attractive-looking system and the internet plus monitor option seems handy, but do you really need both?  Here, the idea fails.	
1. 	These bibs are awesome. They're super-easy to clean and put on a child. They serve their purpose well when you get to the stage that a toddler is trying to feed themselves, this keeps all their food from falling on their lap or floor like it typically does. A pack of two is perfect because I can have one in the diswasher from the prior meal and have the spare one ready for the next meal. The only complaint I would have on these is how long they hang down because if you're feeding a child in a booster seat with a tray on it, the poketed part at the bottom hangs low enough that it touches the tray and gets in the way a little....still, it is manageable and better than any other bibs I've tried. I began using these around 8 months and my daughter is now 18 months and still leaves them on to eat each meal without it bothering her.	
- 1	Good while it worked! My baby really liked the sounds and the night light was great for midnight feedings. I only had it for three weeks when it stop working. I changed batteries thinking that was the problem but the next day it stop working again. It didn't play music and light would not turn off. I am really disappointed. Buyer beware!	
- 1	First of all it's not a 3 stage seat because the seat actually provides no &#34;boost&#34; if you are using it as such.  The seat part is exactly flush with the bottom of the base so I can't even understand why this is a &#34;best seller&#34;.  The blue circular part with the toys is cumbersome doesn't really glide easily in a circle and there is a small section of the tray you can remove but every time I have tried I swear at it and get frustrated because it does not come off easy.  So I just tuck his little arms inside so I can pull the whole circular play tray over his head.  Also, the one time I did manage to slide the tray off and put it back on I narrowly missed pinching my little guys fingers.  I would just get a bumbo or a different type of high chair all together.	
1. 	Bought this for my son. So far he hasn't used it much, but thats because he is still quite young. But I am sure once he is a bit older he will love it. Only issue I have is the mat isn't as big as I thought it would be. But besides that its colorful, pretty interactive and I can see getting a lot of use out of it.	
- 1	Bought these as a cheaper alternative, but I am disappointed. They are very rough, not absorbent at all, and the edges unravel after the first wash. And yes, I did not use any fabric softener in the dryer, so that's not why they were completely water repellent. Good thing though: I contacted the company on their website, asking if there were any special instructions before first use. All they told me is I shouldn't use any fabric softener sheets. And they send me a brand new package for free. They were still water repellent but after 5 or so washes the absorbency actually improves quiet a bit. It's just a hassle. I'd rather spent more money on the OsoCozy organic unbleached flannel wipes. They cost much more but are better quality and work right away.	
- 1	I have owned this set for about 6 months when today my 11 month old son was chewing on the coolin droolin teether in the set and it was leaking the fliud in his mouth! This is supposed to be made to be chewed on! I'm not sure how toxic the water in it is, but its still shouldn't leak. No matter what is in there I don't want my son drinking it! I have contacted Sassy so hopefully they will do something about it! Very dissappointed!*Update: I contacted Sassy, and after apologizing, they assured me that it was only distilled water inside and that they don't use anything harmful in their products. They replaced it free of charge. I am happy with the way they handled it, but I wish it would've never happend. It wasn't worth the worry, and trouble. Unfortunately I cannnot change my star rating but it would only go up to 2 stars.	
1. 	I have been using this guard for about 3 weeks now, and it does exactly what it is suppose to do. My son is tall, and was reaching up for pans, and is now unable to get to them. I am very pleased with this product.	
1. 	This bib is fantastic. The only down size is the neck is large, the rest is pretty good! I will be ordering a few more  now that my kiddo has started to feed himself more.	
1. 	I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle.	
1. 	It did got very messy, but we put old towel under our baby, any put the baby oil next to us, and clean his little hands and feet right after it was done. Suggestion: print the baby's feet and hands in different days, try feet first, it's easier.	
1. 	My niece loved these pads. She used them all the time and they are comfortable and don't show through your clothes. Because you wash and reuse them they are even better. If it had been me I'd have wanted 2 packs but this was a first baby and you learn!	
1. 	Excellent and colourful and makes bath time fun.	
1. 	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.	
1. 	I ended up loving this little booster seat even more than I thought I would. I use it instead of a full size high chair.The tray has adjustments as to how far back against the baby it can go. When he first started using it, I put the tray the whole way back. At 9 months old, he is at the next notch. By the time it would be too tight against him, he would be using it without the tray, jut as a booster at the table, so the amount of notches for adjustments is perfect.You can raise and lower the seat in the base as well. So far, I have kept it at the highest height and that has worked perfect for sitting it on a chair as a booster - at the highest height, I am still able to slide the whole seat with the tray on it, under the table while it is on the chair. Of course this will vary depending on your own table and chair heights.I love that I can just move this around so easily from room to room. He can use it to sit and watch tv in the living room or just sit in like a big boy chair. I can sit it on the kitchen counter while I cook or clean and have him right there. There are rubber pads on the bottom of the base, so it won't slide around. I can sit it on  top of the table to feed him while I sit on the dining chair, or bring it in the living room and set it on the floor and it is still high enough to be comfortable to feed him while I sit on the floor.At first I bought this thinking that it would just be a temporary or once in a while item that I would use. But now, I can definitely see using it instead of a full size high chair for as long as he fits in it. I would think it would fit him up until the time he would be sitting on a regular dining chair on his own. It has so much more potential for use than a full size high chair, since you can move it around to pretty much anywhere.It is a decent size. Not too big and not too small. It doesn't take up much space at all. Storing it away is as simple as sitting it on a dining chair and pushing the chair under the table as usual.It is easy to clean - no fabric to worry about. Trays can go right in the dishwasher if you want.It is sturdy enough. I am not concerned that anything will crack or break.The color scheme is very neutral and nice looking.Price is definitely good and I feel like it is such a great value since it is such a versatile item. Definitely one of the best baby products I have chosen and I am so glad I bought it.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews about this thing and took to heart the complaints of mildew, etc. Considering I live in the south, I was very hesitant to get this item. But decided I'd try it anyway. I'm very glad I did.Let it be known I use this mostly in the stuffiest bathroom in the house (its easier to warm for bathing an infant) and I have a BAD tendency to get distracted after the bath and come back hours later with a still soaked bather to pull out of the tub and hang somewhere to air dry. I have had this thing months now. I've never had to toss it in the wash, it still smells like new. I wash my baby every other day. I'm lazy and hang the thing in the shower itself to dry. I have had not one problem with it and I love it!	
- 1	Was sent in the wrong color. Was an orange background with green eggs and ham print on it, but not as cute as the green one pictured. It also stated lead safe vs. lead free. When I checked the bumkins website, the current bibs for sale say lead free which makes me think this is an older model and that it may not be to the most updated safety standards despite and another reviewer stating that the lead safe were the newer ones.	
1. 	If you want to avoid having your little one sit on a dirty toilet, this product is great. I haven't had any issues with it so far. My son just starting using the toilet, and this has been great for us. I do worry about his skin getting pinched as I am putting him on the toilet, though. I just try to be careful when placing him on it. He doesn't use the handles either, so they haven't been good or bad for us.	
1. 	We purchased this a couple of weeks after our daughter was born.  We have the nice Medela plug in breast pump - however, it's a pain to travel with and it's pretty bulky.The avent has been great to travel with and really helps if I am ever engorged and just need to pump a little.It is also great because it's not loud, seems to pump effeciently, and also is easy to clean.A must have for any nursing mom!	
1. 	They are good. But i like Especially for baby sacks better only bcoz they smell nicer but Sassy are not bad at all. I am just being a little picky.	
- 1	I've heard a lot of good things about this pillow.  I wanted this inflatable travel version bc of it's portability.  It took longer than I expected to inflate, and then had a hole in it!  Wasn't able to properly test it out bc of the hole and I returned it.  In the meantime, I also purchased a regular version (not from Amazon).  It's very stable and solid, and so far, I really like it.	
- 1	Mommy's Helper Car Seat price went up the day after it went into the queue. It still seemed like a good idea, until only one arrived for full price.  I should contact them to fix the problem.	
- 1	I recommend using a syringe to dispense your baby's medication into a nipple, with or without a bottle attached (if not using a bottle, use the nipple with a nipple base so the baby does not risk choking on the nipple). Be sure to hold the nipple tip-down (e.g. rest it tip-down in the bottle cap) so the medication pools in the nipple and does not get dispersed on the sides of the bottle.	
1. 	This product is a great idea, but this was buyer error on our part.  Our eating area was rather small so a high chair would have been a space taker, this product fit the bill EXCEPT we have a lip under the table all the way around and it was useless because by the time our son was ready to sit up and eat his little thighs were too big to squeeze under there (and he wasn't a 'big' baby).  My parents were able to use it with GREAT success for my nephew, so the product itself is wonderful - just MAKE SURE there's no lip!!!	
- 1	Should have read all the reviews before i ordered this OXO brush.Cleaning a bottle also means you are gonna take a soap shower :)The bristles are very soft and pulling the brush out of the bottle, is really a mess.But: It does clean the bottles very nice though. LOL.The nipple-cleaner = useless. This plastic nub is not cleaning anything. I ended up, not using it at all, after 2 tries.Poor execution OXO.I really like the color thought - I ordered the green. The brush-holder works pretty good as well. It's sturdy enough and is not falling over with the brush sitting in it. At least something positive with this brush.My opinion: Waste of money. My 1-Dollar-Brush gets the same job done and it actually has a nipple-brush which works. LOL.	
- 1	This could be useful for the right space. We were constantly opening it up to go in and out, which was cumbersome without a door. I think newer models have a door, which would be much better. You also need a very large space to fit the full size play yard, and it overwhelmed our living room. The other way to use it is open straight as a barricade to protect stairs, electronics, etc. but it isn't very sturdy that way (and the company doesn't recommend it). Good idea but not what we were looking for.	
- 1	I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom, but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up.  It drives me crazy!  I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me, but the latch just doesn't keep.	
- 1	The opening on this is too narrow to accommodate iPhone/iPod/MacBook adapters.  If the cover were taller, it wouldn't be an issue because the whole adapter could fit inside, but it's not.  It's just too short, even for the smallest of the Apple adapters.  So I had to return this anyway, but if I'd kept it, I would only have wanted to use it for a power strip that I never need to add/remove plugs on -- the tabs to open the cover are a serious pain...and ironically would be easier to open if my hands were smaller.	
- 1	Sponge fell apart after 1 week's of use. Nipple brush rough and not dense, thus hard to thoroughly clean a nipple.  I would not buy this product again.	
- 1	Might work well but at the time I ordered this, the description did not have the max width of the door ( 1-3/8&#34; )... Check first before you buy!	
1. 	I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.  I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.  I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.  It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.  Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.  If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.	
- 1	I got this to go in my Mia Moda stroller, and it would not stay in place. It kept sliding down the straps.	
- 1	Like another reviewer, I felt elated when I saw this high chair, thinking it was going to surpass all others with its EZ Clean styling. Then I got the chair and put my 8-month old (50th percentile for weight/height) in it. I couldn't believe how little room there was on the bottom of the seat! The divider that comes up through the crotch is huge and only provides a mere 3 1/4 of depth from the back of the seat to the opening provided for the strap.  Even if you extend the crotch strap farther, looping it through the opening at the front/back (depending on your perspective) of the divider as opposed to the cut-out, you only get 4 1/2 of depth.Compare these measurements to the Graco Contempo high chair (which just happens to be the chair I am trying to replace because of the difficulty of cleaning the straps) where you get 4 1/2 of depth with the cut-out for the strap and an additional 2, making 6 1/2 total, if you loop the crotch strap through the opening at the divider.I don't know what Fisher Price was thinking when it designed the seat for this chair, but once again, I am extremely annoyed with the company's lack of foresight. Yet another great concept; poor execution. I felt the same kind of frustration with their space-saving high chair that is replete with impossible to clean crevices.Perhaps FP believes that all parents make buying decisions based solely on price, so it purposely doesn't spend a few extra bucks to get a product right in order to keep the price of the product relatively low. I'm sure there are many parents out there like me who would gladly pay another $10 for this high chair if it meant we got the perfect high chair or at least something close. You could have had a real winner here, Fisher Price, but once again, you blew it. I'm returning my chair to Amazon.	
1. 	I LOVE these Under the Nile fruits and veggies. They are so very adorable and soft. I love that they are made of organic cotton, so they are safe for my daughter to chew on. I can't wait to purchase more for her & will be purchasing the entire fruit tote as a baby shower gift! We chose the banana because we thought it would be easiest for her to grasp at 5 months. The dog got some mud on it and so we just spot washed it and it came out looking just fine. I'm not sure if they can be thrown in the washer. We opted not to since we thought it would take forever for the inside to dry.	
- 1	This looks like a cuddly lovey in the pic, they say it's a blankie, but it's really closer to a dog toy.  The entire thing is made out of noisy crinkly cellophane, so snuggling with it just startles the baby again and again.  It's much smaller than something like this should be, and the center is a big squeaky button like a dog toy.  The feet for chewing are made out of a very hard PVC like plastic rather than the softer silicon plastics you usually see on these things.  Have seen better versions of this idea.	
1. 	many plus' to the diaper champ; can use regular trash bags, does not give off an odor, at least not yet and we have been using it for 2 months, and its sturdy. We can go a whole week without emptying it, so far with a 2 mo old, which i find pretty impressive myself. Really its a good product, promise!	
1. 	This infant carrier is great. I was able to start using it as soon as my baby was born because he weighed over 8 pounds. It is very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I mastered getting the baby in and out both awake and asleep after a couple of days which is great because he falls asleep in it almost every time. I am able to carry him comfortably for as much as 2 hours and he weighs over 12 pounds (I'm only 5'2.) He does get very warm in it, so I only use it for short periods of time when it is hot. I like that I can go into small shops or the park without taking a bulky infant car seat. It is great for when I have to shop alone, because I don't have to worry about putting his infant car seat into a shopping cart, which gives me extra room for purchases. It is also great for keeping others from touching your baby when you don't want them to. It is very durable and washes well, which comes in handy for spit up and diaper leaks. Even though it is a bit pricey, I feel I will get my money's worth because I plan on using it for more than one child and I know it will last long enough to do so.	
- 1	we bought it and used it once. what a waste of money! the middle part is too flat and my baby was uncomfortable with the bulky sides.	
- 1	This is the only stroller I've ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to.  That being said...I bought this in Miro to go with the Chicco Keyfit 30 Carseat.  I did a lot of research before picking this stroller, and now I wish I had done more.CONS:-Wheels have a mind of their own.  Very hard to steer, even with both hands.  Forget using just one hand.  The wheels, even when you're trying to push forward, don't always face that way.  I run into EVERYTHING in stores, and I'm constantly running over my husband's feet.-Sunshade doesn't cover well unless the back is in the most forward position.  Also doesn't attach well, as it's constantly falling out of position.  If you pull it down too hard, it causes the backrest of the stroller to lurch upright, pulling the baby with it.- Basket is way too high.  Can't use the basket unless the back is completely upright.- Awkward handles make it feel like I can't get a good grip on the stroller.- The backrest is flimsy.  It's easy enough to adjust it one handed.  However, just slightly bumping it from behind causes it to lurch upright (again) pulling the baby with it.PROS:-The Chicco Keyfit carseat snaps into it.- Unfortunately, that's about it!	
1. 	Bought it for her for Christmas and she loves it! Stares at it and smiles like crazy!  If she's grumpy I just show her this and she lights right up! Perfect for her little hands.	
1. 	I like this brush as it doesn't spray water all over me when I take it out after scrubbing my Medela bottles, which I found was an issue with other brushes I tried and the small opening of the bottles.  The bristles are very soft though and you sometimes have to scrub quite hard to get the last of the breast milk grease out of there, especially if the bottles haven't been soaked long before cleaning.  However I would rather put a bit of effort into scrubbing than get a face full of dish water at 3am which is why I am giving it four stars.  Another thing I don't like too much about this brush is that it doesn't come with a separate nipple brush, the end of the brush is shaped to be able to scrub inside the nipple but when I am cleaning my pump it just doesn't work and I end up using the nipple brush from another bottle brush I own as that can actually get into some of the smaller parts of the pump.  We have been using the brush for over two months now and it has stood up to some pretty heavy use.	
- 1	I would recommend in the strongest possible way no one ever buy this product. The other reviews of this product are all too kind and they say so in their descriptions. All of them point out that the product does not work smoothly or seem to do anything magically different, they also seem to give 3+ stars without comparing the product to anything else. I have compared the product to something else...a regular trash can...and the regular trash can was better. And the regular trash can didn't even have a lid on it. A family friend also purchased this thing and has the exact same complaints. Namely that the lid gets stuck, that you have to hunch over and shove the diapers into the pail, and that you have to buy replacement bags every month or few weeks. In the end this thing is a waste of money and is simply worse than a regular old trash can. Detailed descriptions below...The Munchkin:1) There are major issues with the lid. The lid is supposed to keep out odors while sprinkling a tiny (really tiny) amount of baking soda as you close it and initiating a mechanical twist of the bag to further seal off the odors. However, the lid is constantly fighting with the mechanics that twist the bag creating, starting when then bag gets about half full, a series of sounds reminiscent of small arms fire. Crack...crack crack...crack...  You will live in constant fear of a late night gun battle playing out in the child's room leading to a screaming sleepy cranky baby. Closing the lid twists the top part of the bag in a ring of rubber shark-like teeth thereby closing off the bag as well. However, the lid will often simply get stuck open because these rubber teeth put too much pressure on the mechanics of the lid. This forces you to stick your hand into the pail itself and move the bag around to relieve the pressure so the lid will close. Think about it...you have to stick your hand into the very closure intended to keep odors out. Very often you have to decide between fixing the lid or picking up a now grumpy baby.2) The rubber teeth are a pain. Often the rubber teeth create to much counter pressure to the closing of the lid and the entire process comes to a plastic cracking halt. Even if the lid works correctly you still have to shove the diaper through the rubber teeth. You can not just drop a diaper in, instead you have to jam it through the teeth. Every time you change a diaper you have to bend down and shove your hand through a set of rubber teeth two feet off the floor. And two feet off the floor is correct. This thing barely comes up to my kneecaps. Think about it...even when working 100% correctly you have to bend over two feet and jam your fist partially through a set of rubber teeth. How is that better than dropping a diaper into a bucket?3) What's the deal with the bags? I mean..for serious? A bag lasts you maybe 4 days at a max and more like 48 hours. Munchkin wants you to fork out whatever bucks a month for replacement bags? I think this is the entire reason for the mechanical twisting of the bags and not to keep in smells. The tops of the bags have plastic ring you set into the top of the pail and which then snaps into place. The replacement bags are only 5-10 bucks a box but it seems like a real scam. I have tried two things. A) I wondered what would happen if I re-used one of the Munchkin bags. Nothing bad happened at all. I dumped the diapers into the outside trash and put the bag back. No smells, no nastiness, nothing bad happened at all. I used the same bag for two weeks rather than two days. After two weeks of us there were still no smells. B) I then decided to try a regular trash bag. It worked fine. You just have to leave a bit of the bag sticking out beyond the lid to make sure the rubber teeth don't pull the thing completely into the pail when you close the lid.4) The baking soda does nothing. A novel idea sure. But, like the twisting of the bags, it seems like a gimmick. The level of baking soda dropped into the bag when you close the lid is minor and the baking soda compartment is totally closed off. I do not see how either is doing much to absorb odors.Alternatives:The only alternative I have used is an old plastic trash can with an open bag in it and no lid. I dropped diapers in it for 5 days without emptying it. No smells whatsoever. Half the time it was nice out and we had the windows open. The other half of the time it was 90 degrees and the air conditioning was on. In both cases it worked out fine. No smells.Conclusions:Do not buy this munchkin monstrosity. Every time you use it you will wonder if the lid will close or start making cracking noises as it struggles to twist the bag. Buy a trashcan with a lid. Maybe one with a step lid. And if your kid makes a smelly one. Empty the trash can. Why would you want to keep that stuff inside a nursery anyway? The munchkin is a gimmicky thing and not worth it at all. It seems like a great idea but in actuality the thing does not work!

The customer service was excellent.Edited To Add 5/2/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The last of the screws fell out. So the bottom side of the tray that separates the baby's legs is completely off.Edited To Add 5/1/2010: SAFETY WARNING!  Unbelievable.  Another screw fell out on the bottom side of the tray.  This is the third screw to fall out.  Fortunately, I saw it fall before the baby had a chance to swallow it.  I contacted Peg Perego on 4/28/2010 after the second screw fell out and demanded a refund.  To their credit, they said they would give us a refund once we show proof of purchase so we now have to find the receipt.  Also, they did add that they've never had this issue before on the Tatamia (which is relatively a new line) or on any of their Peg Perego high chairs.  I am wondering whether the screw mechanism on the bottom side of the tray are the same for all Peg Perego high chairs. I am wondering whether it is a design defect or a manufacturing defect.  Something is wrong.  Even IF my baby (from when he was 8 months - 12 months) was playing with it, it is a problem because a baby should NOT be able to unscrew sharp screws from the high chair so easily.Edited To Add on 4/28/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The screws underneath the tray falls out.  About a month ago, I was lifting our son out of the Tatamia chair when I saw a screw on my son's lap (almost an inch long with a sharp end).  I realized that it fell off from the bottom of the tray where there are 3 screws.  It scared me because he is at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth.  I was relieved he didn't swallow it and it didn't puncture him.  I had my husband put the screw back in.  Today, my husband was lifting our son out of the chair when he saw another screw on his lap.  We're sure our son is not unscrewing the screw (he is only 11 months old and not dextrous enough. Even so, the design should be such that a child cannot unscrew the screws.) This is unacceptable.  A baby can die if he swallows these screws.  I am downgrading this from 2 stars to 1 star.  I am going to call Peg Perego tomorrow.My husband and I were initially excited to get the Tatamia.  We've been using it for the past 6 months now and we're less than thrilled.  There are several problems with the Tatamia.  (1) The top tray falls off very easily.  Several times, my baby (at 10 months old) managed to get the top tray off... so that left a real mess. I tried to click in the top tray but it won't click in.  It just rests on the bottom tray.  Since the baby always flips it over, I just use the bottom tray now.  (2) It is difficult to slide the tray in and out of the high chair.  With both your index fingers, you have to position the knob just right to slide it in and out but the right side keeps getting stuck.  (3) My baby first hated sitting in it.  He has now grown accustomed to it but it doesn't look very comfortable.  (4) The plastic device on the back of the seat to enable you to recline or sit-up doesn't work very well.  I thought maybe it was just me until my husband started complaining about the same problem.  (5) The high chair doesn't roll very well.  You can't move the chair sideways so you have to go backwards and then swivel and then go forward. As for the swinging feature, we used it once and it was a pain to get it into that position and back so we never used it since.	
- 1	I realize this isn't supposed to be a jogger, but it has been classified as &#34;all terrain&#34;. I took my baby on a gravel path, and he couldn't nap because it was such a rough ride of shaking, bumping and rattling. Why don't they make a stroller like this with an optional 12&#34; front wheels on front, just like they have on the back. Also, going over the smallest and slightest curb is not doable, the stroller literally will not go over. There was an area on the pavement that was about 3 inches taller that the area we were traveling on, I thought since it was such a small rise to get up it would be fine, WRONG. The wheels hit and all the pushing would not get it over and even 3 inch rise, so forget going up any curbs, which are at least 5-9 inches high!!! It even got stuck trying to go over a small branch laying over the path. I was really hoping for a bit better, but between the horrible bumpy and shaky ride on mere gravel and the total inability to get over even so much as something 2-3 inches tall, it gets one star What is the point of having 2 12&#34; wheels, but teeny, tiny front wheels? If all wheels were 12&#34;, this stroller would be near perfect. Also, the recile is very limited with 2 seats, most of the positions give you zero recline, or minimal recline.Pros:Smooth and nice ride on concrete or fully flat and smooth terrain.Stylish and nice look to it.A lot of different seat position options.Seat size is decent sized. My very LARGE almost 4 year old fits pretty well in the seat seeing as he is almost at the weight limit. At his 4 year check he was in the upper percentile for height and weight, 43 inches and 42lbs. While it was not the most spacious, it was good enough and not super cramped. Especially with leg room. In a Phil&Ted; Navigator we tried at the store, his legs just could not fit and the seat was very small and shallow for him and he just could not fit or ride in it, it wouldn't work. Bit this seat fits him a little better.It feels sturdy, like it will hold up well over time.ConsAWFUL on anything but smooth/flat terrain. Will be awful on even so much as gravel ad impossible to get over any bumps or curbs.Limited recline in most seat positions, as well as limited space for the child sitting behind the front seat.Mine had a defect, and for $650, you should not get something with a defect!Over priced for what you get, this company is making a KILLING.Very long and kind of a beast to steer. Also difficult to make turns and does not turn easily.When you have them in different seat positions, it takes up your basket space.Sun hoods could be a bit better. I wish the sun hoods were a bit better, they are okay, but could be better.All in all I liked it more than the Phil&Teds; Navigator, I just wish they made a few improvements. I am sending the defective thing back.

- 1	While the seller was great on this item- great service, and fast shipping, I ended up throwing these spoons away.  I know the label says BPA free, but there was DEFINITELY some nasty chemicals in this spoon or the packaging.  I washed them multiple times and the chemical smell never went away.  I couldn't help but think my baby was eating poison if I let her use these spoons, so I just threw them away.  A waste I know, but they were so yucky I saw no other option.  I don't recommend purchasing these.  I found some other white spoons, BPA free and made in the USA and those have been SO much better than these nasty things.	
- 1	From crazzeto's wife:I really wish I had read the amazon reviews before I bought this. This was our baby's first Christmas and we had intended to give cute keepsake ornaments of her tiny hand to her grandparents so we bought two of these packs. When I opened them, the first surprise was that they didn't come with modeling clay as I had anticipated but instead came with a lump of some sort of sticky, lightweight marshmallow foam. The second surprise was that the shaping tool was not a circular cookie-cutter but was really just a long, thin piece of flimsy plastic you were supposed to form into a circle on your own and use to shape your foam into a cicle. Unfortunately, it is absolutely impossible to shape it into a decent circle - it is literally impossible to do it. You'll end up with a lumpy, mishappen sort-of circle. Very disapointing. The biggest and worst surprise is that the marshmallow foam NEVER fully dries. Your keesake ornament will always be somewhat soft and forever at the mercy of anything that touches it because even the slightest touch will cause a dent or scratch. Hardly the sort of material you want to make an heirloom out of. Please, do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this. I am very upset that I missed out on the opportunity to commemorate my baby's first Christmas and I hope no one reading this has to go through that too.	
1. 	I'm pleased with this monitor.  I've had it for about 3 months and I haven't had any problems so far.Originally I had registered for a different monitor, but I had to make a change when I looked into the frequency of my wireless internet.  For those of you with wireless internet, apparently the 2.4 Ghz monitors can cause interference.  On the other hand though, I have had some interference with this monitor picking up some phone conversations in the neighborhood.  It doesn't happen very often, but when it does, I just change to the other channel and the problem goes away.The nice thing about the child unit is that it attaches to the crib-you just lock it onto the top bar and then unlock it when you need to take it off to recharge.  I find that I have no problem with the unit lasting through night (10-12 hours), but that I do need to recharge it during the day.The parent unit can easily clip onto your pants, or you can put it in your back or shirt pocket.  Kind of a nice feature when you're running around the house and you don't have time to put it down!The lights are nice too, although I like to have the volume on anyways so that I can monitor him better.  Nonetheless, it's a nice feature.Nice features, works well, and goes for a reasonable price.  I think this monitor is a pretty good bet!
