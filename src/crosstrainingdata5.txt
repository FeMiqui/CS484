- 1	I had high hopes for these little guys but no such luck. Easy packaging literally open and they are ready to go. I put one on my bathroom door and it worked to prevent it slamming on my son's fingers, but it left the gap at the other side of the door where the hinges are, where he eventually worked his way over and CRUNCH slammed them in there instead. :(I am sure these were designed for the one option on the door and they work for that, but they did not address the other side and for that I give it a 2 star.I have since removed them and found that my daughter uses them as elf ears for dress up. awesome.	
- 1	I bought these because I got an incredible price for them somewhere else. I really wish I hadn't bought them. My son kept getting nasty rashes after we switched to these. He was getting them from around the opening and also on his testicles. He also got a blister on the tip of his penis that we ended up taking him to the doctor for. The doctor had us use Vaseline on it and we took him out of cloth diapers for a few days. It cleared up and we put him back in cloth diapers with these liners and it came back so that's when we figured out it was the liners causing the problems for sure since we never had issues with our other liners. Do yourself a favor and avoid these. The only plus I can give them are they are very large and you do get a lot for your money, but what we spent in taking him to the doctor killed that savings anyhow.	
- 1	I bought this as a baby shower present for my cousin and once we got it my husband informed me that it did not come with all the pieces need to attach to the toilet right away. After reading about it before buying I had no idea. Not a great description. Ended up returning it so I can buy her a different one.	
- 1	DONT waste your money1- they are WAY too small for any nursing mom2- they are too stiff and won't sit right in any bra3- they are itchy, rough and uncomfortable4- they don't absorb more than a teaspoon before you need a changeI would give these pads a zero if I could!	
1. 	...and yet my lavender scented candles are all I smell. This is a simple, fast and effective way to dispose of the smelly's in your little one's pants. As long as you dispose of the sausage regularly, there shouldn't be a problem. (Especially afer you take them off the breast and start solids)	
- 1	Made in China & not dishwasher safe ?  No thanks...that won't be in my baby's mouth.  Right now we have few American-made choices but if everyone keeps buying crap made in China, we won't have a choice.  Returned !!!	
1. 	Quality made product. We only used this for two weeks to give our son a sponge bath after he was born.	
1. 	We got this as one of our shower gift. It is very nice and has everything you need. I like the hard case because it is durable. I really like the the finger nail clippers the best. We use the brush and comb a lot also. I think it is reasonably price and has everything you need.	
- 1	I was hoping to find a more economical alternative to disposables, but these pads didn't fit the bill.  They weren't absorbant or soft enough for me, and they didn't stay in place.  I'm sticking with my Lansinoh Ultra softs.	
- 1	Too long, does not fit our davinci porter crib. Hard to find the right size. I would not recommend it	
- 1	this was quite possibly the most flimsy thing i have bought to date. out of the pack i got spare parts: the eye on one of the smaller shades came right out when i picked it up. now i am left with two and i am constantly having to hold it down when my son (17 mths) is in the car because i am afraid that he will yank on the edges and make fragments of them as well.i somehow think they could've been made a little better.but once you hold it in place it does offer a little protection from the sun.note:the shade i received is not the one in this picture: mine just had one eye let each in the center along with rubber nipples to attach.	
1. 	these bottles were recommended by our pediatricianthey really do help lessen swallowed air and in turn baby gaswhich helps lessen spit up	
1. 	The negative comments on these gates have a few points I don't understand:Child tips it over.  I've sat on the edge of this thing when a 1-gate ring.  No problems.Child drags the gate all over.  Unless you mount it to a wall, any gate is going to be moveable.Gate has trouble folding.  Yep, it is hard to fold.  this is a GOOD THING in that you don't want your child folding it on his/herself.Gate cracks.  I have three of these.  No problems.  Really must be lemons for this to be an issue.We actually made one giant ring out of three of these and although we need to zigzag the longest wall so that it stands up without falling over (one long straight wall is not going to be sturdy without sideways support no matter what you build it out of), it is just right for our purposes.  The kid might not love it, but she now has a TON of space to play.Our child with a propensity for getting stuck in things has yet to get stuck in it (yay!) nor has she found a way out of it yet.  I love this thing.	
- 1	I bought these for the 8oz hexagonal glass bottles we have.  Unlike the silicone covers for the 4oz glass bottles, these barely have enough 'give' as you pull the 2 openings over the top of the bottles.  This results in a super taunt pulling around the mouth of the bottle.  Much like a rubber band stretched to its max.  This has resulted in one side of the opening of the silicone cases breaking already.  Anyway, I can still use it, but essentially, if the other side breaks, this becomes completely useless.  If they put just a bit more silicone when making the larger glass bottle covers to allow for a bit more give as you are pulling it over the opening, then this is totally great!	
- 1	I bought this bouncer and was totally disappointed. I will first say that the look of the bouncer is cute and the cover is sooo  easy to remove for washing. The toy bar is cute and the toys are just fine.  you can add your own if you like because there is a Velcro loop that toys attach to.  I don't know how strong they hold up because I wasn't actually able to use this bouncer.  The model I bought only had vibrate no music. When I put it together I thought something must be wrong.  The angle  of this thing was pratically dumping the baby out. I took it apart 3 times a rechecked everything, because it definitely was not the angle the picture on the box was proposing and from other reviews i had read they said the baby lays back good. Well not with mine. I had to hold my baby with one hand so he didn't slide out of the bouncer and try to snap the waist restraint with my free hand. Now i may be blonde , but I am very capable of putting a frame together and do have experience with baby products as i run a home day care and this bouncer was purchased for my second child. If the bouncer would have had a more laid back angle I would have kept it and for the money not a bad product, but the one i purchased I must say was dangerous. If this is the way they are being produced now i would not recommend for safety reasons. My husband also felt the same way he commented on the angle of it and said he didn't want our child in that because i looked like he would fall out.	
1. 	Good sponge, compared to the 5$ one we got. Much more fluffy. But takes a while to dry. We bathe every night and hang it in the tub in between to dry - which it does! Getting small/short for my 4mo old tho...	
1. 	This is really useful and simple to use. Just the right size / hight for little ones to do their business on their own. Really easy to clean. Would recommend it over the ones that go over the regular size toilet seats.. because those are too high.. and the kids would need a steps..	
- 1	The suction cups are garbage and it won't stay on. My 1 year old can also pull it down easily. Good idea but bad execution of the product. Don't buy it.	
1. 	This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!	
- 1	This product contains BPA.  Given that this product is a TEETHER toy, I do not know what Fisher Price is thinking or why it would continue to manufacture this item using BPA plastic.  I like the design, but I would never buy a teether product for my baby containing BPA.	
1. 	1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price. I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time.I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina. It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle. I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump.	
- 1	The size was not what I expected. The quality of the brand is uncontestable and I have many other products.	
- 1	I registered for this thinking I'd use it for nursing. Well, I've been nursing for almost a month now, and I've found this pillow to be a bigger nuisance than helper. Here's why:1. The way it's shaped allows the baby to slip down towards your belly button. Rather than being flat towards your stomach, it angles downwards, allowing the baby no support. I end up holding her anyway.2. It doesn't stay on! No matter where I'm sitting: couch, rocker, chair, etc., it falls off! How annoying.3. I'm tall. I have to slouch over.4. Because of problem #1, I use a blanket to stuff in between the pillow and my belly. What a complete waste!It really should be shaped the like the pillows used in hospitals: flat the whole way. Totally a better design.	
- 1	I bought this through AJ Wholesale on Amazon and when the package arrived it was ripped open like it was a return item.  I sterilized the nipples but thats gross.  Not only that but my newborn collapses the nipple so I have to pull it out of her mouth, re-inflate it and give it back to her multiple times during a feeding.  I paid over $12 for one 2 pack - overpriced.  I hate this purchase.	
- 1	ok so the only one it does not work with is BRITAX which is the car seat I own. so I buy the britax adapter and it does not work with this car seat adapter. it works with the other citi mini adapter only. if you own a britax car seat and need a converting double stroller like I do, this will not work for you.	
- 1	These shades were horrible.  The suction cups didn't work and they didn't really block out the sun.  I ended up buying Eddie Bauer sun shades - they are a peel on/peel off style that allows you to roll down the window and they work much better and were much cheaper!  Plus there is nothing that could become a projectile in the event of a car accident.	
1. 	saves headaches looking for pacifiers that seem to always get lostplus it is cute and doesn't tear clothing when it gets pulled off	
1. 	This is one of a few gates I currently have at my house.  I had a couple of Munchkin (The Auto Close) which are great but would require multiple extensions to fit this one doorway so I looked for another product and visually they are pretty close.  Installation is also very similar, the part that differs is that the Munchkin gates come with a wrench and that makes it A LOT easier to install.  And the bars on the Munchkin are also straight and not curved on the side like this Dreambaby gate.  That makes a huge difference as on this one you have to hand tight it and with a bar that curves towards your hands, it gets very tricky, especially at the bottom ones.  Once installed it works well.  Maybe if I ever get one more I'll use a rubber wrench to install it, I got mad at how my hand hurt after I installed this Dreambaby gate.	
1. 	what can i say...cute as a bug...price was great, they are very cute, perfect for my grandchild (bedroom decorated in ladybugs)	
1. 	Love this gate! When hubby bought it, I assumed we would be returning it and buying a better one. But was very surprised how well it works for our family. We have one installed to wall downstairs to separate rooms/at at times dogs locked in kitchen area. It is very solid even when partially locked, and the whole opening/closing/locking operation can be done easily/swiftly while holding baby and other items in your hand (I do it all day long). and then we have a loose one at top of stairs that we can hand carry to top/bottom of stairs (again I was sure we'd be returning and looking for something else). It is again strong - I can put my entire weight forceably against locked gate and it does not budge - and it can easily/quickly be installed with baby in arms, one handed.	
1. 	We love these bibs - they are all we use.  They are water proof and the pocket catches the drips, drops, and blobs that occur at every meal.  The various fun designs and washability are also a nice bonus.	
1. 	I wish they could get a more precise fit so they don't move around on the toilet, but otherwise, my 18MO stays out of the crapper... finally.	
- 1	Imse Vimse skimps on quality and has issues with training pants:*  Too thick for hot weather (don't need exterior cotton, or use thinner exterior cotton)*  Cheap, thin elastic is knotted/tied up along leg openings, so you feel a knot and pinching of thin, rubber band-like elastic (Imse should use comfortable sheer but wide spandex elastic instead of these rubber bands)*  Waist is too tight to easily pull down (even for my skinny toddler; so I removed elastic along the front of the waist)*  Waist is too high*  Rear needs to be wider (even for skinny toddlers)*  Shrinks in the wash, so I would order one size up	
- 1	We live in Manhattan apartment and we have a small stove so we try this product. This does not fit period.	
- 1	Bumkins has missed the boat on the choice for their covers, IMO.  They get wet REAL quick.  And I'm also just wondering... could you put maybe a few more snaps on this cover?? Damn, REALLY!?  It's a little absurd to think I need this many options.  Thirsties covers do it better with HALF the snaps.  Also the 'pocket' does nothing to hold an insert.	
1. 	Extend the life of your Avent's product.  They fit with all my Avent cups and bottles. Also, they help to my daughter to lear to drink independently.	
1. 	My son is now 8 months old (and ~19lbs) and still needs his swing most days for naptime (sometimes with the motion on and sometimes just with the mobile on) -- We have tried and tried to have him sleep in his crib with very minimal success.  Anyway, this swing has been wonderful for him.We did start off with the F-P Aquarium swing, but he seems to like this one better.  It is immensely easier to get your swing-napper in and out of the Papasan swing than the Aquarium one... which can be a critical factor if baby falls asleep in your arms (or while nursing) before you've managed to get them in the swing!  My son seems to also enjoy the Papasan mobile more than the Aquarium swing -- he hardly gave the fish much notice but loves to watch the moving leaves, bird, and bugs on the Papasan.I do want to mention that we've NEVER had a problem with the motor smoking or starting on fire... and in our house this swing is used a lot!!!  Plus, F-P has really, really good customer service for their swings -- when the bird on our Papasan mobile stopped moving for some reason they sent us out a whole new motor housing unit free of charge (so now... I always have a backup to keep this swing in action!).So, overall... I am extremely pleased with this swing.  Speeds and sounds are just fine and it doesn't seem to eat batteries the way others have.  While our Aquarium one still gets used by our son at daycare, I have to admit that were I to do it all over again... I would just buy the Papasan style.  It seems that he is more comfortable in the Papasan seat and still has room to grow (... while we sloooowly transition him to a crib).  ;)	
1. 	We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.	
1. 	We've had this mobile for about 2 weeks now...no battery changes needed and it is working just fine!  This mobile is calming & soothing.  We started with another mobile--the Tiny Love Musical Symphony.  However, it was really loud and honestly just kept my son awake since it was so stimulating!  When I put him in his crib, my hope is that he'll fall asleep and this First Years mobile does just that!The remote is also a great feature so I don't have to come into the room while he is about to fall asleep.And finally...I love that this can be used at night!  We tried the other mobile at night, but he really couldn't see it--even with a night light.  It just made noise.  This one has nice music (ok...it is not the best music ever, but he's a baby and it is calming enough) and the screen makes lovely light pictures for him to look at.So far...this mobile has been great!  And I highly recommend it.	
1. 	I am currently pregnant with my 5th child.  In all of my previous pregnancies, I have just stuffed pillows all around and made do.  My hips were always hurting and I didn't get great sleep at the end of the pregnancy.  I had seen these back n  belly pillows, but I just couldn't spend the money on it.  Finally with Baby #5, my husband said, just buy the pillow.  Boy am I glad I listened to him!  This pillow is so comfortable and supportive.  I have no pain or discomfort when I sleep and I am now in my 8th month of pregnancy.  If you are like me and debating spending the money on it, DO IT!  You will not regret it.  I only wish I would have bought this pillow with Baby #1!	
- 1	huge fan of all Philips products i thought i would give this a try, my son did not like it, he made such a silly face every time I would put it in his mouth, he would take it out almost immediately. not a good fit for us.	
- 1	We've had this chair for nine months, and it is still rocking. That being said, i'm not sure how much longer it will actually last. One of the snaps that holds the upholstery to the arm of the chair has become unattached (i'm not completely certain of how this happened since the snaps are screwed in to the wood), and the chair makes an unsettling creaking noise that gives me the impression that it might fall apart while i'm sitting in it. Neither my husband nor myself are particularly heavy people, so I chock this up to poor quality. I absolutely HATE the fact that the upholstery cannot be washed. My son spit up a lot due to reflux, and while most of the fluid was caught by a burp cloth/blanket/t-shirt/whatever else we could grab, some managed to find its way on to the chair. It is appalling that some of the reviewers say that it's a good chair for the price, with said price being $150+. I'm well aware of the fact that these gliders are not cheap, but 150 dollars is steep for a chair, let alone a chair of this quality. I would caution other potential buyers to remember that this is likely a chair that is going into a nursery. Once you're finished using it, you're probably going to sell it or throw it out. I would recommend getting a quality chair that you'll use elsewhere in your home at a later date, or a cheap chair that you can plan to throw out one it's served it's purpose.	
- 1	We played with this toy some. All the different noices and rattles, I guess, are supposed to be educational, I don't see much value in it from educational standpoint. OK, the inchworm parts make different sounds, but why? They all look the same other than the color variation which has nothing to do with the sounds. And the music is cute hence the two stars, but it is only one song and soon becomes boring. Impossible for a baby, even young toddler to turn it on. I eventually tought my son to whack it on the floor hard to turn the music on. Not too good solution. I do NOT recommend this toy, unless you get it given. It does some, but not worth the money to my opinion.	
1. 	my baby just loves this rocker. he started using it at about one month old, before that he was too small for it and didn't like it. i like that you can remove the toys and put something else instead or use the toy bar for stroller toys. i just wish the middle toy could be removed also.	
- 1	Could never get this to stick on the wall, very disapointing. Spent a good amount of money on it and was never able to use it.	
- 1	I thought this would be great to get my almost 3 year old to start using the potty. but after 1 day it woulnt shut up. and even thru the night it kept talking. No where in the directions does it say how to turn off . so finally i had to take batteries out. returned the item for a refund. how dissapointing.	
1. 	This Playtex Drop-Ins Nurser Holder is such a convenience. These bottles don't have to be scrubbed because they are dishwasher safe. You receive 3 bottles with the slow flow nipples, plus 5 drop in liners. The nipples actually imitate breast feeding and make it so easy for moms who want to bottle feed. The liners provide a fresh sterilized bottle and collapses as it is emptied. The disposable liners collapse to keep air from mixing with the milk and this reduces colic.	
- 1	I bought this seat based on many great reviews and I'm really surprised I never saw anyone mention this: the poor placement of the trigger that you depress in order to loosen the chest straps. My 2-year old quickly figured out that he could easily reach down, grab the trigger, and then just lean forward to completely loosen his straps, because the trigger is located high up on the seat and well within arm's reach for a toddler. Thank God we caught him doing it before we got into an accident...unfortunately, though there are products out there that can cover the chest buckle and keep a kid from unbuckling himself, there's no fix for this. The only thing we've found that works is that, after we get him strapped into the seat, we take the long tightening strap, and literally tuck it underneath the seat base so that it's super-tight. That way, even when he grabs the trigger, the weight of the seat keeps the strap taut, and he can't lean forward.Another negative is that the fabric of the seat cover isn't one continuous piece of fabric; there's a flap that hangs down from the top, and the sides are two flaps that tuck back behind the top flap. My son loves to pull the side flaps out to look for spare Cheerios, etc... so, I look back and the fabric of the seat is literally hanging off the sides, with the molded plastic underneath exposed.Finally, I didn't think about it when choosing this seat as I was a first-timer, but in hindsight I really wish it had cup holders or some sort of storage for kid stuff.I had such high expectations for this seat...now that we've purchased a second seat for our other car that doesn't have any of these issues (the Graco My Ride 65 LX), it really highlights my frustrations every time my kid is in the Britax. For such an expensive seat, the design leaves a lot to be desired.	
1. 	Installation for this product was really quite easy.  When I first opened the package, I was a little weary of all the parts, but it turns out there are really two categories of extra parts: spacers (for the thickness of the bowl) and two other pieces (one for a taller rim, one for a shorter rim).  It actually only took me about 30 seconds to install tightly so there isn't much play.I will probably order another one for another install.	
1. 	My son is 4-months old and the sleepsacks I had were all way too thick and warm for the summer. This cotton sleepsack is think, breathable and soft for him to wear in the summer to bed and for naps.	
- 1	We had this rocker upstairs and a bouncer downstairs.  My daughter much preferred the bouncer to the rocker (and the swing).  Now my daughter is 18 months and wants to sit in the rocker, but she also wants to climb on it, making it unsafe.  She has other chairs that she doesn't try this on.  One other thing that I preferred about the bouncer is that you could pull the toys and they played music.	
1. 	I debated btwn the small and large and ultimately decided on the small for my 1 year old son. He never showed much interest in riding it until he turned 2. He's on the tall side and now I wish I had bought the bigger one, although he doesn't seem to mind being on the small version. If he had actually started riding it at age 1, small would have been perfect.	
1. 	this swing saved me in the begining (and still sometimes now-six months later)! we loved it so much that we sent it to a family member in hawaii even though shipping cost as much as swing. it was well worth it, it's been a life saver for them too. if i could rate this swing higher than five stars i would!	
- 1	Our first one came and the light burnt our after 5 minutes of use. Amazon replaced it with this one, which has worked perfectly until now (almost 3 months). The sound and projector light still work but it will not rotate. Looking at other reviews its obvious this is a common flaw with this product. I'm giving it two stars because I really wanted a product that would fully work for a good length of time and did not get that.	
1. 	I had these with my 6 year old and I loved them.  I bought a different brand with the second kid and that brand sucked.  I had to get another one of these.  These are easy to clean, easy to open, they stay shut when you want them to, and they do the job.  I love using them to give the baby fruit or to put frozen fruit which helps with teething.	
1. 	I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his chair and uses it when we read books before bed time.	
- 1	This is the actual pillow but with zippers that can make it fold somehow. It is not really very convenient for traveling! Super bulky! If you are thinking of going on an airplane with this forget your carry on or your personal item. This is not convenient at all! I returned it and got the Breastfriend inflatable pillow instead and it works like a charm!	
1. 	I hate the Diaper Genie so I was excited to try this Diaper Champ out and I have to say I love it. I hear so many people complaining about the smell and I have to say they're nuts! (no offense)My son is now 5 1/2 months old and is nursing but also eats most solids including table foods when were out at a restaurant. His diapers have definately changed in odor but I have not noticed any odor coming from the Diaper Champ.Usually we change the bag about once a week, every garbage day so no dirty diapers are sitting in there for longer than a week. I also fold my diapers up into what my husband calls an egg so the diaper itself helps control any odor.I have not even noticed a bad odor when changing the bag or I would do it outside to keep the odor out of the baby's bedroom.So why so many people are noticing an odor problem with this product is beyond me. They've got to be doing something wrong.Oh and the unit does need to be cleaned...if you get a big blow out diaper like babies are known to do, and you get poop on the pail, it does need to be wiped off. A good wiping out with some antibacterial wipe, every week or two doesn't hurt either.	
1. 	Everything the other reviewers have said is true. What else can I add? This is a great toy. My two and a half year old daughter is not afraid of dark, but is just mesmerized by the stars. And, during the day, she carries the ladybug with her to play. It is true it needs to be placed in the middle of a room to have the full star map, but my daughter keeps it in her bed and does not mind about this. And she usually falls asleep before the stars fade (45 minutes). We also have the sound sheep, which is another very helpful and soothing aid to help the baby sleep. I believe the company that manufactures these toys knows its stuff.	
1. 	Fits perfect by size to my changing pad and also fits my nursery - its very nice green, little lighter then in a picture. Will order another one in beige.	
- 1	Our daughter spits up and drools a lot, so we bought this to save her sheets from nightly washing.Pros:- The fabric is very soft and absorbent while the backing keeps sheets safe.- Most things shrink a lot in our washer and dryer but this has come out just fine and without any shrinkage.- The sheet saver does keep the sheets clean as long as the baby doesn't travel too far down her crib.Cons:- The cover is a bit too small since our daughter travels in her sleep and he head doesn't stay in the same position.- The strings that hold the cover in place are too short and too thin.  It is very difficult to tie it on securely around the slats or our crib.- The strings have become a safety hazard when our baby isn't swaddled since she can reach out and grab them.	
1. 	Great bib with excellent coverage.  Love the pocket for catching what baby drops.  I hand wash in-between meals and let air dry, but I can also throw them in the washing machine--which I really like.	
1. 	We have this monitor for our 12 mo. old daughter.  At first we had a First Years monitor but the reception was terrible so we exchanged it for this Fisher Price model.  The reception on this one is crystal clear.  I like the light and vibration features- I can see if she's crying if I am in the shower by looking at the lights.  We have never had one problem with it.  We now have another First Years monitor for our 1 mo. old- it has a lot of static just like the previous one (we should have learned our lesson the first time)- we are going to return it for another Fisher Price monitor.Update: We bought this monitor again for our son- like the other, it is crystal clear.  This is the BEST monitor!	
1. 	This is a staple now in our nursery. Baby LOVED this... I put it on while I am nursing him, and by the time he is done, he is sooooo sleepy! I leave it on for the 45 minute timer, and he has been sleeping through the night ever since!	
1. 	My son (18 months) loves it; he rides him, feeds him (hahahaahahahahhaha) every day and plays and talk to him; it's adorable; recommend it 100 %	
1. 	My little munchkin wasn't much for food, but the baby safe feeder was a great way to get her to taste more foods.  I freeze baby food in BPA free trays, and then I can pop a cube in the feeder, and she'll suck on it.  Then when I try to feed her the real food, she's more receptive because she's familiar with the taste.  Great product!	
1. 	and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion. I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck, and that is only because of the gas issue. They are super easy to break down and clean. And yes, I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first. However, after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle, I haven't had the problems since.	
- 1	My personal feeling on nursing pillows is....they are a waste of money. I've tried three and I felt all of them were cumbersome. Of course, you won't know if you feel that way about nursing pillows unless you try for yourself and you may end up finding it to be a necessary component to your nursing success. My recommendation is to only try one...and the one I'd recommend that is a better option than this one is by Luna Lullaby (Bosom Baby). Out of the three I tried, that one was the most comfortable and took the least amount of time to get situated on me and then get the baby situated. I felt this one, the My Brest Friend, was uncomfortable with that piece going around your back and up against the chair you're in....AND it is made entirely of foam and has a VERY strong chemical smell to it...not something I was comfortable with my child laying against and breathing in the fumes. And even though nursing pillows were not something that worked for me, the Bosom Baby can be used for other purposes for years to come...and the My Brest Friend cannot due to it's construction. Just my opinion!	
1. 	Could it get any better?  I don't think so.  This is the best $10 I've spent so far.  We take this mobile everywhere!  It works in the car, either on the window or on the infant seat handle.  Also, I hang it in my pack-n-play since the mobile that came with it is so boring.  I have also used it on the window above the rocking chair for our son to look at during feedings!  I love this product & so does our son; he never seems to tire of staring at it and as he gets older different parts interest him.	
1. 	We got this for the upcoming arrival of our daughter.  But, the first time I used it was to clean the tub after my husband gave the dog a bath.  IT IS AWESOME!  It's very sturdy and has alot of padding.  I love the arm rest, it came loose a couple of times but a quick cleaning of the side of the tub and suction cups solved that.  I was worried when I read the other reviews of this product, but once I gave it a try I was hooked.  Our daughter and dog will never have a bath again without it.	
- 1	While the concept is great, the design of it is not.  I don't like that you have to leave some of the bars to the crib exposed in order for it to fit tightly around the crib.  I don't like the fact that my daughter who is barely just now  able to move, is able to move the bumper down and get her legs stuck in the bars.  They don't put ties throughout the bumper for supposedly safety reasons, but I think they are needed in order to keep the bumper in place better.  I've had the bumper for a week or less and will be returning it.  Save your money and get something else.	
1. 	My little niece loves this toy, i don't know if it is the shape, colors, or flexibility but she loves it. I would highly recommend this teether over some of the other comparable ones.	
- 1	Did not lull baby to sleep, even though he sleeps well in the car.  In fact, I think it makes him seasick because he threw up.  Wish I'd kept the box and receipt, I'd return it.	
1. 	I don't think every hospital gives away these things.  The hospital where I delivered only gave me a nasal aspirator in terms of these tools to take home.  So these gadgets did and still do help me, especially the nail clippers, files, and hair brush.  I disagree that baby's nails are that soft that you can peel off - that would mean that you would have to wait until it gets too long before you can peel it off - I don't want to risk my baby scratching himself with the long nails or getting a hang nail or so long that it actually near the nail off itself where it might tear too deep and bleed.  I do agree that the nail clipper could be a little smaller but it still works.  Great products!	
1. 	My daughters had cups like these when they were young and they were great for playing in the bath tub, wading pool and sandbox.  My 20 month granddaughter loves her set just as much and has gotten a lot of use out of them.	
- 1	I liked this just fine.  It didn't leak much at all, but you can't get replacement straws!!  My kids chewed up the straw and now it's useless and you can't get a replacement straw as far as I can find from Amazon or the SkipHop website.  Buyer beware.	
- 1	This gate does not work with the extra parts added.  We will use it without the extension still, but if you're looking for a wider area I would not recommend this at all.  My husband is very handy and couldn't even rig it to be remotely safe and not fall over.	
- 1	A lovely and well-made toy, yes, but not safe for babies who like to swing/rattle/shake things (which I assume is every baby). My baby liked it at first, was intrigued by the colors, but soon started to whip it around at which point it became essentially a weapon! The design--long and wooden--makes it especially dangerous. I can't believe they're marketing this as a baby rattle!	
- 1	These disks are not the right size for my diaper pail. There is a small place to insert deodorizers but this one justs falls out of place.	
- 1	I really liked this bottle at first, but after a few runs through the dishwasher and the sterilizing bag some serious problems have emerged. I think the low-quality materials warped a bit in the heat, because the parts have become very leaky. The fact that assembling the bottle requires pulling the nipple into the bottle rim *just* right doesn't help with that, especially considering the fact that it sometimes takes a few tries.Pros:- the formula wand is a unique feature, though I don't know how much it really helps- formula storage caps availableCons:- the large, clunky, oddly-shaped parts are a bit more of a hassle than the more straight-forward Avent brand.-leaky- poor quality plastic that warps easily (I once accidently sterilized one in a bag with no water and it completely melted and smoldered. No other brand I've used was harmed after making that mistake with them).-Ounce markings that twist diagonally around the bottle make measuring needlessly difficult- nipple sits atop a flat surface rather than a rounded dome like other bottles. Rounded shapes simulate how the baby latches on to a breast, so the bottle may be difficult for a breastfed baby to use-larger than other bottles so it's harder to bring as many in a diaper bag	
- 1	I loved these bottles for the first month I had my daughter.  I went and bought about 10 from Babies R Us, and after 2 weeks, 8 of the slow-flow nipples didn't work.  They get clogged very easily and forget putting them in the dishwasher- the holes seal shut.  I called Playtex about this and they agreed to send me 6 new nipples if I sent them back 8 (?).  Now I will have 8 bottles with 6 nipples, which will probably just end up clogging again.  The drop-in liner idea is great and does reduce air bubbles, but I can't afford to pay for new nipples every 2 weeks.	
- 1	It was okay.  Would have loud feedback everytime it got within proximity of a cell phone.  Could hear the tick of the second hand clock with this device so it was fairly sensitive.  The automatic sound activation was always kind of questionable.  However, one of the receivers suddenly stopped working at 11 months - there was no warning or anything to indicate that it had stopped working as all the indicator lights were still on.  The fact that it could stop working so suddenly is kind of disturbing, potentially dangerous.	
- 1	I thought I would love this bottle, but my baby and I both ended up not liking it much. The disc to help prevent leaking while shaking works, but then it's annoying if you are out and about because it's covered in milk and you can't just throw it in the diaper bag like you can with a lid for other bottles. Then, if your baby doesn't finish the bottle and you put the lid back on, it will leak unless you put the disc back in place. It also seemed to me that the measurements weren't very accurate on the side. Lastly, the flow of the nipple was always too fast or too slow for my baby. The nipple it came with became too slow for her, so I bought new nipples that were faster flow, but then she was drowning in milk and wouldn't eat.	
- 1	I purchased this toy for my 6 month old granddaughter to encourage her to continue crawling, however, the toy does not serve that purpose.  It does not catch a young child's attention and the &#34;noises&#34; it's supposed to make to draw attention are barely audible.Would not recommend it.	
1. 	If I had known I would've just used this instead of a high chair because this is all plastic and it's easy to clean. I used it since he could sit up and he's 28 months now and he's still using it.	
1. 	It has taken me a few tries to perfect the folding/unfolding in a way that I don't have to handle the underside that has just touched the public potty... but I think I've got it now, and am happy with this product.  It folds down nice and flat, so I can keep it in my diaper bag in a zip-lock for easy use in restrooms.  It's nice to have something for my little that fits his small bottom and that I know is clean!	
1. 	This is a cute diaper bag for dad that will not make him feel like he is carrying a diaper bag!	
1. 	My daughter naps on this mattress during the day.  Looks like she likes it.  Much better than the mattress we had before	
- 1	This mirror looks like a great concept. Large viewing surface, two securing straps (one vertical, one horizontal), wide base, adjustable angle...When I first installed it in my Subaru Forester, I thought to myself: That might be my best baby purchase so far!.Then, I started driving and discovered that the mirror itself (mounted to a ball joint) moves with each bump in the road, making it useless after a couple of minutes on the road as it doesn't reflect your LO anymore.There might be a way to fuse the mirror and ball joint together permanently (duct tape, super glue, play dough) but I can't try that until I have my final car seat (LO is still in portable car seat).Would have been a 5-star purchase if the ball joint didn't move by itself.	
1. 	I have the old model Diaper Genie and the fact that this one has one-handed operation is great - it's the ONLY issue I have with the old one.  A few comments on other reviews:1. Some people claim the refills are too expensive. We get them at WalMart for less than $5 each and each one has lasted more than a month, even with a 7-month-old who poops like it's an Olympic sport. $5 a month is worth it for the convience of not having to change it as much as you would with a garbage bag - which are probably about as expensive.2. Some people say it smells - I can't believe that.  Even with our baby eating solid foods and making hideously stinky poops, there is NO odor in our nursery.  Not even a little!!  I empty it every 7-10 days and there is never, ever an odor coming from it, even when I am sitting next to it playing on the floor with the baby.I love that it is easy to use, easy to empty and refill and that there is no smell at all. We don't use it for wet-only diapers and I would recommend it to everyone with an infant.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this food mill, having purchased it after reading many reviews of this and similar products.I remember a reviewer writing that the space between the grinding disk and the bottom of the plunger was too large when fully collapsed (you push one piece into the other to push food towards the grinding disks).  This is exactly correct.  I tried to puree a small portion (1/2 a pear) and nothing came out except juice!  All the fruit was stuck below the disks.  Since my goal in getting this was the be able to puree small portions on the go it was no good for me.  I returned it.I gave it two stars because it might work better if pureeing larger portions and the components themselves seem well made albeit poorly designed.	
- 1	I bought this set before my baby was born because of the great reviews and how cute it was. He's three months old now and I've had to replace most of the items in the set. The thermometer takes forever to take a reading (more than a minute, which is a long time to have it stuck in a sick baby's bottom), so I replaced that. The light on the nail clippers works when it feels like it... so, not often... and the little post that holds the lever onto the nail clippers has a lip rather than being solid, so the lever falls off if I'm not incredibly careful when getting the clippers out or putting them away... so that's been replaced, too. The hairbrush bristles are super soft, and does absolutely zero to help with cradle cap (my baby was mostly bald, and the bristles are so soft I can't imagine they would be useful on a baby that had a lot of hair, either, b/c I don't think they would actually get into the hair at all), so we've been using the brush the hospital gave us... ugly, but way more effective. Even the emery boards are sub-par; the ones that came with the replacement nail clippers do a much better job. The medicine droppers are fine, nothing to write home about, utility-wise, but nothing wrong with them and they are cute. And the nasal aspirator is also ok, if you like the bulb style (I don't... I use the nose frida, I learned with my first child that it's far more effective... and I've tried both on this baby, and still prefer the nose frida for getting snot out)... but that's not a lot of useful stuff, especially given that this set was more expensive than many of the others I looked at. Such a cute idea... but terrible as far as actually taking care of the baby.	
- 1	These burp cloths are very thick and soft, two layers of good terry cloth bound together by the print fabric trim. But unfortunately, the seams tore apart after one wash. So far, I've bought 4 products from Bebe au Lait - 2 packages of these burp cloths, one of theSimple by Bebe Au Lait Organic Burp Cloth Set 3-Pack, and theBebe au Lait Hooded Towel. Every single product had the seams tearing after one wash.Amazon's been great about refund/replacement, but still, what a hassle! If it happened once, or even twice, I might consider that a fluke. But all four products tore along the seams after the first wash. (One of the towels was torn out of the box.) In fact, Amazon.com sent me a replacement for the burp cloths, and that one tore, also.When it comes to sewing bindings onto terry cloth, this brand definitely has quality control problems. Other than the constant ripping, these are actually very nice - soft, thick, and the print fabrics are cute. My only other complaint would be that they are a little on the narrow side.* Edited to add: I recently bought another set of burp cloths from Bebe au Lait. There was a discount on a cute print, and I was wondering if maybe I just got a bad batch before. And guess what? One of the cloths ripped again in the first wash. This never happens to anything else I own, so I don't think there's a problem with my washer.So that's 5 terry cloth products I received so far from Bebe au Lait, and all 5 have ripped in the wash. It's downright comical.	
1. 	I bought this to use as a travel bath for my baby on quick trips. It is basically a thick large sponge that a newborn can lay on and an infant can sit on to bathe in a sink, tub, shower stall or on a countertop.Pour a cup of warm water on the sponge before placing your child on it. Also be sure to wring it out very well and allow to air dry after every use.This is an excellent alternative to an infant bath while travelling and is very portable. You could also place in an infant tub for extra cushioning.	
1. 	There are a few other ones less expensive, but spend the extra buck on this one because the built in spout/funnel in the lid makes all the difference in the world.We ordered one of these from Amazon for on the go. It was really convenient and large enough capacity to scale as the baby ate more and more in a feeding. It was so handy we picked up another one (from a different manufacturer) at a garage sale. We immediately noticed how this one from Munchkin was so much better designed. The other version had four compartments but no funnel spout in the lid so it was much more difficult to get all of the formula out. It was like one of those frustrating marble games where you need to get all of the marbles to stay put in the little holes. We ended up buying a second one from Munchkin. We'll probably use the other one for cheerios or other snacks or give it away.	
- 1	The bowl works good to catch dropped food but it doesn't stick to the tray very well.  My daughter can pull it right off with little to no effort.  If that is what you are looking for than I would pass.	
- 1	This product came to us in the &#34;lock&#34; position on the top and the lid would not come off, effectively being in the &#34;locked&#34; position.  But, even in this locked position the lid was able to completely rock back and forth and was not anywhere near what I would call &#34;sealed&#34; which would make the sterilization process not very effective and most likely lead to steam burns for the user--even if we COULD get the lid off to put stuff in it.  It was returned, and I did not ask for another in replacement.	
1. 	We love this seat, It is compact enough to take to restaurants or anywhere you may need it. Our daughter just loves sitting in it. The tray is really nice and the cover is a great option. I would definately reccommend this seat.	
- 1	I purchased this mobile for my little one thinking it would be a slam dunk.  Pretty colors, remote control, several classical tunes... well, it would be perfect if it worked.  It broke the same evening I put it together.  Though the music played, the mobile didn't go around as it was supposed to.  I contacted Tiny Love and they sent me replacement parts, but it still didn't work.  I ended up returning it to BRU.  Reading the other reviews I guess I was not the only one with the same problem.  I do give it one star because it is pretty... but that's about it!  :-)	
1. 	My son loves this swing now at 7 weeks old. He actually took his first two naps in it yesterday. I normally hold him almost all the time, but yesterday was in the upper 90s and I just needed to set him down for a while to cool off. He fell asleep.He loves how the swing goes from side to side, and about 2 weeks ago, he started noticing the mirror and mobile up above.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the swing is just a little too fast. We still have it on the lowest setting at 7 weeks old. He hated it at first, and I didn't like him being in it anyway since it was so fast.It's perfect now.	
1. 	Kinda loud...but my daughter didn't seem to mind.  Great deal if you can get it on sale and it's an older design.  FYI, it doesn't plug in.  But did save many nights.  A swing is a must have for most babies.	
1. 	I was looking for a bouncing ball that's a little bigger than this one for my 1 year old daughter, but this one caught my attention. I had not noticed the size in the description but after reading the reviews, realized that it was much smaller than what I was looking for. I loved the idea of the little head popping in and out with gravity so I got it for her. It is small but I don't think it's too small. It fits perfectly in a little one's hand who just learned to walk. My daughter loves to walk around holding it in her hand. She's only had it for a week (early Christmas present) and it's one of her favorite toys. She's fascinated with the little heads and just loves to hold it. It's very well made, cute and unique. I highly recommend it!	
1. 	I have not noticed any change in color as it is stated with liquids. But it is just like the old cups that my child loves.so that is ok!	
- 1	The mattress came inside a broken plastic wrap. Look dirty and very soft instead of extra form. I returned it the same day it arrived.	
1. 	This is pretty cool. I thought it would have music, because we received it as a gift, but it does not. Which turns out to be totally fine. It displays stars on the ceiling and lights up different images, if you choose. It's pretty neat and my baby seems to really like it and likes pushing the buttons. It's pretty bright so it's definitely a good night light to fall to sleep to.	
1. 	This edge and corner set is a great value. We started with just corners and found we missed a lot of other dangerous areas, including a knee-high tall toy chest with thick drawers. This set was perfect to secure the entire thing. It was easy to trim and apply. I prefer the gray to the chocolate for lighter woods. Its sort of a cement tan color. Its very dense foam, so if you press down pretty hard you still wont feel sharp edge. Good product.	
- 1	We had a regular spring mattress but it sagged in the middle. Since our baby loved sleeping on our foam mattress, I thought we'd get a foam core mattress for her crib.  We didn't expect the vinyl cover to be so hard.  For a bed that was so hard, it still sagged in the middle where we needed to put a piece of plywood under the mattress to keep her from rolling face down into the middle. It's a chore to get her to sleep in her own crib, no matter how many crib covers we put on it. We've had to resort to getting a foam overlay which seems to make her a little happier.  Even I thought this bed is too plastic with no give. I wouldn't recommend this mattress to a friend.  For our next crib for our second child, we're not making the same mistake again.	
1. 	I have used these bottles for about a year, and am getting ready to wean.  I used them for the first 5 months for storing frozen milk (I wasnt rotating them), then when I went back to work, I rotated in the frozen milk and started using the bottles with the rack to store milk in the fridge.  Like most others have said, this is certainly more cost effective than bags.  My daughter wasnt ever a big drinker, so I would use from 2 to 3 and a half a day, so stored about 3 or 4 days of pumped milk (with BF for the morning, noon and night feedings [daycare was next to work]).This also worked with my medela PIS advanced pump without any problems.  I didnt find cleaning the separate caps an issue, though Im not sure why they designed them this way to begin with.The one thing they could improve on would be to make it from the same material as the medela bottles.  I think they are both polypropelene, but for some reason, the fat on the medela would come off a lot easier than on these bottles.  Maybe because these have some texture to them?  Anyway, the reason why this is a shortcoming is that, because these are stored horizontally, there's a much larger surface area on the top of the milk than if they were stored vertically (which wouldnt work in the rack system, of course).  Because all the good fat rises to the top, then it takes a while of sitting on the counter and swirlling the milk to get this fat to off the sides.  It can take something like 20 minutes or so to get all the fat off the sides, versus with medela bottles where it may only take a couple minutes.I would definitely buy this, but recommend to the product managers to make this out of the other material.	
1. 	My toddler gets so messy that it was a revelation when I discovered bibs with sleeves.  This bib is awesome.  You just wipe it down to clean it, it has a big pocket, and best of all- those sleeves really keep his whole shirt clean.	
- 1	I wouldn't know if this product works or not because it doesn't fit the bottles I have bought from the same company, i.e. Philips AVENT Natural Glass Bottles. Make sure you have the right bottle before you buy this.	
- 1	UPDATE 10/19/13 changed from 5 to 2 starsAs of yesterday, one side of the pumps topped working. II was using it regularly when I first go it for about a week or so, then stopped to try to regulate my supply because I had an oversupply. 2 days ago I started to pump again and it was working just as fine as the day I got it. (Was expecting it to because I only used it a few times) and Out of nowhere yesterday one side just didn't get suction anymore. No matter how high the setting. I don't understand how it can work perfect one day and then just die out.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)This pump is amazing!  I was pumping to up my supply and had been previously using the evenflo single electric breast pump and I loved that one.  It was my first pump after all,  and being a first time mom on a budget I bought it.  It was loud and took a while to get the job done,  but  beats a manual any day. So after it broke when my son was barely 3 months old,  I went searching for a new pump and found this.Now back to this pump,  this thing is AMAZING!  I don't know why it got got bad reviews. Maybe because I only been using it for a day. I'd update it of it breaks or I have issues.  So far so good.  No problems.  It was easy to put together.  At first I thought the tubing process would be complicated so I was nervous.  (the evenflo pump I was using did not have any tubing)  but my goodness there is a BIG difference.Pros=1.  Soft rubber like material.  (evenflo had hard plastic that was hard hard to adjust over breast)2. It comes with a bag to put your pump in.3. Its COMFORTABLE4. The different suction strength is AMAZING5. Its NOT painful,  on level one (or whatever it's called)  it feels like when a baby has fallen asleep on your breast and is sucking in their sleep6. I got more milk in less time then I did with evenflo7. It's quiet.  (compared to my evenflo)  .8. I it came with storage bags (but I don't know how to use them9. It came with clear instructions with pictures that matchCons=1. It took me a while to take out of packaging.  I had to cut things and was afraid I might damage the pump doing2. The bag it comes with is SMALL.  It looks big in the picture but it is actually like a tiny purse.3. It makes an annoying ticking sound when pumping.  It doesn't bother me (yet)  but may get on someone's nerves so I thought I'd warn you.4. It didn't give instructions  on how to use the storage bags	
- 1	Ive owned several hand pumps and this was my second electric pump. I had the old Lansinoh pump which was the same as Ameda Purely yours. So when I accidently dropped it and broke it I read all the reviews and decided to buy a Lansinoh pump again. I figured if they changed it, it must be improved ...... wrong. I like that its a closed system, that was a requirement for me, a top priority. It also did work for awhile so that got it a second star. But it is LOUD. REALLY LOUD. Like you cant have a conversation its so loud. Im pumping right now with my new Ameda and I can barely hear it. This Lansinoh Affinity worked for me, pumping exclusively for my daughter, for about 9 months. I started thinking I was having supply issues because I was having really bad days where I just couldnt pump what I normally do. Finally it occured to me that it may be the pump. I called Lansinoh and they suggested ordering new valves. I did that and nothing changed. Because I didnt save the receipt (the time we bought this was crazy, she had RSV, etc) there was no option but to trash it. I understand not replacing it without a receipt but it would be exceptional customer service to do so. So I had to buy another one and I went back to the Ameda. I love it so much more. you can get it for the same price here on Amazon so there's no reason to buy the Affinity, in my opinion.	
1. 	I purchased these tubby toys for my grandson, he loves to play in the tub.  And the fact that they squirt is wonderful.  I can't wait until his next bath!! Amazon keep up the great work with wonderful selections!!	
1. 	we are using this one more at home to give our LG a &#34;place&#34; at the table.  Seems like he really enjoys sitting at the table with us instead of by himself in the high chair.  With the tray table in tact, I can slide him under the kitchen table and feel that he is protected from falling out.  This is a 3 point harness and not a 5 point like the high chair.  We only have him in this when we are around.  the biggest bonus of this is the restaurant, very light, simple to use and carry and I can set it up in about 1 min in a restaurant chair.	
- 1	I returned this as it started to fall apart after the first wash. And thats without any use! I prewashed the cover when it arrived before using it on a cart, but right out of the wash the poly filling was coming out & the seam had come apart. For the price it should have held up to a single wash cycle.	
1. 	Very nice it's was exactly what I expected. I will defiantly recommend it. I will be buying more in the future.	
1. 	This is a great puzzle and it comes with A LOT of different 2-piece puzzles. My 12 month old is a bit young for them because she wants to eat them, but when she grows a little, she will have lots of fun, I'm sure. There are enough puzzles in this set to divide them up for rotation from week to week to week! I'm happy I got this item.	
- 1	I'm an exclusive pumper, so in addition to bottles and nipples, I also have lots of pump parts to deal with. This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems!Sadly, my dreams of an organized countertop, with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels, were not to be. I brought this home, popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using, and took it out, eager to assemble it. Unfortunately, not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken.I immediately took the item back to the store. Very disappointing (and my kitchen is still a mess, too).	
1. 	This hammock is a great idea, I bought it to hold my baby's bath toys, but in my tiled shower area, the suction cups would not stay stuck, even when there were barely any toys in it.  My husband and I finally got tired of it falling down all the time so he decided to get some super glue, and now it is stuck there forever!  If you plan on using this in the bath area, I recommend that you buy some super glue as well.	
- 1	They really seem to not provide much coverage for our SUV windows.  They also look &#34;messy&#34; on the window as I can't get them to look smooth.  My 2 year old can easily pull hers off the window which defeats the purpose.  It is just OK for the newborn baby but just doesn't look great.  They aren't too expensive so I guess that is a plus.  I haven't done full research on these, but I would assume that there has to be a better option out there!	
- 1	I bought it because it looks very cute, but not so anymore after I have to clean up the crumbs everywhere.  Crumbs fall off between 'teeth'.  This is only for home use. The shape is odd and too big for diaper bag. My 13 months old son has been playing it as a toy only.	
1. 	We have been using Playtex sippies for about four years now, for two children and they are by and large the best of all that we've tried.There are other attractive models out there, but they tip over easily (what marketing genius thought a narrower at the bottom than at the top design was a good idea!) and don't last. The plastic that they are made out of is hard and it eventually cracks-- dropped or from dishwasher wear.The Playtex models (either insulated or not) stay upright (most of the time LOL) and are easily cleaned by hand or in a dishwasher.(Hand tested on vacation and at nana's.)The only thing that we have done to maintain them is to replace the valve thingies as they will start to age after a year or so and leak despite what other reviewers have said. These replacement valves are cheap though and no problem to find.As to insulation, they insulate to a limited extent but don't expect to have your milk stay good for more than an hour or so in a hot environment. (Tested in Florida, Texas, and Virginia.)Five Stars. The best that we have used and we have tested just about everything on the market.	
1. 	I purchased this to secure the space between the bannisters on my 2nd floor.  This is exactly what I wanted.  And the box included the mounting screws to attach to the walls, so that was a bonus I was not expecting.  The clear color makes it so that my guests will never know the staircase is protected and yet I suspect this is just as effective if not better than any other solution.  I know people pay to have this type of product installed, but self installation could not be easier.  Great purchase	
- 1	This material was so thin that the pattern on the pillow showed through.  It also had a waxy feel which may have been for waterproofing, but not what I wanted.  I have a softer organic cotton cover that I greatly prefer.  Would not buy again.	
1. 	I have two kids; a 5 year old son and an almost 7 month old daughter. When I had my son, things were easy and I lived in an apartment where it was easy to keep him contained into one room. Things are much different now that I have my daughter (open concept livingroom/kitchen, a son that has smaller toys the baby can't play with, a dog that gets excited and sprints around the livingroom, etc) so I wanted a way to keep her safe without sticking her in a pack n play all day. I decided to give this superyard a chance and it is great! I have 8 panels total (superyard plus one extension) and it is the perfect size! I decided to purchase the alphabet/number mats to put under it so that I could just wipe up any drool/messes instead of having to move it around to vacuum daily.I would recommend this is ANYONE looking to give their little one a hangout of their own! It is very durable, which is something I was worried about since I knew my son would want to get in there with his little sister. He can climb over it on his own and it holds up fine!	
1. 	I don't agree with the dimensions listed on Amazon's description.  It does come with 4 pieces that are about 12 inches long...which will cover one side of your crib.  However, I don't know what the 1.5 x 5 part is.  I measured the ones I have and the inside of the plastic measures about 3/4 of an inch...and the outside of it is around an inch.  The plastic is fairly flexible.  I have the Aspen 4-in-1 crib and it fits my rails just fine.  My 11 month olds have not pulled them off....yet ;)  There is another listing for this same product, http://www.amazon.com/Prince-Lionheart-Crib-Rail-Teether/dp/B001JBALRQ/ref=pd_sbs_ba_5 , you might be able to get an idea of the size/shape of the crib rail it expects.I covered just one side of their crib at first, but this seems to work and I just went out (to a local store) and bought another pair to cover the other side of the crib.I recommend this product, however, you need to measure or consider your crib rails - they need to be on the skinny side.Update:  After several months of use, I noticed that the varnish from my cribs has come off of the crib and stuck to the inside of the teething rails.  It is the very very top of the crib rail and not the entire crib rail.  I hardly noticed until I looked at it harder.  I still like what the product does, however, I'm disappointed that it has ruined the wood.  My cribs are cheap anyway, but still, I take good care of my stuff.  I don't know if someone put some furniture polish on the crib rail to make it do that (I didn't).  I thought this was important and wanted to make sure you know about.	
- 1	My 9 month old has zero use for this toy. She likes the winkle but not this. It's made well	
1. 	I was a little apprehensive when I saw reviews saying these bags didn't work properly.  They work perfectly with my Medela electric pump.  They'll come in so handy when I'm traveling so I can pump and store right away without having to transfer the milk afterwards.  These are awesome.	
1. 	I own two of these mattress pads and I love them.  They help to make my extremely firm crib mattress a little cozier for my son.  They hold up very well in the wash and fit great over my Simmons mattress.  It is a little more expensive that other mattress pads, but in my opinion it is worth it.	
- 1	We bought this chair at a local store and the handle which plays music, when pulled, stop playing music within two days of purchase. We changed the batteries that it came with to see if that made a difference. It didn't. Going to take back to store since it hasn't been used.	
1. 	These covers are fine.  They are not soft like other covers but they do the job they are supposed to do and fit my tall sided changing pad, which I love.	
- 1	My daughter did not use this system I bought her for her baby shower. There is too many parts to have to clean so she is using Avent Bottles for the past 5.5 months.	
- 1	I hardly ever give bad reviews. I really hate to unless it's such a big disappointment or issue. This binky clip is not built to last. For the price I expected a bit more. The metal piece on the end has completely rusted out. The elastic has split apart. The fabric has become rough.I paid $1 more for my haba pacifier chain (free shipping if you sign up as an amazon mom). I'd advise anyone to purchase that over this. This is just not worth the money. Pay three dollars more for something cute that will last! So sad that this is just falling apart...Rust = -1 starSplit elastic rendering usless = -1Fabric loosing it's softness = -1Price = -1I don't really think it deserves this one star, but Amazon made me give it one.	
- 1	Bottles have smell of plastic and ratain milk or formula smell.  we have clean them very well. will be using glass bottles	
1. 	This is so much cleaner and useful than my old sponge-tipped bottle brush.  The bristles are soft, but still give you cleaning power.  It fits well into any bottle... I only wish the thin end also had some bristles to give more friction inside nipples.	
- 1	I wanted to like this wrap, but who wants to have to put the baby down somewhere while you spend time perfecting the wrap so that it is just right when you put the baby in? I am much happier with my HotSling which needs no adjustment, as well as my boba carrier. This is just way too much work, and oftentimes I felt like my baby was sliding down as it would loosen.	
- 1	The wicker is thin and cheap.  It came broken in, luckily the damage where the hole was was on the backside.  We just kept it because we didn't want to spend the time returning it.	
1. 	This is light, safe, easy to clean and attractive.  My daughter likes it and is having no trouble so far using it.  She can easily and safely get on and off it by herself or with help.  It is also easy to clean.	
- 1	Very cheap looking. The material had markings on it and the seams were coming undone. This looks like something from a dollar store. It is probably only worth $5 MAX. I was very disappointed. I had thought this would be a cute clothes hamper in my daughter's room. Maybe if I add ribbon to the yellowing ribbon over the wire parts, trim the loose threads and try to iron out the wrinkles, it might look a little better.	
- 1	I have 4 of these, that I use to protect the pretty nursery changing pad cover, and the changing part of our pack & play on another floor.  They do the job of protecting these things from baby accidents, and initially they looked pretty too (love the pattern, and the fact that they are square), but after a few washings/dryings, they are massively pilled and look older than the month that they are.  I don't see them lasting around here more than a few months.  Disappointing, overall.	
- 1	I would not recommend buying this chair to anyone. The base broke while my husband was rocking our baby, luckily no one was hurt. You should go on the Consumer Product Safety Commission website and search this product before you purchase it.	
1. 	I haven't had any issues with the suction cups staying stuck to the windows; but with that said, I did take a moist sponge to them before sticking them to the windows of my car and holding those suckers down for about 30 seconds. The issue I've had (which is so close to a non-issue it's not funny) is that the hot indicator stops being effective after a particularly hot day. It's been 40 degrees outside the past week and my hot indicators are still white. Also, do you really need a window shade to tell you that the car is warm inside?Other than the ridiculous white hot indicators I like these shades; they've been the most durable I've used yet over the past 2 years.	
1. 	These bibs came highly recommended to me and I completely agree! They fold up so small for the diaper bag, they are super easy to wipe off and they do a great job of catching dropped food in the little pouch. Awesome product!	
1. 	Although they seem pricey for a bib, these are an excellent size and material.  They are big enough to cover my one year old's clothes and are easy to take on and off.  They rinse off easily for minor spills and machine wash for bigger ones.  We also use the Bumkins long-sleeved bibs for when we really want to protect an outfit, but these are handy for less messy meals or when we aren't as concerned about keeping the clothes perfect.	
1. 	My seven-month-old has been bottle fed since about 1-week-old. We started with the Playtex Drop-ins.  I have been very happy with those bottles, but sometimes I hate dealing with the inserts.  These bottles are the perfect companion.  The nipples are interchangeable, so my son has no problem with the bottle change-up.I was really hoping the bottle would be easier for my son to hold on to since it is angled, but I think he just likes me holding it, so he has yet to hold the bottle himself.  I do find it much easier for me to hold when he is laying down because I can move around and it fits perfectly under my chin or it sits at he correct angle without me having to hold it at all unlike a straight bottle that falls over easily.The bottle unscrews at both the top and the bottom.  The bottom has a seal in it that pops out easily and is simple to clean.  They wash up quickly and I usually put them in my Avent microwave sterilizer.My one complaint is that the bottles come with fast-flow nipples.  My son is a medium-flow bottle eater.  Fast is just too fast for him.  He moved up to the medium at 2.5 months, but I don't see him moving up any time soon. I would prefer they come with medium since that would be used more frequently to begin with when moving up to the larger bottles.Overall, a great bottle.  I suggest picking up some medium-flow nipples if your little one has been using slow-flow since fast-flow can be a big jump.	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
- 1	My daughter absolutely loved these bottles but the air seal at the bottom gets incredibly smelly very quickly unless you sterilize them every time, which shrinks them and then they leak!	
1. 	For the price you can't really go wrong with these outlet plugs.They are extremely easy to install. It seems from reading these reviews the fit varies wildly --- cant either be extremely hard to get it out or easy, or something in between. For me, these plugs are somewhat difficult to get out but i can still do it without the aid of a tool other than my hands/fingernails. For now, while my daughter is still very young, these will work but as she gets older I imagine she will be able to figure out how to pull these out. Hopefully by then she will have lost interest in outlets (one can hope, right?)If you find yours is very hard to get out, I recommend buying a few of these to keep around the house:Baby Buddy WedgEZ Outlet Plug Remover with 6 Bonus Plugs, Orange/ClearAnything else thin and non-metal would work, if you would prefer.	
1. 	Both my babies love activity play mats and this one offers a lot to play with, especially since you can hang other toys on the extra rings. But this one is exceptionally expensive, especially if you're a frugal mom. There are some nice models for half the price.The one does have a 20 minute music timer to help keep your babe entertained which is a very nice feature. The mirror is also great for tummy time.If you're looking for a complete list of things to add to your registry, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com.

- 1	I got these for my 6 month old and they were too tight on his head.  He hated them, kept pulling them off.	
1. 	I use these Avent nipples with Avent bottles. I just wish they were a little cheaper since you have to buy so many of them in such quick succession.	
- 1	I am very disappointed by this diaper. At the beginning it worked great and I liked it more than my diaper covers with snaps. I used it with prefold diapers and I had no leaks. However, after only a month of use the velcro does not hold anymore, so the cover is now useless. It was a waste of money!	
1. 	I bought this one after reading lots of reviews of the first brands (including this) and also 'cause my sister in-law recommended it and was the best decision I made! I used it for 7 months and still works perfect. I must tell I really USED IT, I mean: 'till my baby turned 3 months I was pumpin every 2 hours every day! 3rd to 5th months every 4 hours every day, and 6th and 7th months 2 times a day.My only recommendation is that you look for the correct size of the breastshield since it comes with a 24mm that's a medium size: [...]I remember cleaning every part every time I used it and it was a job, but it's easier if you clean it with hot water and dishwashing liquid right away after use it. I only sterilized it once a day the first month and once a week after that and was enough.I totally recomend it!!	
1. 	The best tub - no slipping, she stays warm, and you don't have to hold her the entire bath time. Just throw it in the wash one in a while and make sure to hang dry. Way better than a sponge bath tub that falls apart and mildews or a cold, slippery plastic tub. We love it!	
- 1	I was really excited to get this in because we had similar items with several of our other children and never used icky restaurant high chairs.  This one is awful! The pad is held on by three loose pieces of elastic on the top, leaving the pad to flop around.  There is a rounded part bulging out all around the outer edge on the inside of the seat back, pushing the child's head forward if the child is small.  The three-point restraint is utterly useless, as the straps loosen up with any kind of movement and they aren't secure at all.  The restraint system will certainly not hold a wiggly child in.  The tray is a very tight fit and difficult to put on. I paid six dollars extra just to get it in pink instead of tan, what is the reason for it to be so much more on such a cheap item?  We have had many high chairs and booster seats through raising seven children, but this is truly one of the worst baby items I've ever purchased.  I find myself wondering who tested this product and said it was of good enough quality to be sold. My husband took one look at it and said, Send it back!	
- 1	for where we needed this it didn't work do to the plug's we had in the outlets the cover wouldn't fit.	
- 1	I love the idea of a mini-diaper bag for those instances when you don't want to lug around a full-size bag. Unfortunately, this Brica version is too skinny to actually function as a diaper bag.The diaper pad takes up the entire width and length of this thing so anything you add needs to be very skinny otherwise the velcro won't close. Adding just two size 5 diapers already causes the Brica to start bulging uncomfortably. This leaves hardly any room for wipes. You will need a very slim container or a near empty package of wipes. There is a good chance you will need to pack some stuff separately which defeats the purpose of not having a full-size diaper bag.I give credit to Brica for having a very good build quality. The materials are attractive and seem durable. The integrated bag holder is a nice touch. An integrated wipe holder would have been much more valuable though.	
1. 	I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for.  I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it.  I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up).  However, this advertised as no tip over which is another reason I bought it.  I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere.  Other than that, so far it's good.	
1. 	I thought about getting the diaper genie at first but then did some research. This is the best for your money! Not only was it less expensive than most other diaper pails, it also works the best. The only time smell escapes from it is then you open it to take out the bag. I really love how you don't have to buy bags for it, and that it takes perfectly good trash bags. That will save you a bundle of money alone! It works really great for us and we wouldn't use anything else. I wish it would hold more diapers but I really can't complain. Don't buy anything else!	
1. 	Seriously this is the most comfortable pillow ever! While nothing about being pregnant is particularly comfortable this pillow makes getting to sleep a lot easier by supporting you in all the right places.	
- 1	it's good for traveling.  we took it on a trip and it got a hole somehow so we had to inflate it every night. It does not offer good support for baby, you have to watch them super closely.  It is also very slippery and baby kept going under water.  Would not recommend.	
1. 	I initially bought this set because I wanted to change out the hanging toys on my daughter's Boppy activity center for variety.  She loved these!! They have various rubber surfaces that she liked to chew and touch.  Very colorful, encouraged her to grab for them.  During teething these are really great--you can put all of these in the top rack of the dishwasher for easy cleaning (even the fish). Great value for the money.	
1. 	This is the best mirror out there. I bought another one that was rated as the best (and more expensive) but it couldn't be positioned to point at the baby and I couldn't see anything but the top of her head!  I returned it and got this Diono one and it is perfect.  You can angle the mirror however you want so you can see your whole baby.  AND it stays snugly on the headrest.	
1. 	The bottle warmer is a must have for new moms.  It's such a pain to heat a bottle in boiling water - and it takes so long.  This bottle warmer will heat your bottle in 1-2 minutes -- it's quick and easy.  The product has held up nicely and doesn't take up too much counter space.	
1. 	I was  worried about putting this hearth guard down because I didn't think it would stick (I've had trouble with corner guards staying on)... but this comes with heavy duty velcro stick ons.  The velcro is hard to pull apart so I think it will be difficult for my son to figure out.  The pad is very cushiony and I'm sure it will serve it's purpose.	
- 1	I bought these after a positive experience with a similar product in 2010. I wish I could find that other product again. This is not nearly as good. I bought a lot, thinking it would be like the other product I liked in 2010, and I made twelve ornaments  with this product in spite of the significant problems, so this was not a one time bad experience. I experimented with different kneading times and different amounts of pressure to make the print. Regardless, I was not able create an attractive product. Here were the problems I encountered.(1) It requires A LOT of pressure to make the imprint--more pressure than babies, or most adults make naturally, so you will have to very, very firmly press your child's hand (or foot) into each ornament your make. When my daughter was a newborn, this was impossible. I had another kit and saved it for later when she was seven months. It was still very hard. I did a lot of footprints, because she puts more weight on the feet naturally than her hands.(2) The finished product doesn't look great. From a distance on a Christmas tree, you would be hard pressed (no pun intended) to make out that this was the shape of a baby's hand or foot. It just looks like a white circle until you get close. And keep in mind, this was after considerable work to get a firm imprint from my infant. Even more disappointingly, you cannot make out the adorable, distinctive wrinkles in her foot or hand. It primarily just an outline shape pressed in. Both the other clay product I used, and ink pad prints preserve those adorable wrinkles.(3) The circle cut-out isn't sharp enough to cut the edges cleanly. At least this problem is easy to fix with an Exact-o knife or scissors, but it is irksome. I sincerely doubt the examples on the product box were made with this kit alone.(4) The circle shape is only 4 inches in diameter. My daughter's foot nearly fills it, and she is tiny for age seven months (just over 14 lbs). The average one year old's hand will not fit comfortable in this circle. You could lose their cut-out and make your own, but again, it is irksome to have to use other products after you buy a &#34;kit.&#34;I recommend saving yourself this trouble. If you can't find a better clay kit, buy an ink pad to preserve precious prints and make crafts with. It will look much better and be less hassle.	
- 1	I cannot get my daughter to sit properly in this swing. Her chin always ends up on her chest, which is I understand very dangerous because it closes her airways. Also, her head always rolls to the side. All this to say I'm scared to use it and always end up waking her because her head ends up in places that scare me. I will stop using it. (Even in the product photos it looks like infant has chin to chest...)	
1. 	I love our wipe warmer!  I've also seen some of the negative feedback, and I don't have of those problems at all!  If you follow the directions with the package, your wipe warmer will be fine!  The Ever-Fresh pad at the bottom does dry out, but we just re-wet it each time we replace the wipes.  I've never had any wipes get brown or dried out.  The wipes stay warm long enough for me to use them - I just make sure to pull out a wipe as I need it.  And yes, some wipes are not made for the top part that allows another wipe to pull out after.  But all you need to do is buy the wipes that are folded that way.  I buy the Especially for Baby wipes in the big box.  You can get them at any Babies R Us or Toys R Us.  It costs about $10, and lasts us for over a month.  Plus, they're nice and soft and have no scent.The ONLY complaint I might have about the wipe warmer is that when I pull out a wipe, another wipe usually comes out with it unless I use 2 hands to pull.  But this is a minor issue.  I'd much prefer to have the wipe warmer.  This isn't a necessary item, but it's definitely something worthwhile to have!	
- 1	Despite the other reviews, I think this organizer is flimsy.  I was very disappointed.  This only think I liked was the umbrella holder at the bottom, except I'd have to get out of the car and get wet just to retrieve the umbrella.	
1. 	This tub is great, not sure why people had to give it bad reviews. Tub doesn't float with the baby in it and my son loved it! Not once did it slide and he loved hitting the tub and hearing the sound of the beads inside. Very roomy tub and I even use it as a play pad after it is done drying. It helps sit him up and even if he slides the bumper sides are awesome. You can have baby on their tummy to wash their back comfortably.	
1. 	This is a great swing, it is very portable and light, it stores away nicely, and my daughter loves it. It has several speeds and the music lowers. If space is an issue...this is a great choice.	
1. 	My daughter loves this stool. Its great for use in the bathroom in front of the sink. Also light enough for my daughter to move around.	
- 1	The product pretty much only has 2 textures, rubber & plastic. The product overall is a good size but each section is small, too small for the baby to get a proper &#34;bite&#34; on the section he may be interested in. To top it all off, the &#34;twisty&#34; of it actually made the product less enjoyable as the baby could not get a consistent grip/bite as it would twist as he grabbed/bit.Do the baby a favor & just get him the cheap little teethers that are filled with water.	
- 1	I loved the idea of these bottles-- BPA free, natural shape, and helpful for moms who are both nursing and bottle feeding. However, no matter how much care I put into trying to use these bottles, I had lots of problems with leaks. These bottles are designed with the caps/lids on the bottom of the bottle. This means that you are holding the bottle upside down when trying to close it. This is akward at best. Then, you flip the bottle over and... leaks! I tried closing the lids tightly, gently, softly and nothing worked. They would leak no matter what.Great idea, not so good execution.	
- 1	This was good while it lasted, but unfortunately it catches on EVERYTHING and as a result it has broke the clip on BOTH sides of my uppa baby vista.  so sad.  I will be calling uppa baby to see if they can fix it.  I don't have a solution as I feel like a cup holder is almost necessary on a stroller that you use all the time.	
- 1	This monitor worked great for the first week. Then, there was so much static I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't hear the baby clearly. I highly recommend the Sony babycall monitor (also carried by Babies R Us, but not online). It has a wonderful voice activated only feature that allows perfect silence from the monitor unless baby is fussing (i.e., you won't hear the vacuum cleaner or the dryer or the neighbor's dog barking, etc. - it only turns on when the baby cries or your spouse talks, etc.) I bought the Sony and retired the Fisher Price and am sleeping better than I have in weeks.	
1. 	This is the best baby bath tub out there.  It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.  We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.  I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).  This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...  Win win!	
1. 	They are cute, semi-soft and perfect size for little hands. They also make a nice sound while propelling themselves! My 14 months old likes them very much, and I think he will play more and more with them!	
1. 	This set is everything you need to start out feedings with.  Right now I use the spoons and the snack bowls to feed my 4 month old rice cereal.  I wish they still offered the take and toss organizer, but all of these items stack well into each other so they don't take up too much space.  They wash up well, and they are so cheap that if you lose one it doesn't matter.	
1. 	Thin plastic outlet covers....they fit tight enough to prevent little fingers from removing.  Older little ones might be able to remove them.	
1. 	amazing product! originally bought a body pillow and found it too difficult to turn in bed and deal with bringing the pillow in and out from under the sheets to switch sides with me. Got this pillow and every night has been a wonderful nights sleep. I turn from side to side and have even been able to maneuver the pillow a little so I can lay on my stomach for a little while. it is quite big though, so i feel like my spouse is being pushed off the bed and it can be difficult putting the pillow case back on after washing but... I say IT'S A MUST BUY! If you are not sleeping comfortable, this pillow could be your sleep saver!	
1. 	I hate diaper bag. That huge nursery looking sag will be always with me? Hell noooooooo!!!!!  But i needed something that holds few diaper and wipes. This deluxe fold and go is amazing. Everything i needed. It holds 3 size 3 diaper. 1 travel case ( huggies) wipes diaper rash cream ( mustella). In that zipper bag i put my credit card cash and my keys.And its a good 6 hours outside.  I am breastfeeding mom so i dont need anything besides my fold and go. 10$????? You cant beat the price. Just 2 cup of frappucino price something useful for long time.	
1. 	My baby boy just spend 20 minutos as much. I would like the music were loud but instead ins sounds too low. the hanging toys are nice and cute but is not the preferred toy of my baby.	
- 1	Baby fingers stick between ball and the frame:(( watch out for that...I did not know why she was crying ...he fingers got caught	
- 1	Baby would not take this bottle, and husband had a difficult home putting the pieces of the nipple together.  And when I took the nipple off there was still milk trapped between the two layers and leaked out all, over.  I have tried many bottles that are supposed to 'mimic the breast' and have found just a regular nipple with broad base and short nipple is best.  The ones hat come with my pump work great.	
1. 	I ordered these for our nursery to put on the changing table shelves.  I plan to dye the liner & paint the basket to go with the decor of the room.  When they arrived, they were in great condition (a worry of mine since they are wicker which tends to break easily).  I love the size of all 3 baskets.  The largest will hold diapers, the medium size will probably hold wipes & the smallest will probably hold any lotions, powders, creams or anything else we need for diaper changes.	
- 1	Like most other parents, I was happy at finding a warmer at a reasonable price, and this worked well for the first year but then it quit.The organizer caddy was handy.  It attaches to the side of your diaper table or crib with brackets that are included.  Also included are some rubber things that help you adjust the brackets for a smaller widths; for instance, if you are attaching to a table instead of a crib.  The front of the caddy is a zip-up net and inside you can fit about 15-20 diapers.  There are two pockets on each side that I use to keep small bottles of lotion, diaper cream, etc.  The warmer snaps onto the caddy so that it won't fall off the top easily.It also has a tendency to cook the bottom wipes and turn them dark yellow to brown.  It seems this is a problem with most warmers that warm from the bottom.The wipes have a tendency to dry out, but I think that is the case with most warmers.  I usually just add a bit of water every now and them to keep them from doing so (although this particular brand recommends against it, but my current one recommends TO DO it).I was disappointed to find out that there was no warranty when it quit working. I spent the same amount of money on one at Wal-Mart and it has a 5 year warranty - long enough to at least get me through the diaper stage!Specifics:  It is plug-in and not battery operated.  I think most units this size are plug-in.  It fits all size wipes, but does not have the feature for pop up wipes.  And it holds an entire refill size of wipes.  It warms from the bottom, not the top.  It is very easy to open and there is no lock for the lid.  You cannot adjust the temperature.  I think that is the same for most though.	
1. 	I like these bags better than the Green N Pack biodegradable ones. Unlike Green N Pack, these ones come pre-separated and contain poo smells better. The trade-off is that these bags aren't eco-friendly, but they work so much better. I will buy these ones again after I've used all of my Green N Pack bags.	
- 1	My toddler and infant both love these sippies, since there isn't much resistance to get the liquid out (some sippies are ridiculously hard to drink out of) but these straws are total junk. They're thin and if your child bites on them at all, they rip. We ordered these replacements, and they ripped within a couple months. Really need to find a new sippy to switch to, but my toddler is pretty resistant to sippy change. The sippies also leak like crazy after a while.	
1. 	this fits my graco pack and play like a glove didnt have to adjust anything, its thin enough to maintain a hard surface for my 3mth old to start to push up on and soft enough that he can snuggle for a nap!AND its waterproof backing is a great bonus!12 stars!	
- 1	My baby loves eating different kinds of snacks so I thought this snack dispenser was a great idea.  I was wrong and here's why:(1) lid is difficult to open; and (2) dispenser bottle is kind of deep and each compartment very narrow making it hard to grab snacks once compartment is half full.  Also, it's worth mentioning that the small opening in lid is useless.  It's just too much trouble using this dispenser so instead, I use small zip lock bags.  I'm thinking about using regular containers as well.

1. 	I love these bottle brushes, this was my second one.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and has a suction cup bottem that keeps it upright by the sink.	
- 1	This was a gift.  While I've seen other kids enjoy these, it didn't work in our household.  We made our own baby food and I guess it wasn't smooth and thin enough because I could never get food through the whole in the spoon.  Also, it was really hard to fill.  Nice idea, but didn't work for us.	
1. 	I purchased to use when we started solids with my son.  At 6 months this is still quite big for him.  Can't wait to use it when he gets a little bigger.  Love that it has long sleeves to protect his clothes.	
1. 	Was surprised at all the bad reviews.  Got this sound machine about 2 weeks after the baby came home and now 3 months later it's turned into a MUST have.  Just logged on to buy a second for the grandparents house since he will be over there more when I go back to work.	
1. 	What I liked:Firm and has kept it's shape. Provides support for the back. Like the pocket. Great for just having baby sleep in one's lap while reading a book. Simple to adjust the straps.What I didn't like:Could only use it in the cradle-hold position. Had to use pillows for all other positions. Depending on your body's proportions, you still might need a pillow placed under My Breast Friend to bring the baby high enough to the level of your breasts - I did.Great for use while sitting in the bed, on the floor or in a nursing chair but not in a regular recliner/lazyboy - the front slopes up because of the chair's incline.Why the four stars: Overall, would buy it again even though a bit pricey. I had the navy-blue fabric with white flowers - the color bleeds a fair amount initially, beware!Take it to the hospital with you. And if this is your first time, please see a Lactation Consultant/attend a local La Leche League meeting.	
- 1	I'm disappointed. I got these for our baby shower and loved the idea of an all-in-two system where I can swap out the inserts. There were a couple problems. First, the flap that holds the insert is very short, only a couple inches, so with a squirming baby it will be tough to get the insert to stay in place. Second, after one wash under normal cycle, the nylon on the flap (which holds the insert in place) had ripped. The rip is going to get larger each time I stretched the diaper, so these will be useless after a few uses. I think I'll try other systems b/c the quality of this one is really lacking.	
- 1	I feel like this is a frivolous product.  It can really only be used for a very short period of time, and then it's useless.  I let my daughter try this starting around a month old, probably a bit too young.  She started to pick up her head and move around at 3 months old, and this was no longer of use.I wish there was some sort of recommendation about when to start using this and how your child should be positioned on this (should their arms be over the edge?  Or on the wedge?)  I can see this potentially being useful for children with developmental problems who need a bit more help for a longer period of time.I found that just making sure my daughter had enough tummy time on a play mat worked great, and something like this wasn't necessary.I would not recommend this product.	
- 1	don't bother unless you like buying $3 spout replacements every month. Oh yeah, these still allow your child to suck like they do when they bottle or breast feed, so if you let your kids use these much past 1, you'll delay their speech development.	
1. 	This small brushes work perfect for cleaning quite a few things around the house.  Great for the small hard to get places.	
- 1	I bought this seat for my 2 year old son who is just beginning to potty train. I already had a Baby Bjorn toilet seat but he didn't seem to like it. I thought this one might be better since it seems like it would be a little more enclosed around his body and maybe make him feel more secure while sitting up high on the toilet.TO use this seat you have to lift up the regular toilet seat and position this one the rim of the toilet, then lower the toilet seat back down over it. Not difficult but you have to be careful not to let it slide down into the toilet bowl. This also means that to take it off you have to do the same thing. A lot more work than my Baby Bjorn where you just lift it right off.On our toilet, the seat shifted a lot. There isn't any way to secure it to the toilet like there is with the Baby Bjorn. The only thing holding it on is the actual toilet seat itself so there is no way to stop the shifting.Another thing I found out was that my son couldn't get onto this seat alone. Because of the high pee guard on the front, he has to be lifted up onto the seat. If you want your child to be able to use the seat by himself, this one probably won't work.Now that my son has more confidence on the potty we are using the Baby Bjorn again...it's a much better seat and well worth the extra money!FYI:  This seat WILL NOT work on a ROUND toilet bowl. It has to be an ELONGATED bowl.I didn't like this seat and we don't use it anymore. I recommend putting your money into the Baby Bjorn seat.	
1. 	We have gone back and forth over whether or not to buy a diaper pail or not..we adopted a nearly two year old and know that she will not be in diapers much longer.  These scented bags are a great option for those who won't need diapers for much longer.  They really do mask the poo-poo smell and that's all we needed.  5 stars!	
- 1	Maybe our crib is smaller than other cribs...not sure.  All I know is that this thing was a waste of my money.  I had a nice Pottery Barn bumper on there until my son started rolling around in his crib and started rolling near the sides.  I bought him breathable bumper since i am scared of SIDS.  I have a SNUZA monitor and video monitor as I am a total SPAZ about it however, I was very bummed that this bumper didn't hold up to my baby.  My husband and I tightened this bumper on several occasions but my son was able to push his feet down on this bumper and manage to get his feet and leg stuck in the crib.  After many nights of my son crying because his leg was stuck in crib, I reluctantly put the  old bumper back on.  Since putting it back on, baby and I have slept better.  I think in theory these bumpers are good but ours did not hold up to our baby who likes to put his feet on everything.	
1. 	Would have loved this for my kids way back when.  Nothing worse than changing a baby in the middle of the night only to have them scream in shock over cold wipes on their butt.  This solves the problem.  I thought this was a stupid luxury item when my daughter told me about it...but after she kept raving about it, I picked one up for my grandson who spends one night a week with me and I just love it.  I will say that if it sits unused for any long amount of time the upper wipes discolor.  I unplug it during the week when not in use and haven't had any issues.  I've had family members request that I put one in the bathroom for personal use and I will say that if you like moist wipes in the bathroom, this is SO much nicer.	
- 1	The image of these block make you think they are more three dimensional then they really are. They are hard to grab for my 5 month old, and are quite boring. They are just pictures for the most part with one teether toy. The black swirls are just a picture. They have nothing to hang them with, so they are just three plain blocks. I have purchased far more better blocks that my daughter can acually learn and play with then these. A waste of money. Dont buy!	
1. 	I bought one of these 5 years ago and am just now replacing it. That should tell you that its great quality! It has been through three kids and finally the bristles are flattening out. We use it on our camelbacks and thermoses as well. Then it goes into every dish washing load to be sanitized. Anything that can hold up to five years of daily dishwasher use has my vote for sure!	
- 1	These are ok, but not really needed. There are so many products out there- as a new mom it is hard to know which are helpful and which are not. I'd say you can pretty much do without these -- save your money for the things you really will use!!	
- 1	The stroller image shown for Jake is for the higher priced g-LUXE model, not g-LITE....this model does not recline, has smaller black wheels, and not fold up footrest for infants. This listing is incorrect, hopefully they will correct it soon to show the actual item you receive.	
1. 	Why I like it very much...Easy to cleanAffordableAdaptable to home, visiting, grandparents' or caretakers' homesOne cover and two trays...great for playing on a tray or eating with a little side cup to hold those precious little morsels that babies and toddlers cutely grasp in their chubby little handsLong straps that attach to a multiple variety of chairsStabilityAdaptability to the older child when trays are put aside and eating at the main table is the order of the dayWell constructed with an appropriate weight and heightA winner!	
1. 	This would be perfect if it was a little thicker.  The fabric is super thin and I find myself having to change it sooner than I would like if the baby drools to much and it soaks through.  Definitely need a waterproof sheet underneath this sheet.  I still like it though as it's hard to find many other sheets that are deep enough for my 5inch mattress.  It still does the job and is soft.  Even with its cons I still would buy another backup.	
- 1	I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns.  These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better.  I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump.  The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors.  Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean.  It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also.  I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them.	
1. 	I was hesitant to get my daughter the Winnie the Pooh version of this potty seat because of all the reviews saying how flimsy it is, and how it shifts around, and how  it pinches, but my daughter loves hers. She's 40 lbs and it doesn't bend, or slip around when placed on the toilet as per the directions. I can see how the directions could be beyond some people's comprehension. I mean it's not like there's pictures on the box that show EXACTLY how to use it or anything. :)	
1. 	Diaper Champ vs. Diaper Genie...Diaper Champ wins by 1 reason alone - they DO NOT REQUIRE you to buy their bags. Any trash bag will do. We bought a box of 500 trash bags for ten dollars; Diaper Gennie will only work with Diaper Genie Bags which are expensive.Besides that, I chose this one because as we were doing our registry, a FATHER came up and told us to get it (no smells, easy to use, compact), with his 2 kids and a pregnant wife.Baby in 1 hand, dirty diaper in the other, drop diaper in pail, flip bar, diaper is secured in bin. You only need 1 hand to use it. It's secure, it doesn't wobble.The pail WILL SMELL when you open it to change the bag for a new one. Otherwise, it keeps all the nasty smells inside the bin. We keep ours in the garage (have had it for 9 months) and have had no problems with smells (regardless of the weather 10- to 98 degrees). I estimate it holds up to 16 soiled diapers (we put the dirty wipes inside the dirty diaper so they are bulky).	
- 1	Missing parts : (4)x Post rackets and (12)x wood screws 5/8 in the package.Document: missing instruction .  It is  donwloaded from internet. Not sure instruction downloaded is most updated.Package is not packed carefully. Tape  wrapping around  box looks old.	
1. 	First let me say that if you're expecting this stroller to be on par with a full-fledged travel system, you're bound to be disappointed; however, if you're looking for the most basic type of stroller, this one is a fairly good bet.Like many other reviewers, we also received our safari umbrella stroller for free with a Babies R Us purchase.  I brought this stroller to my mother's house to have on hand for visits, and it's been a real convenience.  At under 3 months old, my baby fits nicely inside without sliding around or slumping down too much.  The stroller itself rolls smoothly, and the fact that it's lightweight and not at all complicated (unlike our Graco stroller, which can be a bit intimidating to someone who's never seen one before) makes it ideal for my elderly mother to use with her granddaughter.  This is really the perfect stroller to use in a city where you can walk to most places from home - just belt the baby into the seat and step right out the door.  The only two real drawbacks I've found are the seatbelt (3 point harness only instead of 5) and the fact that there's no sun canopy (make sure baby wears a hat outside if it's sunny).  Other than that, this is exactly what an umbrella stroller should be: portable, lightweight, easy to use and inexpensive.	
1. 	I think this is my baby's favorite bottle nipple shape.Like many others, I was worried these bottles would leak but they don't! Hurray!I really wanted to try these to see if they'd cut down on burping. They don't appear to do so, at least not significantly, but my baby is not exclusively bottle-fed.Pros:- They don't leak!- They are super-easy to get very clean (quickly!) because the bottom comes off. This is great when I'm out and about without my bottle brush.- The shape of the bottle is easy for me to hold and for the baby too although the 9 oz size is very unwieldy for young babies.- DISHWASHER SAFE!Cons:- Water will get into the bottom cap if you warm your bottles in water (but once you realize that it's easy to shake it out).- Can't tell if the bottle cuts down on burping and gas.- I wish this set came with an extra vent disk and nipple like the multi-size set.	
1. 	I am so glad I purchased this little book because my baby plays with it every single day.  She is 6 months old and I bought this for her about a month ago.  She loves touching it, flipping the soft pages and loves hearing the crinkly noise it makes.  This is her favorite toy.	
1. 	Play yard arrived timely and in great shape.  Started using it when the baby was 9 months old - He is now 2 1/2 and I am still using it.  Easy to assemble and safely contains the toddler.	
1. 	I used this to introduce water to my 6 month son. He was able to suck from it without any issues. Really like that this is spill proof too.	
1. 	I love the color and pattern of this nursing cover, it is not as eye catching as others on the market.  The adjustable strap and bending wire at the top works nicely.  The only problem I find is that the sides cannot be well covered.  I would be nice if the cover could be wider, and perhaps designed to wrap around the sides.	
- 1	I liked the idea of this strap as it just sticks on surfaces and does not cause damage.  However, my 16 month old was able to open the strap by clicking open the end (the white box without the button) that is not fixed to the belt.  I believe the quality of the white box is poor.  If the plastic and open/close mechanism were of better quality or if they had put buttons on both ends, then it would have been much more difficult to open.	
- 1	I got the baby brezza about 6 months ago, when it was time to start introducing solids to my baby boy. Back then all the reviews were 5 star, so I was super excited to get this item and thought it was worth the higher price. Well, it's not. The main reason why I got this item was so that I could make vegetable and meat purees in one steamer/blender. In the product review it stated that the machine can be used for meat and fish. It can't. In the operating manual it says that you can only used ground meat, which I didn't like. I thought that maybe I can cook the meat separately and then put it in the brezza to blend with the veggies. Well, it couldn't do it either. It couldn't handle blending even very soft turkey breast and would quit after several seconds. Having to stand there and hold the button down was also very annoying. I was extremely disappointed with the brezza and wanted to return it, but the seller I got it from wouldn't accept returns once you open the box. Anyway, now I use the brezza only to steam the vegetables. I cook the meats separately and then finish it all in a blender. After 6 months it can't blend even soft vegetables, by the way. So basically I paid a $100 for a vegetable steamer, which you can do in a simple pot.	
1. 	We have three of these for our little man and they are great for nighttime. They have been washed a few times and still look and fit great.

1. 	I love the Halo sleepsacks. I own a few brands, and I find myself reaching around the other brands in the drawer to pull out a halo sleepsack. The material is soft and there's plenty of room for my son to move around in the sleepsack without feeling restricted which is good because he loves to move around the crib in his sleep!	
1. 	Fits my Eddie Bauer pack and play perfect. It should be used in the winter though because it was really nice and soft but made my daughter sweat in the warmer months.	
1. 	This is light, safe, easy to clean and attractive.  My daughter likes it and is having no trouble so far using it.  She can easily and safely get on and off it by herself or with help.  It is also easy to clean.	
- 1	These bottles are horrible, first I got only two of this brand because of an emergency since I've always used Dr. Browns but they got contaminated in the dishwasher, so I had to run and get at least two of this meanwhile cause Dr. Browns wide neck are hard to find at retailers in my area, so we used these two bottles for 2 days first they come with fast flow wich is Waaay to fast for my little guy and I would say any other baby younger than 6 months old, so I decided to get two nipples medium flow, guess what still fast, specially if You have a gassy baby, then in the last try I got the slow flow and guess what again, tooooo slow, It was like a nightmare, I had to use the small 4ozs Dr. Browns I had at home wich my baby is already drinking 5 ozs so... These Playtex bottles leak horrible, and when you place them in the bottle warmer even worse because they get water in middle of the bottom rim, so they will be leaking anyways, for the amount of parts to clean up, I did not mind I'm used to it, cause I've always used Dr. Browns wich have several parts, these Playtex bottles got my baby full of gas wich defeats the porpouse of them bottles, they make so much bubbles in the nipples you can see and hear them, and the last thing is the nipple collapses so bad my baby stoped getting the flow and the nipples are really hard. bottom line, I ordered my 3 set of Dr. Browns wide neck shipping next day and I'll be ordering a second set very soon. Dr. B best bottles ever specially for gassy babies.	
- 1	These containers do allow you to pop your frozen baby food out with a little bit of effort.  The lids are little tempermental though.  I have never put them in the microwave or the dishwasher.  One of the lids barely stays on.  Not what you want if you planned on carrying them to daycare in your diaper bag. Will not purchase again.	
1. 	I bought this pump when I ended up separated from my baby for a few days due to a family emergency. She was only nursing 2-3 times a day at that point. I was able to use this pump enough to keep my milk up.It is portable, quiet and very easy to use. Also, the other medela parts are interchangeable. It is also very easy to clean.This pump is NOT meant to be used if you have a lot of milk to pump. It would not be ideal for an infant that is exclusively breastfeeding or for everyday use. Since it is a single pump and manual, it does take longer.	
1. 	This dresser/changing table has been amazing!  Most of the cloths for our little girl that are the current size fit in this dresser.  I use the drawers fir cloths.  The shelves I have out baskets in.  The top shelf I fill with diapers.  The bottom has a basket full of miscellaneous baby stuff.  A changing pad, heated wipe holder, and lotions, creams and a small basket fit on the top of the dresser.After our baby outgrows the changing table she will use it as a greaser in her room.Assembly was not too hard.  I took us about two hours.	
- 1	Well, to be honest, I had a love-hate relationship with this glider. I loved how comfy and suggly it was. But I hated how my head could not rest on the back (I'm 5'4) when seated with a semi good posture, and only could when I was scrunched kinda low or snuggly with my legs bent in the seat.But the reason I disliked it the most was because of the horrible creaks and clicks the gliding mechanism would make when I tried to rock/glide. I even found a metal piece that had fallen off the mechanism. And to make it worse, the noises inhibited the process of trying to get my baby to fall asleep...I honestly was trying to forget the negative aspects, but the thought of nursing my second child in this chair made me contact Amazon for a refund. I'm very thankful that they have such a good return policy!!!	
- 1	We used to have Britax sunshades to keep on the two middle windows, but they've lost their clinginess this past year. My wife drives our daughter to daycare in the mornings, and the route has the sun shining directly onto their faces, so we needed replacements immediately.I installed this one on the left window just to test it out. The clips on the top are somewhat thin, and I thought they'd break off eventually. However, I did like that this shade covered more of the window than our previous Britax ones did.When I closed the door after successfully installing the shade, though, I heard the plastic clatter against the window. I thought it was the window at first, so I immediately removed the shade and reapplied it. Sure enough, it made the same noise. I found out that it was the plastic bar that was hitting against the window when I closed it, but thought it wouldn't be a big issue.When I came home from work, I noticed the shade was on the floor of the car. I asked my wife later if she didn't like it--No. Apparently the clatter against the window keeps occurring whenever driving, and the noise became annoying. My wife had a guest in the car that day, and she too commented on how annoying that noise was.So, unfortunately, while the shade does cover a bit more, we're going to have to rely on the tinting already installed on our windows for adequate sun block rather than suffer the clanging noise.	
1. 	I love these cups!  The size is great (slightly smaller than the normal sippy cups) - the size is especially nice for taking on a trip or just throwing in the diaper bag so water is available.  Plus, they do not leak, which is a must for us!  We definitely like them.	
1. 	I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  MY HUSBAND AND I CHOSE TO USE CLOTH DIAPERS ON OUR SON AND THIS WORKS GREAT FOR HOLDING THEM UNTIL THEY GET WASHED.  WE NEVER NOTICE A SMELL COMING FROM IT.  WE ALSO LOVE THAT IT USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS RATHER THAN NEEDING SPECIAL BAGS.  IT HAS BEEN A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT FOR US AND WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO IS CLOTH DIAPERING THEIR BABY.	
- 1	I'm a fan of manual pumps in general--I've used a Medela Harmony for years as a supplement to the double electric I keep at work and I love the manual pump for its simplicity, efficiency and the fact that I seem to extract more milk while using it.But I recently found myself in a pinch where I was away from my baby for 24 hours without a pump.  The Dr. Brown's/Simplisse was the only pump available for sale in the vicinity so in desperation I plunked down $40 and gave it a try.Horrible.  It did a horrible job at removing milk from my breasts.  I pumped and pumped and pumped until my hand was exhausted and the milk came out drop by excruciating drop, then would stop coming but I could tell there was still quite a bit of milk in my breast.  I'm sure I had it assembled correctly because I took it apart and carefully reassembled it several times to make sure it was all airtight.  It's too darn gentle for its own good.The design is also bad.  Including the collection bottle and stand, this pump has 11 parts total, versus 7 total for the Medela Harmony.  That's several extra little parts to keep track of while washing and align correctly while reassembling.  Simplisse is quite a misnomer.The bulky pumping mechanism also obscures your view of your breast.  With the Medela pump, I look down and easily check on the alignment of my breast in pump and the milk flowing out.  With that pump, it's easy to tell when the milk has stopped flowing.  But with the Dr. Brown's/Simplisse, you can't see your nipple/breast, so it's a guessing game about whether any milk is actually being produced.	
1. 	Looking at baby toys is so overwhelming. This set has all you need (of course you'll end up buying more toys, but really this is all you need!). The toys are high-quality, colorful, and they encourage exploration in play. I highly recommend this set.	
1. 	I was afraid to buy this because of the negative feedback but I couldn't be happier with it.  It's fit all carts fine for me and the pillows on each side are great.  My daughter is very squirmy so I'm always afraid of her hitting her head on the side of the cart but the pillows prevent her from getting hurt and from falling to the side.  The print is nice and neutral and the cover is well put together.  Love it :)	
- 1	We had 3 of those in total and all 3 of them broke after a short time.One of them, the hook broke off, 2 of them did not roll back in and the part that is supposed to stick to the window also kept on falling off. I can not recommend this window shade.	
1. 	I bought one used from a coworker.  My first daughter loved the swing so I figured this would be a good investment.  I love that the seat is more upright than laid back.  It's easy to fold, lightweight and works wonderfully. The only thing I would change is the swing seems to move very slowly (I have new batteries). Of course, I did get mine used so this could be due to that??	
- 1	At home my son has a Baby Einstein (BE) jumper which he LOVES.  While I was visiting my parents I picked this up from Walmart for about the same price at Amazon because my son would not stop jumping in my lap.  What a waste of money.  The toys are too close to the seat.  My son would end up smacking his face against the toys - this never happens with the BE. The lights are nowhere near as vibrant as the BE and something about this is really really uncomfortable.  5 minutes in - my son would be screaming and crying.  Not sure if its the seat or the mechanics of the jumping (you jump on the blue triangle which moves unlike BE where the seat is suspended from springs.Not worth it.	
- 1	Great idea, but did not hold up. We have a 6mo old and wanted to use this with the baby gate. saw a snag in the cover material that morning and thought maybe the gate messed it up. Well come to find out my little man scooting about on it pulls the plastic top up from the foam and it rips, leaving fun flaps of plastic he LOVES to pull at. The cats walking on it have left it dotted with holes as well. Very disappointing. No idea how one could expect to use it with a toddler	
1. 	We bought this for our newborn as a night light and I love it!  We use the green which is soothing and is bright enough to nurse by at night.  I still use a brighter light to change messy diapers, but it works great for anything else.  I love that it has a timer and I feel that it makes the nursery peaceful.  The stars show up great, and as said the blue and green are easier to see than the amber, but no problems with it being close to the ground.	
- 1	As a midwife I thought I would love this Moby Wrap.  I ended up reselling it at a consignment shop, it was too bulky and not comfortable.  It looked wierd.	
1. 	I tried the regular version of these bottles, too.I babysit a friend's 5 mo old boy, he tends to spit up.  I thought these would be perfect to try with him.  He definitely spits up alot less with these bottles, there are far fewer bubbles in the bottle, too.  I gave his mom the pack of regular bottles and I keep these at my house to use with him when  he's here.  She loves the bottles, too, and says these are all she uses now.  It definitely makes for far less laundry when the baby doesn't spit up nearly as much!  Personally I prefer the wide bottles, they seem easier to hold but that could be because I'm dealing with my 2 kids at the same time as the baby.I used a much more expensive brand with my last baby who is 4 now.  Wish I had known these existed, they're far easier to clean and much easier on the wallet.  :-)	
- 1	I don't like this k'tan. I have pretty much lived in my original k'tan for the last four months and was really excited to try this one in hopes that it would keep my child cooler. I ordered the same size that I have in the original and it fit to small. It doesn't stretch as well and neither me or the baby was comfortable. I'm returning it.	
1. 	We have used several other gates to block off the stairs in our home and have been frustrated with them all. My husband and I wish that we had ordered this gate a year ago! It was easy and quick for my handy husband to install at the base of the stairs. The gait opens easily with one hand (the trick is to pull the latch and then LIFT the gate just a bit, which we didn't know to do and initially caused us to think the gate was defective until reading the directions. This feature is nice as our toddler can pull at the latch but can't lift the gate to open it by herself). The gate is also fairly wide, allowing us to pass through it easily, even when carrying things. The gate automatically swings shut, which is convenient, but will also stay open if opened to 90 degrees. Would highly, highly recommend this gate!	
1. 	Yes, you heard me, this thing rocks over the Bjorn.  It's bigger, more comfortable and has more things on it that I wish the Bjorn had - like a bottle holder, various pockets for storing personal items, a shade so that harsh light doesn't bug baby when he's sleeping, waist and lumbar support, rings to attach toys and a clip to clip down the front when it's folded over.  The new on the hip design is great as you can wear baby on the hip or in front.  Perfect on the hip when feeding! He also gets a  better view when faced in of the outside world from my hip.  The Bjorn just did not seem to grow well with him, we tried adjusting it so many ways and it always seemed too tight and just not good for him even though it is a great design.  With the extras on the Snugli though it makes going out and about with the pack easier as you have everything handy without a diaper bag as well, this thing worked great for airport and international travel.  Never thought I would buy the cheap Snugli but I did!	
- 1	Don't you think those back straps will pull your shoulders forward? YES they will. My back started to hurt after 5 minutes walking with my 9 lbs baby! I give not 1 but 2 stars because it is a good quality, strong, VERY easy to use baby carrier, BUT invest more money in it and buyBabyBj&ouml;rn Baby Carrier Synergy - BlackIt has that magic back support! P.S> You have to adjust the straps as your baby grows then nothing will press against her diaper area or anywhere else.	
- 1	Don't buy this. It doesn't fit correctly and causes the mattress to bunch up and after washing it pills HORRIBLY. It pills more and more each time you wash it and like I said, its too small (and i didn't even put it in the dryer!)I am disappointed because I have been happy with every other Graco purchase and I love the Pack n play. I dont know why they dropped the ball on the sheets?	
1. 	Installed these on all exterior doors, kids have real trouble opening them even trying to escape using a chair. Very important with a pool in the backyard with small kids, very small price to pay for this kind of secure safety. Just get in the habit of locking it every time, no matter what and it will do the trick.	
1. 	My daughter and I really enjoy the Kringelring. Made of beech wood and non-toxic finishes, I feel safe allowing my daughter to put it in her mouth. I thought the gaps between the wood might pose a pinching hazard, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Pretty nice quality- I could see it lasting through multiple children. The colors are attractive and might help later in color recognition. I will be purchasing more HABA toys.	
1. 	My baby would take the bottle with a lot of bouncing fussing etc. sometimes, but I was on maternity leave so I didn't really mind the work cause bottle were occasional and I could always switch to BF if I needed to. But at 14.5 weeks I had to go back to work and there is nothing worse than A)leaving your baby to go back to work and B)being told that he won't take the bottle so that your normally happy baby is crying and fussy all day long.I was using the nipple that came with the drop-ins and it's very round and the tip seems harder and rounded too. Not exactly like the shape I am when he's breastfeeding. I had seen these in Babies R Us and didn't get them because it said medium flow. After about 3 days of my caregiver telling me he just hates the bottle I hopped on here and looked for another nipple because I had already looked in the store and there wasn't a lot of selection. I read the reviews which lead me to believe you shouldn't trust the flow speed when comparing the two nipples so I decided to go get these. The next day my caregiver text me and it said I love these nipples! He took them right away, she said it was 100% difference and now he eats when I'm away.If you use this system and baby doesn't like it very much switch to these nipples and see if it helps. My good friend is pregnant and I gave her these as part of her shower gift. I feel they are closer to a real breastfeeding experience and these should come with the bottles.	
1. 	This was my favorite bottle bag for my son.  It will hold six bottles with the ice pack going on top of the bottles.  I usually only put five in at one time so that I could use additional ice packs.  The storage on the top is small, but will fit two Gerber baby food containers, spoon and bib.  I used this to take his bottles to daycare and on all-day trips.  For short trips (to daycare), one ice pack would work.  For all day trips, we used additional ice packs.	
1. 	Love these bottles, but baby seems to drink faster with these nipples. Doesn't leak as long as you line up the arrows. Great for traveling with baby, but not that great for the environment.	
1. 	I have nothing but great things to say about this wipe warmer. If my baby needs a midnight change he doesn't even notice that I am changing him because he doesn't feel a cold wipe on his bottom! I highly recommend!	
- 1	i am submitting a picture with this review. I counted 13 errors where the cards are out of sync and the letter does not match with the animal depicted. The cards cannot be moved around to make this correct or I would keep them. Surprising for abc flash cards and disappointed I am dealing with return of this cheap item.	
1. 	We like this high-chair for our baby so much.  We use it daily at home instead of a bulky plastic high-chair.  I like that it puts her at the table with us and doesn't take up extra space in our small eat-in kitchen.  It is easy to detach and transport.  We take it to church potlucks, restaurants, and when visiting friends and family for dinner.  It is nice to use it at restaurants, where she can then sit on the inside of a booth and not be sticking out in a walkway.  (We always get comments on it when dining out.)  I feel that she is very secure.  The only reason that I did not give it a full five stars is because I have found some tables that take some creative placement in order to get the clamps to lock down right and a couple of tables that it just wouldn't work on.  I still highly recommend it.**Update**After a few months use, one of the clamps broke, the plastic snapping.  We did continue to use it, and I felt safe doing so.  My husband was able to repair it for just a dollar or two, and we have had no further issues with it.  I am still happy with the chair overall and would buy it again.	
1. 	This Boppy is very comfortable.  I like the asymmetrical design; it allows me to tuck the larger part between my legs while the smaller part is wedged under my belly for extra support.  I had been having hip pain while sleeping at night and this little jobby did the trick.  The only negative comment I have on this is that it does tend to make me a little warm while sleeping but I think anything would.  All in all this was a great purchase and I would suggest it to anyone trying to adjust to sleeping on their side (I am typically a stomach sleeper) or to anyone experiencing hip pain.UPDATE:  I have now had my baby and have used this pillow to help prop him up during feedings!!!  I have gotten my money's worth out of this Boppy; I use it every day still.	
1. 	I was given some of these at the hospital when I delivered my baby as we were having major latch issues.  They worked so well that now we are exclusively breast feeding and no longer need to pump and use the bottle two weeks later, or one of those annoying nipple shields.  My only problem was that if I didn't wear them e.g. at night as Medela suggests then the nipples would get flat again, so I purchased an extra set and wear them all the time.  Wearing them 24/7 did cause some irritation initially but breast milk solves everything, and I make sure to air the area out after every feeding and keep them clean and now this is not a problem.  I hope with longer use I won't have to wear them all the time.  I also find that as long as I don't wear anything low cut then nobody would know I was wearing them, I am not on the huge side so I don't know if that makes a difference.  As an additional bonus they are a built in catch for leaking milk.ETA: at 6 weeks pp I no longer need to wear the shells so much, they have done their job and now I am wearing them for maybe 8 hours per day. Still love them!	
1. 	I have 3 kids under 4.  They do not have stranger danger yet.  So if I'm changing a diaper, making lunch or something else that needs my immediate attention & some one comes to the door I need to make sure the older two do not open the door.  These are perfect!!!!  They can not open the door if some one rings the bell & it gives added security if some one tries to break in.  If someone wanted to get in there is no way they could kick the door in, they would have to break a window.  This also doesn't put any holes in the door & is hardly noticeable.  It's the best investment I've ever made!!	
1. 	I use this to keep the toilet locked from my toddler daughter. It's a good product and does the job. It's also easy to install. She can still lift the toilet seat even with it on about 1/2 an inch, but it still prevents from anything or her hands from going into the toilet.	
- 1	They leak.. a lot! I tried so bad for this to work out for me since I have been pumping x 6 months and thought maybe these would be better than the medela shields. When removing from breast the milk tend to pool on bottom and leak out (not good!) .I am returning them (at least they accept returns! )	
1. 	It's kind of big and clunky, but our baby likes to watch and listen to it.  It has a good volume range -- some toys are just too loud.  The bubbling water is a nice effect.  The toy was fairly simple to install on the crib and a plus is that it can be used beyond sitting-on-own age.	
1. 	I purchased a Tiny Love Gymini, FP Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and some other misc. toys to entertain our little one (now 2m).  I thought they were cute.  He couldn't care less about them....at least not right now.  He loved this mobile from the moment it was pulled out of the box.  He will stare at it, talk to the animals, coo, and giggle.  It keeps him entertained for a whole 15 min. and sometimes longer which gives me time to put in a load of laundry, grab a quick bite to eat, and etc.  He'll even stare at it when he's not in the crib, which keeps him entertained during diaper changes.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Two thumbs way up!	
1. 	I hate to use that as my title cause you hear it all the time BUT I swear I have tried just about all of them and this one is by far my favorite... Honestly everything is going to give you a little back pain after awhile... heck my purse alone does... But this Bjorn distributes the weight and pressure of the baby that you honestly will be thrilled with the carrier. I have tried all of the little cheap ones and I figured I was saving money but not I have a carrier collection and only use my bjorn. So Honestly Save money by purchasing just one.My son loved me holding him when he was little and when he got  interested in looking around I just flipped him around and he had the comforts of mom but yet could see everyone else.. And I had the use of my two arms... :-)	
- 1	I've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you can't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it. My son recently had a dirty (poop) diaper leak (not a big leak, like a drop or two), and I don't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again. I don't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym, swing, and bouncer for times I need to put him down. I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles. He's 7 weeks old. I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove.	
- 1	The water stream coming from his mouth doesn't travel horizontally very much, it makes it difficult to aim the stream of water away from my baby's eyes.  It's not very useful for watering my plants, either.  Looks great on the bathtub shelf tho!	
- 1	Don't waste your time or money with this. They are VERY uncomfortable and actually hurt me while pumping with these breast shields.... I should have listened to the customers who wrote bad reviews on this product!	
- 1	I ordered this machine recently and was honestly shocked by it because of the good reviews. I will first say that I have a 5 month old that had colic and white noise helped us so much. I was against having a noise machine initially. But when she wouldn't sleep I knew I had to look at options. I loved the idea that this one you could plug in an ipod as well. 2 big problems... 1) it's not loud enough at all and 2)it doesn't even have plain white noise.I already had a travel size homedics that I just put on waterfall that works great and was 19.99. I just wanted to consider this Graco bc of the mp3 attachment. Marpac works great too. It's just around $50 but I've heard they last 25 years. My best friend has one and swears by it. Hope this helps!	
1. 	I was a little unsure if this would work after reading some of the reviews but has stayed up for about 2 months now. My husband put it up and of course didn't read the instructions, i.e. the wall wasn't cleaned, wait 24hrs, etc. He just slapped it up there and it has stayed. Our shower is a regular fiberglass tub surround so it's very smooth, no fancy tile here so maybe that is helping it stay put. It is about half full and most toys are light weight. We do have one heavy toy that stays out and I am not going to test it out so that one stays by itself. I am very pleased with it and love scooping and rinsing the toys so easily. I will post a picture too.	
1. 	After some disappointing options from the local big box store I finally came to Amazon to do some review research. After an afternoon of reading a full diaper-load of reviews, I decided to give this economical duo a try. I could not care less that my son received a purple and pink set and certainly no one else has cared either. What I cared very much about was the spill-proof, leak-proof claim and I was not disappointed. Just like they were supposed to, the tops audibly clicked into place and didn't leak.Of course, after more than 6 months of heavy use the valves have become a little tired and weakened, but even now they need to be completely upside down or at a very specific angle to leak at all. But because my son is also now that much older, that happens less and less.We have now moved on to Playtex's bigger sizes without handles and once again I am impressed.Our other go-to cup is the Safe Sippy (stainless steel with soft plastic cover) and it too is a leak-proof champ, so long as the handle is on. But since that has a hard plastic straw top, these First Sipsters were definitely used the most when our son was first starting the transition to sippy cup.I give these sippy cups a non-super mom's recommendation for sure.	
1. 	My 3mo old loves the toothbrush!  I also got him the banana toothbrush, but he likes this one better because Mommy does the work!  I make him hold his banana toothbrush himself. I like that he gets practice with his banana toothbrush, but I get it done with this one!He seems to like the taste of the toothpaste.  I think it smells good, but am afraid to try it.  The finger brush makes it real easy to  clean his whole mouth.If there was an improvement to make, I would say that a case for finger brush would be great.  I use a ziploc bag and throw it away, but a sanitary case would be awesome.	
1. 	Our baby was swaddled for sleep up until she was 6-months-old and started rolling over onto her stomach while swaddled.  We tried putting her in footie pajamas for sleep, but she seemed a bit restless during the night.  It was too drastic of a change from the swaddle she'd become comfortable with.  We tried this Halo SleepSack (on top of the pajamas), and she settled right down to sleep.  The SleepSack gives her the cosy comfort of a swaddle with the freedom to roll over without any safety issues.  Now we use a SleepSack every night.  We prefer the standard fabric (rather than the fleece variety).  Living in Houston, the Halo fleece fabric is too heavy and warm, even in winter.This particular design of dots is not our favorite Halo design, but it works just the same as the cuter designs.	
1. 	The negative comments on these gates have a few points I don't understand:Child tips it over.  I've sat on the edge of this thing when a 1-gate ring.  No problems.Child drags the gate all over.  Unless you mount it to a wall, any gate is going to be moveable.Gate has trouble folding.  Yep, it is hard to fold.  this is a GOOD THING in that you don't want your child folding it on his/herself.Gate cracks.  I have three of these.  No problems.  Really must be lemons for this to be an issue.We actually made one giant ring out of three of these and although we need to zigzag the longest wall so that it stands up without falling over (one long straight wall is not going to be sturdy without sideways support no matter what you build it out of), it is just right for our purposes.  The kid might not love it, but she now has a TON of space to play.Our child with a propensity for getting stuck in things has yet to get stuck in it (yay!) nor has she found a way out of it yet.  I love this thing.	
1. 	This really helped me keep my posture while breastfeeding. My baby loves sleeping on this while I have him on my lap, it's that soft and comfortable for him. My only complaint is that two months after we started using it, the filling started pushing through the cover. I keep finding bits of it on my baby's face and it's becoming annoying. I haven't washed this, only spot cleaned the areas that need it. I always use a swaddle blanket to protect it from spit ups and drool but it would have been nicer if it had a cover in the first place. Still, we use this everyday so I'm giving it a 4.	
- 1	all of the dispensers are too big to even get into a medicine bottle nevermind my newborn sons mouth. maybe meant for toddlers.	
- 1	These are heavier and harder than the original Gumdrops made by Hawaii Medical. If you want the authentic pacis like from the hospital or a lighter version that doesn't fall out of baby's mouth than don't buy these.	
- 1	My daughter is attracted by colors and animated screen. So because this mobile has a projector that i believe my daughter will like i decided to buy. Of, it did the job, it kept my daughter's attenetion for at least 10mins at a time. After 2months or so, the mobile stop working. You can hear the music but nothing is moving. For the price of the mobiel I will expect for it to go longer than 2 months. Oh, by the way i thought it was the battery, we changed it, still nothing.	
- 1	I use pocket diapers (FuzziBunz brand).  I needed a diaper pail with a foot lever and a place to put deodorizing disks. I bought this one because of the brand. Six months later, I still hate it as much as I did the first week.It's too small. With two days' worth of diapers in it, the lid won't close.Which is ironic, really, as the foot lever mechanism is so ineffective, the lid barely opens when I want it to. This means every time I have a dirty diaper, I step on that lever, the lid opens about 2-3 inches, and I then try to maneuver the dirty diaper into the pail without hitting any of the dirty diaper surfaces against the outside of the pail. Which is nearly impossible to do. So a long time ago, I just started lifting the lid up with my fingers, which creates a couple of other issues: that I then either have only one hand to remove the pocket insert from the diaper, or I have to first do that and then lift up the lid with a hand that's just touched the dirty diaper - which defeats the purpose of manually lifting the lid, to avoid getting the outside of the pail dirty.A diaper pail is really a pretty simple concept: it needs to be big enough to hold 2 or 3 days' worth of diapers; it needs to open up without the use of hands; and it needs to accommodate some form of deodorizing system. This can does hold scented disks (sold separately) in the lid, so it gets two stars for that. Otherwise -- this is the worse flippin' diaper pail on the market, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why a brand as reputable as Safety First would even bother producing it.	
1. 	My son was 9 months old and we took a 2 hour flight to visit my inlaws. Since he was on my lap I wanted something to secure him since he was not buckled in.I read that some flight attendants will make you take this off during take off and landing. They let me keep it on my son and didn't say anything during our flights (they probably didn't notice).I would suggest putting the vest on before you get on the plane. It is so cramped on the plane and it made it a little tricky to get the vest on him. I was afraid they would see it and make me take it off of him. You can always put on a zip up sweater over the vest.The vest is very soft and easy to use and wash.I was thankful that I got it because when we were about to land at our destination, the pilot had to pull the plane back up. There was wind shear while we were landing and if you don't pull the plane back up, you can crash (great huh). So there is an alarm that goes off in the cockpit. It was very scary since we were ready to land and then all of a sudden we are going right back into the sky. It was very very bumpy.I didn't lose my grip on my son, but if we didn't pull back up, who knows,, I could have.bottom line: it is woth the peace of mind.	
1. 	Keeps my beautiful tan Napa leather nice and clean. Blends in nicely too. It is made of very sturdy and water proof material. I highly recommend this for people with toddlers who love to snack in the car. Clean up is a breeze.	
1. 	I bought this when my DD was around 4 months old, it has a 5 point harness and she had gread head control at the time so it worked very well.  I love this product, we bring it everywhere with us and it fits on every table we've ever tried.My only complaint is that it is a HUGE pain to clean.  You need to thread the fabric onto a curved bar, which takes some patience.	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift which was on my registry. I did read all the reviews here and all the negatives were that it didn't fit the crib. Well it fit my crib fine, but the craftsmanship on this mobile is not really up to par. The bird up top is just a cloth covering. I thought it was an actual plush. The birdie perched on the branch is lopsided. The branch itself is lopsided. And the kicker? The mobile plays a different melody than Brahms which is stated on the box itself. The mobile I have plays something that sounds like twinkle twinkle little star, and I actually had to google Brahms lullaby to make sure I was going crazy and hearing the wrong melody.I wanted to return it but was told that since I opened it and assembled it, I won't be able to so I'm stuck with it.	
- 1	This product seemed perfect when my two year old started escaping his room and getting into things while we were sleeping.  It worked great for about a month until he got wise.  Now he just pops it off and opens the door.  No problema!  I am writing this review as I search for something better that won't just snap off in the hands of a tiny tot.	
1. 	This keeps my daughter busy.  It's not as good as some of the other teethers, but it's simple and fine and you can't go wrong.  It fits nicely into a purse pocket.	
- 1	We received several SwaddleMe wraps (which we loved for a new-newborn, but not for 10+ lbs), so I thought this would be an even better/faster way to get through the night with a newborn.  Unfortunately, our baby was able to easily wriggle her fits through the neck hole which frustrated her and woke her up even more.Might work for some, but I'd skip these in favor of the SwaddleMe's or just a plain blanket with a tight swaddle technique!	
1. 	I bought this because my sister had something like it when she was breastfeeding, and she said it really helped with positioning her baby. When we first started breastfeeding, about an hour after I gave birth, it was really hard to hold my baby to my breast. It was too difficult to support his head with my arm, and regular pillows didn't work. The only way I could comfortably feed him is with the boppy. This one may be a little more expensive, but it has a cute fleece cover that easily washes and stays very soft. You can use the boppy for feeding, positioning baby on his belly or back, or even for you to sit on after giving birth (like a doughnut) to help with perineal pain. The possibilities are endless!	
- 1	My baby got out of this just as easily as if I used a regular blanket. And NO, this is not easy to use. It is a pain in the butt. If you can't swaddle  with a normal blanket this will not help you. And the fabric is super cheap. Waste of money.	
- 1	It's okay.  Cheap, made terrible.  It does what it's supposed to do, but if a strong wind comes along, forget it!	
- 1	We bought this seat elsewhere about five months ago. Until today (when it needed to be taken apart for cleaning) we were happy with this seat. Today my son vomited numerous times in a couple of minutes. Our first baby car seat was a Chicco infant seat that he grew out of and he vomited once in that seat and I was easily able to take it apart, wash it and put it back together. No so with this Recaro seat.  You can't take the fabric off the piece that goes up and down (the combined back and head rest) and taking off the rest of the fabric around that piece was a nightmare. The vomit was EVERYWHERE, under the seat, in the ridiculous cheap foam pads under his bottom and against his back (today I realized those foam pads were weirdly discolored before he got sick). The instructions also say to hand wash where our old seat was machine wash and hang dry.  I actually had to hose the seat off to get it clean and had to hose off the back portion (that slides up and down to provide cushion for the sides of his head) because that wouldn't come off. I could go on but you get the idea. It's sitting in the garage still drying four hours later.Thankfully we live in a warm climate (Texas) and I was able to hose it down - had we been in a cold weather state I can't imagine how I could have cleaned that seat.  After that incident today I wish we had bought a different seat.Fingers crossed I'll be able to get the cover back on the seat when the foam pads by his head eventually (?) dry.	
1. 	I just bought this last week and so far, I'm very pleased with it. I originally purchased the On the Go Medela Advanced Pump but I was too overwhelmed by all the different parts and washing required. I wanted something super simple and easy to use. Because I don't produce too much milk right now, this manual pump works perfectly for those times I just want to grab and pump quickly to output 1 or 2 oz of milk. It's easy to clean and sterilize and assemble. My only complaint is sometimes the suction becomes loose so the pump loses its power. When this happens, just adjust the suction and continue using.	
1. 	Loved using this. Great for using in booths at restaurants, packing in your suitcase for trips, very happy with this item. Best $50 you can spend with a child.	
1. 	I liked this pillow it was exactly as pictured and stated. So soft! I would recommend this to my friends.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter after borrowing my sister in law's on a walk. We had been using the large and cumbersome stroller that came with our Chicco Keyfit 30 travel system and it takes up so much space in the trunk of our car it's insane (and we have a trunk big enough to fit a 250lb 5'11 man in there semi comfortably!). So after using my sister in law's almost 3 year old snap n go stroller I decided I needed one... NOW!This thing has been great. I can leave it in the trunk of my car, and just use the big stroller for walks at home around the community. I love that the cup holder tray has a compartment for my keys or cell phone. you can open the stroller single handed as you're pulling it out of the trunk and it will lock into place on it's own.There are a few things I wish were part of the stroller, like the snap in feature that the bigger stroller has instead of the strap to attach the car seat to the frame. This would be a huge thing, as when you're unfolding the stroller you have to mind that the straps do not get stuck in the hinge areas and make it difficult to strap baby in. I also wish that the basket on the bottom was turned around. It's kind of silly to either have to lift the car seat up to access the basket, or go to the front of the stroller. A little bit more thought should have gone into that part of it.Overall I am really excited about this stroller. We will be making a trip from TX to CA in the coming months, and this will make traveling through the airport and around town much easier.UPDATE: 10/01/12 - We had to make a trip to CA early for the funeral of my mother in law, and this stroller was so easy to travel with, and go through security with at the airport. It folded easy for screening, and gate checking. It was much easier manuvering the airport security lines and the crowded Dallas and San Francisco airports with this smaller stroller than it would have been with the bulky Chicco stroller we have.It also fit very well into the trunk of our rental car, and still allowed room for all of our luggage (3 large bags for 4 days for the 3 of us!) - I would recommend this stroller frame to anyone looking for something a little simpler than the standard stroller while their child is still in a car seat.	
- 1	The handle you have to turn in the top of the gym is hard, and when you finally turned it, it pops strongly.It is also hard to fold (once it's collapsed) I have never being able to fold it like in the picture.I've to say that it looks just like the one in the picture, tho. (color and design wise)Mirror is cheap quality, can't really see anything.I bought it because I needed one I could carry away from home to the grandparents house and it's good for that purpose. But it should definitely be cheaper.It's not too big, so my 7 months old will get off the mat in a second.	
1. 	From the time our baby was born, we haveplaced him in this bouncy seat. The vibratingmotion was soothing when he was a newborn.  He lovedthe aquarium bar and the noises/music it made.At first he would just watch it but eventually he wantedto put his face up against it.We have not used the seat since he was 8 or 9 months oldbecause once he became mobile he could not sit in itwithout going off the sides(because he wanted to stand) or becoming upset that he was strapped in. I highly recommend this seatfor the first 6 to 7 months, but watch your baby closely so that he/she does not fall off the sides or backwards as baby grows.Great soothing chair esp. if baby becomes colicky for long or short period of time.	
1. 	I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4.5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag.  I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK.  A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the basket. I wouldn't even call it that but it's there.  I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back. This is definitely the best and prettiest umbrella stroller I've had after three daughters so I'm going to enjoy it.	
1. 	These do the job: they fit securely into outlets, meaning that little fingers won't be able to pull them out.	
- 1	I had a Sunshine Freedom and a Brtiax Boulevard Combo seat in our two cars.  The car that had the Boulevard had an accident which means they automatically replace the car seat.  It wasn't a large accident rear ended on the freeway with maybe delta of 10mph.  Child was great, seat had no visible damage, but the law is replace it. I loved the Boulevard, and would recommend that seat fully.So, I thought since he is 4, I would upgrade to this seat.  And it looks real good.  It installs with the click mechanism pretty easily and gets real snug.  Using the latch not so easy, using the seat belt is the way to go.The big problem is that it is extra wide. We have a BMW X3, not a small car, and this car seat takes up 1 and 1/2 seats in the back!  I am not convinced that the significant extra width adds that much protection.  In fact, the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety), that does the crash and safety tests each year, does not give it a Best Bet classification (the Parkway does but not the Pinnacle/Frontier) and other brands get the Best Bet, so in it's category it isn't testing well.  And if it is very hard protection, not much padding, the foam is as hard as the plastic.  But you can not use the fold down middle, you cannot put three people in the back seat with this seat there.  Luckily, it does fit over the bucket back seat in our Mini Cooper, you can't fit 3 people there anyway since they are bucket seats.In addition, we had an accident in it and it got wet.  Cleaning this thing is insanely hard.  Getting the pads off was hard and very complicated and a lot of the side protection panels fall out when you do.  Then trying to wash the seat out is impossible, the base is a solid assembly, you can't get in, so all you can do is  spray it and douse it with a hose.  And then dry it somewhere warm so you don't get any mildew.  Getting it back together was a challenge as well.Lastly, it isn't really a booster seat, you just put the car in and the seat belt around the child and the seat!  That means in an accident my child is going to be squished completely, let alone dragging this extremely heavy seat between cars.  You'll latch the seat in and use the buckles until you are done using the seat.Pros: safeeasy to install (with seatbelt, not with latch)confirmation you've installed it tightly (click!)Pretty seat, kid liked sitting in itCons: Bulky, this is the widest car seat I have seen by far and the heaviest.  I thought my old Sunshine Kid seat was heavy, this is significantly heavier!Very hard  to clean & remove cover	
- 1	The base of the handle is very chunky, making it hard for little hands to wrap around.  It also is VERY heavy for little hands to hold onto.  If you want to use a mesh feeder, you will end up being the one holding onto it if you choose this one.  I like the quality of the mesh part, however.	
- 1	I hate stuffing these. Seriously, save your money for better quality, made is USA diapers. And I'm now ashamed I own alva diapers. The one print is copied from bumgenius, Lovelace pattern. Companies like this should not be supported and be put out of business.	
- 1	First time mom who is over protective. Baby liked the colors and animals (we bought the animal friends one). However, this thing is HEAVY & I couldn't stand the thought that the moment I walk away it could fall & hit my poor daughter right in the face! Sure it can be tightened, but I don't think enough to have it be safe!If they can make this lighter I would whole heartedly recommend.	
1. 	If your child wants to get into the toilet, this lid will not stop him. For us, it is a deterrent. He tries a couple times and moves on to other things. But the few times he reeeeally wants into the toilet... he just pushed the thing to the back of the toilet and can apply enough pressure to force the latch open. It's pretty weak and won't save your phone from taking a swim if your kid is really motivated. My 14 month old seems to ignore the toilet a lot more now so I gave it 4 stars instead of 2 since it is at least working mostly.	
- 1	I registered for this thinking I'd use it for nursing. Well, I've been nursing for almost a month now, and I've found this pillow to be a bigger nuisance than helper. Here's why:1. The way it's shaped allows the baby to slip down towards your belly button. Rather than being flat towards your stomach, it angles downwards, allowing the baby no support. I end up holding her anyway.2. It doesn't stay on! No matter where I'm sitting: couch, rocker, chair, etc., it falls off! How annoying.3. I'm tall. I have to slouch over.4. Because of problem #1, I use a blanket to stuff in between the pillow and my belly. What a complete waste!It really should be shaped the like the pillows used in hospitals: flat the whole way. Totally a better design.	
- 1	We got this so that we could hear baby as she slept in her nursey and we worked elsewhere in the house, and becasue we have always had wonderful expereince with everything Sony makes.  This one, however, was a dud.  I could still hear baby without the monitor when the monitor was beeping because it didn't get signal.  I was really, really disappointed, especially since it was a shower gift I had registered for from someone who splurged to get it for us!	
- 1	This thermometer never worked for us, and we tried everything! The strip must have been a dud. Buyer beware. This was very disappointing to us.	
1. 	I was skeptical at first about 'babywearing', I tried it once as a joke with this sling that was given to me and fell in love. It was one of the only places besides the breast that my daughter would fall asleep consistently for the fist 4 months or so.  So I agree with other mothers who say that you have to give it a chance to grow on you. It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry. Hands free is the way to be!The sling I was given was a bit large for me, and I'm not a tiny person 5'3'' 135lbs. Although it was adjustable I think for my next child I'll try a sling that comes in sizes.	
1. 	I love this photo album since you can put the photo in front and on the side. Plus its simplicity makes it really nice. Will buy more of this!	
1. 	This product is well-made. It somehow manages to be both texturally soft, and yet sturdily firm. Cute too. It was a big hit at the baby shower.	
1. 	Even after reading a good amount of the posted reviews, I still wasn't quite sure which size to buy for our one-yr old boy (above average height- 78%). Then, following a reviewers suggestion, I searched it on Youtube. I saw even big five year olds zoomin around on the small with no qualms. I cant imagine our little one being able to reach the ground on the large. Very glad I got the small.  He loves it and the cow print is awesome. Great quality product and a perfect first birthday present! See our posted picture above. Black onesie, blonde hair, cow.	
1. 	Excatly what I needed. plenty of spares for my pump. I pump a lot and these membranes wear out pretty fast due to heavy use and abuse :)  Cheaper to get them in bulk so I always have spares on hand. These should last me.	
- 1	My daughter does not like these cups, so I don't like them.  It's too hard on her mouth and too hard to get any liquid out. They also don't click when screwing the lid on, unless you're extremely muscly.  She is 15 months old, who knows, maybe she will use them when she is older.  She did much better with the NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, 10-Ounce, when going from bottle to cup.	
- 1	I've only used this a few times because they constantly leaked.  Also she outgrew them really quickly.  The blueberry simplex newborn size is better-- more expensive but you'll use them longer, they seem much comfier, and no leaks.	
- 1	Dont like the fact that when baby pulls on the mirror or butterfly or handle the whole thing comes on her face. Then its too close she cant see and she starts crying... If i put it farther out so it doesn't fall on her face, its too far and she cant reach..	
1. 	We use this for our 22 month old and it is perfect. We were able to ditch the big heavy high chair and we just use this now. This is super easy to clean and it's very portable too. I like that it can be used as both a booster for the table or with the tray. The fact that it has adjustable height settings is also very nice.	
1. 	These are great little bibs.  Cute colors and very absorbent.  The velcro on the back is a bit scratchy and I wish it were snaps instead, but other than that I really like them.	
1. 	Other users have lamented over the size of this product, but it really needs to be large in  order to fit the power strip and all the plugs.  It gives me peace of mind.	
1. 	I really like Avent pads. After the wash they keep their shape (love the free mesh bag too!), there is no lint attached to the nipple like in some different brands and they stay in place due to the lace cover on the bra side. Also they absorb leakage well and the milk doesn't go through, unless pretty heavy one. I wear them with my bras and nursing tops and no one can tell I wear the pads.Only at night I have to adjust them due to laying on the side, but not a biggie. I wear them more often than disposable ones (I use Lansinoh and like them too, but they tend to roll when I fold my bra to breastfeed and adjusting is annoying because of the glue side).	
1. 	Everyone knows how the diaper pail smells when the baby is eating all solids.... These bags help a lot woth that. I just use the bag on each pooped diaper. I used to use small trash bags - but they took up a lot of space in the diaper champ and it would fill up ahead of time.	
1. 	A friend bought me this pillow as a gift during my first pregnancy.  I am now 5.5 months through my second pregnancy, and I consider it an absolute necessity.  I don't think I would have bought it for myself because it seemed like too much money to spend on such a specialized pillow that is huge and a pain to store.  BUT--I am now convinced that it is essential for sleeping during pregnancy!  It is so much more comfortable than any arrangement of other pillows, and well worth the price.  I credit this pillow for helping me get more sleep during both of my pregnancies.  My husband even likes it--he uses it when I am out of town!It is quite big and bulky--like another body in the bed.  There is no good way to make the bed with this pillow in it, so we've just given up on trying to make the bed look normal with this pillow in it.  It either gets moved to the floor when the bed is made, or we pull the covers up over it and it looks like someone is still sleeping in the bed.  Oh well - It is well worth it for the 6-9 months of pregnancy that it helps me sleep!	
- 1	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.	
1. 	but was FILLED with tiny lint pills after the initial pre-wash! other that that (which is fixable once i get around to de-linting them) I am overall happy with them... nice and soft for wiping her face and keeps her dry when the drool is overflowing. Nice colors for matching to most of her outfits and some gender neutral colors which I appreciate.	
1. 	These bibs are machine washable/easy to clean and hold up over time. They work for my 9 month old and 3 year old.	
1. 	We like this munchkin brand dispenser rather that the bargain one we got at the supermarket. It has a solid click to it when you shift from one serving slot to the next. With the generic brand we would sometimes over serve because the slot would be open in another tray. Great buy!	
1. 	This bag is perfect for my two-month old baby's daily feeding at day care.  I put my pumped breast milk bottles in there (6 five ounce-bottles) and the cooling gel on top or in between the bottles.  I can also add two or three more bottles if I lay them on top. I looked everywhere for something practical, given that I also have a toddler at daycare, for whom I tried different types of bags that would smell as soon as milk would get in the bag...  I would recommend it.  The strap is long enough that I can carry this bag, the toddler's milk bag, the two diapers bags, etc.	
- 1	Did not fit on my crib (orbelle sleigh style). Bumpers come in 4 pieces, one for each side of the crib. The instructions said to use only 2 of the bumpers if they didn't fit right. I didn't really like the idea of spending all this money on bumpers and only being able to use half of them. If the ties were a bit longer they would've fit on the crib. Returned.	
- 1	This diaper leaks every time I put it on our daughter!The inside is soft, it has the snap for umbilical cord stump ( which is great) but it doesn't hold up.My girl is tiny and petite one month old, and this diaper is very lose around her legs and also bulky compared to the other diapers I have.	
- 1	I bought this item at Amazon because it included the bottle brush and formula dispenser, however when I got it, the box contained neither of those items. It did contain a pacifier. This is considered false advertising. Also, the box was shipped on a yellow envelope, and arrived very damaged (the box was a gift....no time to return it for baby shower). Very not happy (and I paid for shipping!)	
- 1	I had high hopes for this product - it's super easy to swaddle the baby in this product compared to other swaddle blankets, but my son (at 6.5 pounds) was able to get his arm out of the top every time.	
1. 	Compared to the fuzzibunz wipes I have these are very thin; when wet they are very similar to disposable wipes. They clean well and get the job done. My only concern is that the stitching around the edges seems to be coming undone a little, so we will see how they hold up in the long run. For the price you can't go wrong.	
1. 	I have used this bottle system with all my nieces and nephews and now that I'm a mom I use it to. When we pack the bag for the babysitter, we just put two bottles in the bag, with extra nipples, rings and liners. There is no need to carry a bunch of bottles, nor worry about washing/rinsing them out. The collapsible bag limits the amount of air that the baby sucks.The only thing about getting them from Amazon is you have to really not care what color you get. I ordered these the other day and I got pink ones - I have a baby boy. I'm not a color snob so I will be using them.	
- 1	So, maybe I am doing something wrong but these are terrible.  We have only had them about a week and I hate them. I was really excited about these because I like the idea of the organic cotton, but they have leaked every single time.  My son gets a slight rash with microfiber so I was hoping cotton would fix that.  I will say that has been the only good thing about these, no rash.  But they do not absorb at all. He is 20 months old and cannot even wear these for an hour without a leak.  In the mornings I change him at 8 right before we leave to take my daughter to school, by the time we get home at 9 he has already leaked through these diapers.  I much prefer my Flips and Thirsties AIOs.  I am going to try the organic cotton flip inserts instead of these.  And they take FOREVER to dry.  I find that it helps if you flip the top layer of cotton around the diaper, but even then they easily take an hour and a half in the dryer.  I tried to put them on the drying rack and 24 hours later they felt like they had just come out of the washer.  They also stain very easily, which isn't a huge deal to me since no one sees it but still not very pretty. Save your money.	
- 1	these leak al the time. i've had to double stuff them to prevent the leaks. my favorites are the bumgenius freetime with velcro fasteners.	
1. 	i couldn't make up my mind about which rearseat mirror to get, so i ordered a few at once to try.  this was the winner.  we have a jeep, with the rear facing carseat in the center of the backseat, this was the only mirror i could position off the back drivers side passenger headrest and get a good angle to the middle of the backseat where the carseat was.  the adjustability is great with it, a much better system than the others had, if they had one at all.minus 1 star because i think the mirror could be slightly larger, or slightly magnified.  my eyes aren't that bad off, but you have to look up for a good long second to focus and really get a good look at babies face	
- 1	I too am shocked at the excellent reviews this sheet has received. I purchased this sheet from a major department store on sale. I tried them on my daughters mattress and the sheets were roomy. Well that was on June 6,2011. I had this print and another cute dotted pink and brown sheet also from Carters. It was yesterday July 9th I went to put the sheets on her mattress and I saw that the corner was slit!  I washed these sheets on delicate cycle and the mattress is new with nothing that could have punctured them. I looked at the dotted sheets and you can see tiny holes forming where they too will rip on the corners.I am so surprised that since these sheets are a name brand that they performed in such a poor manner. I guess those who gave this product 5 stars got lucky with a better quality of material. I promptly returned these sheets for a refund. I actually have a crib sheet that is 16 years old from my first daughter that is still in excellent condition. Such a pretty sheet...but in my experience not worth the money.	
- 1	I thought the price was great for two and the designs are super cute.  But if I'd realized there was only one (image and description are misleading) I would've gotten something else.	
1. 	Yes, these things work. NO baby can get them off.  Thing is, if your outlets aren't 100% sturdy (i.e.. loose sockets), you adults will have a tough time too (because of how tightly they stick).  Your best bet is to alternate: use these in your baby's primary play area and choose a more user-friendly model for the places you plug in most. (The simple ones without the release buttons.)  This works for us.	
1. 	I love this diaper pail...you can use any trash bags...I like the variety that are colored and scented for a nice touch! It's so easy to use. I didn't have any problems with odors til my daughter got older than 12 months. Once she started eating more real foods, her diapers became much smellier. She's now 19 months and the Champ is still a Champ. We empty it a little more frequently now than we used to because of her smellier diapers, but I think it's a great product!	
- 1	We tested a bunch of different brands of cloth wipes, and these got the thumbs down for the following reason: the wipe is composed of two layers sewn together at the edges. When in use, the layers separate and smeared the poop. On the positive side, the edges are sewn together well and have not frayed or curled after lots and lots of washes. The winning wipe for us was Grovia cloth wipes.	
- 1	This is only good for starting up. But once I started pumping more this became impractical. I recommend Lansinoh bags instead.	
1. 	My son loved this swing. He preferred the cradle motion for the first 2 months, then preferred the front to back motion. He used it all the way up to his 5th month. He was captivated by the overhead lights and mobile. After he hit 5 months, he just didn't want to be confined.	
1. 	I LOVE THESE BAGS! I USE TO BUY THE ARM AND HAMMER BAG WHICH SMELL AMAZING BUT THEY ARE PRICEY. AFTER A WHILE, I REALIZED THAT I NEED MORE OF THESE BAGS. I FOUND THESE AND I'VE BEEN USING THEM EVER SINCE! THEY SMELL LIKE BABY POWDER. SCENT IS STRONG WHICH I THINK IS WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE. I LEAVE THE BOX OPEN IN BABY'S ROOM BUT DONT SMELL IT UNTIL I ACTUALLY OPEN THE BAG TO PUT IN THE DIRTY DIAPER! IT IS A REALLY GOOD AND NEEDED PRODUCT! PRICE IS GOOD BECAUSE ONE BOX LASTS A LONG TIME!	
- 1	I returned these as I just could not bear to see them on my crib. I'm sure they probably do their job, but they certainly didn't look nice. They were a lot bigger than I was anticipating. I ordered the natural fleece ones. Perhaps another color would have been nicer, but they were just so large. I ended up wrapping my baby's crib rails in satin ribbon instead. It looks much better and she doesn't seem to like biting it as much as the wood.	
- 1	I'll make this review to-the-point. Reasons to NOT waste your money on this:1. It is exremely big and bulky, bigger than the actual wipes from the package. It literally takes up 30% of my diaper bag.2. The red button pops off if you use to much pressure3. The wipes dry out very quicklyI use the travel wipes from Target - cost less than a dollar, more in the package, no need to transfer, more compact and they stay moist!	
1. 	The Mozart magic cube is an AWESOME toy for my busy little 15 month old boy.  It's one of the VERY few toys he will stop and play with.  He has always loved music from a young age.  He like to hit the various buttons and it is small enough for him to carry around.  It also can take lots of abuse.  My 4 year old daughter will play with it as well.  Really a classic must have for babies and toddlers.	
- 1	I ended up throwing these out.  The mesh is too stretchy and doesn't hold the items very tightly.  As a result, they move around during the wash cycle and don't get clean.	
1. 	My 10-month-old loves chewing on this thing.  I use the term chewing loosely since she doesn't actually have any teeth yet.  It is a good shape and fits easily along her gums.	
1. 	so these cups are great...they are a little hard to suck out of at first but they are find after they wear in.  there is no 3rd piece to them, no piece that makes them a sippy cup. it is just the cup and the lid and that is what I wanted. they are insulated and keep things a little cooler than the cups like this without the insulation. no sippy cup is perfect but I gave these a 5 because they are better than what I had and my 3 year old and 1 year old like them.	
- 1	I received this feeding set as a free item from Amazon during a promotion. I really don't have any use for it because my child doesn't attend school or daycare just yet but I have found that the smallest bowls do come in handy in my husband's lunch. After using them for over six months I did come to find that I preferred other storage sets, the lids on these do not go on easy and I wouldn't really trust them to not leak. I don't hate them but I also didn't waste any money buying them... and I don't really recommend that you do either, I'm sure there are better sets elsewhere for a similar price.	
1. 	We love this bedding for our son's room. The colors are wonderful and its just the right mixture of colors to make it cozy for a baby yet not too over the top for a boy.	
1. 	I have been using this for many months now and my 17 month old daughter still loves it.  We use a regular toothbrush for in the morning and then we use this finger one when its bath time.  She has always enjoyed brushing her teeth with the finger cleaner.  I think it feels really good on her gums and it gets her teeth clean too.  The toothpaste seems to taste good because she always looks forward to using it.  It has a really nice smell.  It is very convenient for bath time and I would recommend it to others.	
1. 	Both my boys, 3 and 2 love this cot. They sleep well on it overnight in hotel rooms. Best part is the cot fits perfectly between the wall and the bed in hotels, so there is no room for roll offs! Need to purchase another one!!	
1. 	I was hoping my 11mo would not pick up this plate but that was the first thing she did, and threw it on the ground :(That being said, the spoons are pretty much amazing. I can get a good amount of food on it and it easily goes into her mouth because the edges are thin.	
1. 	I like these for several reasons.  The low price for a large supply.  The opaque color that blends with outlet color.  The quality of the plastic is sturdy but still flexible.	
- 1	We actually tested these vs the Joey's hemp inserts. These ones absorbed 3 oz of water, the regular Joey's (single insert) absorbed ~5 oz of water (almost 6 oz), and the Joey's premium (a thin double insert) absorbed nearly 9(!!)oz of water. They're all nearly the same price and about the same size, so I wouldn't recommend these. I've been told before that organic cotton (they're all a cotton+hemp mix) is more absorbent than regular cotton, and now I believe it! :)	
1. 	it has a  plug to drain the water out its great for my fiance when she couldnt lift more then the babys weight and i wasnt home i love this little tub it comes in handy and its pink lol my daughter just loves baths and she loves this tub she just sits in and laughs and plays and shes only 4 months old:D	
1. 	I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)	
- 1	No way to turn then on/off therefore they all come &#34;activated.&#34; The package  was opened when i got mine so they all just fell out. I think they lost  potency by the time i got them as there wasn't much going on.	
- 1	My son loved this swing, it was the only thing that he would take a nap in. Then at about 4 months the motor died. This is very frustrating for us since I really don't want to call and get a new motor - I shouldn't have to. At $139, this thing should work, at least for one baby. I definitely won't be buying again if we have another.	
1. 	We have tried all types of swaddle blankets from simple folder it up yourself types, to swaddleme, to this.  This blanket does a particularly good job at straitjacketing our son so that he doesn't get that little bit of movement, which ultimately turns into pulling a Houdini.  As he got to around 3 months, he started to kick at the bottom and would catch the seam, and ultimately get his legs out and work the blanket up around his head.. so we don't use it anymore  I wish that seam wasn't there, because otherwise he would probably not escape without it.  Regardless, we got a lot of good use out of these blankets.	
1. 	Along with my bouncer, this swing has kept my son entertained for about 5 months!First of all, you have to know...*  The swing is quite large, and warrents a nice chunk of our den. I can say that it doesnt need a very open area (like the middle of the floor) so thats good.*  The mobile is timed, I wish that we could just push a button and it would go FOREVER until you pressed OFF. My baby does LOVE this part of the swing though.*  For an infant (until my son was about 2 months) the swing went a bit too fast for him, even on the slowest setting. We solved this by using heavy blankets that drag onto the floor.*  You will need a screwdrived to assemble it!*  The swing DOES fold, but this isnt a fold that means lug it around and bring to grandmas! I use the bouncer, and a simpler swing for that... because the O.W isnt built for travel.Now, this is why the swing gets 5 stars...*  My baby LOVES it. If hes a bit fussy, sometimes the saucer doesnt soothe him... The ocean wonders does! He still fits, and the seat is very comfortable. It also got him onto a napping schedual, and its a great place to put baby while you need to eat or something.*  The battery life is suprizingly good, considering most of the toys in the O.W set eat batteries like crazy. I change them every 2 months of constant use.*  The toys are intruiging, and never get old. Its also a great place to bottle feed the baby. The music has a few settings, but all of them are deal-able and quiet enough so I can hear the T.V.*  Other than the Jungle Plaid (not enough toys) and the Papasan (too much MONEY!) the Aquarium was the only swing that had the cradle motion as well as the old fashion swing motion. My boy has ALWAYS prefered cradle.All in all this product is fantastic, and is still saving our skins today! I have no idea what we will do when he outgrows it... do they make this swing in adult sizes?	
- 1	After much consideration I chose these baby food trays. I followed the manufacturers directions to care for the plastic and after reading the reviews I knew not to twist the trays as you would a regular ice cube tray. And that was fine, I did not mind as I liked the capacity & clean looking cubes it produced. The last time I took a tray out of my cabinet (empty at room temp), it slipped out of my hand and dropped to the floor and broke. For a plastic baby product, it not very durable. I would have given 5 stars until this happened.	
- 1	These really worked for my baby but I don't have a dishwasher and scrubbing out the inserts just about drove me insane. The little bottle cleaner thing that comes with them is useless as it doesn't reach all the way into the tubes. I'm assuming a dishwasher would clean these just fine but don't know for sure.I switched to the Playtex Ventaire and fell in love with them! I use a bottle warmer and haven't had any leaking although the condensation does collect in the bottom lid gap. I just cap the bottle, turn it upside down and tap on a kitchen towel to get it out. The parts are much easier to scrub clean, in fact I usually just soak everything in the sink with hot water, dish soap and a little white vinegar. So much easier.	
- 1	I had a Sunshine Freedom and a Brtiax Boulevard Combo seat in our two cars.  The car that had the Boulevard had an accident which means they automatically replace the car seat.  It wasn't a large accident rear ended on the freeway with maybe delta of 10mph.  Child was great, seat had no visible damage, but the law is replace it. I loved the Boulevard, and would recommend that seat fully.So, I thought since he is 4, I would upgrade to this seat.  And it looks real good.  It installs with the click mechanism pretty easily and gets real snug.  Using the latch not so easy, using the seat belt is the way to go.The big problem is that it is extra wide. We have a BMW X3, not a small car, and this car seat takes up 1 and 1/2 seats in the back!  I am not convinced that the significant extra width adds that much protection.  In fact, the IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety), that does the crash and safety tests each year, does not give it a Best Bet classification (the Parkway does but not the Pinnacle/Frontier) and other brands get the Best Bet, so in it's category it isn't testing well.  And if it is very hard protection, not much padding, the foam is as hard as the plastic.  But you can not use the fold down middle, you cannot put three people in the back seat with this seat there.  Luckily, it does fit over the bucket back seat in our Mini Cooper, you can't fit 3 people there anyway since they are bucket seats.In addition, we had an accident in it and it got wet.  Cleaning this thing is insanely hard.  Getting the pads off was hard and very complicated and a lot of the side protection panels fall out when you do.  Then trying to wash the seat out is impossible, the base is a solid assembly, you can't get in, so all you can do is  spray it and douse it with a hose.  And then dry it somewhere warm so you don't get any mildew.  Getting it back together was a challenge as well.Lastly, it isn't really a booster seat, you just put the car in and the seat belt around the child and the seat!  That means in an accident my child is going to be squished completely, let alone dragging this extremely heavy seat between cars.  You'll latch the seat in and use the buckles until you are done using the seat.Pros: safeeasy to install (with seatbelt, not with latch)confirmation you've installed it tightly (click!)Pretty seat, kid liked sitting in itCons: Bulky, this is the widest car seat I have seen by far and the heaviest.  I thought my old Sunshine Kid seat was heavy, this is significantly heavier!Very hard  to clean & remove cover	
- 1	Nobody wanted to love this product more than I did. I love the bright colors and thought it would be interesting to my son. Unfortunately, this mobile is just too darn noisy. I have to turn the volume on high to drown out the sound of the motor.  I had read reviews saying the motor was noisy, but I thought surely it couldn't be THAT bad. I was wrong, it's terrible. The motor noise isn't the only loud part. There are these sliding wafers attached to each arm of the mobile and as it turns, you hear the constant slide and clink of the little disc. I have no idea why this was even added onto the mobile as it doesn't stand out and isn't very noticable other than the noise it makes.  Lastly, my 6 month old was only interested in this mobile for 2 days.  I waited to install the mobile until he was a little older... I am unsure if that was a mistake or not.  I wonder if a newborn would even be able to sleep with the noise?	
- 1	We bought a variety of cloth diapers to use with our newborn. We are not new to cloth diapering as we diapered our oldest in cloth until she potty trained. We used the one size Fuzzibunz for my oldest without any problems. However, we didn't start until she was 10 weeks. We bought this diaper to try and did not like it. The insert was difficult to get in. It leaked almost every time we used it. And my daughter seemed to outgrow it by one month old at 10 lbs. It was, however, soft. I would not purchase this again for a newborn.	
1. 	Son liked is and the price was right	
- 1	I must admit, this is the first potty seat that my son can sit on where the pee doesn't fly over the top the seat.  I was really happy with the seat up until I picked it up...The seat, unfortunately, catches all the pee on the underside, causing the toilet seat to be pee covered, the potty seat underside to be pee covered, and the seat to leak out pee once you pick the thing up.  While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat.In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though...UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet!  Just because of that, I would actually raise it a star for use, but it's a DIY star.  If you're willing to go that extra mile, this seat works great.	
1. 	We purchased this bottle warmer for travel use. We have the full sized Dr. Brown bottle warmer but it's too big to carry along on short trips and vacations.PROS:Inexpensive but not cheap. It's hard to find a functional bottle warmer in this price.Sized perfectly for travel. Great to use in hotels and or if you'll be staying with relatives.It will accommodate wide neck bottles. We had no problem warming Dr. Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and Similac's odd shaped bottles.Heats up fast. Average warming time for an 8 oz bottle with 5 oz formula is around 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes depending if it's room temperature or chilled.CONS:Outside of bottles gets really hot to touch. Be careful in lifting your bottles with your bare hands.No built in water reservoir. Water has to be measured and poured with every use.Warmer needs a cool down period of at least 10 minutes with every use. It is not designed to warm multiple bottles.	
- 1	It looks cool, it feels cool, but your child won't be able to drink from it. Greatly disappointed with this purchase.	
1. 	We did a lot of research when shopping for a stroller.  I knew that I did not want a big bulky travel system.  I thought I was going to register for the snap and go frmae, but when I tested it out in the store with a graco snugride car seat it seemed loose, not really very secure.  We tried the snugrider car seat frame and it was awesome.The only 2 drawbacks I have found is the only canopy you have is on the carseat itself. With the travel systems you can pull the carseat's canopy up and the stroller's canopy up shielding your baby from the sun.  Also I wish that it folded more square.  It folds flat, but takes up a lot of room in your trunk.  It has a large mesh storage area, but it you load it like I do it's sometimes hard to get to your stuff witht he carseat on top.Is great for getting through narrow aisles when shopping.  Overall a great product.  If had to buy again i would compare to the new Graco Mosaic stroller.  I think it's probably a better but as you don't have to get a second stroller for when they outgrow their infant carseat.	
- 1	Not magical for us. Helped the first couple of nights we used it, but after that our son started sleeping WORSE, waking up 9-10 a night. We kept at it for a week and then stopped using it when we were travelling--when we didn't use it our son just rolled to his side and went to sleep. Turns out that's all he wanted!  i give it two stars b/c i'm sure the product does what it is supposed to, but it didn't help us at all.	
1. 	I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this monitor!!  It really picks up the tiniest sounds - as I sit here writing this, I have the monitor volume turned down to half-strength, and I can hear the clock ticking in the nursery (which is on the opposite side of the room from the receiver and is not that loud in person).  The range is awesome - I was able to walk across the street and sit inside my neighbor's house, and I still had half the bars on signal strength and could still hear the clock clearly.The lights are really convenient because if I am watching a movie and have the monitor turned down (to avoid hearing the ticking clock) I can have a clear visual on whether my daughter is making noise in her nursery.  The lights are as sensitive as the sound, but are not too harsh that they light up a whole room at night.The battery life is great, and it beeps when the battery gets low to remind you to plug it in.The only problem I have had with it is that if you have the monitor in your hand and you walk too close to the receiver, it makes a terrible noise (due to interference of the signal) - but since there are 2 receivers, and the volume and sensitivity are so incredible, it is easy to avoid.  We keep one upstairs and one downstairs and it works perfect.  I would recommend this to ANY new mom - there is no need for a video monitor (you'll never watch it, or you'll spend WAAAAY too much time watching it) - this gives you the visual you want with the lights, and the sensitivity that you need to make sure your baby is safe and sound.	
- 1	I purchased this as Amazon recommended it to buy together with Dream On Me 3 extra firm mattress which I also purchased. It literally just fit the mattress after one wash per its washing instructions. I would look for other sheets.	
1. 	A set came with my original pump but they melted a bit during sterilization so I ordered new when I had my second baby.  I pumped A LOT (make or buy yourself a hands free pumping bra, Mums!) FT working Mom and second baby had reflux and didn't nurse well.  One lesson I learned is that you buy the shields for your nipple size, not your breast size.  I bought larger shields thinking I would need them being well endowed, but they were painful.  Turns out big boobs don't mean big nipples and the standard shields were prefect for me.  The soft plastic in this set provides extra comfort that the solid shields do not.  I used both, but these were better.	
- 1	I have been using this stroller for a year as a full time nanny/baby planner, and I have never liked it. Here's why:- Short handles: I'm 5' 7 and I hate hunching over this thing.- Short seat: He was too tall for this stroller before turning two! And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it. That's pathetic for a stroller- Skinny seat: no winter coats here - especially after baby turns one.- Small, practically inaccessible basket: hard to get to, and holds very littleI could go on...	
1. 	I have several baby carriers and I prefer my Mobi wrap and my Infantino Flip because I feel they are more secure, but this one is great for the hip carry.  My daughter jerks back a lot though, so I still always have one hand on her at all times.  I like it to carry her around when she's cranky and I don't need both hands to do something.  It's great for going for a walk, but not when you need both hands for something else like pushing a stroller or carrying groceries.  If your baby doesn't jerk back, then it's great!	
- 1	Since my son finally started doing #2 on the potty and potty training is going really well, I decided it was time to ditch the pull-ups and move to cotton training pants with a cover.  After reading reviews on covers I decided to order these because of all the great reviews.  Since everyone said they ran big I ordered 2 packs of the large (26-31 pounds) for my 34 pound, 38 toddler.  We had our first accident (using these covers over the gerber training pants)today and urine rolled all down his legs within seconds.  He may as well have worn nothing over the training pants.  I had purchased BRU vinyl covers to use until these arrived and they did not leak at all when he had accidents.  The unopened pack of these is going back.	
- 1	Too small, didn't work on any of our cabinets.  I returned them and replaced with better universal locks from Buy Buy Baby.	
1. 	I have used Avent nipples for all 3 of my kids.  They are a great product at a great price on Amazon especially if you can get the free shipping!	
1. 	I bought these for my milk storage bottles. they work great instead of the ones with the cap under the ring.	
- 1	I didn't use it for several weeks after I bought it so I can no longer return it. It either burns/ dries the wipes or doesn't heat them enough. Really bad product.	
- 1	When I first recieved it, it looked really pretty and thick, but after a few washes it started to tear. I wouldn't recommend it.	
1. 	My 8 month old isn't too impressed with it.  It is nice and well made but just not for my kiddo.Personally I like the different instruments that play the songs.  Hopefully when he gets older he will appreciate it more.	
- 1	We liked the projector but the music always stopped in the middle of a song, had a long pause (5 seconds or so), and then switched to another song. My baby would start falling asleep and then become alert again as the music changed, again and again. We returned this item.	
1. 	I'm very happy with the stroller. It seems to be well-made and sturdy, folds quite compactly and steers well. The colors are fun and bright.	
1. 	Superb!  It's a must have.  She is able to play independently and you don't have to worry.	
- 1	I bought this monitor with the thinking that if it was made by Motorola, the picture would be great. I was completely unimpressed. The picture was incredible grainy and disjointed. I returned it the next day. Ended up buying the Summer Complete Coverage Day and Night. More expensive, but well worth the money. The picture is so clear that I can see my baby breathing on both the flat screen and handheld. Go that route!	
- 1	These are too expensive for what you get. I got two bottles for almost that same price at my local pharmacy. This is a rip off.	
1. 	I don't know what the old magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.	
1. 	fun toy	
1. 	We've had the frog on our bathtub wall now for a month.  I got the suction cups to use with the frog and so far it's held up no problem.  I did read the reviews about the thing falling unexpectedly so we don't load it up with the soap and shampoo, just bath toys.  It holds all our baby's toys for now although it probably won't for long as we add to the collection although the pod is much larger than I expected.  It holds a large toy boat and a bunch of ducks with lots of room to spare.  A bonus is that our baby finds it quite amusing to look at and he knows now that there are toys in it.  So much better than trying to keep the toys on the side of the tub.	
1. 	I bought this booster seat for when my grandson comes to visit and I could not be happier with this seat.  It's easy to adjust, easy to clean up, the food trays are just the right size for a toddler and it's easy to store.  The construction is solid but not heavy and you can use it in different ways.  The first time I used it was at dinner and the seat scooted right up to the table.  At breakfast, I used the tray and it was not too far back from the table and feeding him was easy.  I can't say enough good things about this seat and my son and his wife liked the chair so much that I gave them mine and I will be ordering another one for myself!	
1. 	We love this whole kit. It has everything. When my son takes night time baths we use the lavender soap and boy is he ready for bed when we get him out. The carry case is also a great. We take it on trips with us and we carry his basic shampoo that came with the kit, toys, towels, washcloths and such and there is still room for more!!! The lotion is great and very thick which helps keep babies skin ever so soft after bath time, and the moisturizing stick is fantastic for getting a dry patch here and there. We keep it in the diaper bag. Great set for any parent, a must have for first time parents.update: my son is now 9.5 mths old and we have yet to even finish  our second bottle of wash. Everything except the lotion and 1.5 bottles of baby wash we still have plenty of. This gift set is fantastic, talk about the gift that keeps giving. At this rate we will not need to buy shampoo/body wash until after his first birthday!!	
- 1	I bought this because it stated it was BPA free.  However, when I was ready to wash it before use, I saw it has a recycle symbol 7, often used for Polycarbonate which has proven to leach BPA into its contents.  I'm unsure if that is what it is made of, but most baby products are code 5 (PP) for polypropylene which is known to be BPA free.  I was just shocked to see this.  I won't use it.	
- 1	I did a lot of research on baby gates before settling on this one. I wanted a top of stair gate that I would not have to drill into our wood banisters with. We've only had the box open a few hours and I have several issues.1) Poor quality -  My husband installed it tonight and the velcro broke when he was trying to tighten it around the banister. Does not make me feel good about the safety of the product.2) Annoying to close - When I purchased I did not realize how the door mechanism works. You basically have to lift the door and lower some pegs into holes. I was hoping for something a little less labor intensive for closing. Because the banisters are not perfectly vertical (because they have round parts and square parts) you end up having to pull the top part back over (I assumed you'd be locking the width once it was set and not having to deal with it sliding back and forth when open). This spacing issue is illustrated slightly in their example photo - you can see when the gate is latched the vertical bar in the middle overlaps more on the bottom and there is a slightly larger gap at the top. Ours has an even more pronounced difference.3) Doesn't fit our setup - The leg on the bottom is pretty much useless for us. We have two wooden banisters which are mounted on top of a small wooden base. If you try to lengthen the foot by using the adjustments, it comes unscrewed before it contacts the floor.4) Door opens both ways - I thought doors for the top of stairs should not swing out over the stairs. This gate swings both ways!UPDATE: After several months of using the gate still drives us nuts. People that come in our home have a hard time closing it proper since you have to put the bottom part in and then pull the top part over. I've seen people close it with just the top pegs in (bottom parts not in) and also seen people close it without the top part fully latched. This really worries me as toddlers LOVE to shake gates. We've tried to no avail to make it an off-limits activity. I think that's a bit like putting candy in front of a child and telling them not to eat it. That said we haven't had any disasters. Our regular babysitter has told me on several occasions the gate drives her crazy too.I called the company about the broken velcro and they were very good about sending replacement pieces at no charge.	
1. 	This is the best gym out there!  It has plenty for them to play with, but it also has the several modes for the lights and sounds.  We looked at them all and decided this was the best...and best for the money!	
1. 	We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the Notes section to write some story, etc.  It also helps Dad see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!	
- 1	We bought this book for our 8 month old son. He loves interactive books, so we thought that this would be a great toy. Except it didn't do much. I think there was only one button to push. It did have different plastic textures, which was cute, I guess. But it wasn't worth the $10 we paid for it, so we returned it.	
1. 	a 4 because you don't really need 3 pieces for a tray, one works great, the dish washer safe part rarely gets in the dishwasher since I clean it after every meal and run the dishwasher every other day. Also I have seen trays slide along the side and lock anywhere on other models and this has 3 tabs on the sides to lock the tray on. Which is ok. It works.  I do like the size, fit , and that it sits on a chair so as she gets older it can be a booster seat.  I started using it for my daughter at 8 months, could have used it sooner, but at least wait until your child can sit on own to use it.	
- 1	I don't understand why not more people are complaining about this, but the volume on this monitor is really low! I've seen some other reviews that are saying the same thing, but it seems most people aren't bothered by it!? Maybe we did something wrong and should have placed the baby unit differently or done something differently on the parent unit - but I tried all kind of different constellations and locations and it didn't seem to make a difference. We were without a monitor for a while until we got this one and during that time we had to listen out for our baby when we were in the living room at night. That worked ok, but I preferred using a monitor just to make sure we'd hear him even if the tv or dishwasher was on. But when we turned this one on it make NO difference at all! The noise we heard on our own, by listen out for him across the hallway was pretty much as loud as what came out of the baby monitor! I'm sure the reception and other features are great and it seems like a good quality monitor - but all that seems pretty pointless if you still can't hear your baby! I returned it for a Graco monitor that didn't have as many good reviews - but I can hear my baby on it!	
- 1	I ordered this booster seat because of the 4.5 star rating, but it was a BIG MISTAKE!!!  This booster seat will tip over at the slightest turn, leaving your child unprotected.  There is no latch to secure it to the seat, and if the booster is unoccupied it can serve as a projectile in an accident.  I actually bought 2 of these, one for each car, but unfortunately it was a waste of money.  I ended up purchasing another brand to replace them.	
- 1	The potty looks cute in pictures, but it's way over the top! The size is ridiculously large. And the music is so loud that I almost jumped when I first tested it with a cup of water. I can't even imagine how scared a baby would get if the potty started blasting the music while the baby was sitting on the potty.	
1. 	Great! It has lights and bright colors which my daughter loves. You can also choose the mode so you can have it play for 20 minutes straight for younger babies or the playing one where the baby has to touch the toys and it will play music. Great music and nature sounds. My daughter gets to play and have great fun while mommy gets to get things done	
- 1	I was really excited when I heard about the product and ordered it straight away, but the result was disappointing. The nipplette just simply does not stay on even with the support of wearing a bra on top of it to prevent contact with cloth while moving around. The effect, of course, wasn't as described either.	
1. 	I bought this for my breast pump. I was surprised at how it actually foams and cleans as soon as you start wiping it down with the wipe. But I have to say I didn't want to leave it without rinsing it as I didn't know if it would leave any residue. But as an alternative to using, it's great at cleaning!	
- 1	There are two MAJOR negatives for me about this car seat.  First, as other users have stated, the handle does not move easily and is very loud and squeaky, which is just a nightmare when you have a sleeping baby.  Second, you can only adjust the straps one way by elongating the top straps, you cannot lengthen the piece that goes in between the baby's legs that the straps snap into.  This is a huge problem as your baby grows, especially if you use a bundle me (which EVERY mom I know uses in a cold climate) or if your baby is wearing any bulky clothing, or a cloth diaper.  My baby is 18 pounds and 27 inches at 5 months and my baby has already out-grown this car seat for this reason.  I would have loved to be able to have used it through the winter, so this is a huge disappointment and the main reason why I would never buy again!  One last note, the strap adjustment is under the baby's legs which is just awkward to try and blindly thumb around to get to after your baby is in the seat and you want to tighten up the straps!	
1. 	this was one of the first things we bought for our baby.  It is so cute. The stars are a great nightlight.  Only problem is the orange color is a little dull and hard to see, but it may just be his room.  I love this turtle, it's a wonderful nightlight.	
1. 	I searched far and wide for a booster for my two year old.  I thought that this looked like the best one, and the price was not too bad.  I was right!  My favorite thing about this booster is that it is very easy to clean! No nooks or crannys for food to get stuck in. It wipes clean very easily.I also like that it is low profile and not offensive looking.The seat does not slip off the chair and feels pretty sturdy.I think that this chair is the best value to price out there.  I just ordered a second for the grandparents' house!	
- 1	I don't like the look of the bear personally. My daughter doesn't use it either. The pacifier sits weird in the bear's hand.	
1. 	I really wanted to love the drop-in bottle system.  I purchased eight bottles, several boxes of liners, and two breast milk storage kits prior to the birth of my son thinking it would be so convenient to just pump breast milk into the liners and freeze them.  Unfortunately, mother nature didn't cooperate with my plans and I was unable to breastfeed.  I figured they would still be good bottles even if my son was formula fed because you don't have to scrub them and they should cut down on gas.  This was a good theory, but in practice I have found that I tend to wash these just as often and just as thoroughly as I would a traditional bottle, so it really doesn't save me any time.  Plus, to me, it seems almost messier to deal with disposing of the liner (especially if there is leftover formula) than if you just poured the extra down the sink from a traditional bottle.  I have found the liners to be costly and kind of a nuisance to keep up with (one more thing to remember when traveling with baby).  And now that my son is taking four ounces at a time, I have found that it is just about impossible to fit four ounces of water plus formula in this bottle without making a mess.  It also bugs me that I can't use these with my bottle warmer (they melt...oops!) and the nipples do not fit well in my dishwasher basket.  These are small things, but when you deal with them several times a day it can get annoying.What does my 5 week old son think of these bottles?  Well, this was the first nipple he was ever introduced to, and he seemed to like it at first.  But in the past two weeks he has been acting like he doesn't want to latch on to it as well.  He actually preferred the narrower, firmer nipple on the Similac nurser bottle.  With the Playtex drop-ins nursers he eats very slowly and seems to lose interest halfway through a feeding.  Also, I can't tell that they really prevent gas all that much.  He has a lot of trouble with spitting up.  For this reason we finally decided to switch bottles.  He now uses the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow bottles and is doing MUCH better....feedings are much easier and quicker and there is a lot less spit-up mess to deal with afterwards.I know every baby is different and I can see where these bottles would be great for a breast-fed baby.  Mom can pump directly into the liners and the nipples seem to be designed to mimic breastfeeding.  I will be saving my bottles, and hopefully I can breast-feed my next child so they will be used.  However, for my formula fed baby, they did not work as well as the Dr. Brown's.	
- 1	Tried to use it several times but my daughter hated it.  I could tell that she was not very comfortable.  It did not allow her to move her arms where she wanted to.  Also it is very small in size.  If she did like it,  it would not have lasted very long.	
1. 	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!	
1. 	The only thing that would make a safety gate 'stay' on our banisters, which have narrow wooden spindles. It is made as an extension to a tension gate though, so be warned, if your toddler is particularly rambunctious they can pull it down - so I would suggest not to use this at the top of the stairs; though it is each to their own.... Also make sure you buy two - one for the top and one for the bottom - buy four if you want to extend on both sides.	
- 1	This is our first experience with a crib soother.On a positive note, setup was extremely simple.  There's a strap that is fastened around the crib and a safety string of sorts that can be used as a backup (I think.)  It is important to note that the plastic buckle is very secure since it requires both hands to attach and remove.  No infant/toddler would be able to release the buckle.The soother has three different settings - a light show, music and nature sounds and movement.  The light show consists of the firefly's gently fading red, green, orange and red lights.  There are two musical settings, one nature sound setting and four different insect motions (2 bugs flapping their wings, an inchworm inching and a frog hopping.)  The light show and movements operate in conjunction with the music/soothing nature sounds.  However, the motion will not work independent of the other 2 features (sound/lights).There are two major drawbacks that I can see.  The first is the noise it makes while on the motion setting.  The noise really isn't soothing at all.  I would call it more of a cranking sound than anything.  We rarely use the setting.  Matter of fact, the only time we have used it is when our 3  year old adjusts the settings for her own entertainment.  Our baby, on the other hand, is a little startled by the noise.  The second drawback is that the soother requires 4 C batteries.  I haven't used it enough to see how long they last, but it's still a lot of battery power for the little you get from the machine.  My guess is it requires so much juice to crank the motors which move the fireflies around the night sky.Pros:Cute, whimsical designBrightly colored bugs that catch your child's attentionDifferent settings to allow for combinations of motion, lights and sound3 sound settings (low, medium and silent)Cons:Cost - too much for what you get, but it looks like many have gotten the hint and dropped their pricesBattery requirementsMotion setting makes noise that is not soothing at all, which means that it's really just a sound and lights machine.Less than desired music qualityOverall, I would say that we are disappointed with this product.  While the promise of creating a relaxing baby retreat sounds great, the product fell short of delivering on that promise.	
1. 	Gerber Fun Grips are my favorite, they are easy to clean and they really are spill proof.  I use this size for water and juice and the bigger ones for milk.	
- 1	I wished these would have worked for me, but instead I wound up completely frustrated and tossing them in the trash. They kept curling up and falling down! Maybe it was because I was trying to apply them to my windows over the summer, but I shouldn't have to wait until its cold out to get them to work.	
1. 	I used same play gym for my daughter 4 years ago. it worked great than. now with my son, my daughter wanted to get this playgym only. she didn like anything else she saw.	
- 1	The hammock was a waiste! Tried to use it, threw it out. The seat is not deep enough, my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water, when he's on the &quot;infant side&quot;, but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems. I don't know if that actually works, he's not big enough yet. The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks, we've tried both.I wish I knew which tub is better, so I could get it!	
- 1	Plain and simple...it just doesn't work.The apparently simple design of just 2 buttons on the front is misleading because you just can't get the thing to work right.  On top of that it insists on being cleaned, even immediately after a thorough cleaning.  Lastly and perhaps most importantly, my little one hated having it placed inside of her ear.Another BUST form Safety 1st.	
- 1	What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!	
- 1	We have a convertible crib that is barely a year old and this does not fit at all - the ties are way too short.  I already stupidly threw the package away and now I am stuck with an item I can't use.  I will add that it doesn't smell and seems of decent quality - but they should make the ties longer or add that they do not fit all cribs.	
- 1	You're better of adding a few more $$$ and getting a really good one, like Dr. Browns warmer, wich I should have done since I use that brand of bottles, etc. I made the mistake of buying this and one month later I had to get a Dr. Browns one, is like they say you get what you pay for, that's exactly what happens with this warmer wich is not consistent, forms a nasty build up very difficult to remove not even vinager and the beeping is so loud! no worth even try, I got this one cause I love a few things of this brand, the bottle cooler wich is amazing I must say, the drying rack, the containers for powder formula on the go, the wipes warmer I think the best one, etc. but with the bottle warmer they need to improve a lot. Other than that the pacifier sterilizer is pretty good idea.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of traditional Playtex sippy cups. They truly are the gold standard. They last forever, don't leak, and are cute as well. This new line that they came out with is just terrible. After 2 washings they leak all over the place. I don't know whether it's the new valves or the cup lids themselves, but they are completely useless. I'm stalking other sites to find the originals so I can stock up because these new ones are a disaster.	
1. 	this carrot gets lumpy after a while, but my baby really likes to chew on it.  it takes a long time to dry - at least 2 cycles in the dryer.	
1. 	I've used Halo sleep sacks since my son was a baby! Was so happy to find this 2T size!! It fits perfect. My son is an average size 2 year old. The only complaint I have is the foot holes. Sometimes both feet get stuck in one foot hole when he's going to bed and kicking around. I don't really see the need for them since the sleep sack is too bulky to wear around the house anyway so wish they'd make one with no foot holes this size. Other than that it works great and my son is happy in it.	
1. 	The membranes arrived slightly curled as if they'd been stored in a hot warehouse for quite sometime. I ran them under some pretty hot water and flattened them on a towel. No harm no fowl so far. Some of them do rip if I'm not careful pulling them off the yellow valve, but I think that's me trying to be quick (and thus too rough) more than anything. I make sure to have quite a few of these on hand at all times, just in case.	
1. 	My son loves the Woombie.  My daughter loved the Miracle Blanket.  As a parent that has now used two of the most popular baby swaddlers, here are some pros and cons of each.Woombie - We used the Houdini woombie in pool party and in vanilla crea (have one of each) and one Original Woombie in Raspberry color.Pros:Allows the hands to be across the chest or up near the face - this was the main reason my son hated the Miracle Blanket and loves the WoombieSnug - I haven't really noticed a difference between the Original and the Houdini versions although the Houdini is supposed to be a slightly firmer swaddle.  Both are snug.Nice colors - All the colors we have are nice.  None have faded or bled in the wash.Cons:The Big Baby and Mega Baby sizes are too long.  There is so much excess fabric that hangs down.  My two year old can still fit in the Mega Baby size, lengthwise, because it is sooo long.Does stretch out after many uses.  You can fix that by tossing in the washer and then tumble dry.  (It says line dry but who has time for that?  We've always tumbled dry with no problems.)Fingers can creep out the top and scratch the face.  He's never managed to get anything more than his fingers out, but just a warning that it can happen.**Biggest con - You have to keep buying bigger sizes if you want to continue to use it as they grow.  If you buy two in each size (so that you'll always have one handy if one is in the wash), then that's over one hundred dollars in swaddle blankets.  Yikes!!**Hard to use if you need to put baby someplace with straps - like a bouncy seat or swingTerrible return policy from Woombie - only unused and unwashed are accepted for returns with a 15% restocking fee!!The Miracle Blanket - We have two - one in pink and one in blue.  We used these with my daughter until she rolled over from back to front, at about eight/nine months old.Pros:Fits any size baby.  It's a super long wrap, so there's no way that your baby will ever be too big to fit width-wise.  Lengthwise our daughter outgrew it around four months.  Then we just stopped putting her feet in the pouch but keep wrapping her arms.  Still worked great!!  Also if you leave the feet out, it's easy to put the baby someplace with a three point harness like a bouncy seat or a swing.Can only purchase two and lasts until you need to stop swaddling!Colors are nice - never faded or bled in wash.**Best pro** - Miracle Blanket has amazing customer service.  One of ours got a hole in it after three months of use.  Miracle Blanket replaced it free of charge, not even charging for shipping the new blanket or return shipping.  Doesn't matter where you bought it - they will replace it for you and fix the old one and donate to kids in need.  AWESOME!Cons:Learning curve - Babysitters and grandma had an extremely hard time learning how to use this.  The first time, despite a demonstration before we left, our babysitter put it on our daughter upside down so that the foot pouch was like a little hood!The blanket has a weakness where the foot pouch is sewn onto the main piece.  After much use, it develops a hole from being pulled on by baby kicking or moving the feet in and out of the pouch.  Both our blankets developed one.  We had Miracle Blanket replace one, but decided to just keep going with the other one.  The hole never got bigger that the radius of a straw but it's definitely a weakness in the fabric.Hands are down by the side - This was what our daughter liked, but our son hated it, so I guess it could be a pro or a con.Overall, I would recommend either.  You just have to think about what your baby likes.  I think the Miracle Blanket is better for a baby who really needs a firm swaddle with very little movement.  The Woombie is for babies who like their hands up.  Our daughter, who required a firm swaddle, just couldn't handle the amount of movement the Woombie allowed.  She needed much more restriction.  Our son prefers the freedom to arrange his arms around his chest or thighs as he likes.  If you want to try one, start with the Miracle Blanket first since their return policy is better.  If Woombie would change theirs, I would equally recommend them.	
- 1	The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.	
1. 	We already had a Combi Activity Rocker, but the toys on the Combi are all manual (meaning there's nothing a little baby without developed motor skills can just kick back and watch.) My girl was extremely demanding & I needed something to entertain her while I read my email or brushed my teeth. (I used to sit in front of her & play with the toys on the Combi for her, just to keep her calm.) I was at my wits end & then I found the Aquarium bouncer. I'd read good reviews, but still wasn't sure because it just seems so flimsy  & insubstantial compared to the Combi. Frankly, for the cheapness of the frame, I thought it was over-priced. But hey, whatever works!We were at the store & she started fussing. We were near the bouncers, so I grabbed the display model, put it on the floor & plopped her in. (There were actually batteries in the display model!) Instant difference. It went home with us & I finally got a little free time.A this point, she's 5 months & doesn't spend much time in it (she prefers to be upright & moving) but I still plop her in it in the bathroom while I get the tub ready every night & she still loves the music & those silly fish.	
1. 	My son has enjoyed these stacking cups since age 6 months and still at 1 year they are one of his favorites! They are so simple but he loves them!	
- 1	I wouldn't call this much of a safety product. The plastic is very flimsy and the locking tabs aren't that hard to open. I would expect a better quality product from something marketed as a safety item. It's fine as a deterrent, but nothing I would waste money on again.	
1. 	This has lasted and held up well. I bought this in 2011 use it regularly in public and even at home when we're entertaining. I never have to worry about things showing that I don't want seen and even when the baby is pulling on it, the top stays in place. I love the neck feature that allows me to see the baby while eating. It washes well and still looks good aft all this usage. I'd buy this again	
1. 	I say best out of two because I had the Diaper Genie to begin with, and it was TERRIBLE. Not only was it bad at containing odor, but it broke after about six months, (it wouldn't twist OR cut), and I was going through refills like crazy. I don't know if the Champ I have is the 'new and improved' one, but it works great. I've never had any problems turning the handle, it's always moved fine for me. And as far as the wipes getting stuck, I've always wrapped the wipe inside the diaper before sealing the diaper, so I've never had that problem. Maybe the others who are having problems with that should try that. Also, they say you can use a trash bag, but I don't. I use the Genie refills, for a couple of reasons; for starters, the Genie refills are deodorized, which is great. Also, if you waited until the Champ filled up (using a trash bag) the whole house would stink by the time you emptied it, regardless of what it says about trapping the odors in. With the refills, you have to empty it about every four days, which turns out to be just right, because I can empty it before it starts to smell.  It takes a bit more work to use the refills, but it's worth it. You pull out as much as you think you'll need, then put a knot in the bottom and fit the top opening around the underside of the hole in the lid. It fits perfectly. And because you aren't twisting half the container away, it takes about three times as long to go through one of those than when you use them in the Diaper Genie. It's also sturdier than the Diaper Genie; it doesn't fall over every time my toddler plays with it. He loves to turn the handle - and if he can do it, then anyone can. Also, I'm using it on the size five diapers, which I don't have a problem fitting in.	
- 1	We got this product as a gift from a friend of mine and boy did we looked forward to get it because our little boy loves giraffes. He simply adores that animal so our friend thought that this will be perfect.When i saw it and when i saw the reviews i got very excited and i couldnt wait to see our baby`s face when we show it to him.But the thing is this ...We got it. And it looked perfect. So i put it in the washer and washed it as described. It said dry flat so i did that too. And the next day i laid it flat and put our little boy on it. He was sooo happy, he was simply smiling and biting the giraffe`s head.  For some reason i looked at his little face and i noticed little hairs. When i pinched a little from the furry part of the giraffes head, i got a finger full of fabric.Immediately i put it again in the washer. Washed it again and still the same thing. The fabric keeps coming out :-((Now im scared to put our little guy on it because i dont want him to end up swallowing any of it. He is at a stage where he licks and bites everything.I am wondering if i should write the company about this or not.I always get good products from amazon, i have bought so many items here and this time i feel cheated :-(Its a child product and i dont think that they should be exposed to something like this, at any age. No parents would want their kids to end up having a mouth full of fabric.Please if u have some advice on how to make it stop loosing fabric, im all ears. Our baby really likes it. I like it. Except for the fact of constantly releasing fabric :-(((	
1. 	I love this product. Great price and great for keeping the closet organized. It comes with a pack of stickers that continue on in sizes way past the toddler years. LOVE IT.	
1. 	This ice pack is designed for use with the Medela cooler, which holds four 5-ounce bottles. It keeps milk cold for at least 6 hours, a great help for the pumping mom on the go.	
- 1	This swing has some nice features. The music, the different swing positions, and the mobile. Unfortunately the swing is very loud sometimes. It sounds like it is working really hard. It wakes up my baby when it gets very loud. My husband is going to see if he can use a silicone lubricant to make it quieter.	
- 1	My husband purchased these locally, not on Amazon.They're great if you have a cabinet you want EVERYONE to be locked out of. Try cooking dinner and being in the thick of it, and not being able to access your cabinets because you as an adult can't get these POS's to work.Don't buy. There has to be something better than this.	
- 1	Got one as a gift and now have to return it.  It is not as universal as it states.  The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly.  It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller.	
1. 	Since my son started sitting in high chairs at restaurants, I've always worried about him eating off the dirty tables (or licking them).  So when I found this rubber placemat, I thought it was perfect for eating out.  It takes up very little space in the diaper bag since it rolls up into its catch tray, it's super easy to wipe clean, and it doubles as a protective guard so my baby doesn't hit his face against the edge of tables.  The suction is pretty decent, it sticks on most surfaces.  All in all, for how inexpensive it is, it is a great product!!	
1. 	Max is a HUGE hit in my house.  We have him on the carseat/stroller handle, and he is endless fun for the little one.  I put him on just before a plane trip and it kept his attention for so long.Note, the picture has him attached to a green snap - maybe to attach to clothing?  He doesn't come with that - just the yellow elastic loop.	
1. 	OK, so your baby is too old to be swaddled and now wont sleep through the night right? My husband and I had this same problem and I thought I would never get sleep again. We saw this and gave it a shot. Thank GOD for this. My daughter has been sleeping through the night since she was 6 weeks old and this helps!!! Your baby stays warm in this plus stays safe. Having the feet in the pouch lets her play with her feet, but they get bored really fast and go to sleep. The baby can still move around so you dont have to worry. I tell every mom I run into about this if they dont know about it. Really worth the money	
1. 	I really, really love this stroller. I can open and collapse it one handed, which any mom can appreciate. I feel comfortable with my daughter in the shoulder and lap belt, and the canopy is much better than the cheapo strollers at Toys R Us. The quality of the construction is great as well. I guess I don't see the big deal with the reclining feature, mostly because it doesn't recline very far and my daughter doesn't really like it, but every kid is different.This is a great lightweight umbrella stroller and my only complaint is such a minor issue it's barely worth the time, BUT... I'm average height and the handles can be a little awkward for long walks. If I walk close enough to hold them comfortably, I end up kicking the back wheels. If I keep my distance, I have to rest my palms on the pointed end. It is highly likely that I'm having difficulty transitioning from a bulky, traditional stroller to this model, and that you should ignore this complaint and just get the stroller anyway.	
- 1	I bought this toy for my teething 4 month old after reading so many wonderful reviews.  She loved the squeek and loved chewing on this flexible toy. I loved it for about two weeks. Then I noticed to my horror that it was peeling in many different places and pieces of it were coming off. Now my baby has no teeth as yet but this toy could not even hold up to her gumming.Unless you want your baby ingesting whatever that stuff is made from, don't buy it.	
1. 	I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.	
1. 	I LOVE bumbkins bibs.  They are super easy to clean.  They stay nice.  I can even throw them in the washing machine for a good washing.  I loved having 3 so I really wash down the one she was using and worry about her bib being wet for her next meal.  The elastic did come loose on one but I just stitched it back on.  The other 2 were fine.	
1. 	These Babybjorn bibs beat the pants off regular old flat bibs.  It isn't even close.  We keep one hung on the diaper/travel bag and one for home use.  Eating at home and at restaurants is now a much less messy affair.  Every parent should have one (or several) of these.	
1. 	This is an excellent and very affordable tub!  I ordered this for my 6 week old son and he loves it.  The sling makes it a comfortable experience for baby to relax in.  I love the colors and the little nook for the bath supplies to go into!	
1. 	This is an awesome item!  It helped my colicky baby sleep much better!  Now that she is over the colic, she still loves the swaddle me blankets.  It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket, because she can't squirm out of it.  She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.  She wakes up several times during the night without this, but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me, she sleeps 8 to 10 hours, and she is five months old!  It's a wonderful product and I don't know what we would do without it.	
- 1	Smells..okay.The scent seems short-lived. I don't smell it ever since I put it in the diaper pail lid. Eh. Would not repurchase.	
- 1	It took 2 of us to get my son in this carrier and if he was squirmy it didn't work at all. When we were successful he was very comfy and seemed to enjoy it. I much prefer my Moby wrap...I can carry him front, side, or back without any help or trouble.	
- 1	My kids still put toys in their mouths, and right out of the gate I felt that a few of the edges were a bit too roughly cut to be safe for small children.  It's also very easy to have small fingers pinched between the wood due to the elastic band holding the toy together.  It is attractive, though not very turtle-like in appearance.  Not much going on here, but not charming enough to fit the 'classic' toy formula either.  I can't recommend this for anything beyond a nice looking coaster.	
1. 	As a mother to a little Houdini, I tried just about every swaddle I could think of to keep my baby girl from hitting herself in the face while sleeping and waking up. This is, by far, the best I have found. We have been using this blanket for two weeks now, both for naps and at night, and the little one is finally starting to warm up to the idea of being swaddled. She typically falls asleep quickly and sleeps longer when wrapped in her miracle blanket. It has also been great for soothing her during the more fussy nighttime hours. The only downside is, if you have a little Houdini on your hands, handling him/her too much while swaddled can loosen the blanket just enough for those little arms to find their way out. Otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever!	
- 1	How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??!  This pillow reeks with fumes, I think from both the plastic packaging and the foam in the pillow itself.  Please do not buy this pillow for use near your baby.	
- 1	It worked for about a month - worked very well to. We loved it. Then the picture got all fuzzy.  We returned it to Safety first and they sent us the Prism.  We lvoed the prism till it got 'pin stripes' on the monitor.  Either we have the worlds worst luck with minotors or saftey first's quality is going down hill.	
1. 	If you're reading reviews on this product then stop and place the order. You will not regreat it. This is perfect. I haven't met a Kiddopotamus product that I don't like. Your babies skin will thank you for this product. It fits perfect on the Chicco travel stroller and stays on when you fold the stroller up. A MUST HAVE in my book!	
- 1	My 2.5 year old toddler had a peepee accident in the car.  The toddler was soaked, the pad was soaked, and the carseat was soaked through to the foam.  This was just another piece to wash.  Totally useless.  Its going back.	
1. 	So adorable and cute. The way it moves and is flexible is great for babies. I would recommend this. Baby enjoys it.	
- 1	I'm addicted to Amazon and I love reading reviews and subsequently buying a LOT of here. All I can say is that I should have listened to others about this product. I really wanted to love it. I have the Playtex insulated sippy cups and they've always been AMAZING. However, I liked the idea of being able to see how much was left in his cup with this OXO sippy. Ugh, I should have just stuck with what works.What I like:- It's clear and has measurements so I can see exactly how much is left.- It's pretty cool looking.What I hate:- The lid and the grooves where it screws on is really cheaply made. Does not feel sturdy at all and one time my 20 month old son dropped it and the ENTIRE lid came off. Milk everywhere.- The rubber stopper/flow regulator ALWAYS seems to fall off and into whatever he's drinking. Therefore, you have to go fishing for it and then clean up the mess it made leaking all out.I'm pretty lenient with most things and usually can make most things work. Unfortunately this is isn't one of them. This thing is just junk. Save your money and get something else.	
- 1	After having these covers in multiple colors now for a few months, the white middle is falling a part and there are little threats coming out of it. The color combination isn't very smart either since you don't want the white to stain.	
1. 	i love this seat!  i wish that it had a reclining mode, but i think that theres no way it would travel in such a handy little package if it did that!  i love how the straps wind up, the seat completely folds up, and the lid snaps on!  how cool is that!  it travels so nicely!  i definitely recommend this product!	
- 1	For Day 1:  We loved it!  My son would hear the song and rush to the potty to go.  It was a great reminder when we were out running errands.  I had put it on his upper arm so it would be out of the way, because it's kind of big.  So I know it didn't get wet.Day 2:  Nope, nothing. It will not make a sound.  There is nothing on the screen.  HUNK OF JUNK.  We're using a plain old kitchen timer now.Thank goodness Amazon's customer service is always AMAZING.  I returned it for a full refund.	
1. 	baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome. especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty. Ziplock is useful but not reuseable. It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots. This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.	
1. 	I bought this gate for the top of the stairs and for me its been money well spent.Its easy to install and quite sturdy.The auto close feature works well though it is a bit loud when it closes.The opening is a bit narrow but overall it is doing what it is supposed to.	
1. 	I purchased one for my twins.... I plan to purchase another. The size is great, it can hold a lot of toys. The pockets on the side actually can hold books well. The bag with handles inside is prefect. I actually have it out with all my kids blocks and it adds more space in the toy bin. I don't close the top, I have it bent back and so far if I try to close it it works fine (hasn't reshaped to being bent back). The little toy mat that folds down in the front is a nice feature. My twins don't actually us it to play but I have hardwood floors so it adds a little extra padding. The best part for me is safety. My twins know how to get in and out of this but never get hurt because it's not wood or hard plastic. They also run around a lot and I don't have to worry about them bumping into this and getting hurt. And last it is extremely easy to set up and down. Takes seconds. In my opinion if you were going on vacation it's prefect to bring since it folds flat.	
1. 	i bought these hoping to use them fairly soon but for the most part she just likes to carry the box around and take everything out of it and put it all back in! which is fine she's only 16 months old. They are very durable they have had juice and formula spilled on them and they didn't even peel away from the backing. the colors are good the pictures and words are very clear and when she gets older im sure these will be great for her!	
- 1	my 17 month old dtr loved this toy.. she would start giggle as she pressed the button in anticipation of the water hitting her face. However, the light is quite bright.. i would see spots after i stared into it so i was concerned about that for my dtr. But within 2 weeks of purchase, the toy broke. I thought the battery had died but when i went to replace the battery, water had leaked in despite the rubber seal. It was fun while it lasted but not one i would recommend.	
1. 	love it. has 3 different color modes. found same product in stores but at least no sales tax and shipped to home. very soft and cute. makes great nightlight. only bad thing is that it turns off after 15-30 minutes, would like it if it stayed on all night.	
- 1	I did not care for this because it  looked like a straight jacket for babies. When I put my baby in it she went ballistic until I unwrapped her. Back to the old fashion way.	
1. 	these are cheap but okay quality. Can't imagine how can it not fit on the back of any front seat, unless your front seat doesn't have an adjustable head rest such as a  racing car seat. There are many pockets, very useful for holding water bottle or other small items such as little toys to distract your kids while putting them in the car seat.	
1. 	Received two gingham sheets.  Nice understated pattern.  I'm happy with the quality.  They keep baby cool during the horribly long AZ summers.	
- 1	These are very small and very thin fabric. I was expecting something more substantial when I ordered them. Each is maybe 3&#34;x3&#34;	
- 1	This newer, cutesy version of the Playtex Nurser has a major design flaw - the ounce markings on the side of the rigid plastic shell holder are not horizontal LINES, which you expect for an accurate measure. Rather, the ounce gradations are marked by adorable but basically useless rounded leaves, bubbles, raindrops, etc. Where does the ounce mark truly begin? At the top of the icon? Bottom? Smack dab in the middle?? (Try eyeballing THAT at 3 AM!) Because baby is on a strictly liquid diet for at least the first 4 - 6 months, being able to obtain correct & exact measurements at feeding time is VERY important.I'm sticking with the less attractive but much more practical ORIGINAL Playtex Nurser. They are hard to find but worth it! They are also made of a much sturdier plastic than these flimsy bottles. My baby seems to be doing just fine with them and they're working well for us, though I'll probably switch to a non-liner bottle system once he passes the 3-month mark.	
1. 	I think this is my baby's favorite bottle nipple shape.Like many others, I was worried these bottles would leak but they don't! Hurray!I really wanted to try these to see if they'd cut down on burping. They don't appear to do so, at least not significantly, but my baby is not exclusively bottle-fed.Pros:- They don't leak!- They are super-easy to get very clean (quickly!) because the bottom comes off. This is great when I'm out and about without my bottle brush.- The shape of the bottle is easy for me to hold and for the baby too although the 9 oz size is very unwieldy for young babies.- DISHWASHER SAFE!Cons:- Water will get into the bottom cap if you warm your bottles in water (but once you realize that it's easy to shake it out).- Can't tell if the bottle cuts down on burping and gas.- I wish this set came with an extra vent disk and nipple like the multi-size set.	
1. 	Great crib, easy to put together, and very pretty. Our baby is not here yet so we haven't used the crib. For now, we like it!Sole issue: not all mattresses fit. We bought an oversize mattress and it fit with sheets and a breathable bumper -but without it the mattress moved a little bit and that freaked me out a bit (I had just taken a class of SIDS and the nurse told her that the mattress must absolutely fit snugly).So... Overall great crib but why the heck would the company not make this crib standard size??	
1. 	This booster is light and well built.  The unit is easy to clean, and my only real wish is that the center strap was adjustable in height. Other than that, my kid's happy, I'm happy.  I recommend it.	
1. 	You don't see that too often!  These are great stackers. We have a few varieties of them but these are our favorite. They are pretty sturdy.	
- 1	Pros: Out of the box, it does not off gas like the Baby Care play mat out. Also thicker than the Baby Care play mat.Cons: Punctures quite easily. Graphics not as cleanly printed as the Baby Care play mat.It is going back to Amazon and I will order another Baby Care play mat instead.	
1. 	This is a great potty chair.  We have a frog potty in our upstairs bathroom and my daughter complains that it hurts her bum.  This is her favorite and she says it is comfy.  It's the perfect size and easy to dump and clean after each use.	
- 1	I must admit, this is the first potty seat that my son can sit on where the pee doesn't fly over the top the seat.  I was really happy with the seat up until I picked it up...The seat, unfortunately, catches all the pee on the underside, causing the toilet seat to be pee covered, the potty seat underside to be pee covered, and the seat to leak out pee once you pick the thing up.  While I'm happy that the seat works - I hate it because I still need to clean things up when my kid gets off the seat.In comparison to the other seats I've purchased, this seat is the best because less pee gets on the floor - I might just have to try putting silicon around the base to keep it from filling with pee though...UPDATE:  I sealed all the edges of the seat with some silicon caulking (got it from Lowes for $3) and now the pee goes where it's supposed to go - into the toilet!  Just because of that, I would actually raise it a star for use, but it's a DIY star.  If you're willing to go that extra mile, this seat works great.	
1. 	Too cute! This is the second size of the same diaper cover we have purchased. Works great, lasts through a couple growth spurts, comfy on my little one, holds up well through washings. Highly recommend!	
1. 	We've tried a LOT of bibs - and Bumkin bibs are the best!  It is truly waterproof, yet it can be washed in the washer (yay!).  This one in particular is a favorite because the long sleeves and generous length are prefect for protecting long sleeve clothes (or nice dresses).  This also has a tie at the neck (instead of the velcro that the short sleeve version has) which ensures that it doesn't snag sweaters/dresses and if you tie a double know its a little more difficult for tots to take off mid-meal.  We have two for each child and love them!	
- 1	I got this because of all the great reviews but when I received it, I was very disappointed. It was very flimsy, not firm and felt like it would not last more than a month. Plus the plastic-y texture and smell was a big turnoff (even though you would cover it with a changing pad). I was surprised at the poor quality given the reviews but it is a good price. I returned it and got a naturepedic changing pad instead which was much more expensive ($99) but am glad I did - there is a world of difference but I guess it's always about getting what you pay for. The naturepedic one is FIRM, durable and very high quality. So if you are looking for a cheap throwaway pad, this could work but we were surprised at the poor quality - my fingers could touch when i squeezed it.	
- 1	So, first when I opened it I tried to remove the packaging strings and there was no way to remove them so I ended up cutting them (but a small piece was left inside the cube at 4 corners) ... The music choices are pretty annoying and I am not someone who gets annoyed by baby tunes. To change the tune you have to press twice on the orchestra side rather than only once, which I find annoying. Overall my LO doesn't seem too interested in it just yet.	
- 1	Out of the box I noticed that the gate couldn't latch closed.  Upon inspection, I noticed that one corner was not welded squarely making the shape of the gate malformed.This defect was immediately noticeable without our need to install the gate to identify the malfunction. This denotes poor quality control.We sent it back and bought a gate from another manufacturer.	
1. 	When sitting down to write my review I read some of the ones that had given the product low stars. I was amazed to hear of their problems. We have been very satisfied with these bottles and they are definitely the favorite of several different types that were received as gifts. They are very easy to hold when feeding our grandson and he does not experience any problems with gas. I like the way the bottle is put together into 5 different pieces because it makes it so easy to clean them properly. I would recommend them and be very comfortable giving them as a gift.	
1. 	I am a first time mom and have never used another bather for my two and a half month old.  It's easy to store, dries fast, and my baby seems very comfy in it.  It fits nicely in my sink and its mesh fabric allows water to flow through.  After reading other reviews, I want to try it in the bath with me and see how baby and I like it!	
1. 	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent.	
1. 	great toy, works well on place flights.  occupies child and keeps them happy.	
- 1	We had to buy this in a hurry because the product we had wanted (and ordered from Amazon) suddenly became unavailable.  What a poor choice!  The back panel is not even the right _size_, so there's a gaping hole in the back of the dresser.  Tells you a lot about the manufacturer's quality control.  The whole thing feels flimsy and cheap.  I'd be worried about putting a baby on top of it, it feels ready to fall apart at any minute.  My husband put a dent into this thing with his _nail_ -- exactly what is it made out of??  I wish I had known that it was made of this kind of cheap stuff, it certainly shouldn't be for the price of it.  Bottom line -- waste of money.	
- 1	I usually love baby einstein, but not this one.  My son just isn't interested in it (but yours might be).  The sound is very quiet and my son just doesn't pay much attention to it.	
1. 	I'm not sure why people waste their money on certain other pails, this one is perfect for me. For one, it takes any kind of bag, without you needing to buy special ones constantly. The lid doesn't snap down too loudly, and is very hard to open unless you use the pedal. It's small (office size), which means you will change it more, but who wants diapers hanging out for that long anyway? I recommend it because it's unobtrusive and won't waste your money requiring anything special.	
1. 	These plugs are easy to use and do the job.  The new fangled products look like a pain and are probably no more effective than these.  These are a good value for your money and you don't have to waste precious time figuring out how they work and how you are going to install them!!	
1. 	The sling is perfect for a newborn. Makes bath time easy. This tub also fits perfectly in our kitchen sink. Very happy so far!	
1. 	This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back.	
- 1	I returned these the second I got them because they were so much cheaper looking and feeling than the Organic version. I'm so glad I did because I can imagine that after a few washes they'd be all torn up. Plus the organic cotton was super soft while these felt a bit abrasive. Worth paying the extra money.	
- 1	Washed sheets only and stored in closet for use, found two holes when using sheet for first time.	
1. 	These are the best. So easy to clean. If they get wet it wont transfer to your baby's clothes. The pocket is good. Overall these are the best bibs!	
1. 	With our first kid, I've been glued to the computer trying to navigate and research all the crap you can buy. I really try to be a minimalist when it comes to parenting gadgetry, but after the first few attempts at non-bib feeding (and mostly subsequent cleaning...ughh) that rose to priority status. We came across these baby bjorns and decided to give them a try. I wouldn't exactly call them soft, they are more of a flexible plastic. Some friends of ourse have silicon bibs that are very malleable, but these definitely keep their shape.First of all, the tray is brilliant!! Catches the food and our kid gets a few more attempts to shovel it in before it inevitably falls to the floor. Cleanup has been significantly reduced and these are easy to wipe down or stick in a dishwasher I guess (though we've never had to do that).The neck strap is easy and secure and the bib doesn't move around when the kid's arms are flailing around so that's definitely a bonus. When we visit friends and family, or go out to eat, we get A LOT of comments and envious looks from other parents. They are a little more expensive, but really easy to use, reduce cleanup, easy and adjustable to wear, firm yet pliable for comfort and protection and effective at keeping food available for the baby.They really perform as I had expected and hoped, therefore 4 stars. I think I would prefer for them to be a little more soft and pliable, but so far they have been excellent.	
1. 	I use these with my Medela pump in style advanced with no issues whatsoever. I love them better then the bags, they are easier to store in my opinion, they don't leak, easy to thaw, easy to heat in a bottle warmer. They are the perfect 2 oz size for my newborn baby who takes between 2-4 oz per feeding. I have bought 2 boxes to keep me going for a while.	
1. 	I use this on my Maclaren Quest Sport.  Pros: you can fold it up with the stroller, and has extra storage for cell phone and maybe a diaper or two and travel wipes container.  Cons: didn't fit Avent bottles or larger sippy cups (we use Tommee Tippee), cup holders only fit pint sized waterbottles & other plastic bottles (like 20 oz soda for example)- and a definite NO to those paper take out cups(we learned the hard way) I bought a cheap cupholder seperately (Munchkin).  Overall, it is worth buying to save yourself some aggravation with the hard-to-access basket on the Maclaren stroller when seat is reclined.	
- 1	I got rid of the Diaper Genie II and bought the Diaper Dekor instead...we've been very happy with the Diaper Dekor and recommend that.- holds very few diapers -- must be changed every few days(Diaper Dekor holds at 5x as many diapers...and only needs to be changed weekly, every 8-9 days)- refill does not last very long...gets expensive(Diaper Dekor refill lasts forever -- like 2 months, I think! Way cheaper...)- what I hated most: I scratched up my hands every time I stuck a diaper in it...there is a plastic ring around the refill that sticks out...I honestly bled almost every time. It was awful.(Diaper Dekor has a step pedal, so hands never have to go inside.)- don't really have a problem with smell control with either of these, but our 6mo old is exclusively breastfed and of course, smells like roses :-)	
1. 	A friend of mine gave me this sling in the pattern Fern (Batik) and I used it right away. My baby loved it. I decided to purchase a second one in Indigo so that I can accessorize. It is so affordable compared to similar slings, but you are really getting a product of great quality. I feel confident putting my little one in it because the rings hold the fabric in place without slipping. This sling is as beautiful as it is functional. The shoulder padding is also really comfortable. The one drawback is that the instruction booklet is less than clear on how to properly do the cradle hold, and there isn't a decent picture of it, but the sling itself is wonderful. I ended up looking on youtube for videos on how to use a ring sling and never looked back.	
- 1	This is the 3rd type of carrier that I've bought - I was really happy with it until my daughter got to be over 10 lbs. She's 6 months old, 13 lbs. (which is really small for her age) and it gave me severe back pain to carry her less than 1 mile. The ErgoBaby is designed to spread the weight evenly and I'm now going to spend another fortune for the Ergo. Advice to all expecting parents: DO NOT get the Bjorn. Get a Moby or other wrap for the newborn and then get the Ergo.	
1. 	We got this carrier as a shower gift, and we really like it. I have to agree with the other reviews that it's a little tricky to get baby in and out - but you get what you paid for. We thought about buying the Baby Bjorn, but I think it's too expensive for a carrier that we won't use that much anyways. So we have the Cozy Rider and also the EuroRider(also by Infantino), that is much similar with the Baby Bjorn and have a much better system for getting baby in and out - we can do it without waking the baby, and cost half of the Bjorn.So if you plan on having the carrier for occasional use only, I recommend the Cozy Rider. I used it in supermarkets, the mall, and at home too, when my baby was fussy and wanted to cuddle all the time. It does start hurting your back after a while(30-40 minutes or so), but it didn't bother me that much. The EuroRider has more padding, which helps a lot, but cost twice as much as the CozyRider(we bought it gently used though!!)So, bottom line, this is a great carrier for its price - easy to adjust and our baby loves it. If you plan on hiking or wearing it for longer periods of time, you might want to look into a carrier with more padding(like the Euro Rider or Baby Bjorn). If not, this one will do just fine!!! I recomend it.	
- 1	I bought this pump because, as a stay-at-home mom, I expected to pump very little (just to relieve engorgement, etc).  Unfortunately, my daughter had difficulty transferring the milk from my breast, and in order for her to get enough milk, I had to pump and bottle-feed her eight times a day.  Since I already owned this pump (and didn't want to spend a ton on an electric pump), I tried to make this one work.  It lasted less than three days before the gasket that helps create the suction gave out.  I'm sure Medela would have replaced it (later experience with the company left me extremely impressed with their customer service), however I had come to the conclusion that manual pumping eight times a day was not going to work for me.  The muscles in my hand and forearm were exhausted from the work, and I found the suction created by this device (before the gasket gave out) hurt my nipples too much.  I was able to return the pump and bought a Medela Swing to replace it.  The Swing worked much better for me.  If you have to pump often, it is much more convenient to have the pump do the work itself, it is quicker than manually pumping (at least in my experience) and the adjustable suction on the Swing made it much more comfortable to use.  Overall, if you expect to need to pump more than once or twice a day, you may want to consider the investment in an electric pump.	
- 1	we thought these would be the best bottles. but they are leaky, no matter how hard you tighten them. we bought these from amazon and from toysrus. both leak. I even stopped shacking the bottles to mix the milk, and instead used a spoon. still did not help.My sister bought the same bottle design, also avent, from france. Those bottles were transparent ( do not have the honey colored hue of our bottles) and never leaked. She paid even less and they are BPA -free.	
- 1	This product is terrible. We bought it looking for a less-crazy, more modern-looking alternative to the noisy, pastel-printed alternatives. But there isn't really any part of this mobil that works. The cross bars are prone to breaking (we had to superglue them twice while setting it up). The cards are supposed to be interchangeable, but I spent 20 minutes trying to swap out a single card, only to give up and spend 20 minutes undoing what I did. Even if you leave the card alone, they don't really hang flat. And the attachment mechanism is worse than other mobiles that are in the same price range. Terrible!	
- 1	Mommy's Helper Car Seat price went up the day after it went into the queue. It still seemed like a good idea, until only one arrived for full price.  I should contact them to fix the problem.	
1. 	That's about the only complaint I have about this nightlight.  If not a remote control then at least the option to leave it on continuously.  Although my son is not yet old enough to learn about stars/constellations and the like, this nightlight definitely catches his interest and lights up the room enough so that I can tend to his needs if he wakes up during the night.	
- 1	I bought this because I liked the idea of the handles and I thought... well... we have two different shaped toilets in our home... it'll at least fit one.  Other reviewers mentioned that it worked on round toilets but it didn't fit any of our toilets.  Our oval toilets are new, and we also have one round toilet from the 80s that it doesn't fit on, either. Bummer.  We ended up buying the Prince Lionhart weePOD, Basix and it is such a better product!  It fits on both of our toilets, is easy to clean, lightweight, secure, and super cushy/comfortable.  My daughter loves to sit on it.Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey	
1. 	After reading the other reviews, I was apprehensive to spend $100 on something that wouldn't work properly. To my surprise, it exceeded my expectations. After moving our 4 month old from our room to hers to sleep in her crib, we found that the monitor had excellent range. Our room is on the opposite side of the house, across the kitchen and living room, and we were still able to get excellent sound and picture. THe picture is so clear you can see her chest rise and fall, and the sound is so good you can hear her shift in the night. I am not sure why some reviewers couldn't get reception 5 feet from their baby's room. Maybe they didn't know the monitor had 2 channels?I recommend this to anyone. I was nervous about being so far away all night, but this monitor gives me peace of mind. In addition, it is lightweight and portable. I take it to the bathroom while I get ready for work and to the computer room while I do work, to the kitchen while I cook, etc....A must have for new parents - well worth the money!!	
- 1	My unit has too little range. It only works about 40 feet from the camera. My daughter's room is about 60 feet from the living room and it doesn't work there anymore. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that our apartment building has some concrete walls in the way, but the product says it should work 900 feet so i guess i could expect to reach at least 100.-I cannot return it because i already threw the original packaging away but i would if i could.	
1. 	I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my let down and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.	
- 1	I bought this when I was shopping for my unborn baby. He is almost 10 months and I can honestly tell you that I tried to use this product, but it was unnecessary for me and my husband. The concept is great, to electronically time all of these various things (naps, feedings, diaper changes, etc), but it is not as efficient as it seems.Firstly, the battery life is not good. It just eats batteries, even when it is doing nothing. Secondly, even if your newborn has ate just an hour ago and has napped long before that time, it does not mean that your baby is not hungry. This concept applies to diaper changes, feedings, naps, etc.) The only real indicator is your baby... and believe me when I tell you that your newborn will find a way to tell you what he or she wants. Also, since you haven't recorded how long it has been that your baby last slept or how much your baby has last ate (particularly if you are using formula or bottled breast milk), this product really falls short.Honestly, I wanted to love this and use this like some other parents say they had, but it was one of those completely unnecessary purchases we made hoping to make life with a baby easier. This product was frustrating.Me and my husband found that it was easier and more efficient to simply use a notepad. We wear watches, so we just recorded the time of each activity (i.e. what time baby went to sleep and how long he slept , what time baby ate and how much he ate). This product doesn't have a log, so you couldn't possibly look back on the activity throughout the day or week and measure how much baby has been eating and sleeping. It is just a set of different timers.I would not buy this product again and I cannot recommend it to anyone. I think the standard notepad is the best option.Also, another option that I think would be great for this purpose is an iphone/ipod/ Smartphone APP called the Similac Smartmoms Baby Journal. It is completely free to download onto any device that reads APPS. It has all the same functions of this device but includes pictures as well as a chance to mark how full baby's diaper was at his last change. Also, it keeps a log of all these activities for a very long time and greats graphs to determine trends. Technology is so great these days. Go on similac.com/app to check it out. I only found out about this app when my son was already 6 months old and I don't really use it, but I think it would be great for new parents and especially better than the Itzbeen Baby Care Timer. Good Luck and Congrats to all you new parents!	
1. 	My baby has loved to nap in this seat ever since we came back from hospital.  She is very comfortable in it and the fabric is soft and cozy.  She likes the music, but the vibrations irritate her.  Now she is growing, and I can no longer put her in that seat when she is wide awake because he gets bored quickly. I had to get her a Tiny Love toy bar to keep her entertained in it. For the relatively high price, Fisher Price could have at least included a simple removable toy bar for the times when baby wants to play.	
- 1	Too soft and not tall enough. This should either be firmer or taller (thicker) because once it squishes down then it's basically worthless.	
1. 	This is a nifty little contraption but it took a bit to figure it out. After opening the white part, pull the green plunger out to add the meds. It only holds about 1 tsp of liquid.	
- 1	While this cushions the baby, the letters come out to easy and the connections warp over time.  It's a good mat if you need it as a cushion or maybe when my baby grows a bit older (now 18 month) and learns the alphabet, but not a good mat for feeding or snacking.  We don't feed him on it but he sometimes has snacks and drink on it and when he spills, it goes directly under to the carpet... :(	
- 1	I wanted containers to carry my pre-made food along. However, the lids will not stay on. I definitely do not recommend this product!	
1. 	My son needed sheeting options for his new toddler mattress and I am not into cars and trucks.  I prefer a a more modern aesthetic.  This print is fabulous and I love the deep pockets.  We have a thick organic mattress, so deep pockets are essential.  The sheet is soft and comfy, not as soft as luxurious Egyptian sheets but soft enough.So why 4 stars?  I finally made it out to Target this week (hard to do with two toddlers) and this exact same sheet and print is only $9.99 there.  I feel ripped off but I guess I got the convenience of online ordering from home in my [ASIN:B0045ZHISI Dixie Belle Lace Slip]].	
1. 	This is exactly what I was looking for. It's super soft, and it very conveniently has a place for buckles to go through when strapping her in to the car seat. Also, it's so easy to use! I read about how swaddling your baby too tight can give them hip problems, but you don't have to worry about that with these. Perfect!	
- 1	I am not at all happy with this product. They fall off when the weather turns cold (below 30) or gets hot (above 80 outside). A total wate of money. I will be buying a different product.	
1. 	Very pretty nursing cover, nice quality cloth, I do think it's not a necessary item but I haven't really started using it yet since still pregnant with first child.	
1. 	I make my own baby food and I got both the freezer trays and the travel dish, so that I can pack food for my little guy to take to daycare.  It worked out great.  The food fits from the freezer trays right into this dish, so every night I popped them out of the trays and into the travel dish and put them in the refrigerator.  They defrosted overnight and my little one had food for daycare the next day.  Having the spoon right there was great too.	
1. 	I bought this bath to use with my infant when he was about 8 or 9 weeks old. Prior to that, we were holding him (making bathing a two person job -- one to hold the baby in the bath and one to wash him). He got too heavy for me to hold the entire time while bathing him and I needed a way to wash him by myself when my husband was at work. This seat works very well. I put the seat inside a small plastic baby bath tub and fill the water about half way (so that when I put him in the water level doesn't rise too high on him). I think this bath is better for a baby that's a bit older (I wouldn't have used this with him when he was a tiny newborn). It was perfect for my son at 8 or 9 weeks because he could recline and have a nice soak while I washed him without needing a second set of hands. He's 13 weeks old now and loves sitting in it and kicking his legs. Once he's able to sit up independently, we'll just let him sit in the baby bath tub without this seat.	
- 1	I bought this because it stated it was BPA free.  However, when I was ready to wash it before use, I saw it has a recycle symbol 7, often used for Polycarbonate which has proven to leach BPA into its contents.  I'm unsure if that is what it is made of, but most baby products are code 5 (PP) for polypropylene which is known to be BPA free.  I was just shocked to see this.  I won't use it.	
- 1	The lid sucks and is dangerous and the hole is way to small my little mans private parts goes over the sponge and doesnt even come close to be able to fit inside the hole.  =/ Don't buy.	
1. 	We have 2 of these.  They are a must.  Great color and I very much dislike the primary colored gates.  We needed to keep our young crawler and now toddler away from a gas fireplace in the winter and a console with electronics on it.  They come apart and are adjustable which is great.	
- 1	The velcro was so sharp that it cut my son's legs.  I would not recommend this diaper cover.  We used organic wool covers and loved them!	
1. 	My son loves playing with balls and this is just perfect. We stuck it to the patio window and he just loves it!	
- 1	We have 2 baby gates the Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru and the Munchkin Easy Close Metal Gate.  I would recommend the later.  There is no real problem with the Regalo, the Munchkin is just better.  1. The Munchkin lock is a lift and squeeze function designed to be done with one hand, the Regalo requires that you pull back and lift up which can be done with one hand, but is far easier with two hands (and let's face it if you have toddler you never have 2 free hands!) 2. The Munchkin has an additional 3rd lock feature at the bottom of the gate which also serves to determine which way you want the door to swing (it can also be left up so that the door swings both ways).  The Regalo only swings 1 direction and has no additional lock feature.  3. The Munchkin will lock automatically when pulled closed.  The Regalo must be manually locked (a 1 handed operation but still 1 addition action each time you go in and out.)So while there is nothing really bad about the Regalo, there are better options out there!	
1. 	I've been using sleepsacks on my daughter since she was born. She's now two years old and still sleeps with one! I love it because I can rest easy knowing she's always covered. It's also awesome because when your kid is wearing one of these, they can't reach their pants/diaper and take them off! I have so many friends who complain that their kid is constantly taking off their diapers during the naps and I don't have that problem! The zipper is at the bottom of the sack, so she doesn't know how to unzip it (she's two and STILL hasn't figured it out!) I love these and I will use them with all my kids!	
1. 	Our daughter truly enjoyed this during her tummy time period. We have since given it to a friend who has a little one, and she loves playing with it when we visit... perhaps I was too hasty in giving it away.	
1. 	This toy hammock certainly is jumbo, fits the description perfectly. For some reason, it never occurred to me that even though this item is clearly billed for STUFFED animals, that items such as Beanie Babies or other bean filled animals are much heavier and the item will sag a lot or will break under the stress of all the weight. Either way, the stuffed animals that my son did have are in there, off the ground and it has stayed up perfectly.	
- 1	I thought this idea seemed great since my hands would be full once our baby arrived, but it did not work for us. We bought this for use in a doorway, but the foot pedal stuck out so that we never would have been able to close the door. The opening for this gate was also very narrow. We returned this for the North State Industries easy close gate, which we love.	
- 1	The thing with this bag is that it would only be able to hold a few very light weight bath stuff, like the numbers or letters that go on the bath wall. My son has many toys, and even the weight of two small rubber ducks wont allow the bag to stick. Honesly its not worth it! Now it just sits on the corner ledge of the bathtub, and acts more as a grocery bags to store toys.	
- 1	What I like:- There is a detachable hood. I wish all non-wrap/sling carriers and covers came with hoods! Hoods provide privacy and quiet in addition to warmth & weather protection.- It is easy to snap the cover on over the carrier straps.- The foot pocket is not large, but it is slightly adjustable and is better than no pocket.What I don't like:- The snaps that attach the cover to your carrier's straps are not secure! Mine may be defective, but one of the cover's snaps won't stay closed with a light tug, and the other is better but still somewhat easy to detach.- The material is incredibly flimsy. Hoodie makes it sound like a nice cozy sweatshirt- it isn't. This is very thin material... You get what you pay for.The faulty snaps make this impossible to use. In the event that mine is defective, I would only recommend this for very mild weather where you either need a hood or a little extra leg protection. The idea is excellent- it's execution that is flawed.	
1. 	What I like:* Easy to wash/clean* Small enough to have them on the purse, on the go.(but still can hold 10oz) =)* Material and design* Even though they're not completely spill proof, my 18m old son can handle them without making a mess.* Stackable for storage.* SON LOVES THEM (He wouldn't drink from a sippy cup until I introduce these because liquids come out fluently)**Please consider this*** Even though the cup itself isn't 100% spill proof, the spout does the job very well when you're on the go. My baby always had a hard time drinking from cups with internal plastic valvs or spout, and when I tried to drink from those cups, even for me was hard. I'll rather have some drops here and there (because this is only what you have, tiny drops)  than giving my baby a hard time with those hard to drink from cups.	
1. 	I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).	
1. 	Perfect, cleans all of the formula out for a clean bottle.  I thinks it a little pricy, but there is not much else out there that can clean a dr browns bottle.	
- 1	First of all, this thing dries out wipes, even if you do add the 1/4 cup of water you're supposed to add every couple of days! It also restricts you in the kind of wipes you can buy... forget getting Chubbs in its round container, for instance. The little storage area is a nice idea, but it's rather flimsy and not very supportive. Your best bet would be to get one of the wrap-around warmers, which have cute pastel designs on them and mold to the shape of the wipe tub. These take up far less room and are much easier to clean, too. This one? You'll be continuously wiping it down, when it hasn't fallen over, that is.	
- 1	The woombie is a good idea, but not made for my LO. She was getting too strong for the swaddles and I thought this would work. While it kept her in, the woombie is not made for LO's that put their hands over their head. While zipped in it and down for the night baby tried to reach up and subsequently flipped the zipper cover  and collar over her mouth and nose where it stayed. Being a new mom I panicked and sent it back the next day.	
1. 	We got this product as a gift.  It has been one of the most helpful baby products we own.  Our baby started using it as a newborn and used it for about 7 months, till he could get out of it on his own.  It is a soothing, calming chair that is especially good for babies with reflux to help them keep their tummies full.  If your baby spits up a lot, sometimes the upright position really helps.Our baby loved the soothing vibrations.  I must have changed the battery 10 times.  I would set him in the chair for naps and something about the angle of the chair and the vibrations just lulled him to sleep.It is an excellent product, and would make a wonderful gift.	
- 1	We have this sponge for our baby and thought it would be good for sponge baths in the first few weeks but he hated it.  It was itchy and very thin.  I wouldn't want to lay on it with no clothes on either.  I ended up ditching the cushion and folding up a big beach towel, it seemed more comfortable for him.  The cushion also wasn't very long, our son was 20 inches when he was born and was already a bit to big for it.	
1. 	My son loves these little colorful boats. Not only does he like chasing them around in the bathtub, he also likes playing with them outside of the tub. They are soft enough for him to use to chew on.	
- 1	After one use, I was unable to close both the clasps and the product was completely useless. I would not recommend this purchase.	
- 1	We have use this a few times and it really doesn't hold up the baby well. Babies move around a lot and this thing always looks like it is about to collapse. It bends if she leans to the side. I bought it to avoid the yucky ones in restaurants but I find that I don't really want to take this with us most of the time. My baby is on the heavy side so maybe it works better with lighter weight babies. I feel like I wasted money on this and I wished I spent a few more bucks for a better one. You get what you pay for.	
1. 	I thought there would be a connector to it so it made it longer when inserting it into the other part to pump. The neck line of the tube is very small. Thank you for your product.	
1. 	This set would make a perfect gift for an expecting mother.  It comes with everything you need to feed a baby for many months.  The bottles have pastel colored rings that would be appropriate for either a boy or girl. You get 6 ounce bottles with slow flow nipples and 9 ounce bottles with fast flow nipples.  I still use the slow flow nipples even after 4 months because my baby is a fast eater and this helps her slow down. It even comes with an extra slow and fast flow nipple and two extra vents.  The nipples are also supposed to be naturally shaped to aid in breastfeeding, but my baby is exclusively fed pumped milk, so I cannot attest to that ability.The bottles are different because of the Ventaire technology.  The bottom of the bottle twists off and a rubber vent fits inside.  Make sure you twist the bottom on correctly, or milk will leak.  The first few times, I did not screw them on correctly- the threads are stiff and I did not match them up, and they leaked a little.  After more uses it is easier to twist them on. There are tiny holes in the bottom that allow air to escape, so your baby is not taking in extra air while eating.  I could hear the air escaping while my baby ate.  This was especially helpful when she had a cold and was breathing a lot of bubbles back into her milk.The bottles are shaped with a angle which allows for mothers to hold the baby in a more upright position while eating.  This helps reduce gas and supposedly colic.  It comes into narrow sides that the baby can grip when it is able.All of the bottles come with caps that fit very tightly, making transporting milk easier.  All the accessories are interchangeable between the 6 and 9 ounce versions.  they have held up well through multiple cleanings in the dishwasher.I would highly recommend these bottles.  I have also used Avent, and they are good, but I do believe the Ventaire technology has made my baby less gassy and less fussy.	
1. 	These drop-ins are okay - they are not an improvement over an ordinary bottle. Yes, I can simply throw these liners away after using them, but since I still have to wash the bottle's nipple, this system does not save me any time. I use these liners in conjunction with my bottle warmer and they don't melt, which is good. I bought the Playtex Drop-In system to try to reduce the amount (frequency and quantity) that my baby spits up. However, the amount of spit-up is the same - not better, but also not worse.	
- 1	I bought this based on the - mostly good reviews- however, I am giving a warning.. read the bad reviews and take them to heart.. everything stated... Stiff material that hurts then, sticks in their throat, velrco easily undone.. its all true! beware! this will be like throwing your 12.00 OUT OF THE WINDOW.	
- 1	Yes, I read all the reviews saying that these are impossible to clean.  I thought: oh I'm not some OCD clean freak; plus I'll clean it right after use, unlike all those OTHER people.  Silly me!  Everyone was right.  You know how they sell those bottle brushes, complete with nipple brush?  That's because we don't want bacteria in our babies' foods, right?  Since they don't sell a brush in the world that could clean this thing, there is really no way to get it clean.  And I don't want my sweet boy ingesting some banana from last week.  It was fun for a one-off experiment! But we like to be more sustainable than one-off excursions into plastic.  Oops.  Humble pie is mine.	
1. 	This chair is great as my 4 month old loves it. Baby was born preemie so we are still working on holding head up constantly and he loves to sit up. We put the Boppy pillow on back of chair for extra support and it works well. Once he fully has head control, this chair will be even better. The seat is deep, leg openings are good (though may be an issue when he gets chunkier...he is 12lbs now). The seat back is high which I prefer. Easy to clean. All in all, a great investment for our little one.  Please watch your baby in the chair and leave on the ground....my little one squirms and can rock chair a little bit...I'm betting stronger/older babies can tip this w no problems.	
1. 	my baby was 7lb,11oz and 20in at birth.  he fit into this until he was 6 weeks old and then was too long.  that's why i gave it 4 stars.  it seemed like we didn't get as much use out of it for the price.  i'd almost recommend buying the medium size right away.  he did stay swaddled and slept very well those first weeks which was a relief.  i used it day and night.	
1. 	My son graduated from crib to 3-side bed super early so the pack and play had to go be replaced for travel all too soon.  This is super light weight, easy to use and a good step up from a pack and play.  It doesn't take up much room in the car and he quickly recognized it as his place to sleep.  I do recommend adding a sheet.  It's the same size as most cot sheets (like for school), so we use the set that we had to purchase for daycare.	
- 1	My husband and I found that the Teddy Bear Strap Covers were much better.  They are fuller and softer on the babies face.  These are very flat and not very soft and do nothing to support my son's head in the carrier.	
- 1	Such a compelling product.Alas.I tried 4/5 of the catheters, and despite repeated instruction-reading and tummy-rubbing, nothing ever came of it. These ended up being more of a novelty item than a useful tool.If my baby has gas, I have more luck laying him on his back and pushing his knees to his chest or leaning him forward on my knee and patting his lower back. Gas drops seem to work, too, though my doctor says they're all hooey.If you're registering and considering these, consider this: You will need a lot of plain white onesies in many different sizes. Yes, even if your child is super fashionable. Go register for those.	
1. 	They are soft, I'd say bigger than average (length-wise), have ample sized velcro sections in the back that are secure.  Great price also.I was concerned they would be too small but they are perfect for my teething (constantly drooling)  toddler @ 14 months. The neck is also ample - definately bigger than an infant bib.  We've had them for about a month maybe longer and i've seen no signs of wear with weekly washings.	
1. 	After our daughter was born in March we began using disposable diapers! However she was ultra-sensitive to the chemicals in the diapers and wipes and kept getting sever diaper rash that made her little butt raw and painful! After switching brands of diapers and wipes several times we finally decided to begin using cloth diapers and cloth wipes! Enter the OsoCozy Flannel Wipes! Wow! These wipes are sooooo soft and work wonderfully! I only need 1-2 wipes to clean a major blowout and that is amazing considering it took 5-6 disposable wipes(or more) to do the same job! Not to mention these don't have nasty chemicals. That's a plus plus! I use warm water and California Baby Diaper Area Wash with them.  I haven't had any trouble out of these wipes...they continue to get softer as they are washed repeatedly! Out of 60 wipes, I have a few that have loose seams but it's not really a problem for me and definitely does not affect the performance at all. Overall, I really love these wipes and would recommend them to anyone.	
- 1	While having a digital baby monitor is a novel idea, the execution of this particular product left me unimpressed.  It is sturdy, however the battery life on this is non-existent.  My iPod statys charged longer than this baby monitor.  And it does not have a rechargeable battery pack. So it is best to keep it in the docking station using the AC adaptor.  The display monitor is adequate, but a bit dark. I did like the voice activation feature though.Recommend pursuing a baby monitor with the option of rechargable batteries rather than this one.	
1. 	I love this bath. It was awesome for when my son's umbilical cord hadn't fell off. It has grown with him every step of the way. The bath toys and extras are great to.	
1. 	Every time we go somewhere, this is in the diaper bag!  I use the Tommee Tippee bottles and 2 bottles fit in there with an ice pack. (I use a different ice pack than the one that comes with it).  It fits nicely in the diaper bag and so far I'm extremely happy with this purchase!	
1. 	My son absolutely hated tummy time.  I have tried absolutely everything to get him to spend more time on his stomach, but nothing worked.  I know how much I love water, and hoped that my son would as well, so on an impulse I bought this item.  I'm very glad I did because now my son participates in tummy time.  He doesn't scream and cry anymore.  I'm so happy that I had the whim to buy this product and I would recommend it to any parent who struggles to give their child tummy time.	
- 1	en serio, como se les ocurre hacer un bobo sin tapa, por dios cada vez que el bebe los quiera usar hay que lavarlos, es imperdonable un error como es.	
1. 	Kid gets to have a tumbler like mom and dad.  Great playtex quality and design.  Love this.  Will grow with my child and will be using for a long time since the design is not babyish.	
1. 	I used this seat when my dd was under 15m. Now, I am using it for my son. I never really had a big issue with it, just small ones. a) It doesn't turn well in water(mainly I think cause of plastic and friction) but that didn't matter to me cause I don't really find myself NEEDING to turn itb)instructions- I don't remember if it came with instructions but when i would put it on the tub, I would lean on it to force it onto the tub. After doing it this way for dd for a year and for ds for awhile, my hubby informed me that there was a handle underneath to open it. I am the type that reads manuals from cover to cover. I don't remember that at all.c)water drainage- when I am done with it, I have to lean it foreward and let it sit for the water to drain out. Now, I have been using it since 2004 and NEVER HAD THE MOLD! It' just takes a good minute for all the water to drain. I just lean it foreward and let it sit there until the next bath or my shower then move it.All in all, good bathseat with few small hangups. I love it and am continueing to use it and have used it for about 2 years	
- 1	First time mom who is over protective. Baby liked the colors and animals (we bought the animal friends one). However, this thing is HEAVY & I couldn't stand the thought that the moment I walk away it could fall & hit my poor daughter right in the face! Sure it can be tightened, but I don't think enough to have it be safe!If they can make this lighter I would whole heartedly recommend.	
- 1	I was really looking forward to using this product in transition my 13 week old baby to her crib, but when i received this product, the packaging was so old that the Mobi had a yellow discoloration, and the packaging just fell apart before i even touched it. I figured that I would try it out anyway, so i put the batteries in and it didnt work. So i figured that maybe the batteries were old too, so I tried brand new Energizer batteries and it still didnt work. I had to return the product. Im i think that next time Ill go for the rechargable Mobi.	
- 1	Not sure how these are used as inserts. I was NOT impressed and my petite baby leaked each time. They are now floating around my house as burp cloths or just to clean up mess. I was not thrilled with the diapers either.	
1. 	We have three of these (in Ecru a.k.a. off white) and it fits the Babies R Us contoured changing pad we have.  Its nice and soft for our baby to lay on while we are changing her.  Its also easy to take on and off to switch out for a new one.  I originally had one but realized it was good to have extras in case of accidents so bought 2 more.  No complaints from me!	
1. 	This book is perfect!  I'm a first time new mom, and this book made it so easy to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, sleep.  Definitely would recommend this for new moms.  Plus it's small enough that I throw in the diaper back for doctor visits.	
1. 	I ordered these for our nursery to put on the changing table shelves.  I plan to dye the liner & paint the basket to go with the decor of the room.  When they arrived, they were in great condition (a worry of mine since they are wicker which tends to break easily).  I love the size of all 3 baskets.  The largest will hold diapers, the medium size will probably hold wipes & the smallest will probably hold any lotions, powders, creams or anything else we need for diaper changes.	
1. 	This is the only bottle I've used for my baby. It keeps air from her tummy and ventilates perfectly. I've been using it since day one after being a nanny for many years and seeing how different bottles act differently. A lot of moms who don't have colicky babies use the bottle because it's such a trustworthy product. The ventilation system helps keep my baby's acid reflux under control. Plus, the bottom comes out so you can just use a sponge to clean the bottle. You don't have to use a bottle brush if you don't need to. If you do use a bottle brush (I do sometimes) you don't get sprayed with soap or water as the opening to the bottles are wide enough to prevent the mess. They came very quickly, well packaged. I shopped around and every time I do I end up coming back to Amazon. Excellent product!	
- 1	Mobi advertises that you can use this system as a security camera since you can view it from any internet browser. Turns out you only get 2 hrs of viewing time a month. You have to pay $10/ month for unlimited. As for a babay monitor, it's okay. Not as clear as I would have liked. Also, the set-up for the internet viewing is not clear cut. Needless to say, we are very frustrated with this and are debating whether or not to return it.	
1. 	I liked this pillow it was exactly as pictured and stated. So soft! I would recommend this to my friends.	
- 1	The band rolls up and doesn't stay in place. The Velcro has a hard plastic underside or backing that wrinkles and is uncomfortable against your skin. Also the gel insert that you can freeze or microwave does not stay warm at all. It stays warm for like 3-5 minutes and then you have to keep reheating. Glad I got it on sale for $20, but still a waste of money. But you get what you pay for.	
- 1	I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it. I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle. I have since returned the Snoogle. I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable. The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me. I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me. I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money.	
- 1	The edges were frayed as I started to roll it out. It also does not fit well for my Kia Sorento windows.	
1. 	I don't like how Medela changed the pump accessories to be one peice instead of 2 - it makes it harder to feel like you've done a good job cleaning.The picture makes it look like the bottles are smaller than the others I have - but they are the same, so no worries.Great buy - cheaper than buying things individually.	
1. 	I was a bit sceptical about buying this at first because I didn't think it was that safe but I'm going on vacation with LO soon and I needed something and this got good reviewsa so I tried it. Its fantastic! She loves being right at the table with us and it is VERY sturdy! Can't say enough good things about it	
1. 	This changing pad cover is so soft and looks really nice.  It also washes and dries without shrinking.	
- 1	I told myself that if I ever got pregnant again that I would splurge on a pregnancy pillow!  Well, I did and hated this thing.  After 2 nights with it, I could not tolerate it.  Both mornings I woke-up with a sore neck and there is not a good way to turn it over in the middle of the night when you are covered by a sheet.  I actually, had to get out of the bed, pull the sheet back, flip the pillow over, and hop back into bed.  If the pillow was on the edge nearest the side of the bed, good luck trying to get out in the middle of the night for restroom break!  The leg support was the only thing that was decent.  I decided this was not a splurge; I will take my 10 pillows any day over this uncomfortable pillow!	
1. 	My 7-month-old son really enjoys playing in this toy.  He has this one at grandma's house and the Einstein at home.  He got bored of the Einstein and it's useless puppet quickly and fusses when he is in it. Not in this one.  He get's so excited being in it.  He loves the book.  I haven't had any problem with durability.  A friend gave it to me after her son outgrew it and everything still works.  I can see where it can be overstimulating for a baby under 4-months though.  My son didn't get it until he was 5 months.  I don't even think that babies under 4 months should be forced to sit in such an upright position anyway.	
- 1	This bouncy seat is OK, but.....if I had to do it over, I would have bought one of the infant rocker bouncer seats that convert into a toddler rocker.  What I didn't like about this seat is that it wasn't as curved and comfy as other seats.  It was kind of reclined back at a weird angle.  The toy bar was hard for my baby to reach and other than watching the pretty waterfall lights, there just wasn't much to it.  The toys were kind of bland and didn't do much.  I did like the pretty colors and decor, but it just didn't work out for me.  When he turned 8 months, I sold it and bought the rocker/bouncy seat that converts to a toddler chair.	
1. 	When i was looking at swings for my baby, this was number 1 on my list because of the 2 different swinging modes and i loved the ocean theme of it.I definately will recommend this to any mommy about to have a baby, this helped sooth my son to sleep after i tried everything else, he even fell asleep in it. It also has a nice plush comfy machine washable pad that held up the 3 times i washed it and it stayed looking new. This swing always retains value if you want to resell it, i resold it for almost as much as i bought it new because it still looked brand new after all the use.A must have swing, if i have another child i am definately buying this swing again. The only thing i could find wrong with it, is it does have a loud motor but you get used to it quick and it seemed to soothe my son to sleep.	
1. 	They work well. It's always nice to have extra nipples for your bottles. They are easy to clean. I recommend them.	
- 1	Sounds like a good idea but you must be sitting for it to work properly.  I didn't quite think the whole day through with these.  My thought was to use them while nursing on one breast to capture the milk from the other.  Maybe for mothers who are bigger milk producers it will work for you but not so much for me.	
- 1	I bought these and still haven't used them because I can barely get them open. I know it's supposed to be for baby proofing but adult proof too? A little too much for me.	
1. 	I have a 2 week old that suffers from gas.  She seems to do much better when bottle-nursing with these drop-ins than without.  The side-benefit of not needing to wash/sterilize bottles as frequently is also a really nice side-benefit.Don't tell mom... they seem to deliver less gas than when baby breastfeeds!	
1. 	My toddler HATES coats. She hates them so much that I am completely unable to get her to wear one, even in cold weather.  When I discovered that the Bundleme had a toddler version I decided to give it a try. My daughter loves that she doesn't have to wear a coat and loves snuggling into the soft inside of the Bundleme.  I am a happy mom because she is warm and happy. A win win! The fabric wipes clean on the outside and is nice and soft on the inside.  It washes well and has lasted for over about a year.  I expect it to last many more to come. It was a great purchase!	
1. 	the best little tub for babies to keep them safe and happy. my kids loved it and i still use it today(2 years later)	
- 1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.	
- 1	When this package arrived, I was very disappointed to see not for use with Single Deluxe or Freestyle breast pumps written in very small print on the front of the package.  I assumed that because the product was made by Medela and claimed to be compatible with ALL Medela breast pumps, it would be compatible with my Medela Freestyle Breast pump.	
1. 	We have 2 sets of twins, 8 months old and 3 years old. Surprizingly we dont have many gates, just 4, one for the top and bottom of each staircase. These work very well. They were easy to install and do not leave marks on teh walls. They are easy for me and my husband to open and close (even with babies on the hips) but too difficult for my 3 year olds to operate. They are very safe and hold up to much abuse, including my 3 year olds grabbing the bars and shaking it. It serves its purpose, though I didnt try it in a doorway. I dont need any others seeing tha tmy house is VERY baby proof. but these are nice looking easy to use and very sturdy.	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
- 1	I see babies with these pacifiers and im not sure how are they able to hold on to them.My three months old are having a difficult time holding it.The pacifier is extremely heawy!!!!May be it will work when he is older?!	
1. 	We've been addicted to Halo SleepSacks since my daughter was a newborn. We've been through all of them - the swaddles when she was a newborn, micro fleece in the winter, and cotton in the spring/summer. Right now, she's a petite 2 yo (approx. 10th percentile in weight and 40th in height), and she *just* outgrew the size large, which she was in since she was a little over a year old. Note that even though they say Large fits 22-28 LBS, my daughter outgrew it by length when she was only 23 LBS. The XL is perfect on her right now.We keep her room at 70 degrees and she wears a short sleeve onesie, fleece zip-up footed pajamas, and this cotton sleep sack to bed. She's just the right temperature and sleeps soundly through the night!	
1. 	These do their job. They are a little difficult to pull out of the socket when you need to use it, but that's the point. :)	
1. 	If there were 10 stars for the rating system instead of 5, I would probably give it 9 out of 10. It's a great product but it's not exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it's big enough for 2 adults and a picnic basket (not really much more). Yes, the handle is nice so it folds into a purse-like contraption for carrying. And yes, the backing seems to keep out the moisture since we last tested it on a moist lawn. But the top material is sort of plasticy. It's not crinkly cheap plastic, but it's not comfortable like a soft blanket. I guess there are give-and-takes when it comes to trying to stay dry or using a traditional blanket.I got several other picnic items at the same time on Amazon so check out those reviews as well. And let me know if you find them helpful!	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for transitioning my baby to bottle feeding.  The original bottles we were using were shorter and wider, so they were difficult for my little one to hold herself (and she was determined to hold that darn bottle!).  She was able to hold these longer, thinner bottles almost immediately.  The VentAire design has helped my daughter have less gas and that makes feedings a great deal easier.  She also spits up quite a bit less than she did before, which makes for a happier baby, happier parents, and less laundry!I have recommended these bottles to several other mothers who were transitioning to bottle feeding and will continue to do so.	
1. 	This works great!  The measurements for heating are accurate.  I only wish it had a buzzer or beeping noise of some sort once it was done warming the bottle.	
1. 	I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my let down and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.	
1. 	We bought this when our son started crawling.  We do not use it to keep him in but rather to keep him out.  Our kitchen, foyer and living room come together in an unusual way so a traditional baby gate would not work for us.  We have it &#34;open&#34; in a sorta backwards &#34;C&#34; shape.  I usually just step over it but I can actually fold the second to last panel inward to create a walkway when needed.  Before purchasing it, I read some of the other reviews and I think a lot of people are really expecting a lot from this item.  In the description, it says it is &#34;lightweight and portable&#34; and it is just that.  It will move on a smooth surface (but ours came with anti-skid pads) and if you don't have enough of an angle at each bend, it may fall over.  But, it is made of very sturdy plastic so if you set it up correctly, it will serve it's purpose.	
- 1	I ordered this product expecting the Snuzzler with the light/baby pink on one side (which is shown in the photo) and instead I received one with HOT pink on one side. I cannot use it and I had to return it. Otherwise, the product seemed good. Very soft.	
- 1	Why bother?!  Elastic came off of these things numerous times, and some of the inserts arrived with dirt marks.  Flip covers have too many large, hard snaps that can press against baby's skin.  Sizing is limited for thick prefold diapers (mine were organic unbleached) because it only works as a small and medium cover; legs openings are too tight with prefold diapers.  Shape has a large waist and narrow hips - bizarre.  Cover is thick polyester and not breathable, so it overheats.  The inserts were thick with a synthetic side and worthless - resembles a thick feminine menstrual pad in which poo could slide off once you pick it up.  Elastic is only on back, so the stiff cover (which doesn't stretch much) on the front will not expand or stretch when baby is sitting.  This would be funny if it were a movie, but it's really a Flippin' nightmare!	
- 1	I bought this pillow because it was one of the tallest ones out there and I am a very high-waisted person with a very tiny baby.  The problem is that it's tall only on one side (6 or so) and on the other side (the one closest to your body) it is very short (about 3.5).  This means the baby just rolls off and then in between the pillow and my body, pushing it out of the way.  There is no way to keep baby on the pillow.  This is the WORST design of any pillow I have tried, including the Boppy, and trust me, I have tried them all!	
- 1	I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.	
- 1	Nice sling, well made with very pretty fabric BUT IT DOESN'T FIT! I measured myself with a tape measure and according to the official Hotslings size chart I measure a 24&#34; from shoulder to hip which is 2&#34; below the maximum size for their regular size sling.when it arrived it barely fit over my frame at all- let alone with the baby in it! I had it adjusted so the buckle's cinches were all the way out and it was as big as it would go. It was way too small. So irritating!	
1. 	I wonder what baby thinks...I'll have to see after I'm done playing with it.We got this because every book ends up in baby's mouth.  This book, with cloth pages, seemed a bit nicer way to go.  A friend has a 1 year-old; not so into it, too young.  At 6 months, winner.Buy it!	
1. 	I have waited 9 months to write this review based on my purpose of warming up breastmilk. First thing first, this bottle warmer is available at Walmart for $15. I saw the price on Amazon going from $15-$35. So just beware and don't get rips off.We have been using this warmer to warm up frozen breastmilk for 9 months and had no issue at all. Other than the deposits in the heat plate even though we been using distilled water the entire time.We know this warmer wasn't designed for frozen breastmilk but formila in room tempreture. However, other warmer works better for breastmilk are just too expensive. Also due to the bottle storage we use (no bags), we wanted to give this bottle a try. In order to get it to work, we have to experiment and find out the best amount of water measurement to pour into the steamer.The milk bottle we use are the medela plastic one (ok with high heat), we stay away from glass bottle because they get over heated easy and very hard to control the tempreture. Now every bottle of breastmilk we have has different volume of milk but in avg we have about 120ml to 150ml, I take out the bottle from the freezer, turn the cap half open (enough for it to breath but not losen). Then I fill up the measuring tube full (i don't even need those number line these days, they are useless for my purpose), I pour all water in there, set the bottle in the steamer, and I cover it with a coffee mug that fit perfectly (not tight), turn the switch and after 3-4 mins, it will auto turn off, usually there'll be a small cube of frozen milk floating in the bottle, that's why I leave it alone covered for another 2 mins before I take it out and feed the baby. If I'm heating up 150ml- 200ml, I just steam it again with 1/5 to 1/4 water filled in the tube. Everything comes out perfect.This thing is awesome and save us a lot of money. Highly recommanded!	
- 1	I purchased these because someone had given us similar bibs by Luvable friends with the liner in the middle so I thought these would be similar, should have bought more of the friends kind, the drool soaks through the bib defeating the purpose!  My 5 mo old daughter is not on solids so I can't comment on their performance in regards to that but I'd imagine it wouldn't be good if it can't handle drool.  In regards to them being scratchy around the neck I have not had a problem, yes they are velcro and velcro is velcro, just make sure it is fastened and it is fine, don't understand the issue with that?  In the wash I fasten them but also throw them in a garment laundry bag with her little socks and haven't had any issues.	
1. 	I only use these to put ice chips in when my little guy's teeth are hurting him. He loves it. I literally get screamed at when I take it away to refill(he's only 7 months, so I will let him slide on that). I tried teething rings and other teething toys, they helped but not half as well as these.	
- 1	This bottle cools way way too fast.  And when you do warm it in water the stainless steel burns you.  I do not have a problem with this on other bottles I've purchased.  The bottle also leaks with the nipples that were supplied.  My precious breast milk would just run out.  I tried replacing the nipples with other recommended ones and the milk still leaked.Other bottles keep the heat in longer or the cold in longer.  These do not.  They immediately go to room temp much faster than any other bottle I've used.	
1. 	My 16 month old son loves this ride on toy. We call it his Wheely Bug. He pushes it all over, rides it, and flips it over to see how the wheels work. Great toy and very durable. Need to watch little ones, since this toy does not have a back. They can slide down pretty quickly.	
1. 	I read some reviews suggesting that it is simple to just lift both toilet lid and seat I do not agree. There is a latch that actually goes inside the toilet bowl so that is not possible. My 15 month old son can not lift the lid and has actually lost interest in even trying. It is simple for me to open so no struggle when ya gotta go! I give this the full stars it deserves!	
1. 	Great to find this product in Winter. Keeps baby cozy while we stroll around town. Easy on and off. Fits on my Uppa umbrella stroller and my Orbit one too!	
1. 	Can't say enough good about this product - best thing I ever bought!  Easy to take to relatives or a restaurant.	
1. 	I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!	
1. 	I have two of these monitors (silver and pink) and they are great.  I love the video, especially since my twins tend to wake up quietly.  It's great to be able to check if they are simply rolling over or are standing up waiting for me to get them without having to open the door.Important to note, if you want to watch two children in two different rooms, you need two complete monitor systems. This is because the handheld monitor can only monitor one camera at a time.  You would only be able to hear/see one child at a time, and unless you wanted to spend all night switching between the two cameras, you need one monitor for each room.If you want to watch one child in two different rooms, you just need to get an extra camera.  Super simple to add a camera; just set one to A and the other to B.  The handheld monitor is set to whichever camera you want to watch.I have noticed that the pink camera seems to be zoomed in compared to the silver camera.  By this I mean that the pink camera gives me a close-up view and the silver camera is more like a wide angle view.  It's not good or bad, just something that I noticed.Here's a quick run down on the monitor.Pluses:-- Good video even in little or no light: We tested this in daylight as well as in a dark room with and without a nightlight.  The video was very clear and crisp regardless of ambient light.-- Easy set-up: It was very easy to set up the camera.  I have them sitting on shelves (with the cord out of reach of my twins) rather than mounted on the wall.  It means that I can move them from room to room as needed.-- Long battery life: I have the monitors on and plugged in over night (about 8 hours) and the charge will last all day (about 5-6 hours of actual usage).  Of course, the battery last as long if you check the video frequently.Quirks:-- Background hum: There is a hum in the background that can be annoying, but it doesn't ever obscure the audio.  The mic is very sensitive and you don't have to turn the audio up very much to hear your child well, which means that the hum is very soft.-- No volume markings: I found this annoying because the on/off dial is the same as the volume dial.  You have to re-find your volume setting every time, and if your child is quiet, it can be hard to tell if you have it set loud enough.  The way to get around this is to take a marker and mark the dial at your preferred volume setting.-- Handheld interference: If you have two handheld monitors, they can cause interference.  All you have to do, though, is turn them to different angles until the interference stops.-- Camera interference: Once in a great while there will be interference between cameras, where you can see a faint ghost image of the other video.  If you don't need both cameras on at the same time, turn off the one you're not using.  If you need both on, as in my case, simply flipping the handheld switch between A and B once or twice will remove the interference.Overall, this is a great video monitor system and I am so glad that I got it.	
- 1	My daughter uses a Graco infant car seat, and I couldn't get the toy to fit on there right and stay on. Plus, it got kind of annoying when putting the handle bar of her car seat up and down. We only ended up using this a couple times. Very disappointed!!!	
1. 	This storage system is perfect if you are already using the Playtex Drop-in System:Pros:1) No need to purchase separate storage bags for freezer. Since you are pumping and storing directly into the drop-in liners you'd be using for your drop-in bottles, no need to purchase separate bottles or storage bags. The kit comes with adapter that will work with certain popular pumps like my Medela. Make sure you purchase the newer kits, though. My sister-in-law unknowingly purchased an older kit which only came with one pump adapter instead of two.2) Perfect amount for each feeding. Since you are using the exact same drop-in liner you would for a regular feeding, you freeze the exact amount you want. Anywhere from 1 oz to 10 oz. So no need to thaw an entire bag and have unused or wasted milk or worry about using all the milk in the bag within a certain amount of time. So far from what I've seen, other breastmilk freezer storage bags only store up to 5 or 6 oz at most. So if your baby is drinking more than 5 oz and the bag only holds 5 oz you have to thaw of those 2 bags?  With the one step storage you just thaw what you need.3) Convenient and less loss of milk and nutrients. Again, since you can pump directly into the drop-in liner, no need to purchase separate storage bags. It saves some time and steps. With the one step storage it: pump into drop-in liner, freeze, and when ready to use, screw onto nurser, thaw, and serve. With other storage systems, you pump into a bottle, pour into storage bag, thaw storage bag, and pour back into bottle. Think about how much milk and nutrients you are losing in all those extra transfers. Also, people have told me of incidents when other storage bags have leaked or they accidentally spill some of the milk in the transfer to or from the bottle.4) Perfect for long trips: Just pop a frozen liner onto a nurser and it stays colder longer in your cooler for long trips.Cons:1) Kits only come in set of 6. And you have to purchase the entire kit, you can't just purchase additional rings and lids. I ended up purchasing a total of 4 kits. I found cheaper additional kits on e-bay. But I don't mind because when I'm not using them all in the freezer, I use them in the fridge for the fresh milk. When I run out of storage rings, I use the advice of another reviewer and take the liners out and throw them into a large freezer bag.  If you plan to do this long term type of storage, make sure to freeze right side up instead of upside down as instructed, though.2) Takes up more room in freezer. Since they don't freeze and store flat like other storage bags, it does take up more space in the freezer, but again, the convenience for me is worth it. When I take them out of the rings and throw them into the freezer bags, I am able to store more.3) Doesn't work as well with the expandable 8-10 oz liners as instructed. Works perfectly with the 4 oz preformed liners, but the expandable 8-10 oz liners... well... expands so it would make it difficult to insert into nurser if frozen as instructed. It would probably work fine with the original preformed 8 oz liners. You can find these online and there are generic versions. I haven't used either of those, but have instead worked with the expandable liners. I'd freeze them right side up in the nursers instead of upside down as instructed, and once frozen, I pop them out through the bottom of the nurser and throw them into the freezer bag.  When it comes time to use, I would reinsert through bottom of nurser to thaw.  If you cannot get frozen liner back into nurser, just string through storage ring, top with storage lid, and then thaw.  Then screw storage ring onto nurser for mess free thaw and transfer.4) Liners can be difficult to read. It can be difficult to see the measurements on the clear liners, but I've learned to gauge pretty well the amounts and when you breastfeed you never know the exact amount anyways. If you're really anal about, just pump into the bottles provided with your pump and measure it out before pouring into liners.Overall review:Since I am already using the Playtex drop-in system, this storage system has been really convenient for me. My husband has little patience, so he would not have liked to have to thaw a separate bag and then pour that into a bottle to serve. In a bind I've taken a frozen liner straight out of the freezer and thawed in hot water in under 10 minutes.	
- 1	This was the biggest disappointment. I used a friends electric pump (don't remember what brand it was) and a piece broke so I decided that buying a manual pump was fine since I only pumped to have some milk on hand for a babysitter if we went on a date or left the baby with his grandparents for any amount of time. Well. After about a month of rare use the star shaped piece that creates the vacuum started getting sucked down into the bottle. There was too much suction for it. It was so ridiculously frustrating to have to stop pumping all the time to unscrew the pump part off, fish in the milk for the piece, snap the top clip part off to reinsert it in place, fidget with the pump handle to get it back in place, pop the cap on, screw it back on, pump very carefully, and BAM- the piece is sucked back into the bottle; repeat. There is no way I could EVER recommend this product.	
1. 	I got this for my 2 yr old son and he loves the balls more than the net really but he's getting the idea.  It seems durable and suctions well to the wall.  I don't particularly like the bath toys or in this case, the balls, that squirt water because I've noticed if any water is left in them, they have a tendency to mold.  Overall a fun bath toy that my son likes!  I would recommend.	
- 1	We got it and it was so cheap.  I ended up just throwing it away.  Don't bother.  Waste of money	
1. 	I love having this for road trips because I don't have to haul a whole diaper bag into the rest areas. It is great for toddlers when they don't need as much stuff except for diapers and wipes. I don't use the wipes case, I just throw in a small pack of wipes and it works fine. I have been able to fit in 5 diapers, a small bottle of hand sanitizer, and a light change of clothes (onsie and leggings).	
1. 	Works well and as expected	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating.	
- 1	Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations.I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my diapering diapers for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!	
- 1	I had hoped to use a sling but I ended up with a different papoose that I love. It seemed my baby wasn't ever comfy in the sling, it also made my shoulder hurt. I ended up returning this product.	
1. 	Love this system and these drop-in liners work great! I would recommend these to anyone and I'm picky so you know they are good.	
- 1	I was so excited when I bought this but that excitement quickly fizzled away the first time I used this.  For newborns this is awful.  I could't keep her head and body up AND bathe her and getting her out of the bucket wasn't easily at all.  It's just too awkward.  Then when she was older I couldn't properly wash her because of the tub shape.  Getting my hands in there and washing was ridiculous.  It's a good soaker tub to let them soak and enjoy the warmth of the water surrounding them.  My daughter did enjoy that part.  As a bath tub, I give it two thumbs down.  I ended up going with the First Years infant/toddler tub.  It's so much easier to use than this bucket style and my daughter was just as happy in the traditional tub.	
- 1	I bought a diaper genie for my baby, despite numerous people telling me it wasnt worth it..  It was fine at first... My baby is only a month old and im already giving it away!  My first complaint is that the first few diapers wont stay wrapped!  As soon as i put another diaper in it unravels the first diaper and the second drops down with the first.. IT keeps doing this until the bag is too heavy and wont wrap at all!  My second complaint is that the cutter doesnt work!  It will cut about an inch or two and then stop and every time i try to do it again it just doesnt work, so i end up cutting it with scissors..  This thing is WAY too much work for a diaper pail!  ANd its a pain to get the diaper down in there when trying to hold onto a wriggling baby too. In my opionion its NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL!!!! I wouldnt recommend this to ANYONE!! I bout the diaper champ and it is the greatest pail ever! BUY THE DIAPER CHAMP!	
- 1	Things a car seat should do:1. Fit in the car securely.2. Hold the baby securely and comfortably.3. Be easy to adjust.Fitting in the car:Rear facing with this seat is a no go. I tried this seat in a Volkswagen Rabbit. No go. Ok, but it's a Rabbit you say. Tried it in a Honda Passport (Mid sized SUV), no go. Tried it in a 2011 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited 4dr (practically a freaking Hummer), no go.By no go I mean that the seat won't fit in the car, rear-facing, which is what states are requiring these days. By won't fit I mean that you can juuuuuuust shoehorn the seat into the car if you massively reduce the comfort and fit of the front seats, lean to the side while driving, roll the driver's and passenger seats all the way forward and raise the backs up vertical, and place the seat in the middle section. WHAT?1?!? Also, in every vehicle that I tested, the angle of the seat was far too vertical for a baby who can't properly support his head. Safety 1st's solution? Roll up some towels and shove them under the seat. I've got a better idea: Add some more cars to your test bed! Like actual cars, not minivans.Hold the baby:As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a bit of a bear trying to unbuckle the big buckle. It's a two-handed press. Maybe that's a safety feature so the little ones can't get themselves out, I'm not sure. Other than the fact that I'm 99% sure that this seat is not properly fitted to any of our vehicles it seems pretty safe. Our daughter has never had any issue with comfort or fussiness in the seat. She goes right to sleep.Easy to adjust:It's not terribly complicated, but it certainly doesn't seem to be as easy as it should be. We need that Dyson guy to redesign car seats from scratch, because the gyrations parents have to go through to get a kid in the seat in the 21st century is just ridiculous. It should be as easy as clicking down the big bar on a rollercoaster ride. Maybe that's a slight oversimplification but I shouldn't have to feel like I'm strapping Ricky Bobby into his NASCAR seat every day. The lap belts, no matter how I adjust them, always seem a little pinchy, but like I said the Tiny Boss never complains, so it's all good.It's not terrible, but honestly I don't like that it doesn't fit behind the seat in any of our vehicles and doesn't even fit in the middle seat without a ton of tweaking, and even then not angled properly. So, according to Amazon rules, that means 2 stars. If you buy one, do it in person, and take it out to the car. Don't buy one here, whatever you do.	
1. 	I think these membranes are supposed to be replaced every 3 months, but I didn't replace mine until they tore (at I think 6 months).  I bought this pack and these worked until I stopped pumping after 12 months.  These are pretty much the same thing you get with your pump originally.	
1. 	I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!	
1. 	I love these for when the kiddo is still taking smaller bottles. You can directly thaw in the bottles and put a nipple on them and go about the day! No thawing, moving to a different bottle and THEN adding a nipple. They fit perfectly into just about any cooler, are light and easy to pump into and are generally awesome.The only thing I would change is to make them 4 oz instead of 3.5 or whatever they are, or at least make an option that is, so that those of use that live in the US can get an amount that daycare workers can track.	
1. 	Great crib, easy to put together, and very pretty. Our baby is not here yet so we haven't used the crib. For now, we like it!Sole issue: not all mattresses fit. We bought an oversize mattress and it fit with sheets and a breathable bumper -but without it the mattress moved a little bit and that freaked me out a bit (I had just taken a class of SIDS and the nurse told her that the mattress must absolutely fit snugly).So... Overall great crib but why the heck would the company not make this crib standard size??	
1. 	We were a die hard Avent family becasue of our daughter tummy troubles.  But they just didn't seem to be working for her.  They were great in reducing air intake, but she just seemed to leak an awful lot with them.  She would be covered by the time she was done and that was with the number 1 nipples.  Plus for some reason my husband and mother has trouble with the bottle themselves leaking.  So I started to research and try other bottles.We hated the liner in the nursers, she hated Dr. Brown's, and the paln jane bottles allowed her to take in too much air.  So we were stuck on Avent until last week.  My cousin had a little girl and we traded a bottle to try the other guys out.Well, we steralized what we had and traded!  Her daughter does great on the Avent and doesn't leak....our daughter does great with the Vent Aire and does not leak.  I guess it just depends on teh child.  But, these are great.  She manges to keep it all in her mouth and she doesn't fill up with air.  They are also more afforable than the Avent.Anotehr plus is that she is 3 months now and very much wants to hold her own bottle and with these, she is almost there.  She can wrap her hands around them and pull her feet up for extra support and just about hond them herself.  This feat makes her very happy and the lack of leaks and tummy aches make us very happy.	
1. 	Before we found this, brushing our baby's teeth was a struggle. But she actually enjoys it when we brush her teeth with this toothbrush. Definitely recommend this!	
1. 	My baby loved these the first time I put them out!  Sometimes it takes a few times before she likes something, but these stackers were fun right away!  They are bright and colorful and fun!	
1. 	This is an outstanding swing in both quality and function.  Very attractive and durable as well.  The fabric seat washes well.  My son will sleep for hours in this swing, which is a huge help for his reflux.  He is only 4 weeks old and is already entertained by the music and the birdies flying overhead.  As a newborn he fits into the swing nicely, and there is clearly much more use of this swing for months to come.  Batteries seem to last a long time, we have used this swing for a few hours each day over the past month.  This swing is definitely worth the extra expense!Update March 06:  at 7 months, my son continues to enjoy this swing.  It has now become a fun enjoyable time for him to sit upright and play with the toy tray, enjoy the mirror and singing birdies overhead, and also his favorite place to watch his video.  This is a great swing that can be used right from birth until they are tipping it over!  Sill a great buy in my opinion.	
1. 	This is not the cutest mobile, but I think that from a babies point of view it will be perfect.  I love that it can be changed around to offer baby a different view and that it can be raised as baby gains strength and height.  My only criticism is that the plastic arm holding it up could be sturdier.	
1. 	Let me start by saying my son has had no problem switching between bottle and breast.  From the very beginning he wanted his food and didn't care how he got it. But, I've noticed that even the stage one nipple is too fast for him.  He chokes and gags on this bottle.  But, then again I've yet to invest in a bottle system.  I've bought at least one of every bottle, except Dr. Browns - hoping someone will buy me some for my baby shower!I've not noticed a lot of bubbles in this.  I have the VentAire bottles too and I've not noticed any difference in gas or colic. However, my son thus far seems to prefer the VentAire.  I think because this nipple is just too fast for him.I think all babies are different don't invest in any one system.  Let your baby decide...because ultitmately thats what is going to happen anyway!	
- 1	Everyone told me how wonderful this blanket was and I saw great reviews for it on Amazon and elsewhere, so we purchased it.  For our purposes, it simply didn't do the trick.  Our daughter was too wiggly, and too unhappy about being wrapped up for the blanket to work.  We ended up going with the Halo sleepsacks with wings -- all we had to do was velro close those suckers and it was lights out for the little one; they required way less effort for us and obviously at 3 a.m. I'm a bit lazy.	
1. 	the first thing i noticed when i received this was that the mirror was actually large enough and of high enough quality that you could see yourself.  we tried it in the car, but couldn't get it adjusted right --  so i hung it on the wall by the changing table so baby can look right into it while i change him.  i used a removable 3M wall hook (which are a miracle if there ever was one).  the monkey itself has a pleasant look and is soft.	
1. 	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.	
1. 	This is a very useful set for a new mother.  I love that the bottles are PBA-free, and that the nipples are designed for a nursing baby, to help the baby go between breast and bottle.  These bottles actually vent air in from the bottom as baby drinks, which prevents a vacuum buildup AND prevents air bubbles going in from the nipple through the liquid (which puts bubbles in the liquid which go to baby's tummy and has to be burped out!)  Bottle design has come a long way in 24 years!	
- 1	They aren't absorbent.  What else matters?  Granted much cuter than a cloth diaper / but that works and these don't.  I pass.	
1. 	I LOVE it! It's surely the cutest baby's mirror I've ever seen! It's very easy to install and the quality is great. I can also use it in my baby's crib. It's worth every single penny! I highly recommend it.	
1. 	This is a good swing, I like the two different swinging modes, front to back and side to side.  The only problem I had was that the music quit working after 2 weeks.  I did not want to disassemble the whole thing and lug it back to the store and I did not want to ship it back to FP and wait for 3-6 weeks for a replacement.  We didn't need the music anyway, so we just used the other features, my son is now 8 months old and is still under the weight limit and he enjoys the swing once in awhile, though now that he is mobile, he wants to be on the floor, crawling around.  My son was quite fussy and the swing often helped to soothe him, a few nights he actually slept in it for 5 hours straight, if he took him out he woke up and cried and cried!	
- 1	We have not been able to use this. it is imposible to drink from it. What a waste of money...	
1. 	LOVE this brand, really the whole line is great- the style is so refreshing no goofy cartoony stuff! Quality, softness, size, style are all A+ in my book.  These receiving blankets are also swaddles, and can triple as a lightweight stroller blanket, many uses for them- I have 4 different colors!	
1. 	Whenever we use our Bjorn in the winter I don't have to worry about bundling up our son or having to wear a jacket for me that's big enough to wrap around him: this is perfect!  I love it!  In Tacoma, it rains: A LOT!  And I've gotten a lot of complements on it too!  The Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover is lightweight and super simple to attach, plus, it's so cozy and warm, I never worry about our baby being too hot or cold: it's perfect!  I love it!!!  *Excellent gift idea for baby-showers too!!	
1. 	We purchased this for our three year old.  We plan to keep it as a travel bed for her when we spend the night away from home.  To get her used to it, we set it up in the living room and she loved it instantly.  It's low enough to the ground that we don't worry about her falling out and is long enough for her to stretch out with plenty of room to spare.  It breaks down in seconds and it incredibly easy to put into the travel bag.  So glad we purchased this item.	
1. 	I was happy to see that this is actually a Medela item in its original packaging. I was unable to find a replacement ice pack for my 5 year old pump in style model until I found this one. This was exactly what I needed!	
1. 	Is perfect for my baby, but i would like that the music last a little bit more and in my opinion it must have more music to hear	
- 1	We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget. Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times. After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1) It is NOT particularly lightweight, and even though my son was a smaller baby, it still got really heavy really fast. After about 3mos. I refused  to use it anymore. We put it in hubby's car and I put the convertible seat in mine.2) The straps adjust from behind, and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually. So, if the season changes (or you just live in a variable region like we do) you'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie. THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm (lighter clothes) day. And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time!3) The handle was not very steady. What I mean is, these seats are pushed and pulled constantly, usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip. I found that after just a few trips, the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side, and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4) Last thing, but definitely my biggest concern. The anchor strap slips! You don't notice it the first few times, and you probably won't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally. Because it was in my husband's car, we didn't notice it at first. Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE! The strap (it was the LATCH strap) had gradually gotten looser and looser, even though we used a towel to even out the seat (as recommended) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible. We fixed it, then found that several weeks later it was loose again!I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat (since I've never heard anybody else complain of it), but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again. Go with Britax or Chicco!	
- 1	How impractical is it that you can't put these bibs in the dryer, they have to be line-dried. Ours had the iron-on image in front actually melt and stick together in a wad.	
1. 	this product saved us a lot of grief. baby would not nap without it for the first couple months.  Battery life is decent, but wish they had a AC plug in model.  also the music shut off every 7 minutes, should play for longer.  The legs started bending a little too, towards the end, but over very happy we got it.  you won't regret it either if you baby has some trouble sleeping.	
- 1	I wanted something to protect the padding on the sleep surface, something easily washable with a reflux baby.This was the only thing I could find for it so I ordered it.The only good thing about this sheet is it fits the Travel Lite but it almost fits it a little too well - it is a little too hard to get on and off!  (I do put a thin waterproof absorbent pad underneath for spit up.) I understand you want sheets snug, but wow.It's scratchy and horrible feeling, plus our daughter's face breaks out every time we use it.Ugh, it's just horrible really!I learned that changing table pad covers work PERFECTLY with the Travel Lite!  We use soft velour changing pad covers with a thin waterproof pad underneath it for spit up. and know she is super cozy and not on a scratchy surface.  Now we don't even use this at all unless absolutely necessary.  I wish I had read reviews before that would have mentioned using a changing pad cover!  I haven't tried using a king size pillowcase yet, but I've heard they also fit nicely and could see how they would!Don't bother with this!	
- 1	this didn't fit our toilet unfortunately.  We had to return it and find another product.  Not sure if it would have held up to my son's strength anyhow	
1. 	These bibs are waterproof, offer good coverage, have charming patterns, and even a pocket to catch the crumbs. Just right!	
1. 	We have used this since the birth of our baby and have never had a big problem with it. The sling for a newborn worked well for us, the only thing I didn't like was the second stage, where you remove the clips for the bottom of the sling and just let it sit in the water. It seems like they could have designed this better. I never had a problem with the bump, as when I started using the second stage I would put baby's bottom behind the bump where it should be and shifted the headrest up a but. Once baby could sit up I had no problems at all. My child is now 15 months and still fits in the tub. The toys that come with the tub are also very nice. Our favorites are the pelican and the starfish.	
1. 	I purchased this monitor after my safety 1st monitor stopped working (after using it since 2000).  This monitor does the job that it's suppose to do.  I love the light feature better than anything else.  It let's me know if my baby is crying without having to turn the volume up all the way.  That's a great feature to have.  I have not had a static problem and haven't had to switch the channels very often.	
1. 	I was worried that my petite daughter (just turned 2 a couple days ago, very short and weighs 20 lbs) might not be able to use this but she has no issues with it. I needed something for our toilet since she refused to go on the little potty we bought her. Daycare has miniture 'big' potties which she can easily use with a stool but ours is still too tall for her. She would throw a fit when we would try to lift her up to it I DO IT!! so this is exactly what we needed.The seat is on a hinge almost and when you take it off the toilet it falls back to the step part allowing it to 'fold' flat. When my daughter first used it I made sure to hold the ladder still so it wouldn't scare her (thus her not wanting to use it) if it moved. She turns around on the step and then sits and scoots back on the seat with little effort. While sitting on the seat she can put her hands on top of the handles to brace herself for #2 and yes, even lift up the ladder but she thinks that part is funny and it keeps her on the potty longer (it's always an event that she doesn't like to rush) without being dangerous at all.Our neighbors have a 2/12 year old and are tired of cleaning out the little potty they have for her all the time so I let them borrow ours for a bit to see if they liked it and she's now ordering one. I've recommended it to several people. We're military living overseas in Germany and it fits the toilets out here just fine, if that helps anyone.	
- 1	It will be standing straight up on the counter and milk will start coming out of the straw. We can't figure out what the problem is or how to fix it.	
1. 	I have a graco pack and play and my son didn't use to fall asleep on the bassinet surface neither when used by itself or with a thin sheet. The Eddie Bauer sheet is like terry but soft and, it would seem, comfortable enough that my son actually stays asleep in the playard now for hours. It's also protective that even if his diaper leaks the pack and play doesn't get soiled. The only gripe I have is that it's not exactly form fitting and looks just a tiny bit loose but it doesn't move over the bassinet surface enough to be a hazard.	
- 1	Does not perform function.  The suction cup does not work and even if it did my son at 6 months was strong enough to detach the spinner part and throw it on the ground defeating the purpose of having a toy that could attach to his high chair or table.  When he leaves it alone for a while he is entertained by the moving parts and mirror.  I wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	I bought these for my grandson who spits up formula with each feeding and is drooling now too.  Very happy with them.We go through lots of bibs each day, and the soft A&A; bibs were nice, but pricey and not protecting the clothes underneath from moisture. Protective bibs with plastic backs were just too harsh against the folds of skin around his neck. These bibs have a protective layer sandwiched in between two layers of soft terry fabric. So they are soft against baby's skin and also prevent moisture from seeping through the bibs to the clothes beneath.So we still go through many bibs a day, but do not have to change outfits each time. They are absorbent, color choice is good and can coordinate with most anything he wears. Price is OK  and quality is good.	
- 1	The unit is very low-tech.  The camera works, but seems to stay on all the time.  There is very little functionality, other than a decent cam.  The sound monitor is not very good.  The battery on the hand unit died after 2 months...i'm still trying to find a replacment.  Stick to the big name monitors.	
- 1	You cannot pan with this product so when the baby rolls during the night, you lose him/her.We returned this and got a web cam.  We love it. Picture quality is better, you can pan/zoom, record video, set alerts to record ro email you when there is motion (if you want to use as a security camera), and you can watch baby with the sitter while you are away! Oh, plus it's $100 less than this!	
- 1	Been shedding no matter how many times I wash it. Now the one side is completely covered in lint balls.	
- 1	I was very excited to purchase this product but that lasted less than 10 minutes. I received the item, opened it up, inspect it- everything looked good. I put wipes in then i open and closed the main compartment a couple times and noticed it had already broken. The clasp that holds the main compartment shut was cracked and was being held together by the press to open sticker. I didn't even get to use it one. Very disappointed.I also did notice the wipes flap flops open when you open the main compartment but i could have lived with that but if the whole thing can't close that is a problem. High hopes completely dashed. If anyone knows of a similar product i would love to purchase it, maybe one a little bigger to fit a diaper in there as well.	
1. 	After lots of reviews I figured this was the best seat for our long toilet's (Kohler brand). While this doesn't 100% fit/lock in. It does stay in place and is very comfortable for my son. It made for an easy transition from potty chair to the bigger toilet.	
1. 	I got this as a shower gift but could not use it for awhile. The handle is kinda big and the chewing surface kinda wide. It also takes a lot of force to get it to vibrate and that took a while for my daugher to figure out, at first I had to hold down one of the corners for her while she chewed on the other. Once she got a little bigger it was a much better toy for her. But don't get me wrong she loved it when she was itty bitty she just needed a little help from mommy.	
1. 	I decided to get this seat over the cooshie, and I'm very happy with it so far.  I love the bright orange color.  My son loves it and takes it with him to sit on the hard floor as well.  I like that it's removable and not strapped down to the chair.  Cleanup has been easy with the exception of smushed blueberries, which left a slight discoloration on the seat.  I could try something a little harsher to get it out, but I'd rather not make it worse.  I know some reviews said the seat rips eventually, if mine does that I will post an update!	
1. 	Baby is not nearly as gassy since we switched to these bottles. Also very easy to clean.	
- 1	I managed to get it open once, used it, then found it difficult to open to refill.  I asked a couple of other people and none of them could open it easier.I'm going to leave this one and go buy anotherMunchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary; I had one of these before and it worked perfectly and easily for 2 years, first for formula and then for small snacks.  It was easy to open to refill but didn't open unintentionally.	
1. 	We have a Jeep Liberty Limited jogging stroller and while we love the stroller, the canopy leaves a lot to be desired. It was hard for us to take our dauther for walks during the day because the sun was always getting in her face. I started doing some research for some sort of canopy extender and reviewed a lot of the ones on Amazon. I decided on this one because the reviews/details state it is flexible and large enough to do it's job. We purchased it and have had it on our stroller since the day it arrived. It ties on easily and depending on where/how tight you tie it, it can be adjusted even further to cover part or all of the stroller seat. It also folds up with the rest of the canopy when you push it back, so it stays out of the way when you need it to. The only thing is it does catch the wind a lot easier, but other than that, no complaints.	
- 1	This product was a lifesaver for the first few days I had it.  Unfortunately it was no match for my toddler triplets who just transitioned to beds and want out of their room at bedtime.  It isn't that strong and if someone pulls or shakes the door, eventually it will pop open.  If I had rated this product the first day, I would have given it 5 stars.  By day 5, it was a disappointment.  On the plus side, it is very easy to use and doesn't take any tools to install.	
1. 	Very Nice Changing Table and for a great price. Keeps everything to the hand.	
- 1	Great idea, it is a must have for newborns and especialy  for new moms who are nerveous with the first baths- as I was. I had this sponge and the frog shaped green sponge ( don't remember who's the manufator). Although this one is bigger - and that's an advantage, it got black disoloration (nothing spilled on it and it is not mold) after only a few times we used it. It didn't come off  in the wash and although it didn't smell or anything I didn't want to use something that looked dirty for my daughter's baths. It did not happen to the green sponge, which I would reccomend.	
1. 	I thought I'll purchase this to try on my 4 month old since he was so strong that he got out of all the swaddling blankets (no matter how tight we made it) and either end up without a blanket in the middle of the night or scares on his head from scratching during the night. To my surprise, this swaddle worked really well and he was unable to get out. It kept him warm during the winter season and I do not have to worry about him catching a cold from kicking the blankets away. This swaddle is easy to use and does not restrain my son from kicking - which he loves to do. Even after many washes, the valco maintained its strength. A very nice product overall.	
- 1	I hate this diaper pail. Like really hate it.  The pop-up door is too small to fit anything into, especially with the bulky, bulbous air freshener holder thingy sticking off of the bottom of the door.  The air freshener disc rattles around in that thing making an annoying noise each time you pop that stupid door open.  It does seal tight, holding most odors in, but it's just such a pain to use that when I bought a second one, I just went with a garbage pail with a one-touch lid.  Cheaper and way nicer.	
- 1	I found this product awkward to use.  The cut outs for holding the pump could be better designed and so could the bra itself.  I only use this if the other handless pumping bra (Simple wishes) is in the wash.  I would not purchase this bra again or recommend it to anyone.  Unlike the simple wishes bra, once you've finished pumping, you have to take the bra off bc it's so uncomfortable and conspicuous under clothes.	
- 1	It's so small!!! Barely fit four diapers. I was under the impression that it was large! Quite annoyed about it.	
1. 	My little 2 1/2 month grandson was delighted with this! The blinking lights, different sounds kept him amused. I would recommend this to anyone.  Price & Quality were exceptional through Amazon!	
1. 	This makes it quick and easy to sterilize.  Four minutes in the microwave.  Fits four bottles in the center and nipples, etc. around the outside.  We use it daily.  Works best with distilled water- less residue- but tap water is fine too.	
1. 	my daughter loves this for the past four months (she is 9 months now).  Still will play with it.  only reason i didn't give it a five star was that the food cup in the bug comes off way too easily.	
- 1	The voice is too low that baby can only hear it when the surrounding is exactly in silence, which is very rare.	
- 1	I realize no product will work for everyone, but I honestly believe that this didn't work for us due to its design and not my daughter's preference. A minor issue is the girth of the jar, which seems a little much for a small toddler to handle comfortably, although the silicone grip helps some. The main problem though, is the lid. The opening is recessed, while the rest of the lid is flush with the top. Which means, tip the cup enough to dribble (and I do mean dribble, my final complaint is that the air vent is ineffective so the water doesn't flow fast enough) and the flush portion of the lid bumps into the child's nose. Which means she has to tip her head way back in order to avoid squashing her little nose while waiting for water to drip into her mouth. I payed the (in my opinion, ridiculous) price for this cup because I thought it would provide a more natural transition to an open cup, but watching my daughter try to use it showed me that's not the case.In the end we settled for plastic and bought the ThinkBaby straw cup, which she has used successfully from eight months old. The straw cup helped her develop great water drinking habits, and at two years old she drinks from her little Libbey and Ikea juice glasses every day. Apparently a transitional cup wasn't necessary.Two stars for the concept, and silicone grip.	
- 1	Updated January 3, 2014.  I received a new one of these and this one won't stay shut off.  Turns on and runs great, but when you turn off the sound and projection, they come back on within 10 seconds on their own.  So, I sent it back to Amazon (Thank you, Amazon for the amazingly quick turn around with a replacement!).  The replacement arrived today and same thing.  Turns itself back on after 10 seconds even if it shuts itself off with the timer.New Review: I've purchased 3 or 4 of these because my son loves the jungle projection on it.  The projection is always the first to crap out.  I just received a new one today and guess what?  This one won't turn off.  I got it all set up and turned it on.  Got it positioned and went to turn it off.  Turned off and then 5 seconds later it came back on all by itself.  Now the only way to get it stay off is to unplug it, which means that I have to reset the sound each time.  Seriously?  These projection sounds machines (the Munchkin one and and the SoundSpa one) are junk.  JUNK.  Save your money.  Don't purchase them!Original Review: Got this a few months ago and loved it. However, it has started shorting out. If you turn on the noise and then the projection, the whole thing turns off. And then when you can get it on, the projection doesn't turn. Grr.	
- 1	Like many parents to be we found ourselves looking for reasonably priced nursery furniture and this seemed to fit the bill; multi use drawers and changing top, ample storage, clean design, and reasonably priced.It showed up in a big box, pretty well packaged on the outside with crush bumpers on each corner and running along the lengths of the box. So far so good right? Apparently they must have spent all their packaging budget on the outside of the box to prevent damage and very little on the inside, there's damage to a few of the pieces including the main top board corner. Although there were a ton of crush bumpers and corner braces they still neglected to adequately protect the pieces inside. Contrast this to the crib I just assembled last night that had the main pieces wrapped in sheets of foam and therefore didn't need the multitude of bumpers and braces. Sometimes spending more to package it right inside the box makes more sense than making the outside bulletproof.On to assembly, I've assembled many cheap particle board based furniture in my day so I regretfully dismissed the reviews here about assembly difficulty. I grew up on K-mar and Ikea furniture assembly, how bad could this be? Apparently I've fallen off my high horse, the assembly design of this thing makes Ikea assembly look like genius design, a beacon of pictorial assembly art, and a shining example of using as few as possible different bolt/screws combinations. This literally came with a big bag of bolts. Do yourself a favor and download the assembly PDF from the manufacturer's website: [...]. Now take a look at the assembly hardware list. Confused yet? I resorted to counting the specific screws to make sure I was using the right one at times, in fact I probably spent more time making sure I was using the right screw than I did actual assembly, it was a game of logic to figure out which screw is which # on the part sheet and some were packed in the wrong pouch.And about the hardware, drawer rails were completely plastic, even the dowels to connect pieces were plastic. I guess the design was tested to make do with plastic but the cost cutting is apparent and noticeable. The drawer rails are completely made out of plastic which seemed odd to me for such a crucial part, they are also hammered into the panels and use no hardware whatsoever. Not sure how much they saved with this design but doesn't give me much confidence that it's built to last. The design has also been changed and instead of updating the assembly instructions they chose to add a separate insert to call out that parts xyz are deemed no longer necessary and to ignore in assembly, this tells me the company is focused on saving cost of updating printed manuals vs. the customer experience. There are also pre-drilled holes that are not used and add to assembly confusion. Again a sign of we changed our mind but we'll let the customer figure it out. Onto the pictorial assembly, download the PDF so you can zoom in and see the parts and orientation much more clearly than the provided print copy. Instead of laying out the pieces and coming back to them in the same perspective, they'll abruptly change direction (flip the picture) on you and made me question if I had it right. The logic of the assembly is also suspect, it stops assembly of the frame mid way to focus on the drawers which in turn draws out the time where you would have parts just strewn about the room. It's an odd choice and something I fell into since I was following directions.On the bright side, the company is readily wiling to send me replacement and assembly parts free of charge. Awesome right? A manufacturer that stands behind their product but.....it could take up to 10 days to get your part. So here I am now with a 50 by 42 box siting face down on in the nursery with assorted parts still laying around that's making it harder for me to work on other parts of the room now. Lesson here is that yes you can get parts easily but plan on plenty of room to assemble and be prepared to wait if you're missing hardware and/or replacement parts.We will keep the piece now that I'm already 80% complete but I would reconsider given how much time it's taken to get assembly this far (4-5 hours already). If I paid myself $20/hr to save the headaches and for an easier to assemble and higher quality piece I could have bumped up the budget to a different price point and gone with something else.It's not a terrible piece of furniture but be forewarned what you're in for.EDIT: It's been 8 days now and I'm still waiting for replacement parts to arrive and the latest shipping update shows I have another 4 days to wait. Mind you, this shipping to PA, if you're further from Canada it could be longer still. I've had a 80% finished dresser hanging around the nursery over a week now and by the time the parts show up it will be close to 2 weeks since I even started to put this thing together. In retrospect, this is not a delay I need in getting the nursery ready. Be warned and account up to 2 weeks after receipt.....	
- 1	I use this for baby food. I thought silicone would make it easy to pop the cubes out, but because the cubes are right next to each other the whole tray is like a rock. You can't get the food out unless you thaw it a little first. I tried peeling back the silicone and actually put a little hole in it. It would work better with a little space between each cube like a normal ice cube tray.	
1. 	one person posted that you need a new screw size as the plate is thicker than standard - this is true but mine came with the longer screw.	
- 1	Unless you have a less than 6 pound baby this is useless.  My son was 8 lbs 14 oz at birth and could NEVER use this insert.  It was a  waste of money and it was too late to return.	
1. 	I actually bought this at Target in green, but it is an absolute MUST.  My diaper bag didn't come with a changing pad, and I like this one because it is much easier when you are out and about to grab this and run into the bathroom then to have to lug the whole diaper bag in with you.  I don't use the little black plastic wipe container it came with though but that is my personal choice, there is nothing wrong with it, I just slide a half empty regular wipes refill in there and it fits just fine.	
1. 	We bought the Cloud B Twilight Constellation Night Light for my 1 year old daughter. She loved it. I think it is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has a young child.	
- 1	We just received the cup and no hanger when we ordered it on Amazon. Had to do a return and they refunded our money. Cannot rate the product as we never got to install it on the car seat. Its funny that Britax does not include these with the car seats as it is standard on most of the other brands.******UPDATE  May 2013****So I now we had to have a cup holder I ordered another one and was not at all impressed by this when I received it. firs of all it sticks out way too much from the car seat and can easily be damaged in time if other passengers regularly seat next to the car seat. Shame on Britax for not having an inbuilt cup holder after spending close to $300 on a quality car seat. Because of this our 2nd car seat is not a Britax.Updating from 1 to 2 stars as this time I actually got the complete product. I think the missing component issue is a Britax issue and not a Amazon issue as I have seen a lot of reviews with complaining about missing components on various other retailer websites.	
1. 	We were trying to transition our daughter to sippy cups and we were having some difficulty.  We were able to get her to start using the soft spout cups for water, but milk she would still only take from a bottle.  Maybe it was just time, or maybe there was something to these cups, but now she drinks milk solely out of these.Pros:- They are a nice size for little hands to manage.  Now at 16 months she is able to use the largerGerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Varyones as well, but when we first started transitioning, the bigger ones were too awkward for her to maneuver.- It's nice that the lids and valves are all interchangeable between the 7 and 10 ounce models. Organization has not been our strong suit since the baby came, so it's nice not to have to worry about finding the right one.- Everything cleans easy in the dishwasher, we just place the valves in thisMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Varyand have had no problems.- They have lived up to their spill proof name, as well as proven rather sturdy.  My daughter still likes to toss these to the floor, though with less regularity at least.  Despite all the impact to the hardwood floors, they have held up to the abuse and continue to not leak or spill.- The cups have little ounce markers on the side so you know how much liquid you put in the cup and/or was consumed.We liked these so much, we bought two more sets of them.	
1. 	we bought this chair to replace our bouncy seat, because my son hit the 25 pound weight limit at four months and we decided to find him something else to sit in, and this worked just fine.  i love that the weight limit is 40 pounds!  the toy bar could be nicer, neither of my kids ever cared much for the toys, but they both enjoyed the chair itself.  good investment for very large babies, like mine!	
1. 	We used this all the past summer, it was very convenient to carry to Central Park, it looks pretty, is durable.	
1. 	I am glad I got this size, as I am very busty but apparently my nipple size is smallish (I honestly think I am very average, but the standard size breastshields are VERY wide).  The standard ones worked fine for me, but they were uncomforatble when I pumped both sides at once, and these are much more comfortable (less suction/less breast tissue in the shield when pumping).	
1. 	I LOVE these bibs!  We've used these and two other types and these are far better.  They're the right balance of water repellent and flexible.  I dont like the cheap plastic Gerber ones because as my daughter moves, they're all over the place.  These stay put like a t-shirt.  Also, they're easily washed.  I threw them in the wash and they even accidentally made it through the dryer too... while I wouldnt recommend drying them, they seemed to survive.Our daughter at 10 months though has figured out how to pull on them to unvelcro them from her neck...so I may end up modifying them to use a snap.  But it doest take quite a bit of effort on her part to get them off.	
- 1	It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid. It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids. For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably. Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss. If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance. But should not have any issues in carpet. Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product. Going back to fisher price bouncers.	
1. 	These bottles have been perfect for us.  We started bottle-feeding out of necessity when our baby was only 6 weeks old, and these bottles have worked perfectly.  They're BPA free, which means we don't have to worry about heating them.  We haven't had any trouble with the nipples, and we're currently using the Stage 2 (3-6 months) size.We love these bottles and their classic design.  And the price is great (BPA-Free plastic bottles often cost $12 each).  If you are bottle-feeding, I would recommend getting at least 12-15 of them so you don't have to wash and sterilize bottles everyday.	
1. 	I don't know why they call this a mobile since it has no moving parts, no motion or sound, it just hangs there.  That being said, this is the best toy I've gotten for my 10-week-old son so far.  I don't know why he loves it so much, but now the changing table is his absolute favorite place to be.  He smiles, laughs, and flails his arms and legs in excitement any time we get near it, and would probably stare at it laughing and cooing for hours if I let him hang out on the changing table that long.  Its been a real godsend for distracting him from his hunger screeching at 6am while I'm trying to get his diaper changed first!	
1. 	I saw this product when I was pregnant with my now 18 month old son. I wanted to get it, but had trouble justifying a $35 nightlight. For months now, bedtime has been a nightmare, sometimes taking two hours for him to fall asleep and my needing to be right by his side. For Christmas, my son received one as a gift, and he is so enchanted by the nightlight, that he is instantly calmed when it is on and drifts right off to sleep. I cannot say enough great things about this product. My husband is also quite thrilled with it, and we may need to get one for his office.	
1. 	If you want to nurse discretely, this is the way to go. It has a adjustable neckline that allows you to see baby as s/he nurses, a build in burp cloth at the edges and provides adequate coverage.	
1. 	We love this baby shampoo because it washes out easily.  Nothing is worse than a baby shampoo that requires lots and lots of water to rinse out so that the baby loses patience and starts crying in the tub.  This shampoo cleans well but washes with a few rinses of clean water.  In fact, we like this soap so much we use it as an overall body wash as well.  The smell is also pleasant and not too strong.	
1. 	we bought this for our other car. It's easy to install and color doesn't make our car seat but it's cool because you can't see it once the carseat is clicked in.	
1. 	I purchased these when I went back to work for an extra set of pump supplies.  Buying this set was more cost effective than just buying the new pump parts (without the bottles and bags).  They worked perfectly with my Medela Pump in Style.	
- 1	Hate to be the bearer of bad news, because I too was initially really happy with this bassinet.  Our brand new Notting Hill Bassinet  fell apart with only a few weeks worth of use. (SEE PHOTO GALLERY!)  We barely used it, followed all of the installation directions carefully, and our child was well within the weight limit.  We have a 3.5 week old (now roughly 8 pounds) who actually doesn't even spend that much time in it. This morning I  noticed a roughly 6 inch tear in the side stitching, which is essentially what holds the mattress of the bassinet up. The 6 plastic side straps are a bit deceiving because they are  cosmetic vs. functional - in other words, there is really little holding the mattress (and your baby up) other than cloth that is stitched around the metal bars. If the stitching goes, so does the mattress. I am in the process of contacting Graco regarding this, but wanted to alert others first. This is not a cosmetic flaw. It is a potentially dangerous one. Again, I have included a photo of the damage in the image gallery. If you bought one, return it.If you already own one, and can't return it, please keep a close eye on the stitching. Ours fell apart very suddenly.UPDATE AS OF 9/13/11:I was issued a full refund without question by Rubbermaid (owns Graco) for the amount I paid on Amazon. I had to provide them a receipt. They sent me a prepaid shipping label for the bassinet so they could take a look at the damage themselves. IF YOU HAVE ONE, CONTACT GRACO ASAP AND REQUEST A FULL REFUND. [...]Good luck and happy babies!	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift and I was very excited about it at the time. Unfortunately, once my baby was born I found out that it was absolutely worthless!  I was disappointed at first because the white noise was so quiet, then a few days later the music stopped working, and then the light wouldn't turn off unless you unplugged the whole thing!  Eventually the music started skipping like a scratched cd. So basically the only thing that I can use it for is for the mp3 plug in, so it's junk and I never use it.  I'm bummed that my poor friend spent money on this stupid thing.	
- 1	I have tried several kinds of bath mats and this one so far does the best at staying in place. To avoid the brown slimy stuff that builds up from everday use, I hang it up when done using. I have had this for about a year and several of the fish & shells have fallen off and one elmo has almost completely detached. Seems like most products these days only last a year.	
1. 	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.	
- 1	We usually use flips covers with cotton prefolds (snappi'ed) and they don't leak. The Thirsties leaked all 3 times I tried to use it. Maybe I have it sized wrong with the outside snaps, but I can't figure out how to use it without it leaking. Maybe it also is because we've got a skinny baby (4th% for weight) and Thirsties fit chunkier babies better. But I didn't like these.	
- 1	I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem. I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag. However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet. I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle. I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook. I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded. I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.	
1. 	This is great.  Unlike other car seat protectors this is heavy duty and won't cause the car seat to leave marks on your seats through the protector	
- 1	I was looking for a side hip carrier that was comfortable and attractive. This is not it. I am constantly rearranging myself or trying to straighten out the waist band and shoulder cushion from riding up in order to be comfortable.	
- 1	I received these as a gift.  The material is very soft and I love the pattern but it started pilling after one wash.  also it comes undone easily as a swaddle. i like it better as a stroller blanket.	
- 1	I was a child passenger safety technician for 9 years so I have had experience with tons of different car seats and boosters.  I am a big fan of latchable boosters and was very happy to see one come on the market with a lower price point.  Unfortunately, this seat has a huge design flaw.  The two LATCH attachments each have their own straps to pull to tighten them.  They are placed one on top of the other with a single push button to release both.  Problem is, the push button doesn't press tight enough to hold both straps tight so the side that runs on the bottom doesn't lock in place.  The end result is that when you install the seat and tighten the LATCH attachments, one side stays tight, but if you pull gently on the other side, it will pull away from the vehicle seat about 5 inches.  It is essentially the same as installing the booster with only one LATCH anchor, which most of us would never do because it isn't safe.  How will this perform in a crash?  Who knows?  My guess is, when the child and the seat start to move forward (which they will before the seatbelts fully engage), the LATCH on one side will engage causing the seat to pivot toward that side which will put the child completely out of position behind the vehicle seatbelt.  Or, it might function fine.  Unfortunately, I'm not comfortable letting my child be Graco's crash test dummy.I called Graco and the rep was absolutely useless.  She just kept telling me the seat could be used without LATCH and that LATCH was only to make it easier for the child to buckle himself in and that the seatbelt is what holds the child in.  I kept trying to explain that I knew the seatbelt held the child in, but that the crash dynamics can change when one side comes loose in a crash and the other doesn't and I guarantee Graco hasn't crash tested a seat with LATCH that is not functioning properly.  I was very bothered when she went to talk to someone else and came back and sounded out the word projectile like it was something she had never heard.  My level of faith in Graco and their customer service just went way down.	
1. 	I bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was BPA free. When I got it home and opened it I saw the dreaded #7 recycle code on the white part. I contacted Baby Bjorn to clarify. Here is what they said:BABYBJ&Ouml;RN and Plastic Safety: When it comes to the material used in the production of our products, we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety. To guarantee the safety of our plastic products, all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Kitchen and Bathroom products are tested by Specialized Technology Resources (STR), an independent global provider of quality assurance testing. All plastics used in the production of our Kitchen products fulfill the demands of the European (EEC),and the American (FDA) Standard for plastics, and are classified as food-safe. Through testing, all of our Kitchen products have been designated PVC-free, phthalates-free and lead-free. Recent studies by health organizations such as the National Institute of Health have raised concerns about the safety ofBisphenol-A (BPA) in plastic products. BPA is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic.Polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach BPA. Polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any BABYBJ&Ouml;RN baby products and all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN products with a plastic component are BPA-free. More specifically, the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN plate is made of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic which is certified BPAfree. While both polycarbonate and ABS, along with other plastics, have a recycling designation of 7, there is no knownhealth risk associated with ABS.I decided to keep it and see how it goes, even though I prefer using glass or stainless steel items. I like that this one is NOT made in China, like so many things tend to be.	
1. 	Fantastic little booster seat.  It's the only one we own.  Perfect for our small home where a traditional stand alone sort of high chair just won't fit around our table (I use it on an IKEA Stefan chair).  My little one has been using it for the past couple of months, starting at about 7 months of age.  Easy to adjust straps and simple to snap on to any chair.  We've carried and used it on long trips to grandma's, at various restaurants and it has worked perfectly each time.I've never used the removable tray and lid.  No need to-- the snap-on tray washes easily.  After a few very messy eating sessions I've taken the whole chair into the tub for a wash down... so easy!I highly recommend this seat.  It's made of a sturdy plastic that looks like it's going to hold up for a very long time to come.  It's way more useful AND economical then any stand alone high chair.	
- 1	Mine was included with the set I purchased. The sheet is as soft as some of the others that I have purchased, also it doesn't fit my mattress very well. It is a bit too tight, and it can't be my mattress, because the others fit perfectly.	
- 1	You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.	
- 1	I needed more rings to secure toys to high chair, stroller and car seat. These rings are very colorful, but they are quite flimsy and do not secure very well to anything, they are too bendy. You clip them together in a chain and baby just pulls them apart. Use them to tie up toys and the rings and toys just hit the floor. Baby likes to teeth on them so they stay on the playpen.... cannot be used on the go because you will lose your toys. I would not really recommend these rings, try a different set. These are not practical at all for their primary purpose.	
1. 	We've had the Dekor for 8 months now and are very pleased with it.  It's easy to use, looks good, and mostly keeps the stinky diaper smell out of the nursery.  I mean, you have a bag full of poopy diapers....I think no matter what trashcan you use some stink is going to get out.  But I love that with the Dekor bags you can just cut it off wherever you want and toss it in the trash without feeling like you're wasting a bag.  One thing that could be made better, though, is to have the lid swing all the way open when you're changing the bag cartridge out.	
1. 	I received one of these as a gift, and it took me a while to open the product - I had planned to use theBaby Bond Flex Nursing Sash with Removable Burpcloth, Night, Large/X-Largebecause it is supposed to cover the boob rather than the baby. After eventually opening the apron-style Bebe Au Lait, washing it, and tossing it in the baby bag, I can't imagine trying to use the boob-covering sash.My husband jokes that this cover is a giant napkin, as it catches the spills which inevitably result from eating pasta and burgers with my non-dominant hand. I looked for another cover so I could have one in the wash to remove the evidence. After considering other brands available on Amazon, I got another Bebe Au Lait. Here's why:- The terry pads at the bottom give it a little weight to keep it from blowing in the wind. I haven;t used them as pockets or burp wipes yet but see how they can be handy.- The viewing window support has stood up to repeated washings and being folded/twisted to put it in the baby bag- The buckle on the neck strap stays in place - size once and don;t worry about it after washing and using several times.- It's available in subtle patterns. Having a big apron across me is a big enough advertisement that I am feeding my baby - I don't need lime and pink paisley drawing extra attention to that fact. The mosaic pattern is primarily white and brown, and reads like brown or gray from a distance. My other cover has a pattern of abstract flowers drawn as a white line on a gray background, which I also like.Based on reviews, other covers seemed less robust and made of lighter materials.The cons of this product are the same as any apron-style nursing cover:- it can be moved by the baby (I don't think Baby Bond would be immune to this based on how my baby grabs my clothes)- It gets hot in the summer - babies are little space heaters. I minimize this by moving the cover off my baby's bottom half, covering only his head and my boob, and holding the cover out for some air ventilation- It doesn't hide your back, so if you nurse bottom-up (like pulling a t-shirt up) it can leave your back exposed. I don't care most of the time, and use Nursing Tank By Undercover Mama or a top which allows top-down access in situations where I care.- People standing behind you could theoretically see in, especially if you're seated. Honestly, I don't care. I use a cover to respect other people around me by not blatantly flashing my boobs. If a passerby happens to catch a glimpse in once baby is going, they don't see anything they couldn't see at the beach or in a Victoria's Secret ad. If they have a problem with this, it's their problem, not mine!- It doesn't have a L/R reminder feature, which I don't care about at all. I only use this while out, not at home, so keeping track on the cover doesn't make sense.I'm glad I ended up with this instead of the Baby Bond: it reliably covers your nipple for latch-on, is easy to put on and take off, and doubles as a SuperMommy cape.All the best to you in your breastfeeding journey!	
1. 	I love the Dr. Seuss designs on these Superbibs. They are gender neutral and very cute. The bibs can be wiped clean in between uses and hung to dry. By the next time you want to use them, they are ready to go! I do throw them in the washing machine from time to time and hang dry, to clean off the food that doesn't completely come off by handwashing. Highly recommended. The are expensive but worth the price and hold up well, and you don't end up scrubbing baby food out of clothes!	
- 1	Why in the crap are mobiles over $50? I went to Toys R Us to buy a soothing mobile for my baby. I figured I'd spend around $20-30 tops for a name brand, quality item. Well hell no. I paid $55 for this sucker. I got it home and was totally disappointed that the animals don't actually MOVE (in a circular motion), they just move up and down. ????????????? Also, the colorful animals on the base of the mobile that you're just SURE will do something don't do anything; it's just a big sticker. The handy remote stopped working after a few days, and the mobile is so bright that it actually kept him awake instead of soothing him to sleep. After maybe a dozen uses over a couple of months, the thing has started just emitting a horrible, creepy carnival-like music and the animals don't light up anymore. Could the batteries be dead after using it 12 times??? If so, this is a horrible power suck. If not, the thing is defective, and what am I supposed to do since I've thrown away the box, receipt, etc?I'm totally over mobiles. I'm pregnant with my second now and that little goober isn't gonna have anything in his crib besides a paci and maybe that Sassy mirror that babies love. I refuse to get sucked into the BUY EVERYTHING moneysuck that new parents experience. Take that, Fisher Price.	
1. 	Such a clever little thing to have for those little teethers! They are a bit hard to clean but I guess that's because the mesh is so fine to avoid chunks breaking through!	
1. 	Baby sleeps in this every single night. The velboa is just the softest, nicest fabric. I really prefer it to the fleece. It doesn't get as hot, and it's just softer. Perfect for baby.	
1. 	This is a lot bigger than I anticipated. I know it says jumbo, but I just didn't realize how jumbo it would be. It works great though and holds a lot of stuffed animals!	
1. 	I got this when I was travelling, this is compact and easy to carry. Will surely recommend to anyone who wants their own feeding chair instead of using restaurants.	
1. 	My favorite feature is that is not only sways (side to side) but it rocks back and fourth as well. It easily folds up to fit standing up in a small space and the turning mobile is adorable. The only bad thing is that it doiesn't play soothing music for baby but I guess that's what Baby Einstein cd's, videos and dvd's are for.	
1. 	It took me 3 tries to finally find a great bottle brush. The bristles are a bit stiff but I don't mind the spraying of soapy water so much as long the brush cleans the bottles well! Made of durable plastic so hopefully, I'll still be very satisfied after putting this to good use!!	
- 1	I didn't realize that those bibs are made of some plastic-like material when I purchased them; they look really cute, but I don't know if I can trust the material! It smells very strong.	
1. 	We have a four-month-old daughter who has been using Playtex VentAire standard bottles for the past month with notable success.  They have worked nicely for the following reasons:1. The bottles did not cause the dreaded nipple confusion when transitioning between the bottle at daycare and breastfeeding when baby is with mom.2. Although it does have a lot of pieces, the fact that the bottle disassembles completely makes it easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect its various parts.The bottles have presented one challenge:1. Replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - can be hard to find.  Nipples wear out, and wanting extras to have on hand, I ended up buying extra bottles instead because it was nearly impossible to find the slow flow variety (and it was cheaper to buy extra bottles from Amazon than to pay the exorbitant shipping from the two sources who sold the nipples separately).UPDATE (3/2012): As my daughter has reached her first birthday, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. We have also used Playtex Drop-Ins. This is how the two compare:1. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).2. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). (In both cases, this refers to the slow flow nipple variety for each bottle.)2. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider.	
- 1	It was broken when it arrived.  I was very excited to get it and help to protect my kids.  But it arrived broken and I had to return it.	
- 1	I first received this bag and while unpacking it immediately noticed 2 areas with poor sewing where the fabric was coming undone.  One area was inside one of the exterior bottle pockets.  The lining was completely unsewn along the top.  The second area was on one of the backpack straps.  The padded strap was not sewn well and the fabric was coming apart along the edges.  I sent it back and received a replacement.  When I unboxed I looked it over to check for any similar areas and I found the same thing on one of the padded backpack straps.  The fabric was not sewn well and was coming apart along the edge.  I find this kind of quality control disappointing, especially in an expensive brand.  The first time I was willing to chalk it up as a fluke, but after having a 2nd bag with the same issue I am now suspicious of the quality of these bags and this brand overall.  I will likely send this one back for a refund rather than getting another replacement.	
- 1	The cart itself is adorable but it is not sturdy in the slightest and is incredibly difficult to put together. Some of the wood pushes into itself and wont go in all the way without a little hammering which scuffs it up. I would not buy this ever again.	
1. 	We recently bought a pack of these and they are the best cups out there. When dropped, the rubber valves stay in place. They are very easy to drink from and have a small spout which is easier for little mouths. The cars designs are so cute. They almost look 3-D with cute race track back grounds. Lightening McQueen is pictured on both cups. Can't go wrong with these cups. Highly recommended. Easy to clean too.	
- 1	I was looking for a spoon for our little one and I thought these would be amazing, and I was extremely disappointed.The rubber that was attached to the spoon was coming apart. When we got them I washed them and after I washed them I inspected them and noticed that the rubber on one was already peeling back from the metal. I did not even use these. I didn't feel that they were safe for a baby; if the rubber was already peeling back and they hadn't even been used yet, what was going to happen after these spoons are used all the time? I didn't think they were a safe purchase.Instead I went with another plastic spoon; not what I was looking for but a safer option.	
- 1	This didn't fit our coffee table and we returned it.  Other than that, there really wasn't anything wrong with it.	
1. 	Whoever invented sleepsacks is obviously a parent.  It's a genius way to give babies an extra level of warmth without the danger of a blanket in the crib.  Our girls know that putting the sack on at night signals that it's time for sleep which is even better.Bonus, when they get a little older and are starting to climb, it's much harder for them to climb out of the crib with the sack on.  :)	
- 1	the thermometer on this duck is lousy. the water has to be scalding for it to change color so it is not very useful for its intended purpose. as a toy, it is not great since it doesn't quack and is kind of hard plastic.	
1. 	having gone through several (cheaper) seats - and tons of clorox wipes cleaning up the dribbles off the toilet and floor - I read reviews and tried this one for my twins.  the adjustable mechanism makes all the difference in the world - as long as its adjusted snugly on the toilet, no leaks, dribbles, messes!  i bought one for each toilet that they use and it's worth the $, no question!	
1. 	I started out with an infant tub & one that has an insert to lay the baby on.  The plastic arm kept collapsing, dumping my week old baby in the water, even though I had a hand on him at all times.  It wouldn't stay up.  I bought this as a replacement.  It sits directly on the bottom of the tub & I only run enough warm water to submerge his bottom & legs.  He likes it much better & doesn't cry now when it's bath time (He's 13 weeks old now).  It's soft & absorbs the warm water, which is much more comfortable for him.  It does get a mildew smell if it doesn't dry properly, but that's solved by washing it every week or so on gentle cycle.  Once he's able to sit up, I'll go back to the infant tub (without the insert).  And this product meant to go in a tub not a sink, unless you have a large sink.  It's been great so far!	
1. 	This playgate is great! We used it for Christmas around our tree so our 1 year olds wouldn't get into it. The gate swings open nicely so we could get in or out to get to the tree. We have also taken pieces out and put it around furniture and worked nicely. It is kind of difficult to take pieces out to shorten it. Overall we're happy with it.	
1. 	I purchased this while pregnant because I could not see spending $40 for a Boppy.  I was not able to use this as a nursing pillow because it was too bulky for me, but I did use it for tummy time when my son was a newborn.  He is now 10 months old and I use it for play time, I plop him down on it, let him crawl over it, etc.  I never used the strap because it is a U shaped pillow and is already self-containing so I don't know why you need a strap?  Anyway, there is a pouch for the strap to go in and my son makes a game out of pulling it out after I tuck it away.  Overall, I like this pillow and I would recommend it for anyone interested in a Boppy.  I do have to say that I purchased my pillow at Wal-Mart for about $20 and it has a brightly colored jungle theme, so I cannot comment on the specific color/style being sold on Amazon.	
- 1	I love OXO products, as they are great quality and sturdy.  But my little one refused to have anything to do with the hard spout on this sippy cup.  Too expensive not to use it, but he never would touch it because of the spout.	
- 1	My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds.  I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)	
1. 	The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one...the second one was also damaged...I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one...It is a great crib! It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded. It can be assembled very quickly. So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!	
1. 	We've tried several different cups and these are by far the best.  They are easy to click closed, barely leak, and the valves come out easy for washing. My biggest head ache with sippy cups are reassembling the valves after washing and these are the easiest.  My kids also love them.As another reviewer posted you might need to replace the valves every now and again because they dont age well.	
- 1	I have a 2011 Ford Edge and it does NOT work to roll down the window with the shade on.  i properly installed it, and it gets all caught up.  Currently my baby is just 3 months, so we won't be rolling down the window back there anytime soon, but still.  I haven't tried another one so i can't give another recommendation unfortunatly.	
- 1	This is a cute idea, but the execution is virtually impossible!  The stuff is so sticky that you can't roll it out with their little wooden dowel at all.  The first imprint I did was fine, though not much detail.  Then trying to &#34;cut&#34; the stuff into a circle?  Disaster.  And then trying to &#34;poke&#34; a hole through the top with the straw?  Impossible!!!  It's so sticky and their tools are so dull that it doesn't work and by the time you've gotten anywhere the imprint has been destroyed.  I just threw the whole mess out.  Don't waste your money.  Get real plaster and do it with something better.	
1. 	I don't know why everyone has these reviews saying they leak, etc.  I have used them for over a month now.  Dishwasher every time (on the top rack only - with standard wash settings, they will melt if used during antibacterial or heated settings).  They are extremely easy to hold and fill and they seem to be perfect.  I guess everyone has there own opinions on baby products...	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to travel with! Works great in crib or playpin.  Our son is now able to rest thanks to this product	
- 1	If you are used to the sizing of the old made in USA and China FuzziBunz, then the new Made in Turkey FuzziBunz will be an unpleasant surprise. My experience only applies to the large perfect size. The new ones are at least two inches taller in rise in the back and much wider. My 24 month daughter (30 pounds, 35 inches) went from a trim fit in the larges made in China (on the second snaps in) to a bulky fit on the tightest setting on the new ones. All the extra material bunches between her legs and the diaper hangs off of her butt. The fleece is soft but more textured (I prefer the old ones better) and the leg elastic is less trim. Overall, I am not pleased at all with the changes and will be trying different brands with my second daughter due soon. Maybe if I'm still potting-training a year or 18 months from now, these will fit, but it's hard to imagine my daughter's already rotund belly getting much wider by then, and from what I understand, all sizes have this much higher rise and wider waist, so I'm doubtful the mediums would work. For now I use them only for overnight because they don't fit under clothes. It's a shame because I was a very much a FuzziBunz devotee. They have great customer service (they have replaced 5 of my diapers, several of which were out of warranty), but if I don't like the product any more, that doesn't help me much.	
1. 	I bought this for our 6 yr. old when she was an infant and loved it and repurchased now for our 6 mo. old. This was one of our favorites and had to make sure my 6 mo. old had the same toy. So glad they still make the toy, and it's exactly the same, well built and very entertaining for her. It's a toy I used for motivating both my kids to start crawling.	
- 1	I bought a MOBY wrap first.  After a few days I was tired of wrestling with 15 feet of fabric and then it was hot!!  This BB is so handy!  It will fit in the diaper bag and it is easy to put on like a purse and the baby fits right in.  It is also easy to get the baby to sleep and then remove and put in bed or swing.  This is much easier than lugging a car carrier everywhere (they're so heavy!).  This way you can leave the car seat in the car and just pop the baby in this sling to get groceries or go to the Dr. etc.  And if you don't like people to touch your baby all the time this is the way to go, they look but don't touch.	
1. 	This seat was great when our baby was a newborn. As soon as she started rolling over she could just roll out of the seat. Very dangerous.	
1. 	My kids 2-4-6 love this seat, well the 6 yr old I big for it, but he used to like it.  It's easy to transport and the padding covers hinges well, so no pinching!  It's comfortable according to them, and keeps them from falling in.  Easy to clean. Very happy  with the purchase.	
- 1	Thought I could attach this to a stroller. It won't stay is place. It will swivel and fall over regardless of what stroller I try to use it on. Not the best... just collecting dust now!	
- 1	Okay, not my favorite teething product but not worth my time to return either. I would keep looking if I were you.	
1. 	I bought a changing table that came with a thin, flat changing pad.  This is one of the only covers that works.  Yes, you do have to put something absorbent underneath, but this keeps everything in place and looks nice.	
1. 	This seat is perfect for when baby wants to sit up and look around, but lacks the strength and muscle coordination to do so.  For us, that was a short period of time, maybe 6-8 weeks.  Once he could sit up well, he didn't want to be confined to the seat for anything.We keep the seat out because I have 3 nephews under a year old, and the seat gets a lot of use.  One little guy still fits into it at 9 months old, another has thighs that are too big to let him fit comfortably in the seat (since about 6 months).This seat is neat, but its useful lifetime is limited based on your child's personality and lower-body size.  If you can get your little one interested, though, it's a great way to get him up and looking around.  I've seen covers for them, which seem like a good idea, but we always just used it without one.	
- 1	I bought this and it was perfect for the summer weather and fit comfortably, easy to put on and take off. But don't try to breastfeed or wear it during take off or landing in an airplane unless you take it off completely!!! There is a sharp pointy piece centered on the color coded part of the straps. Run your finger underneathe. That part cut my baby's head and made it bleed during take off, after the flight attendant informed me that flight regulations state that you CANNOT restrain your lap infant during take off or landing. I was not informed of this a month prior when I flew a different airline. So I unlatched the carrier and just let it hang down while I held my infant in my arms. All of a sudden my baby started screaming continuously. I assumed it was from pressure in his ears but he had flown before and didn't cry once. After frustration and tears from him and I both, I took off the carrier completely, stood up and faced him away from me, that was when I discovered the cut with blood. I panicked and immediately started feeling around the seat, my shirt, and anything else that could have possibly cut him. Then I ran my fingers along the part of the carrier that was right at the level of his head when he was screaming and that's when I noticed. They should have a RECALL on this model. Got asked if I wanted another model or refund from the company but not before I bought a different brand.	
- 1	Our diaper genie broke within a month! The month we did have it, it was a pain in the behind to mess around with tying off the plastic on both ends. I switched to a regular garbage can and don't have any problem with smell.	
- 1	If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would.  My Mom told me that all's I needed was a grinder to feed my baby, so I bought this one.  It never ground up a single piece of food.  My Mom was convinced that maybe I was doing it wrong and she had the same experience. Her reaction was they just don't make things they way they use to.  It was a waist of money and after many attempts, it ended up in the trash.  We ended up using a fork to mash soft foods and a small food processor for bigger stuff.  My next baby, I hope to invest in the Beaba Baby Cooker.	
1. 	Finally switched my 14-month-old to these (after using the NUK silicone spouts with regular bottles to ease transition) and I LOVE them! Did a lot of research on which sippy cups to get and these do not disappoint. I can throw one in my purse without worrying--NO LEAKS! It does take some determination for my kid to get the liquid out, but she eventually figured it out and now has no trouble. Same goes for grasping. Just took a day or two. Did I mention no leaks?? Highly recommended!!	
- 1	We needed a back up sleep sac since our baby has taken to puking at night.  We have a sleep nest which we love, but for some unkown reason i decided to try this as something different. The main thing that dissapointed me about this item is the thinness of it. You can literally see through the fabric it is so thin. I thought it would at least be somewhat substantial... but no... nearly weightless and totally see through. The sleep nest we got on amazon was much nicer since it was thick and the shoulders had snaps, so you can lay your baby down and then tuck them in with two simple snaps and a zipper. This one provides no warmth.  If i had not ripped the packaging when opening it.. I would have returned it.  Maybe we can use this for summer... but totally not worth the price of the item.	
1. 	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.	
1. 	These are abit thicker than the medela ones they gave me in the hospital but me and my baby seemed to like them better. Great for latching problems!!	
1. 	My brother and his family are a very green family!  They loved this gift.  They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!  My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's green test!  YAY!  I recommend this gift!	
1. 	My son is 10-months old, and we've been using this product even before he had teeth starting at 4 months.  We used it to clean his gums and rub the milk residue off it.  Works great, and he actually loves chewing on it!  I still don't understand how the tooth paste is flavored and good for you, but it does what it claims though.  I plan to purchase this product all the way up until he has a full set of teeth, before converting to a real toothbrush.  I only wished that it came with 2 of the gum cleansers, instead of only 1.	
- 1	My baby is a shade over 2 months old, can barely hold his head up... and is too tubby to fit in this seat. His thighs barely fit into the leg slots, and even in his thinnest footie pajamas i can barely wedge his diapered bum into the seat. (If i let him go naked he might fit a little better, but that would end up quite messy.) He's between the 75th and 90th percentile of weight for age, so he's big for his age but not huge. And even so, two months is pretty young for this product. The babies in the pictures are clearly older.If there were any information in the product description or on the packaging about the maximum size or weight of babies who can use this product, i might have been saved the trouble of finding out mine is too big.	
1. 	I bought this monitor and an extra camera because we have a 18 month old and a new born coming.  (I write this from the delivery room!) But our 18 month old was in a toddler bed but was sleeping anywhere but the bed, so we wanted to know what he was doing and that he was safe.  I couldn't ask for a better camera.  There are cheaper ones and more expensive ones.  I can't really get the color option, but I don't really need it.  Also, being able to hook this up to a bigger TV is AWESOME!  My wife just hooks it to our TV in the bedroom and we have no problem seeing our toddler.  With two cameras this works wonderfully. Nightvision is very clear with just a nightlight.  We have four portible phones, wireless internet, and other devices and we have had little to no interference.  This was a great purchase for less than 200 bucks.  Something that we can use in a ton of different ways.  We love this!	
1. 	The Playtex system works well with my Medela breast pump - you will need to buy these liners, plus a set ofPlaytex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage KitPlaytex storage rings (which these liners drop into). That kit comes with an adapter that fits on a Medela pump. The whole system is convenient and easy to move from frozen storage to feeding simply by dropping these liners into a bottle, and you can buy either latex or silicone tips for your bottles. The thin plastic allows the milk to heat up easily by submerging in warm water before feeding. Overall, very convenient and in almost 7 months of pumping, I never had a leak! Also, BPA free which is great!	
1. 	Received the crib recently, came less than a week after I ordered it, and everything was packed very nicely.We put it together last weekend and it looks gorgeous.The only issue was that some of the bolts did not easily work with the screws ... so it took a little bit to get the bed put together. We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material. I know it is a soft wood - so we'll need to be a little careful with it.It looked really high when we put it together, but now that the mattress is in it's fine.Very pleased with this choice.	
1. 	I'm a new mom trying everything for the first time and I recieved the diaper genie(the new one) as a shower gift. It's very simple and easy to use after reading the very short directions. This product is a must for my house since I have 2 dogs that love to get into the trash. The only time I ever had problems with the cutting mechanism was when it was filled too much and no big deal I cut it with scissors. And now I empty it when it needs to be emptied and have no problem. I don't put all my son's diapers into the pail if the diaper is just wet sometimes I throw it into the regular trash. But this is definitely helpful when it's a smelling diaper. My house and my sons room do not smell at all.	
1. 	dont know what I would do without these. My mother in law discovered these and i thank her. they can later be used for kids snacks when not needed for formula.	
1. 	I purchased this crib after researching the Consumer Reports research on cribs. This particular crib earned CR selection as RECOMMENDED, which definitely got my attention as they tested every aspect of it for safety and usefulness. The crib is fairly easy to install, although you might probably need the help of a second person. Million Dollar Baby (The Manufacturer) takes fair measures to protect the item while shipping. My personal experience was that some of the parts came in scratched or cracked. I contacted the Company and they sent a replacement that took WAY TOO LONG (like 3 weeks), only to ALSO arrived scratched!! I couldn't wait anymore so I decided to use the less scratched part since my baby boy was about to be born and I wanted everything to be ready. As far as construction goes, this crib seems pretty sturdy (if you install it correctly). I love the fact that this crib can be used by your baby basically all his life living in your house, as it can change to a full size bed! It is a very good investment because you have a crib, a toddler bed and a full size bed in one. It comes with all the parts needed for use as a crib and toddler bed; for the full size bed you have to buy the conversion rail kit which sells for around $90 here on Amazon. I like the fact that an Entity as Consumer Reports backs it up, because they test every item to the fullest extent possible in every possible aspect; so if they recommend it, that gives me peace of mind that the item should be safe and good quality (although as a responsible parent you should always keep a watchful eye and check everything twice). Recommended.	
1. 	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!	
1. 	These wash cloths are perfect!!!  Especially for newborns...but I also use them on my almost 3 year old.  I love that they are thin so they easily get in all the nooks and crannies of a newborn baby.  They are very soft so I feel ok about rubbing this cloth all over my baby's delicate skin.  The inexpensive price is also a huge bonus!!  I also love that these wash cloths wash really well.  I have washed them so many times and they still look like new.I highly recommend these wash cloths!!! *Great to add onto a baby gift!!	
- 1	This changing pad arrived, as some reviewers have mentioned, with the padding all bunched up. Regardless of whether the fabric is organic or not, I am pretty sure the foam included inside the changing pad is pretty toxic. I emailed LA Baby about this and never got a response, so I'm assuming they don't really want anyone to know how the company is meeting federal fire regulations through their foam. If you read carefully, the description never once mentions what the inside of the changing pad is made out of. If you are looking for an inexpensive changing pad free of polybrominated fire retardants, pick up the Serta Organic Contour pad which is listed for a mere 89 dollars on Amazon (really?), or you can find it at most popular chain stores for 29.99.	
1. 	What a lifesaver this swing has been for me.  We initially did not purchase one, but at two months old, our daughter was making it difficult for me to get anything done.  We purchased this swing primarily for the two different styles of swinging.  Thank goodness because our daughter doesn't prefer the front to back swinging.  In a matter of minutes, using the cradle swinging, she is sound asleep!  At eight months, she still loves this swing, but is now getting too curious about the fish.  It's time to remove them and just let her enjoy the aquarium.  We also have the cradle swing that doesn't have a mobile.  She uses this one at the grandparent's houses and likes it, but doesn't love it.  First time using it, she kept searching for the mobile and aquarium!!!	
- 1	It is both too long, too bulky, and too filled. I hated and could not get comfortable on this. Would not recommend	
- 1	Beware of this system.  We have owned this system for 2 years now.  We are on our 3rd monitor.  The video cameras work just fine, but the monitor is awful.  Our first broke after 15 months.  Because I didn't have a receipt, Summer Infant wouldn't exchange it.  I looked into purchasing a different system, but we already had multiple cameras, so I just decided to do the Secure Sight monitor again and save the Amazon receipt.  (Summer Infant offered a &#34;discounted&#34; price to replace the 1st broken one, but it was cheaper to buy a camera + monitor on Amazon.  Thanks for the &#34;great deal&#34;, Summer Infant!).  We are now 2 years and 4 months later and the 2nd monitor broke a few weeks ago.  I contacted Summer Infant. I had to email them a picture of my Amazon receipt and they sent me a prepaid packing slip to mail the monitor back to them.  The customer service rep said they would send a replacement.  I don't know how long it will take to get it.  Meanwhile, we are without a monitor in for the 2 year old we moved to a &#34;big boy bed&#34;!Picture quality is great, sound is great.  It is so frustrating because I am overall very happy with the quality, just not the longevity! I truly think they should last longer than 12-15 months.  If I were starting out completely over again, I would NOT purchase this system.  Because I already have multiple cameras, I just didn't feel like I could change brands, but we may have to if this 3rd one breaks.....when it breaks.....	
1. 	These were a must have for about 4-5 months during teething.  They are absorbent, although sometimes did &#34;leak&#34; through, but that is user error for not changing out frequently enough.  The colors held strong after many washes and the velcro has held up well.  I tried to fasten the neck prior to washing to prolong velcro like and it seems to have worked.  I love the pretty colors and the great price.	
- 1	We have been using this bed rail for a little over a month. It is a pain to use. Forget about trying to get it up when your child is already asleeep as it takes at least 10 minutes each night and you definitely can't do it in the dark. We thought it would get easier with use. Instead after a little over a month, the thing is broken. One side won't fold down. The other side, we were able to fold it down but can't get it up again. We spent 20 mintes trying to get this rail up last night and it would not work. I will be reporting this to their customer service to try to get a replacement or my money back.  I will update on that process. But needless to say, I would definitely not recommend this product.	
1. 	We use these for wrapping up blowout diapers at this point - our baby is still in the 'not bad poo smell' phase. Much prefer using these to individually wrap offending diapers than a whole diaper genie system (though we do have an Ubbi). Keep a stash in the diaper bag and you are covered. At first the smell of these bags bothered me (too close to baby powder smell) but now I'm accustomed to them.	
1. 	I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!	
- 1	I sent these back, because I was looking for something flexible. The description was misleading & said they were flexible, but these are a thin hard plastic- only slightly flexible. It looks like the description has been corrected now. Silicone would have been nicer. These were also quite small, so they wouldn't be good for use with a toddler. They probably would be better for spoon fed babies.	
1. 	This product is awesome. It was so helpful to keep track of feedings and diaper changes in those early, sleep-deprived days. Would definitely recommend and will likely purchase again for our next baby.	
1. 	This is loads of fun, handles on the side so small hands can hold, and then surprise the child can put their hand in the top, pull out their treat, eat, no spills, no mess,they can throw the cup on the floor and no spills.  We see many kiddo's at the zoo with these cups and just had to have one for our little girl.	
1. 	I really like these. I have been using these to convert my daughter's Avent 4 oz bottles to sippy cups. Perfect inexpensive accessory to save on the price of sippys. She is 11 months and has been using them since she was 6 months. I would have given them a 5 star rating if I could pick the colors. I got two green ones, which is fine, just wish I had a choice!	
- 1	The absorbency of these flats are fine, it's definitely only a daytime diaper for us. But the shape of them is so weird. They are rectangular and get misshapen after washing and drying, making them really hard to fold into a decent diaper. I recommend just making your own if you're going with flats, or we bought flour sack kitchen towels from Wal-Mart for $1 a piece and they are our absolute favorite cloth diaper. I'm okay with having a few of these in my stash, but I would never buy more. They are overpriced for what they are.	
- 1	We bought three of these car seats to use in three different vehicles -- two minivans and a small sedan. It has worked fine in one of the minivans, but we weren't able to use it in the other two vehicles. The problem is this: When using in rear-facing position, the seat will pivot backwards at the point where the belt slides through the back of the seat. The seat would have to be re-tightened and re-leveled after every use, and would often tip my daughter backwards to an unsafe angle while in use. It's also difficult to install because there's no level indicator -- the instructions say to line up a level with an indicator mark on the side of the seat. Learn my lesson... buy a higher-quality seat and avoid the waste.	
- 1	Not sure this is the product you ought to buy.  A couple of things to know:1. The bumblebee lights up and sings a song when you punch it.  Seriously, you have to punch it to get it to do anything.  Unless you're training your 3 month old to box, he's not going to be able to activate it on his own.2. The flex rods that hold up the structure are similar to the kind used in backpacking tents, except not as sturdy.  After about two months, one of the rods broke.  This causes the entire thing to precariously balance for a minute or two and then come crashing down on my son.  We've got it splinted with a chopstick and duct tape, but I don't think it's really working.And now my five month-old is angry that his toy is broken and I can't fix it right.  I think he's going to punch me.	
- 1	Terrible!! These replacement lids are terrible. In fact, this is a terrible product all together. The cups leak really badly.	
- 1	I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all	
1. 	Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.	
1. 	I purchased this for my 4 month old's stroller since we are currently in Germany and it's now freezing! It keeps him extremely warm and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this product! Completely worth it. Now, when we are out walking and going to Christmas markets or shopping I don't have to bundle him in 100 layers of clothing. I am very happy that we purchased this!	
- 1	I loved this seat at first, but it lasted less than a year. It eventually cracked in half. The bottom is poorly designed, it's just exposed foam that turned disgusting colors from becoming stained with urine no matter how much I cleaned it. The splash guard was awesome, but it just didnt last.	
1. 	kind of expensive but totally amazing at catching food that dribbles out of your baby's mouth.  and our baby enjoys looking in the cup and eating leftovers!	
- 1	Make sure to  keep your barcode. My toy organizer was too heavy for the suction cup.It repeatedly fell off the shower wall. It cannot be returned if you have thrown out the barcode.	
- 1	These nipples are thin and collapse easy . They are functional and follow the proper flow but they just are too weak.	
1. 	Best plate cover ever! Very easy to use. You just slide it over with the plug end. Noting to pull out or put back.	
1. 	I was concerned about the bells coming loose but these are so well made that it looks very safe&#8230;Baby loves to shake them and they are the best first baby instrument...	
- 1	You could probably make your own salt dough and save some money instead of buying this product. I was not impressed.	
- 1	Smells Horrible - Rubber smell is overwhelming even after washing it.  We got this thinking it was going to be similar to the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, sold on Amazon, but it s not. It is thicker, more rubbery sounding (squish squish) and tastes and smells horrible.  We are going to buy more of the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, it has a vanilla smell and is all natural rubber as well, much softer in texture and makes no squishing sounds.	
1. 	I love medela bottles, I love that they are BPA free. I love this product, I like the way it looks, the only thing I HATE are the bottle nipples. They look horrible and my two month old daughter does not like them at all. I went online and got other medela nipples, those she likes.	
1. 	These bibs are great!  My son is a super drooler and these have done a great job holding up to the test.  Colors look great and the price is great also.	
1. 	For weeks I boiled my ISIS pump parts and bottles, leaving on my non-stick pot calcium stain. As I was going back to work and my baby had to be bottle fed (thus more things to be sterilized), I found this great product and eagerly bought it. It's such a great invention! Everything (pump parts, nipples, dome caps, bottles etc) has slot of its own on the rack so they won't shift around. And if you keep the lid closed after sterilizing, contents stay sterilized for a day!Be sure to check your microwave power though, since it takes 4 minutes for a 1100watts microwave, longer for less powerful ones. Even though I have a 1350watts one, I do it for 4 minutes just to be sure!  And let it cool for recommended length of time to avoid scorching yourself.Enjoy this product and you won't regret.	
- 1	I liked this seat as a harnessed booster.  Once my son stopped using the harness (age 6), I found that the seat belt across the lap does not fall in the proper position.  The lap portion of the seatbelt falls across his lower abdomen not across the top of his thighs as it is supposed to.  According to multiple saftey organizations, the proper lap belt position for a booster is across the thighs, below the hip bones or it could cause serious injury in an accident.  I bought this booster thinking it would last until my child no longer needed a booster, because it transitions from harness through to a backless booster.  Not safe.  My advice, stick with a carseat and get a high back booster that converts to a backless that positions the belt properly!	
1. 	Love this pillow. When I was pregnant I started having a lot of back pain. This helped to relieve the pain and was very comfortable.	
1. 	This is an awesome sleep sack! No worries about loose blankets in the crib or baby being too cold. I put this on my five month old son over his footed pajamas and it works great to keep him warm and comfortable at night. It is very well made, and so soft. My son loves it!	
1. 	These are a MUST have for any new parent. These blankets are TRUE swaddling blankets (just like the hospital but MUCH nicer quality) not like a lot of the other blankets that claim to be swaddling blankets but are really just regular blankets. My son was a preemie (3.5 pounds) and when he came home from the hospital at 4.5 pounds this is all we used. We must have bought at least 12 of these and used every one without fail. My son was swaddled every time he went to sleep and he slept MUCH better. We actually used these much longer than most people do, we swaddled him for months and months but as time went on we just swaddled him around his waist with his arms out, it was a security blanket for him and he was just comfortable being swaddled. Now, obviously at 21 months we no longer swaddle him but these good early sleeping habbits really set the stage for his much longer term healthy sleeping habits that he has today. Do not hesitate, these are fantastic AND they come with a little sheet that shows you exactly how to swaddle in case you don't know how or forget. I kept that sheet on my fridge for months so that when my mom watched him she would have it in case she forgot (it's been many years since she's swaddled babies:) These come in many colors all white but with diferent colored dots (it's really a swiss dot print). blue, pink, yellow, lavender and sage green. They wash beautifully and always stay soft. The only color I would not buy again is the sage green as that one did fade, the blue, purple and yellow are all gorgeous, my sis owns the pink and that is lovely as well. Hope this is helpful! Pleasant dreams:)	
- 1	I exclusively pump, so my baby always gets expressed breast milk.  I switched to these bottles from the playtex drop-ins because my baby was spilling tons of milk from the sides of her mouth. These bottles work when they want to. You have to find just the right way to screw the ring/nipple to the bottle, but for the most part they leak. I have not been able to determine if it is the bottle itself or the nipple that makes it leak. If you close it too tight, then I have to interrupt feeding constantly so that I can vent the bottle, if I unscrew it to vent, it leaks all over the place. For milk storage, it is a great product, especially because it is compatible with the breat pump attachments as well as the medela cooler. However for feeding find something else please!	
- 1	We have beautiful wood cabinets and wanted to avoid drilling holes into them with the latches to prevent our infant from opening them.  We bought these cabinet locks for all the cabinets in our house (so we have a bunch of them).  They're extremely difficult to open (for adults), which makes them inconvenient when you're trying to get into the cabinet.  You have to push a button while applying pressure to the inner part of the hook and pull outwards...maybe wrapping rubberbands around the cabinet knobs would have been easier and more enjoyable to use.	
- 1	I was hoping to find a more economical alternative to disposables, but these pads didn't fit the bill.  They weren't absorbant or soft enough for me, and they didn't stay in place.  I'm sticking with my Lansinoh Ultra softs.	
- 1	If you put these in the dryer (even on delicate) they'll be too small. After washing, the sheet hardly fits over the 4 corners of the mattress & only covers half of the sides of the mattress. We have  standard sized Colgate mattress that fits our Graco crib perfectly. They should have made these a couple inches wider and longer to allow for shrinkage.  Im going with jersey sheets that have some stretch now to avoid wasting more money on sheets that are too small.	
- 1	These bottles were great for getting a breastfeed infant started on a bottle. We had several different bottles in stock, and this is the bottle our infant preferred. Unfortunately after a few months the bottles quit venting. So I bought two more and neither one of them vented brand new. I called the company and got no response so I returned the bottles and I guess we will be trying something else.	
1. 	My daugther plays with this walker since she was able to sit (6 months) and she's now 1 1/2. The way she plays with it has changed and she finds new things to do with it. It was also very helful before she started walking because she would stroll with it all the time.	
- 1	Our baby cried immediately! Babies should be encouraged to look around and hold their heads up - this is like a developmental step back.	
1. 	We received a number of swaddles as gifs before the birth of our first child and this was hands down our favorite swaddle. We had a big baby and he thrashed around quite a bit but slept best when swaddled. While the aden and anais swaddles were very soft and had cute patters on them he almost always managed to break free. We also liked the Woombie swaddles in terms of keeping him in the swaddle, but the zipper went up really high and we worried about choking him. The Miracle blanket was the best of all worlds because the inner arm flaps kept his arms in place so that we could wrap the long outer strip really securely. Highly recommend!	
- 1	PLEASE READ:I loved this at first, but am kicking myself now for using it so much!  My son slept in this for the first 10 weeks, including naptime.  He did tummy time, floor time, and was held a lot also.  He is 6 months old now and has been in a helmet for the past 5 weeks to treat a severe flat spot caused by positioning.  I did not know until it was too late that flat spots are not just caused from sleeping on their backs, but the car seat, swing, and this sleeper are far worse than the crib!  Being a first time Mom, I had no idea the harm I was causing.I did love the convenience of this--easy to move from room to room, and it folds small so you can take it with you wherever you go.  I have a small house so the size of this was perfect--no large pack n play to have to move around and fit into a small space.  My son still takes naps in it and occasionally sleeps the night in it (he is in a helmet now, so I figure it can't cause any more harm).  If I have another child though, this will not be used.My baby will be in a helmet now for at least 6 months to get his head near the normal range.  Beware and be careful!  The convenience of this is not worth the inconvenience and strain on the baby that it causes.Added to original review 4/25/2011:My son is now a year old and still has a flat spot, even after 8 months of wearing the helmet.  He will always have a flat spot, hopefully less noticable as he gets older.  The neuro-surgean said that his flat spot was the worst she had ever seen.  The improvement from the helmet is there, but since he started so severe, we just can't get it back into the normal range for head shape!  I can't tell you how much I regret using this rocker.  Imagine causing something to your child that you could have prevented.  I didn't know.  Don't make the same mistake I did.	
1. 	I have to say I have not been disappointed with this warmer, other than it should not be used with the Playtex inserts bottles (which is why it gets 4 stars) as it cannot sense the heat properly and makes them way too hot and doesn't shut off. My best advice? Read the directions! I was shocked at how little water it uses and thought I was reading it wrong. Do not use more water than the directions say for your bottle size! It is correct, and when followed it heats the bottle perfectly every time. All of the water disappeared and the light turns off when it's done. I honestly cannot understand how people could say they read the directions and it still didn't work, but hey that's just me. Definitely recommend! If you have the inserts, you can always use a plastic bottle and pour it in. A must have for when baby is home with daddy, grandma, or anyone else that doesn't have a ton of experience with properly heating a bottle (esp. breastmilk).	
- 1	The mat didn't lay flat or stay suctioned to the table. Milk cups repeatedly fell over due to this and rolled off table. It wasn't very easy to clean without soaking it everyday. We liked the thickness of it and thought the part the hung over the table was a good idea, but it just made a worse mess when the kids leaned over it.	
- 1	My son barely used this toy. Since we live in a small condo and this toy does not maneuver easily.Hard to turn around corners and hard to push on carpet.I got him a little shopping cart (which was half the price).It was light and he ran all around the house with it.http://www.amazon.com/CASDON-611-Toy-Shopping-Cart/dp/B000V5DHT0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1303583995&sr;=8-4And a mickey mouse ride on train which he mostly pushed around.http://www.amazon.com/Mickey-Mouse-34918-Plane-Ride-2dOn/dp/B000EX0DRSHe loved these other toys so much longer and used them more often.	
- 1	I got this because I wanted a natural teether. Well, it's just simply not entertaining enough especially when compared to the colorful Thomas trains my other child is playing with. I know it's supposed to be natural, but would a little color be so bad? Right now he likes gnawing on frozen asparagus more than he likes this (which is also natural!). There are ways to color toys that are natural too. Maybe it's better for younger babies, but mine got this at 5.5 months and liked it for about 2 minutes.	
1. 	This mat was wonderful and we just stopped using it at 13 months, the attached toys are still in use, however. Out of the box this wonderful and whimsical play mat even caught my attention. The giraffe helps hide the batteries and is part of the rainbow supports and also holds a mirror in its mouth. The green leaves are soft and hide a four color light circle that with either classical music or rainforest sounds change colors and pattern with the music. The toys were great for my daughter as she got older say 5 months and up. The parrot has a fun spinner perch, the monkey rattles, the toucan is soft with crinkles wings, the soft monkey has been put on the stroller because she loves its large soft hands and ears.Pros: Great for older babies. Gets and maintains baby&#8217;s attentions. Fun colors and lots of options for play and motor/visual learning and growth.  As our daughter grew, the supports were strong enough to use to stand and bounce a little. Fischer Price really did a nice job choosing materials that easily clean. For those  &#8220;Oh no&#8221; mornings, she would lay under the leaves and watch the lights change and roll to play on her own.Cons: Would have loved if the rainbows collapsed and could be easily removed for travel and/or storage. Takes a lot of C batteries BUT we have not had to replace them even after 13 months of solid use. Can only hang toys on designated soft hooks. Monkey did not come with hanging ring, I had to fabricate one. Overall though a great item and a godsend on most days!Would recommend!	
1. 	having gone through several (cheaper) seats - and tons of clorox wipes cleaning up the dribbles off the toilet and floor - I read reviews and tried this one for my twins.  the adjustable mechanism makes all the difference in the world - as long as its adjusted snugly on the toilet, no leaks, dribbles, messes!  i bought one for each toilet that they use and it's worth the $, no question!	
- 1	This cup broke within 2 weeks of ownership. Thats all I needed to know to not buy another. I did like the attached cap it has to cover the straw , but its simply wasnt spil proff and it broke so I'll pass.	
1. 	Great bathtub, I love the cloth part to hang the babies on. My only complaints are there are some nooks and crannies that don't drain (why they would do that I seriously have no idea) so you have to make sure to clean them out or it'll stink, and the padding started to come off after only a couple months of use, I'm sure I could fix it easily with some super glue though	
- 1	My daughter prefers the Evenflo Airvent bottles/nipples and I thought this looked similar and would be a good time to switch since we're now using formula.  The bottles are supposed to be made specifically to help mix formula/water better-it has a little spatula shaped rubber thing that sits down in the bottle to help mix it, but it doesn't really work and just adds another thing to clean! The nipple is too big and my daughter doesn't like it at all.  The bottle itself is too wide and my 10 month old has a hard time holding it herself.  Overall, I wouldn't bother with these-similac makes great formula, but should stick to that b/c these bottles are not good at all!UPDATE: I dropped this bottle (on our wood floor) while it was full of milk and the bottom completely cracked and broke off. So it's not durable AT ALL either!	
- 1	too light, almost white in color, not pink	
1. 	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!	
1. 	These are really easy to use and are great for the stove.  However, I am unable to put all five on because of their size or maybe it is just the spacing on my oven.  I have four on, but I was unable to put the fifth one on because we have three knobs right next to each other.  Since this was the case, I did not put one cover over the oven knob.	
1. 	well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.	
1. 	Overall, this is nearly perfect for what I wanted it for - cat litter.  It is small, which is perfectly fine for dirty litter from one cat.  I wouldn't have wanted it any bigger.  I don't smell anything coming from it, but then we finally found a litter that doesn't smell either, so it's hard to say.  I have a two-year-old also, so we have another diaper pail that's actually used for diapers.  I don't think I'd trade it for this for that purpose.  This is pretty small, we can fit about a weeks worth of dirty disposables in our diaper pail, and I doubt this would fit more than a couple days worth.  Nor does it have the extra flap that so many diaper pails do have to help with keeping smell in and kids out.  On the other hand, for the price, it's awesome.  We paid a LOT more for our diaper pail than this.It does fit standard grocery store bags, but they have to be smashed between the pail and lid to stay put.  Not a big deal.  Although small hooks on the sides to hold the bag would be a nice convenience.  I took off a star for two reasons.  The pail is plastic, which slides very nicely on hard floors.  Not exactly a feature.  It's an easy fix to buy little rubber stick-on feet for it, but it would have been nice if it came with them.  Second, the space for the foot pedal is small.  If I'm barefoot it's fine, but if I have a pair of shoes on it's hard to get my foot in there to step on it.  That said, for the purpose and price, I'd buy it again.	
1. 	I like having this around for easy bath time readings cause some times you think its fine, turns out its hot.	
- 1	I had the Nuby 5 ounce sippy and my son took to that but I wanted a sippy with a lid to keep the spout clean during travel. I saw this in a 2-pack at Meijer and thought that it was perfect since it held more liquid and had a lid too. But this leaked from the spout from the get go!I ended up buying a new one, such a waste of money this was!	
1. 	I bought these for my great granson & his mother is very pleased with them. very easy to use. It helps not having to wash a dirty bottle, just simple to clean.	
1. 	This mat provided my son with plenty of stimulation - blinking lights, swinging animals, and music.  This is where he perfected his motor skills.  All the cons are VERY minor and it's worth every penny spent.	
- 1	We bought these bottles a few months ago from a local store. Liquid routinely leaks from the sides of the lid, even when the flip-top is closed. We also had one bottle shatter when dropped from a few feet off the ground.	
1. 	es perfecta porque tienes la opcion de utilizarla facilmente en un recien nacido,tambien tienes espacio para agua limpia,o lo que tu desees..y a medida que el bebe vaya creciendo tiene espacio suficiente para el.I love it !!	
1. 	Baby led weaning is so messy, but this helps! He still gets food a little around the collar and on pants, so take off pants. Soft and easy to wear, pleasing designs!	
- 1	This car seat does everything it's suppose to do, it secures the infant tightly, has the sun-canopy and stylish looking BUT it's heavier than a ton of bricks.  The car seat alone is almost 30 lbs and then you put a kid in there, no weakling is picking this baby up. The knobs to push in are hard to push and it's difficult to secure without the base. Overall I wouldn't recommend just because it's so heavy and most likely a single mom isn't going to be able to lift it out of a back seat.	
- 1	We bought this for the diaper bag when my first was ready to potty train. My second is using the potty now, and I pulled it out to give it one more shot. It doesn't fit well on any toilet seat, public or residential, it slides around horribly, and it bows under my kids' weight causing the joints to catch skin. Both of my kids ended up sideways and screaming on the toilet with pinched thighs, and I had to support their weight to keep them from falling in. I wanted so badly for this to work, but it doesn't. :(	
- 1	The diameter is right, but it's way tooooo long! Don't understand why they design like that. You have to have nipples as high as 6 cm to use them. Or did I get it wrong?	
- 1	I wanted to like this wrap, practiced wrapping it over and over again, and finally gave up. I wanted something simple and easy, so it would take a second to put on. This wrap is not simple or easy, it took waaaay  to long to put on, and hearing my baby shriek while I was doing it drove me crazy. Plus, I was sleep deprived and exhausted, and figuring out fabric origami wasn't what I wanted to do after a sleepless night. I was never sure if it was too tight or too loose, and had to adjust it constantly. My son hated it as well, he was never comfortable in it. The wrap itself is hot and bulky, so I could not wear it if I took my son out for a couple of minutes. I would recommend trying it out &#34;in person&#34; before buying it. I bought a backpack style carrier, which is awesome and easy to use.	
- 1	Wish i could return this item. Not useful at all. Waste of my money. Doesn't even fit in my car lighter	
- 1	I bought these with the intent to put them in a diaper pail. They do not have any type of attachment or adhesive to do so. The package says they are specifically refills for the attachment, but the online description does not specify this. I had to put my own adhesive on these so not to waste my money on them.	
1. 	This sheet fit a regular-sized crib mattress nicely. We found the jersey has a soft brushed 'warm' feel to it, unlike a cotton sheet which can feel chilly to a baby on a winter's night. Cheerful, clear yellow blended well with our little jungle-themed crib bedding of greens, yellows and oranges.	
- 1	While the sheet serves its purpose, it's rough material and I am concerned it may irritate my son's sensitive skin. I'll give it a few more washes to see if it softens up a bit. Very low priced so I guess I get what I paid for.	
- 1	We have a tile shower.  I cannot get these suction cups to stick.  Two seem okay but the other keeps falling off.  I finally just gave up.  Good size net, though.	
- 1	I'm going to start by saying right now - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I applied these according to its directions exactly, taking good care to secure the suction cups tightly, while I was cleaning my car.I then went inside. I came outside five minutes later and both had fallen, each time I tried to re-attach them, they fell right after I attached them. I then decided to roll them back up and take them down, but realized that the casing that holds the shade actually cracked by falling on a cushioned seat repeatedly.In addition, I attached them in mild 50 degree weather and the heat sensor said it was 'HOT', much too &#34;hot&#34; to touch!These are the most faulty piece of crap products I've ever purchased! The heat sensor is a sham in EVERY Munchkin product I have purchase, the suction cups are extremely faulty, and the shades never roll back up!Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	
- 1	Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working.	
- 1	I ordered the flannel sheets and was shipped these instead. My husband didnt know so he washed them and I couldnt return them. They are very scratchy and not good material. There are better ones out there.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this blanket, but it's just too small. It's 5'x5' which barely fits one adult and 1 child. I need something a little bigger so that 2 adults and a child/baby can fit comfortably. It's a great color and the quality is good.	
1. 	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these, one for my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law's home as they are beginning the potty-training task with our grandson.  Although he is still too young to be able to handle climbing on this by himself, having it around the home now will get him familiar with the item and what its use is for.  I purchased all of the potty training items now for both homes so our grandson will become comfortable with them at both homes and learn what he needs to do at both homes too.  This step is very well made, sturdy, and doesn't have any sharp edges to hurt the little ones.  The top is slip-proof and has a rubber strip on the bottom to keep it from slipping on tile and wood floors as well.  Highly recommend.	
- 1	We've had it for 10 months, and it's pretty much DONE. It's sides are held by 4 plastic tubes (two at top, two at bottom). 3 out of the 4 already fell out or are falling out (i.e. no longer held by the stitching). AND, we had this right next to the crib, and one evening discovered our 8 months old was playing with one of those plastic tubes!!! She just pulled it right now. For our next one, we're spending more, and getting something that might actually last, and not be dangerous.	
1. 	Such cute design and it big enough that it covers a good portion of the front area.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't close tight enough around the neck so that sometimes food will get on the collar area.	
- 1	You get what you pay for! Baby hates these. They are so hard and too short under the lip so baby can't even auck properly on these. Soothies are the way to go!	
- 1	My son immediately tore the lid off the ball, then he shook it and threw it around, sending snacks flying everywhere, then he figured out how to unscrew the ball part and it was in two pieces. The Boon Snack Ball was entertaining for him but totally useless for snacks. Choosing design over function makes me feel like a yuppie idiot. (See my review of the horrid Keekaroo wood highchair). Lessons learned, I'm sticking with dorky uncool designs that actually work and make my SAHM life easier not harder!	
- 1	These cups leak more then any other cup we have owned (and we have a lot). If you want a good insulated cup try the Munchkin click lock sippys, or Zoli-Bot straw cups. These ones start leaking the second you put the top on even if the cup is only half full- it just starts pouring out the top of the straw! We just threw them all in the trash.	
- 1	These bottles completely did not work for us.  My son ended up sucking just on the tip of the bottle, giving him an even more shallow latch!  Even if you look at the baby in the picture amazon uses, he is just sucking on the very tip of the bottle.  For us, these are worthless.  I am taking them back today.	
1. 	These work very well with a Medela Pump in Style advanced system. We tried the others available on Amazon (in plastic bag, much cheaper and kind of misleading you into thinking they are Medela brand)... these work soooo much better, especially for the high volume &#34;exclusive pumping&#34; needs we have with no breast feeding. Why spend extra time pumping?	
1. 	Cleans easy, vents great, works perfect for newborns.  These bottles also fit into standard size heating element.  Easy to fit into the mouth as well.  Lovely new invention!	
- 1	This monitor always had a lot of static in the background. Sometimes it would not even work because of the amount of static. And now I havent even had this year and it doesnt work at all. A piece of junk! Save your money and buy something useful.	
1. 	My son was an early crawler & this was a a MUST HAVE. We lived in a townhouse & couldn't gate the stairs going up & down from living room so this worked to keep him in one area. Especially helpful as I'm a stay-at-home-mom & sometimes you just need those few seconds to leave the room to pee, answer phone, whatever. I also bough the extender to make it as LARGE as possible. 2 panels larger to be exact. My only complaint is that it is a little heavy & hard fold, which proved to be a pain when our home was on the market & I had to snatch & fold it up quickly for a showing. Definitely pinched my fingers a few times in my rushing around trying to do it quickly.  But the good news is it's VERY sturdy b.c it is so heavy. MY son could pull, hang do whatever & this gate held him IN. And my son is VERY tall for his age  and this gate stood the test of a very active toddler. Definitely hanging on to it for baby #2!!	
- 1	My toddler son received this monkey lunch bag as a gift and we both loved it.  It's really adorable and just the perfect size for his lunch.  The zipper works well, and I like the pocket on the inside.  His school has a fridge that the kids can put their lunches in, so I cannot attest to the insulation of the bag.After a month of use, however, my love for the bag started to diminish.  The bag is fabric, and the fabric isn't coated either on the inside or outside.  So anything moist or liquid that comes into contact with the fabric soaks right into the fabric and you can't simply wipe it clean.  Spot cleaning does NOT work.Fabric bag + young kid + food/drink = gross and smellyUnless you have time to thoroughly wash the bag every other day (or even weekly) with soap, water and a good scrub - but if you have a small child, I'm doubting you have the time for that.  Or the energy.Not only does it start to look grimy after a few weeks, but I'm sure it is teaming with more germs than the average parent would find acceptable for their kid's food storage system.After a couple months, I ended up getting theCrocodile Creek Classic Lunchbox - Solar System 10 x 7.5, which you can spray with cleaner and easily wipe down with a wet dishtowel to get it reasonably sanitized and cleaned.  However, the Crocodile Creek isn't perfect either: the zipper often gets hung up on the bottom corners.  It might be frustrating for young fingers.  But overall, it's a better choice than the Skip Hop in my opinion.	
1. 	Love the royal blue color.  Maybe it shrank a little?  I'm not sure, but it's a great fit on our baby's mattress.	
1. 	This little guy was one of our baby shower gifts that actually gets daily use.  It's cute, for one, but I really questioned whether or not it did much for my baby.  I don't think it did when she was really small, but the white noise seems to be useful for her now, at nearly four-months old.  We use this basically every time she sleeps, whether a quick power-nap or going down for the night.  We have it strapped to her crib (which she has slept in since before 1 month old) and have used it basically every day and night.  We always use the heartbeat sound since I think for now, having some consistency is probably the most comforting to her.  I think the monotony of the sound is probably best for little babies, too.  The whale sounds seem like they wouldn't be very soothing to anyone, of course, I'm not a baby, so my opinion probably doesn't mean much.Occasionally, once the sound stops, she will actually wake up, but turning it back on and rocking her a minute or less will have her out cold again.  I do wish you could have the sound on longer, for that reason.  I also feel like the plastic switch box is pretty cheaply made and find that the buttons kind of stick in a pressed-in position.  This has not affected being able to play it or anything, yet, but it's kind of annoying and I wonder how much more abuse the heartbeat button will take.Overall, I think that using this regularly comforts her AND she uses this sound as an association for sleeping and calming down.  I used to think I'd just set up and iPod and speakers in her room for white noise sounds, but this sheep has been really convenient and easy for us to push the button and be all set.	
- 1	I was so excited when I first saw that 3 sprouts had come out with a hooded towel. I really love the marketing & designs of 3 sprouts products and have purchased and been very satisfied with their products in the past. I was a little hesitant regarding the price of these towels ($30 for a child's towel ... really?), but the higher price point of their storage bins was worth it so I figured these towels would be as well. So I ordered two - the yellow monkey and purple hippo.Incredibly disappointed! Here's why:1)What is the main purpose of a towel? To DRY! These towels don't dry at all, they simply smear the water around!2)The t-shirt material on the back of the towel is not sewn to the inner terry-cloth portion and therefore makes drying even more difficult3)For a $30 towel, they aren't that soft. The back t-shirt side is, but not the terry cloth side that you are actually putting against the baby's skin. It is actually pretty rough.4)The towels don't wash very well. The faces pill very badly, wrinkle and become misshapen.The one positive of these towels is their nice and roomy size. I bought these when my daughter was almost two and was worried the hood wouldn't fit her head. The hoods are very roomy and the towel is nice and wide - wraps around her very nicely.Overall, these towels are incredibly adorable and incredibly unusable. For the price I spent on them I was expecting a lot more - At the very least I was expecting them to DRY!! :)	
1. 	Love the halo sleep sacks. This fits my almost 6 monther. I like the cotton ones because my apt is always warm	
1. 	I purchased these tubby toys for my grandson, he loves to play in the tub.  And the fact that they squirt is wonderful.  I can't wait until his next bath!! Amazon keep up the great work with wonderful selections!!	
1. 	My son would not sleep without this!!!!!!!!!!! It was a life saver for me and when he grew out of the size small I got this one in large and it worked perfect!!!!!!!!! It is the only kind he couldn't wiggle out of :)	
1. 	My sister had these on her coffee table and they were so much more effective than the ones we had that didn't stay on and were not particularly cushy.  These don't look as attractive, but they work and they stay put.  My toddler did manage to pull one off recently, but extra sticky strips are included, so I put new ones on and haven't had a problem with it since.	
- 1	These have leaked several times and they are way to thin. They would be good for when a baby is older and drinking less.	
- 1	Poorly sewn and cheap material but since I love the pillow itself I guess I am stuck using their covers. Being a new mom who has Time to make your own cover (as I type this one handed!)	
1. 	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.  At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!  It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.  I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.  The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.	
1. 	baby like it a lot. she like to watch herself in the mirror, and also like the monkey with long tail.	
1. 	This took seconds to install and was working great from the beginning.  I put it at about 7 o'clock.  I am not sure why this has so many negative reviews, our little girl bangs the lid up and down a quarter inch testing it every day and it has held up well so far.	
1. 	This gate is really a great product. I love the fact that you don't have to hardware mount the gate (no drilling into the doorways required), and it's still very sturdy. It was incredibly easy to install, and is very safe and secure. My 18 month son knows how the gate opens, but cannot open it because of the weight required to push down on the lever. The only negatives I encountered were:1) The first Hands Free gate I purchased was not painted properly, so I had to return it for another one.2) I had to buy the 5&quot; gate extension for the gate to fit in the doorway. So, in the end, there are additional costs if the opening you intend to use the gate for is not that narrow. But all in all, it's totally worth it.	
- 1	I purchased and returned because it was defective. Even when it was functioning &#34;properly,&#34; I found it not worth the hassle. It took quite a while to cook anything, and it was far easier to just cook it on the stove and mash it up with a masher or fork. Perfect example of our fatuation with gadgets.	
- 1	These stink! The gap in the c shape is so large that using them to attach toys, etc doesn't work. If you link them together they'll disconnect after a minute or 2 of playing.	
- 1	I already have a bottle drying rack, but I needed something else that would hold spoons, forks, and straws upright. I initially wanted the OXO Tot dishrack, because I thought this grass was weird-looking, and a bit pricey for such small dimensions, but I had to have something that was BPA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free. And Dishwasher-safe... OK, so I put it in the dishwasher--in the top rack, on mild wash setting, mind you--to sanitize it before I put my clean baby items in it.  And the grass came out warped! The grass no longer sits flat in the tray.  The corners are bowed. My dishwasher is only a few months old, and has never ruined any of my other dishware.  So, it's totally this product--Read: Made In China. Well, the baby items still went in and stayed upright to dry. Which is the only reason I gave a second star.  But, what a disappointment that the grass sits awkwardly now, after just the first wash! I would not recommend this at all.	
1. 	During my first pregnancy I received a Night and Day bottle warmer as a gift.  I had triplets and the Night and Day bottle warmer could not hold the number of bottles I needed at night so I ended up giving it away.  I would not recommend this product for homes with multiples.  You might be able to use it if you have twins and they only get up once during the night.When I became pregnant a second time, one of the first things I asked for was a Night and Day Bottle warmer.  There are not too many models out there.It is a very simple to use and set up.  The two water holders slide onto the side of the warmer and the cooler is placed in the back.  There are a couple of different basket holders.  One for bottles and one for jars of food.There is a chart on the side of the cooler.  You find the size bottle you are using and what type.  You fill the water to the number on the water holder.When you want to warm a bottle you dump the water into the warmer place the bottle in and hit the button.  Button will glow orange as it warms.  When it is ready the light will shut off.  Takes about 2-5 minutes.Good Features:On and Off switch on the cord.  Very nice when you have toddlers that like to push buttons.Indicator light to tell you when bottle is done.Warms a bottle in the amount of time it takes you to change the diaper.Very stable.  No tipping and not top heavy even with coolerFits many size bottles, See note below about Dr Brown's BottlesPoor Features:Water holder clips can break during shipping, inspect your warmer as soon as you buy itWater bottle for cooler, must fill with water.  Does not stay frozen for longer than 7-8 hours.Cooler lock is plastic bump.  Breaks very easily.  Cooler will no longer lock if one is missing.  Steam can get into cooler because seal is broken.  Top will not stay on if lock is broken.Will only hold 2 bottlesDr. Brown's BottlesUnscrew the top just enough so it does not have a complete seal, then warm bottle.  If you do not unscrew the top or remove the straw, the formula during heating will rise up the straw and flow into the warmer.When I opened the box I discovered one of the water holders was broken.  It was just the plastic clip on the side.  Then a few nights later I noticed that the lock on the cooler was broken.  I emailed First Years and told them about my broken pieces.  I never received a written response but a week later a new cooler and water holder arrived in the mail.The Night and Day Bottle warmer is a must have for Families that have 2 story homes or very large homes.  It is very convenient to remove the bottle from the cooler, place in warmer hit start.  Better than going to the kitchen and warming a bottle.*update* 8 oz Dr Brown's Bottles will not fit into the cooler unless you remove the cap.	
- 1	This price is a LOT for something that youll have to buy many of!!!! this comes with just one, and if you multiply the price by the amount outlets you have, youll be spending a lot of money. I do however recommed these,	
1. 	I was hesitant to buy these because of the price.  After reading so many glowing reviews however, I'm glad that I did purchase these.  When my first two children (ages 9 and 11) were toddlers, I made the mistake of over-buying for them.  I've now learned that it's better to have quality over quantity.These blocks are gorgeous.  I feel good that these are made in the USA.  The designs, manufacturing, painting, etc are amazing.  I can rub my hands over these without getting a splinter.  The paint doesn't chip off easily.  They are bigger than most other ABC-blocks.  The corners are sharp, like a couple posters stated, but they're not going to poke your little one's eyes out or anything.  There aren't any toxic or chemical-type odors when you open the box - so I didn't feel like I needed to wash them or let them air out before letting my toddler play with them.  I have some Melissa & Doug alphabet blocks and these definitely are a better quality.  (Most other alphabet blocks are also made in China.)  I can see my grandchildren playing with these years down the road.  However, if for some reason I decide that I no longer want these in my home - they would have a decent resale value - unlike many other toys.Not only are these a high quality toy, but the play value of these are endless.  When your toddler is young, you can use these to help learn coordination, colors, animals, etc.  When they're older you can use these to help teach letters, spelling, etc.	
- 1	My little one could not get anything out of this cup until I loosened the lid. Once I did that, then it spilled everywhere. I ended up using Gerber graduates cup instead. These sit in the cupboard.	
1. 	We bought this for my infant when she was 6mo old. She is now 2.5 and still likes to sit in it.  We've definitely gotten our moneys worth from it. I like that it converts and I also like that the bar comes off.  My only wish would be to have more than 1 song option. As much as that flower was pulled, the same song over and over started to wear on us!	
- 1	Cute idea, however, one of my rattles didn't rattle. Not that they rattled much to begin with. By the time I would have received a replacement through Amazon he would have out grown them so it's hard to say weather or not the wrist rattles would have worked for my little guy. Returned and refunded.	
- 1	This purchase was a waste of money for my.  My son has had these for 4 months now and has never paid any attention to any of these.  They are made of very hard plastic and not good for teething accept for the squishy part of the butterfly.	
1. 	This was recommended by a friend, so I brought this to the hospital and switched baby out of the hospital's swaddle into this one.  It's amazing how soon after tucking in that last piece, the baby went from fussy to calm!After one month, we still use this swaddle every night.  I ended up buying another in case one was dirty, because we cannot have bedtime without this.I own this in the beige with green trim, and the giraffe print.  Maybe it's because the giraffe print requires more dye to get its design, but I tend to use the beige one more because it feels softer and stretchier.	
1. 	great for rice cereal bottle at night time. watch and listen to make sure nipple doesn't get clogged but overall great	
1. 	Help me out dealing with the soreness and pain of first weeks of breastfeeding. May be useful for teething period.	
1. 	This is the perfect on the go feeding bib.  It rinses easy in the sink when we get home, had a pocket to catch falling food, and dries quickly.  It even protects clothing more that others I've tried.	
1. 	This toy is so much fun to play with for my toddler.  Even I find myself doodling with it occasionally.	
1. 	Smells so good and seems to work well for cradle cap!  It's a good amount of the money, too. Love it!	
- 1	Researched this and received it as baby gift - was VERY UPSET to find it came with PUL Foam mattress after all Baby Bjorn claims that they are safe. I ordered a new all natural mattress pad from Moonlight Slumber.com that custom fits crib.I would have returned it but I had already opened it up and washed the pieces before reading tag. I have deleted all other baby bjorn products from my registry and will not support their companies continued harm to our babies/children. Read up on PUL in baby products - the chemicals leach off and impact baby health and the future health of child/adult.UPDATE - We did end up with crib mattress from Moonlight Slumber and it works perfectly.	
- 1	I got this one as an extra for work so I didn't have to bring it back and forth; it was too firm and rigid for my taste, made the flanges pinch me no matter how much I loosened the thing, and was awkward to size and put on and off. I went back to the simple Medela one in less than a week.	
1. 	Love these.  Best thing I ever got. Use them for my twin grandsons ain't my small kitchen.  Easy to set up and take down.  The twins are two now and have been using these since they could sit up.  Easy to clean.  I sewed two towels together and put it over the back of the chairs to minimize those grimy hands.  We take these camping and when we visit friends and family.  There are three hieght adjustments and folds up to take anywhere.  Nice to have for many years!	
1. 	I have had other baby carriers with my two older children and this one is definitely my favorite. It was easy to use and felt very sturdy. Unfortunately, my son didn't like being in it, but he's not much of a snuggler so I'm guessing it is his personality and not the carrier that is the issue. :) I'd recommend this item to other parents.	
- 1	It stopped working the second time I used it. I work from home, so I don't have to pump often, so I decided to stick with the free manual pump I received at the birthing center rather than try a replacement. Fewer things go wrong with fewer parts.I was given a refund quickly without any problems.	
- 1	Our 3 month old daughter has horrible GERD since birth. She's on meds, special formula, cereal added, we keep her upright for feedings and for an hour afterwards, etc. We were able to raise the head of the bassinet which she quickly outgrew, but not the new crib. Our pediatrician whose son also had severe GERD basically said good luck because she's going to probably have to sleep in her swing until she's a year old. No way do I want to do that! It's fine for a nap, but she never sleeps as deeply in her swing and she really needs to be trained on good sleep habits like all other kids or she'll have problems all her life (and I'm speaking from experience, I had her same issues as a kid and have had lifelong insomnia -- now I know why). This under the mattress is working well for us for right now. During the transition from the bassinet, we had to put this in the middle of the crib for a few nights with a towel around her to keep her from sliding down and from freaking out. The first night we didn't do this and it was a disaster even though we'd introduced her to the crib earlier with no problems. She moved in her sleep and when she couldn't figure out where the heck she was with all this space and even with my picking her up immediately (we co-sleep in the same room with her) she screamed and fretted for a good hour (staring at me as if she wanted to make sure it WAS Momma and nothing else had changed! so sad but adorable at the same time!).When I went to remake the crib once she was used to it (we just kept spreading the towel around her until she was used to the extra room, it took 3 nights) and I moved the wedge up, there was a VERY unsafe gap. While someone (MIL....sigh) suggested that if I *had* to 'mess with it' to just roll up towels, but this is so not a good idea. Very dangerous! Instead I put this under the mattress and it solved the problem even if the angle doesn't seem to be quite as high. As far as wedges go, this is a decent price although the price fits the cheap quality (two pieces and it off gases terribly). We're going to replace this as soon as we find something that works better (and is safer and made with better materials).So yes, it works, but I can't recommend it.	
1. 	Playtex drop in suystem is what any decent lactation consultant will recommend.  it is by far the slowest slow out there.  kids don't get used to gulping down, and you have the best chance of continuing breast feeding.  the liners are easy to use.  means you can stay out all day with only 1 bottle.  great stuff.	
- 1	I could not make this product work for me.I'm 5'5, and right after delivery I was about 170 lbs. I've ordered size Medium and it felt too big for me. Carrier was too lose, and baby wasn't secure there. So I decided to wait while I lose weight and order Small.Now I'm 140 lbs and tried Small size (baby is 5 months old). It looks fine on me, like it should be, but it feels to tight for baby's legs. I mean there is enough space for baby, but fabric is to tight between baby's legs, and it seems bother her.I will not order third one just to try Medium again. I bought very adjustable Baby Bjorn and am completely happy now.	
- 1	updated review...17 months later. i purchased this because i liked that its a reusable and i love skip hop items i have their diaper bag!!i thought hey i can refill as needed and attach to the stroller etc. however the strap on it broke and it would no longer hang or attach to the stroller and the slider was not the best. It would not hold any moisture for the wipes. i have plenty of those cheap wipe holders you get and they hold moisture better than this thing. Not to happy about this item after all.	
1. 	Holds adult weight.  Terrific value.  We purchased organic mattresses to go along with it.  It matches the DaVinici mini crib.	
1. 	I don't know why, but these fit the breastshields better than the set that came with my Medela pump in style - the set that came with the pump only covers the last .25 inch or so of the shield, these cover closer to .5 of the shield. That means I am less worried about the bottle I am pumping into getting too heavy and slipping out. The connectors seems to be the thing that takes the longest to dry, so I have multiple sets since I pump very often.	
- 1	If you are using this as a trainer cup, to move your child to the sippy, do not buy. The spout is too small. I like the THINK BABY bottle much more. I wish they would have made the spout larger.	
1. 	Just got my Sassy Teething Feeder today and tried it out.  Aesthetically it's so colorful and pretty.  My 7 month old took to it immediately.  The netting is all natural and is not dyed in any color so I don't have to worry about her ingesting anything harmful.  It was very easy to put the fruit in and screw on the net on to the ring.  Also, there is a push lock on the ring so the baby can't accidentally unscrew it and get the food out.  I left my baby with the feeder and a piece of banana and she was happily gnawing for 20 minutes!  It is a little hard to clean the net because of the mashed up banana residue but it's better when I soak it in water first.I highly recommend this product for the 6-8 month old babies!	
1. 	I snipped the end off the net so the balls would fall thru and it became extra fun! Suction cups hold great. Only downfall is the balls have a tiny hole in them so water gets in and becomes moldy. But other balls I had fit and work good too.	
- 1	Good idea, however it did not work for me. My oven handle was is in the way. I think it would be a good product if your oven handle isn't too high up on the oven.	
1. 	Fall and spring are wet weather months for outdoor sports, and this blanket has kept us dry in downpours and snow/icy weather during many, many soccer games.  We sit on it, or layer it as a protective shield when there is heavy precipitation. Most recently the little siblings forgot their jacket during an especially windy and cold playoff game, so we built a fortress of blankets, and huddled together under this... almost forgot it was cold out!	
1. 	This is the second one of these I've ordered. I had the red one and then ordered the brown/tan one as well so that I could leave one at the grandparent's house. I bought this thinking it would be a transitional seat for later, but I ended up deciding not to buy an actual high chair because this met all our needs. I didn't start feeding my baby solid foods until 6 months, so she was already sitting up well and didn't need a padded recline anyway. This chair functions really well for us. I like that it doesn't take up our precious space, and if we need the chair when company comes over it is easy to take off temporarily. It's so easy that we often take us with us when we go and visit relatives. My daughter is about to turn one and this chair is still working great for us. It is also easy to clean. No complaints at all. I would highly recommend this handy little chair.	
- 1	When we were shopping for strollers, we started at tory's r us. We liked the chicco keyfit 35 and its compatible stroller. We then went to a local baby furniture store to look for a crib. That's were we saw the Orbit. It was amazing, convenient, felt like the best when pushed, and just so cool. We ended up buying it, along with an extra base and the panniers. Make no mistake, when we got it a year ago, it was the coolest stroller, my wife loved the convenience of the base and how it could be rotated etc...Talk about stroller envy from our friends....we liked how the stroller could be folded just by lifting it with one hand....Then the uniqueness wore off at 4 months.It was heavier than other seats, can't be used past 20 pounds (recs are to keep them rear-facing until 35), not the easiest to carrier around using the arm strap (don't let others convince you otherwise), bulky (you can't put it in a grocery cart, you can't put it in a jogging stroller)....As we plan to expand our family, thoughts are....1. there's no orbit stroller for an infant seat and a toddler seat, 2. What if we have twins? 3. the toddler seat sucks (don't let others tell you different...play with one then play with the britax advocate...you'll see what i mean...)Currently we own the orbit infant system (referred to as the Beemer), theChicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego(the mini cooper) andBaby Jogger Summit XC Single Stroller, Sand/Black(the Hummer). We just bought theBritax Advocate 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Onyx]. We'll probably keep the orbit for when we have another child...But definitely did not like the convertible/toddler seat.And I know the orbit company reads these reviews so please take note orbit, some of your distributers LIE about what you can do with the car seat...One place told me i can put the infant seat into my summit xc and it was safe enough to push around the mall, even though there were no adapters and it is not meant to be done that way. I know you guys wouldn't recommend that.My rec would be skip the glamour, get the chicco keyfit 35, buy any Baby Jogger stroller that fits your lifestyle (you can even get one that accommodates a car seat and another child)  and the appropriate adapter for it...enjoy. I also recommend looking up a car seat check location and having certified techs install or check your installation. 80-90% of car seats are incorrectly installed. I was a certified tech at one point and it took 4 days of classes 7a-3p. to get certified. FYI Pediatric advanced life support is a 2 day class. The safest car seat is the one that is properly installed.And please note NEW GUIDELINES are that kids remain rear facing until 2 years of age. Please make sure your carseats are rated appropriately for this increase in age and weight.Update 2/28/11The Britax Advocate CS is an awesome seat. Straps are easy to use. Glad we went with the Britax.	
1. 	At first I thought this tub was ridiculously big, but my son loves it! I think it's so clever that you can have the baby in a lying down or sitting up position, depending on which way you put him in--this product is very durable and made to last until your child outgrows it! We even bought a second one for our summer house, because I can't imagine giving him a bath without it. My son is 9 1/2 months old and can sit up perfectly, but still prefers to lounge in it lying down. I put it on my kitchen island and bath him that way, so I don't kill my back in the bathroom. I also like that it's all plastic, no mesh or rubber mats that can mildew--it has a bump in the middle to keep the baby from sliding.	
1. 	this is a very pretty and well make romper. however, i found that it runs a little big.l l	
1. 	I am very happy with this purchase!  I wish I would have bought it when my son was even younger.I was going to purchase a different booster seat that was recommended to me, but some people recommended this one, and i'm so glad I went with this one!  it is great because it is so easy to clean, can be used with or without tray (we use it without any tray, pulled up to the dining table with us), and my favorite part is that it has adjustable height so it will grow with him and he doesn't have to be so low right now.  it also straps under the seat, around the back of the table chair, and the child is strapped in with 3 point harness.highly recommend!	
1. 	Love these! They are easy to clean and are so much more comfortable and effective than the soft ones. I'll never go back.	
1. 	I bought this for my 6-month-old daughter (she is in the 50th percentile for height and weight). The chair came in a HUGE box and was very easy to assemble--it was basically 3 pieces you insert one into the other and then attach 8 bolts. It took me less than 10 minutes by myself. I am 5'7 and it comes almost high enough that I could stand and feed her comfortably (but not quite...I wish it came up another 6 inches but then it'd probably be unstable). I have Pergo floors and was able to roll it around easily. I didn't expect the brake to work after reading all the other reviews, maybe they've fixed it because it doesn't budge when the brake is engaged, even when my daughter rocks around. I went with the orange seat pad after reading about spaghetti and carrot stains, so far it still looks new. I highly recommend the orange! The pneumatic lift is fun, it does make the chair heavy but I don't plan on lifting it. The tray snaps in and out with one hand easily (they must have updated this since the older reviews too). It is smaller than other high chairs but seems big enough so far. The plastic covers are great--one is covered with a huge sticker when it arrives, and doesn't come off easily. I used a blow drier, though, and it came off without leaving residue. Boon should really think about doing something other than a sticker there...we already bought the chair, we don't need the advertising! The reason I give it 4 stars is the harness system doesn't fit my daughter well. I made it as tight as it could go, but it's still VERY loose over her shoulders. However, this isn't a carseat, it's a highchair. Maybe it doesn't have to be so snug. It would make me feel better though. Once the tray is in I don't see how she could fall out. Finally, the chair looks great in our house and we get compliments on it. I'm actually proud of the high chair! I love that it will hold her up to 50lbs and is so easy to clean. I would recommend this to my friends.	
- 1	We have a Moby wrap which I absolutely love, so, for comparison:The Moby is extremely soft cotton.  Like having a thick t-shirt on.  The downside is that it is a LOT of cotton, so it's heavy & hot.  However, both baby & mom are comfy overall.  This one, in comparison, is more of a net material (maybe nylon?)  It's NOT stretchy at all, and itchy/rough.  My baby hates it touching his skin, and I'm not a big fan of it touching mine either.  Because it's not stretchy & soft, it digs in everywhere it crosses the body, and stays extremely tight.  This kind of defeats the reason I got it instead of a standard baby carrier (I hate them digging into my shoulders).  So, for comfort, I'd give it a low 1 on a score of 1-5.  I WILL give it this: it's very lightweight, and breathable because it's mesh, so in that regard, it gets maybe a 3 for that.I wouldn't buy this again.  I used it once, and it was not a fun experience.  I'll suck it up & deal with the heavy hot Moby any day to keep my son and I in comfort.	
1. 	Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better.  At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son.  Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub.  Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed.	
1. 	This is exactly what I was looking for.  Nice soft cotton is warm without being too hot.  I like the reverse zipper for changing baby's diaper without having to completely uncover him.	
- 1	This mat has too many pieces.  If you get it for your little one to play on, you'll be forever putting together all the little bits and pieces, which are likely choking hazards anyway.  Get a mat that's all one piece.	
- 1	I really wanted this to work out because of the price but everything seems to fall off from this. It clips on to anything just fine but it is hard for the stuff to stay in the shelves. Not worth at all	
- 1	I'm an exclusive pumper, so in addition to bottles and nipples, I also have lots of pump parts to deal with. This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems!Sadly, my dreams of an organized countertop, with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels, were not to be. I brought this home, popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using, and took it out, eager to assemble it. Unfortunately, not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken.I immediately took the item back to the store. Very disappointing (and my kitchen is still a mess, too).	
- 1	Our toddler figured out how to pull the entire lid off by 16 months (we didn't introduce the cup until about 10 months, so we got less than 6 months of use out of it).  She pulls off the lid and pours the entire container of cheerios into her carseat.  Munchkin now sells a model with lock on lids.  Skip this model and go for the lock on lid one.  Your carseat will thank you.	
1. 	This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet.  The first time I saw it I thought, What will they think of next... but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home.  It's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes, pineapple, watermelon, even strawberries!  It's great for regular feeding too, since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat, fresh brocolli, etc.  The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly, I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water, but after just two weeks of steady use, the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently.  The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself, but it's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder.  I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it's a great thing to have on trips.	
- 1	Well, not NEVER. I did use it a few times with my daughter but I don't think she likes it. She can't move her head around much and she can't play with her toys. I attach her teething toys to her car seat for her to play while we're out and she can't get the toys to her mouth :(Maybe when she gets a little bit older I would try again.	
1. 	Little hands love shaking it.  As it rolls they can see the face and chase.  Would buy as gift for others.	
1. 	My son has loved this from the time he was a couple weeks old.  It has lots of things to play with and he loves the lights and music.  I like how you can set it to where he has to hit a hanging toy to make the music and lights go on. It is also a really great price, way cheaper than what is in the stores.	
1. 	I love it, and a lot of people keeps asking me where did i get it. My 2 year old and i've had used these untill a couple of months ago, she's getting heavier for my back, but i still have it on hand in the closet in case i need to go some place where the stroller would be a hassle and i'd need to have my hands free.	
1. 	Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!	
- 1	We're expecting our first baby in Jan 2011 and I bought this mattress to replace the super thin mattress in ourGraco Pack 'n Play Playard With Bassinet, Elephant Parade.  I was definitely not impressed with this mattress.  I knew from all the reviews that there's a slight gap (about a 1 to 1.5 inch), so I was expecting that.  I didn't, however, expect this mattress to be soo soft. Not to mention that it's so thin that you can still feel the steel beams along the bottom of the bassinet.  I have no idea if my baby would be ok sleeping on this or not, but it's definitely not something I'd feel comfortable on, so I wouldn't use it for my child.  I guess softness is relative, but this mattress seems way too soft for an infant (might be ok for a toddler).  I returned and purchased the Dream On Me Extra Firm mattress, so we'll see how that works.	
- 1	I purchased this item to go on the back window of my Nissan Versa, a very small car.  My husband try to put it up but the suction cups won't stay and, when it stretches to fit, will not cover the back window, which defeats the purpose.  Thank you to Amazon for refunding us on this purchase.  I am constantly impressed with your impeccable customer service.	
1. 	I ended up loving this little booster seat even more than I thought I would. I use it instead of a full size high chair.The tray has adjustments as to how far back against the baby it can go. When he first started using it, I put the tray the whole way back. At 9 months old, he is at the next notch. By the time it would be too tight against him, he would be using it without the tray, jut as a booster at the table, so the amount of notches for adjustments is perfect.You can raise and lower the seat in the base as well. So far, I have kept it at the highest height and that has worked perfect for sitting it on a chair as a booster - at the highest height, I am still able to slide the whole seat with the tray on it, under the table while it is on the chair. Of course this will vary depending on your own table and chair heights.I love that I can just move this around so easily from room to room. He can use it to sit and watch tv in the living room or just sit in like a big boy chair. I can sit it on the kitchen counter while I cook or clean and have him right there. There are rubber pads on the bottom of the base, so it won't slide around. I can sit it on  top of the table to feed him while I sit on the dining chair, or bring it in the living room and set it on the floor and it is still high enough to be comfortable to feed him while I sit on the floor.At first I bought this thinking that it would just be a temporary or once in a while item that I would use. But now, I can definitely see using it instead of a full size high chair for as long as he fits in it. I would think it would fit him up until the time he would be sitting on a regular dining chair on his own. It has so much more potential for use than a full size high chair, since you can move it around to pretty much anywhere.It is a decent size. Not too big and not too small. It doesn't take up much space at all. Storing it away is as simple as sitting it on a dining chair and pushing the chair under the table as usual.It is easy to clean - no fabric to worry about. Trays can go right in the dishwasher if you want.It is sturdy enough. I am not concerned that anything will crack or break.The color scheme is very neutral and nice looking.Price is definitely good and I feel like it is such a great value since it is such a versatile item. Definitely one of the best baby products I have chosen and I am so glad I bought it.	
1. 	I bought this to take with me to my cousin's wedding so the baby could sit at the table with us. She's 5 months old, and sits pretty well, but not completely on her own. I was afraid the reception hall would just have those old wooden style highchairs. This worked great. It has a nice 5 point harness to snap the baby in. So you can use it even if they aren't 100% sitting on their own. It got her snug up to the table. It was easy to put together and easy to take apart for travel. I knocked off a star because like some other reviewers have stated, if you have a table with a large lip underneathe, you can't get this on it. I have an Ikea dining table at home with about a 3-4 inch lip under the table, and I can't get this highchair on it. So I can't use it at home. But it's worked on restaurant tables with no issue. For the price, it was definitely worth the purchase.	
1. 	My son zoomed all around the house in this. Great walker! I only hate I didn't find it sooner. It works great on tile and hardwood floors but I'm not sure how it works on carpet.	
- 1	I really hate to submit a negative review bc this product is almost there.  But it still needs work.Initially I loved it.  It was easy to set up and use, easy to clean and my daughter enjoyed the food that resulted from the recipe book.  The only thing I didn't care for was that when I washed it in the dishwasher (according to the instructions) little food particles would settle into the bottom of the main container.  While this didn't impair the use or cause any issue with the food made bc it was on the underside, it did look yucky.  I didn't have too much success removing it even with a small bottle nipple brush bc of the way it was designed.  I decided to deal with this issue bc I liked the convenience of using a machine and not having to have something cooking on the stove with little ones running around.  But after only three uses we ran into a few snags.Despite cleaning out the water reservoir after each use according to the manual's instructions and leaving the cap off the reservoir to let it air out in between uses, I started to notice a strange odor.  It smelled like burning during the second use so I thought it was the heating plate breaking in or the motor for the blender.  But on the third use it was stronger and more unpleasant.  It definitely originated from the reservoir and made me feel like mold or something might be in there.  Since the water heated in that compartment goes into the main compartment to steam the food I was a bit unsure about the safety of the baby food I was making.I had resolved to call the company to see what might be going on and how I could remedy it but before I could even stick it in the dishwasher after the third use I realized that the main compartment had cracked all around the attached handle detaching it at this point so that the handle was only attached at the bottom.  One more use and I might have had little plastic pieces in my baby food.  Yuck!There ended my love affair.  I contacted Amazon and they nicely refunded me my purchase price after I described what had occurred.  Given the odor issues I had I was unwilling to replace it.I hope the company resolves these issues bc it really is a great little tool at a good price for the market.	
1. 	We heard that it wasn't really critical to brush our son's gums when he was just getting his first teeth, but we also read that the big reason to brush is so that it becomes a habit that your child will be used to as part of his/her bedtime routine. Our son didn't mind this little rubber brush at all, and seemed to enjoy having his teeth brush. When we switched to a &#34;real&#34; (kids) toothbrush we got from his dentist at 14 months it was an incredibly easy transition. We haven't had to use the gum cleanser yet, but I'm sure it will also be great, as I've heard great things about Xylitol.	
1. 	These are so great especially at times of daddy-changing-the-baby-when-pooped.Before I started to use these I'd get to wash the changing pad cover after each time my husband gets to change our son when he pooped, not to mention the clothes of both my baby AND my husband.So if you have the same situation - these are the laundrysaver :))	
- 1	I got this after my sister suggested it. I thought it might help keep the pacifier in my babies mouth. It didn't work. I think it actually caused it to fall out more often because  of the weight of the lion on the end. It was also hard to clean because the lion part in not detachable. I am not sure if i was supposed to put in the washing machine or sink. The only thing I did like about it was that it was easier to keep track of it because when it fell it did not bounce around like a soothe pacifier does by itself.	
- 1	I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom.  Which in turn would leave your wipes so wet you might as well use a wet towel.  The concept works but the design is worthless.	
- 1	I was looking for something to keep my baby cool in his convertible carseat. I needed something that a) kept him cool and b) could attach to the seat. This product sort of manages the first, but fails terribly at the second. The material is a nice mesh, which looks like it should feel cool. After a long ride, my baby's head wasn't soaked in sweat, as it usually is after being pressed up against the non-breathable material of the car seat. Unfortunately, the liner does not stay attached to the seat. The bottom part sort of sags against the back of the seat, so I had to adjust it every time my toddler sat down. If I didn't pull it straight, it would crumple under his back and I'm sure that is not comfortable. The head rest attaches to the main body of the liner with velcro, but the velcro can slip, detatching the head rest from the main body, exposing the velro strip. This caused a rash against the baby's neck. Lastly, the head rest theoretically should adhere to something on the back of the car seat (they provide tape), but it doesn't reach and doesn't stick, so the headrest often falls off completely.I ended up sewing the headrest to the liner, and sewing ribbons to the headrest so I could tie it to the carseat. At that point I might as well go buy some mesh fabric and sew my own liner.I gave it two stars as iti does seem to keep things cool, but the design is really poor. Don't buy this.	
1. 	We love the Joovy Caboose.  Our 2 year old can stand while the 2 month old infant is in her car seat up front with the included car seat adaptor.  Toddler cannot sit on the bench when the car seat (Graco Snugrider) is attached because it requires the front seat to be reclined.  Looking forward to when the baby can sit in the front seat without a car seat (6 months of age and able to sit without support, according to the instruction book), so that the toddler can sit on the bench.  He loves to sit and ride around the house on the bench seat, very exciting because it minimally restricts his mobility and makes him feel like a big boy - it's easy for a toddler to get on and off the stroller.Also, the design is nice and simple, I like the color options and minimalist style, and it is not too much larger than a regular size single stroller when folded.  The price is great for what you get.	
1. 	I am so glad i got this pillow.  I hate to sleep on my left side.  But i can put this pillow between my knees and it's much better.  it's just the right firmness and angle, unlike my regular pillows.I have not tried it under the tummy yet.	
- 1	Night Vision doesn't work properly. When my baby's room is dark it stays of and I can't hardly see him. When his lap is on, so it's the night vision.  Seems to be working backwards.  Not happy with this product.	
1. 	The fabric is thicker material than some other bibs we have and can handle more of the baby's messes. Assorted colors are nice and goes well with outfits. The thicker fabric does have a heavier feel to it and will be even more so when wet. Velcro attachment area on back holds well yet not so much where it's difficult to remove with one hand.	
1. 	First purchased a cheaper clip on chair from Walmart but immediately returned it as it was flimsy and the material was very cheap.  This clip on booster is a nice canvas material that wipes clean very easily and can also be taken off the frame completely and thrown in the washer/dryer.  I have actually just put it in a sink full of warm soapy water several times and then either hung outside to dry or put in the dryer for a quick run.  It dries super quick!!It clips securely to most tables as long as there is no obstructions (such as butterfly style table extensions) and despite other reviews, it does get right up close to the edge of the table.  Food can fall before it makes it to your babies mouth of course, but I cutdown on that by adding a table mat with tray (Tiny Diner Placemat) and bib with pouch (Tommee Tippee Explora Easy Roll Bib).  When my baby was smaller and just starting to eat solids I had to put a small pillow or rolled towel behind her to position her a little more close to the table, not a problem and actually good that it will allow for growth and use for quite a while as she contnues to grow.  I actually don't have a problem with the steaps and sometimes don't even use them, my child does not try to climb out.  Although, I don't put her in the chair unless it's time to eat and we are sitting together anyways.  Children should not be left unattended anyways.I have used this chair at restaurants and as long as it's a sturdy table, it's not a problem.  It folds easily and travels nicely.It is nice to have your child sitting at the table as part of the family and not off to the side like an appendage and takes up no extra room in the eating area.  Just like a chair at the table and promotes family eating together.Would definitely recommend and can't beat the price.  Have never used another highchair for my daughter and glad I didn't get a big bulky regular high chair or on the seat booster.	
- 1	This is a good looking product and easily installed but imagine my dismay when I installed one lock only to find out that the key to open it was not included.  You have to order the keys separately.  Thankfully I did not put one on the other cabinet or I would have been locked out!!  Not sure why the keys are not included but be sure to order the keys if you order these locks.	
1. 	We love this chair. Our 18 month old daughter has been using it since she was 5 months old. We bring it with us everywhere, and we use it at home all the time. I didn't think it was that much of a novelty, but literally every where we take it, people comment on how neat it is! It stays hooked to our home table until we go out to eat. We use it with a Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, which has a handy trough that fills in the small gap between the chair and the table.Best things:*No germy public high chairs! The times I forgot her Chicco chair, I've used baby wipes on the public chairs and YUK!*The chair is familiar to her even in unfamiliar environments. Because she got used to using table manners at home, she knows how to behave at restaurants.*We love it because she sits right at the table with us instead of in a high chair next to the table. She is a great eater, and I think part of it may be that she's always been a part of our meals together, just another person at the table.*Compact--We had a small kitchen in our previous house, and a typical high chair would make things pretty tight. This is easy to clean around/under because it's part of the table. This also folds down super small for travel, whether right down the street or on a long trip.*Easy to fold, unfold, and attach.*Easy to clean and quick to dry. Ours gets pretty funky pretty fast, so we're always cleaning it with a scrub sponge and some dish/hand soap. It still looks like new after much abuse!*Inexpensive--try it! What have you got to lose? If you buy some big high chair and it ends up not working out, you're out $100!Cons:*There aren't many, but one would be that there is no tray to catch spills. Our daugher learned not to spill quickly, probably because it ended up all over her every time. So maybe this is a pro?!*Tips flimsy tables in some restaurants. We have had to put a chair under her and a couple of times, not use it at all. This got to be more of an issue when she got bigger.In response to other reviewers, we have no trouble fitting it to our large table, with multiple leaf inserts and a wide skirt. We have only had it not fit 2 other tables at restaurants. I don't think it's heavy, and I'm kind of a wimp. I never take it apart to wash, I just stick it in the sink and scrub it off with a sponge. I don't find the harness an issue because I never use it. I don't have the kind of child who will agree to be harnessed into a chair when she is ready to get up. If she wants up, we get up! This is why I am shopping for a booster seat now--I take my child's constant getting up out of this seat as a cue that she has outgrown it, not physically, but ability-wise, and don't think Chicco installing a 5 point harness on the chair would change that.	
1. 	My baby doesn't sleep in his crib that long for me to know if its really waterproof, but it is very soft and fits snug on our Graco Pack n play in zurich.	
1. 	I purchesed these bibs because the reviews were great. I totally agree. This bibs are really nice. At first I thought these bibs were thin and were not going to catch anything. But they do a great job and wash up nicely. The Dr Seuss theme is really cute. Everyone comments on them.	
- 1	In actuality it measures 3 inches shorter in length than the package promises. (34 vs 37 inches long)Either it was bought, washed & shrunk, then returned & resold or the manufactures are selling defects.Others had this similar complaint and I should have listened and not wasted my time & money buying this!!!	
1. 	Just perfect !!! works great, small, easy to use very practical! For the price it's great! Work with my glass and plastic bottles...	
1. 	I love this kit.  Everything in this kit is a necessity and works well.  My only complaint is the nail clippers.  They are a bit big to use on a newborn...Oh, and I wish I knew what hospital the lady went to that received all of these products...I got diapers and a formula bag...I had to sneak the t-shirt and blanket for memories!!	
1. 	We are on our third size of Halo sleep sacks and love them!  My daughter can't wait to get into hers at night.  This particular one is very light weight so has been great for the warm summer.	
1. 	I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!	
1. 	When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the condensation but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack.	
- 1	I purchased these cloths because of the decal and gave them a chance considering the lower reviews. What a waste of money....1) The cloths are just too narrow, they honestly won't keep the majority of your shoulder or even the length of your hand covered,2) The material absorbs just like a terry washcloth,When my son dribbled, even slightly, and I wiped him clean, I had to fold up the cloth afterwards and put it in a knot-it bag so it wouldn't dirty anything it touched. My son is now in his projectile vomiting stage... these cloths have become obsolete. My only use for them now is for that occasional one time use.Basically, forget about staying dry with these cloths. I love Luvable Friends, their items are usually fairly priced, reliable and cute... but these cloths were just not worth the price or the detergent.	
1. 	The quality of the bed is great, and I love that eventually I'll be able to use it as a full sized playpen when we're ready. I love that I can collapse it for traveling and that it came with a tote for travel. I find the pockets on the sides of it to be very useful to stash things I may need in the middle of the night. It is an effective cosleeper and makes access to my newborn from bed easy as can be.Now, that having been said, after one month of continuous night to night use of this item I have to say I find it an inconvenience when getting in and out of bed. I have unattached it from our bed and put it against a wall where it is still easily accessible at night, but where I won't find it such an obstacle to climb around.	
- 1	I rarely buy things on amazon that I never use, due to my diligent research prior to buying anything online.  Unfortunately, this product just did nothing for me.  I expected something very sturdy, since it's for your floor and you will obviously be putting things like a highchair on top of it.  Within a couple uses it ripped when I accidentally bumped my highchair.  I was shocked at the cheapness of it when I opened it, and totally amazed when it ripped so easily.  Waste of money, fold a waterproof table cloth in half and put it under your kids when they eat.	
1. 	We got one for our firstborn and he uses it strapped to the chair at meals and on the floor, while watching cartoons for snack time. We ended up getting a second one for Grandmas house because they are so cheap. Great quality too! When the laziness takes over, we just throw the trays and messy buckle straps in the dishwasher. The adjustable height lets you transition this from just-sitting-up-and-eating-solids to I-can-feed-myself-with-a-fork.	
- 1	These bags are a waste of money. Yes they can stand on own when filled with milk but takes up to much room in the freezer. Due to the shape of the bag and remaining space when filled to the 5oz line they are unable to lay flat. I would recommend the Lansinoh storage bags they can hold up to 6ozs of milk, lay flat in the freezer and are cheaper than the medela brand.The time you spend trying to be careful when removing the adapter that you pump directly in can be spent just simply transfering the milk from bottle to bag. Save your money and don't buy this item unless you have money to waste.	
1. 	Baby has feeding issues so we have to feed him in an upright position (the NICU feed position)  Other bottles were hard to use in this position, but the angle of the ventaire makes it so easy.  The bottles have 5 pieces (body, nipple, collar, base and silicone vent) They are easy to clean and assemble, however if you do not dry the pieces well water will drip from around the bottom, or the collar.These are all white so great for boy or girl.  I did however prefer the brighter colors that the old ventaire bottles came in.(deep blues, purples, etc)	
1. 	This is a great thing to have.  My baby twists and turns all over the place and would normally get all caught up in the blanket or kick it off while she sleeps.  Not only is this SIDS approved, but it solves kicking the blanket off (getting cold) and solves getting caught up in a tangled blanket.  I would very much recommend this.	
1. 	My baby loves this. She smiles big when I put it in her mouth and brush her teeth. It also works great as a teether. I used it when she got her first 2 bottom teeth, and I'm using it again now that she's trying to get her two top teeth. It has a hole in the handle so I can attach a paci clip to it and attach it to her shirt. She can suck and chew on it instead of a paci. Works great.	
1. 	My daughter has a lot of fun playing with this.  I got it for her when she was 6mos old, she still plays with it now at 9mos.  The one we got is a different color than the one pictured (not that it bothered us; but just wanted to note that colors may vary).  My daughter likes shaking and biting this, but also has fun spinning and watching the beads.	
- 1	The mirror comes with two different methods of attachment - suction cup or clip onto the visor.  I am using the suction cup and it seems to be sticking very well, though I've only had it up for a few days so far.  However, the image it gives me of the back seat is incredibly small, much smaller than my regular rear view mirror.  I'll be able to see general motion and that's about it.  I guess this is a side effect of the wide view but I don't need to monitor three kids, just one, so it doesn't need to be wide.  There is also a small amount of distortion, right above the center of the mirror, which is annoying.If I can find the packaging I'm going to return it, but I may have already discarded some or all of it.	
1. 	Turned out to be a total stink bomb. Read my new review.  It absolutely reeks after 16 months.  Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the grown-ups in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.  As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.  I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own payload.  I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.	
- 1	I hated this pillow. Like most pregnant people it's extremely difficult to get comfortable for sleep and I was so excited when I read the reviews. I really really wanted to love this pillow but it just did not work for me. It made me feel claustrophobic and even more uncomfortable. I've discussed this with other moms and they either love it or hate it. There's no in between. I think this is way overpriced and I'm so glad I waited to buy the cover for it because I would have wasted even more money. And the cover costs almost as much as the pillow.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this, but was sorely disappointed.  Setting up the clock/alarm was confusing and time consuming.  The lights changing from day to night were barely discernible.  When it was on night, the day was still lit slightly and vice versa.  Also, the plastic screen/cover that has the daytime/nighttime bunnies was flimsy and didn't stay on well at all.  For an alarm clock marketed towards toddlers this should have been much more durable.Since pieces were broken within the first day we just trashed it after trying for a week to get it to work correctly.  I would recommend looking into another alarm clock as we are.  This one was pretty useless.	
- 1	My eight month old son was able to figure out within a few minutes that he could hold these cups over his head and shake the cheerios right out of them.... cheerios went everywhere, all over his car seat, all over the store and when we got home (and my husband refilled his snack cup) all over my house.	
1. 	This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.	
- 1	My son loves putting stuff in his mouth but didn't really take interest in this at all. i thinI when baby's teething, they need something firmer to chew on.	
- 1	Like other reviewers, I have had nothing but problems with this thing! The instructions for how much water to add are not right at all. You have to figure out on your own how much water to use, and then, you can do the exact same thing twice and one time will still be ice cold and the other time burning hot. There is a little ring piece, which is not attached, and if you lose it, the thing does not work AT ALL since all the steam just escapes! Ours stopped heating consistently after two months of use. It gets a brown build-up in the bottom, and you can not fit your hand in there to clean it out. The instructions say to wipe with vinegar periodically, which I have found you actually have to do every day or else you will never get the build up out. We are switching to Munchkin brand bottle warmer now that this one has quit working.	
- 1	Pros:1. Very soft, good for baby's teething. My baby loves to chew it :)Cons:1. Price is on the high side2. The item got an odd smell with it3. Color faded pretty fast4. Bits can be chewed off by baby, probably swallowed by baby too!	
1. 	good thing i only bought one package because one pack had enough to cover all the outlets in my house.	
- 1	I would not recommend this product. It doesn't give you any support so your back will suffer big time. I don't use it.	
- 1	My 5 month old is still swaddled, and oddly enough, she seems too small for it (we even own a size small). The sides that are to be wrapped around the belly/arms are too long, so the velcro barely even works. The left side (that wraps around first) pretty much tucks all the way underneath her back, and the right side (that wraps around second) wraps all the way around to her back, only leaving maybe an inch of velcro contact. Needless to say, it isn't secure enough to keep my little one from working her way out of the swaddle. She also gets her hands up and out of the bottom of the swaddle wrap, causing it to bunch up around her face, neck, which she then ends up chewing on and waking herself up.I bought mine from Target, on clearance in June/July 2011. Maybe that is why? It is a small, cotton, pink swaddle. She is 25 inches long and she fits ok length wise, but to wrap her tightly at all, it's waaaay to big for her. Seems strange to make a swaddle so loose since the purpose of a swaddle is to be tight.Also, mine does not have any velcro fasteners on the bottom like the other commentators. Not sure why but ours are apparently different.	
1. 	I love this pump. I was told by my doctor to pump to stimulate my milk supply and this totally helped. It is worth the money it costs. Think of it as an investment in your baby. Plus if you have more than 1 child you can use it again.	
1. 	I really like this product. It is made of good quality and does the job. I just wish it wrapped around more because I'm always having to use an extra blanket or something to cover my back and sides.	
1. 	This is super soft and plush. It fits great around the changing pad - the soft pink is a great color.	
1. 	We've had this for a few months now and its a very nice bed! My son is 18 months and he can get in and out very easily! No niches or scrapes when we received it and it only took a week to receive it. Also we bought the sealy soybean foam mattress with it and its amazing!	
- 1	Considering I paid over $350 for this stroller, it was a total disappointment. I was expecting more especially after reading all of the great reviews. Two issues: The design of it overall was just poor and the materials it was made of was cheap.	
- 1	I purchased the Britax B-Nimble to have as an alternative to our large/ heavy BOB stroller (which I love by the way!). I researched & read dozens of reviews for the best lightweight stroller with all the bells & whistles I was looking for.  If I had tested the B-Nimble out in a store - I would not have bought it.  It is NOT nearly as Nimble as it's name! And for the price/ brand, it has a poor design (this is a simple Umbrella stroller being marketed as something more).  In summary, the Con's outweight the Pro's for this stroller.  I wish I had returned right away :-(PROs -- Fabric is nice & durable, I think you can also remove the cover to wash (haven't had to do this yet, since I avoid using this stroller due to the Con's - see below).- Lightweight- Shoulder strap is handy- The extendable footrest is nice- the center lock for the 5 point harness is nice & easy to use.CONs -- Handling/ manuverability is terrible.  Maybe it's the two front-wheel design, but it's not easy to steer forward on simple ground surfaces - the wheels get caught easily & if they aren't parallel at all times, one will flip around and stop any forward movement until you re-align the wheels.- Canopy is awkward & flimsy.  It also doesn't pull down low enough to shield the sun/ rain/ wind from my daughters' face.- The rear step-down lock that holds the stroller open is broken, and the plastic piece spins around under my foot while trying to lock open the stroller.- The mesh basket underneath is way too small.  But I guess that's what you get with an umbrella stroller.- You need both hands to open & close this stroller. And in both cases, it is just awkward to do.- Doesn't recline to a flat position.- The parent cupholder is constantly falling off - between opening & closing, and moving the stroller from place to place.  It's just doesn't stay put, so we end up leaving it off, and not having a place to put bottles/ cups.	
1. 	These have served their purpose pretty well. I used them to freeze breast milk, and now for homemade babyfood. All in all they have worked out great. They actually yield a little less than an ounce though. Maybe you have to fill them to overflowing to get a whole ounce. Also, sometimes the lids don't seem to fit quite right or stay on well. But most of the time they do. I always wash them by hand, as other reviewers had said the lids warp in the dishwasher.	
- 1	We bought this instead of the pull back shades, thinking it'd work well and be easy to install.  Was very hard to get flat and straight on the window and pealed up when you lowered the window (this wasn't a huge surprise and was discovered by accident).  Wouldn't buy again and would just get the pull down shade in the future.	
1. 	These bibs are wonderful. Not only are they pretty but they do absorb well and you can embroider on them to personalize them. I got these for my granddaughter. They do have boy colors too in blues and greens. Well worth the price.	
1. 	I highly recommend this product for a kid that hates wearing a bib..my son (11 months) couldn't take it off like all the other tens of bibs we tried and he actually treats it as of it's t-shirt or sth :D	
1. 	This toy keeps my 8-month-old daughter entertained.  She seems to like all the sides, as she flips it around and plays with each one.  It's portable and quiet enough.  I wish there were more toys of this variety.	
1. 	This nursing cover is actually beautiful enough to wear as a bride.It saved my gown's elegance and allowed me to nurse discretely throughout the day.	
1. 	This bib covers the whole front of the baby's body including his shoulders, upper arms and the whole belly. The pocket does not necessarily stay open to catch all the food, but if you have your baby seated in something with some kind of a tray, you can just lay the bib on the tray and it catches the food pretty well that way. It's made of very durable waterproof fabric, and I like that the white rims are made of the same fabric too. It's super easy to clean. I usually wipe it with a wipe on the go, and then come home and wash it in the sink and hang it dry. I would wash it after a use and it's usually completely dry for the next meal. I have washed them in a washing machine and they came out in perfect shape. They fold up very compactly. I just fold one and roll it up with a spoon and keep it in my diaper bag with his food.	
1. 	These are awesome straw cups.  Unlike the other straw-type cups, these cups don't leak, don't have tiny parts to clean, and are not super expensive.  We've used a flip straw type cups only to get frustrated with small parts that are difficult to clean, and lots of leaks when tipped on the side.  We've tried similar straw through lid type cups only to have a mess of leaks, and flimsy straws.  The Take and Toss cups beat them all - the straws are made of fairly hard plastic, and they go in smoothly and tightly through the lid of the cup.  We've used other straws with this cup, and found that they work fairly well also.  The cup will leak only a tiny bit when tipped.If you got a kid who tosses cups still, this cup may not be for you, as I'm pretty sure a lot more liquid will come out, but if you've got a sippy cup transitioner on your hands, this cup is great!  On a side note, if you don't want to use the lid, kids can drink out of the cup without it - the edge of the cup is curved enough to allow drinking without drooling.  Highly recommended!	
- 1	These were ok for a changing table I always used my pad anyway. Ended up being a waste of money and I still have them taking up space in his drawer.	
1. 	Medela is the best and these membranes are perfect. Easy to replace and keep my pump running like new. Of course I'd get them again.	
1. 	This pinch guard goes on easy (and comes off easy on the rare occasion that we want to close the door to our playroom).  The kids used to play with the door so much we talked about just taking it off.  Someone was always getting their fingers pinched.Since we got this they actually stopped playing with the door all together since it won't close.I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little thicker  - if it was it would also be able to prevent the hinge from closing on little fingers too.Overall, it does what it says it does, for a good price, without being permanent.	
1. 	This mirror is great, gives a clear image so I can glance back to make sure the baby's okay.  It isn't a safety concern as far as breaking, because it's not glass; it doesn't block my view because it attaches over the middle seat headrest; the biggest safety concern is that you'll get distracted watching the baby instead of the road.  I'd be way more distracted trying to somehow look or feel back to be sure he's okay.  Well worth the investment!	
- 1	This thing is weird...like a little bite wing tray that has to be positioned perfectly to do anything.  Also, the 'soft bristles are more like hard nubbins.  I'm really surprised this has such a good rating.  It was useless to my 4 month old.	
1. 	My 23-month-old daughter loves this horse. It's adorable, solidly built, and easy to put together; however, its mane and tail shed some yarn coming out of the box, and shed some more yarn just by being gently touched. Fix the mane and tail, and this would definitely be a 5-star item.	
1. 	This kit is a  MUST HAVE for any mom who is pumping with a Medela PISA and using Avent bottles to feed your baby. It's so much easier to use this attachment. All you have to do is take your Avent bottle, place the blue ring as you normally would, screw this conversion cap onto the bottle, then screw in your Medela attachment on top of the conversion cap and pump right into your Avent bottle. No more pumping into the smaller Medela bottles, then transfering your breastmilk into an Avent bottle. No more washing extra bottles either! Now you can literally pump into it and either feed your child or cap it and store it right in the fridge. As long as you use the blue ring, there will be NO LEAKS. JUST REMEMBER TO USE THE BLUE RING and you'll be good to go! I've been using it for almost 4 months now, I sterilize it regularly and it shows no signs of warping, cracks, or yellowing.Once again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the purchase of this conversion kit for Medela moms and Avent bottle babies. It's a time saver and well worth every penny. I only found this 4 months into pumping and I really wished I had found it sooner, so don't hesitate and just purchase this already. Tell your other mommy friends about this kit too, because there are a ton of moms who would find this attachment quite useful.	
1. 	WOW! We love our video monitor! This has really helped our transition to getting our son into his own room at night! Our son was perfectly fine when we transitioned him to his own room, but my husband and I were a nervous wreck! This monitor helps us keep peace of mind and be able to rest. We have had minimal problems with static and the sound/picture quality is great - even the night vision feature! We can check to see his position (I am always nervous about him smooshing his face into the mattress when he rolls around), his breathing and the geographic locale of his pacifier! We get a kick out of seeing our son exploring in his crib and not even knowing he has an audience!Also, when he is napping, it makes it easy to check on him without actually entering his room - which always used to wake him up.I understand from the other reviews that durability and longevity may be an issue with this item. I can't comment on that because we have only had it for 2 months. But for us, 2 months of sleep has been worth the investment already even if it tanks later...	
- 1	I really wanted to like these due to the cute prints. As others mentioned, you can feel the dampness after one pee.  The numerous buttons drive me and my hubby nuts- just way too many and pretty hard to snap with wiggly baby.  AND this diaper leaks- pee leaks and poop blow out to the back.  My other AIO cloth diapers never leaks or has blow outs ( GroVia and BumGenius AIO one size).  I'm really disappointed.	
1. 	My son loves SwaddleMe products! He's a little more than a month old and he's been using them for 3-4 weeks now. I bought this for him because it was going to be cooler where we live. It's not too heavy but keeps him nice and warm. SwaddleMe is soft and cozy. All of the SwaddleMe Products help him sleep easier and I will admit that they've 100% helped me and my husband sleep at night. Once he's in his baby straight jacket he sleeps at least 4 hours a night, sometimes up to 6! So easy to use too! There is a video a person made on youtube if you have no idea how to put it on baby. Great investment!	
- 1	I thought this would be helpful when using public restrooms, but my child hasn't needed it and I haven't wanted to carry it around in my already-too-full diaper bag all the time. Wish I hadn't purchased this.	
- 1	Strangely, out of all the 4 boxes I purchased, only the unicorn one reals chemical smell out of box.  Peacock, gorilla and kangaroo are okay.	
- 1	Do not buy this doesn't work at all waste of money!!!  Go buy a food processor or some other type of food mill bc this is such a waste !	
- 1	I ordered the strap assuming that there will be a spot on the TV to anchor it to. But even though the TV is just two years old, there isn't an anchoring spot. Therefore, it will be a good idea to check that before ordering.2 stars because they should clearly specify on the product description.	
- 1	It just stains so easily it's not worth having it. I took the cover off and it's better that way. My friend has some black water proof changing pads, I'm beginning to see that's the way to go, would be nice to have them to put over the changing pad.	
- 1	I thought this idea seemed great since my hands would be full once our baby arrived, but it did not work for us. We bought this for use in a doorway, but the foot pedal stuck out so that we never would have been able to close the door. The opening for this gate was also very narrow. We returned this for the North State Industries easy close gate, which we love.	
1. 	I bought these after my 14 month old got interested in our stove knobs and have been very happy with them so far. They're easy to put on (just pop the knobs off, put covers on, and replace knobs) and aren't visually offensive. They're effective too--no more risk of little fingers turning the gas on. Highly recommended.	
- 1	I don't know how the best pump maker in the world has the worst sheilds and at breast system. I bought the pumpin pals sheilds and LOVE them. These bruised me, reduced my production, and caused damage to my skin.	
1. 	I was given a Dr. Brown's bottle as a shower gift and am so glad that I got it!  (It was different than the ones available online - an 8 oz. wide-mouth bottle)When I stopped breastfeeding I started using 4 oz. Avent bottles for several reasons.  First, because I ended up with 8 of them after purchasing other Avent products and second, because the lactation consultant that taught my breastfeeding class recommended them stating they were more like the breast.When I started looking at purchasing larger 8 oz. bottles I remembered that I had received a Dr. Brown's bottle and decided to try it to see if my daughter would take it.  The wide-mouth nipples look very similar to the Avent ones.  My daughter smacks a lot when she eats and subsequently takes in a lot of air.  She spit up often and would sometimes spit up what looked like half her bottle when she had trouble burping.  She took the Dr. Brown's bottle instantly and so I decided to buy a few more and switch for a week or two to see if there was any benefit.  I'm so glad that I did!Once I got past the fact that the bottle looked as big as my daughter's head (the 8 oz. wide-mouth bottles are very large!), I realized that she was burping much more easily and hardly spitting up at all.I truly believe the benefits of using this bottle outweigh the extra parts you have to clean.  After doing some research I discovered that one of the main reasons bottle-fed babies get more ear infections is because of the vacuum effect traditional bottles have.  As the baby sucks on a traditional bottle they have to gradually suck harder and harder as pressure builds in the bottle. This also creates pressure in their ears which can disturb the fluid balance and cause inner ear problems.  The baby also has to frequently break the latch (and the nipple collapses at a certain point of pressure which causes them to unlatch) so that the pressure can equalize in the bottle.  This causes them to take in more air.  Now, when my daughter is really hungry, she can take practically the whole bottle without ever having to break her latch!I really like the nipples as well.  They are much thinner than the Avent ones and mold better to my baby's mouth.  I suppose this is because the Avent ones have to be thicker and stronger to resist collapsing under pressure?Others have stated that leaking is a problem.  They WILL leak only if:1) you heat them without loosening the top (collar/nipple)2) you travel with them without putting the disk in the top designed to keep them from leakingDon't do these things and you shouldn't have any problems.I definitely recommed you at least try these.  I will definitely be purchasing these as shower gifts for new moms!  I do recommend the wide-mouth bottles, though.	
- 1	My son barely used this toy. Since we live in a small condo and this toy does not maneuver easily.Hard to turn around corners and hard to push on carpet.I got him a little shopping cart (which was half the price).It was light and he ran all around the house with it.http://www.amazon.com/CASDON-611-Toy-Shopping-Cart/dp/B000V5DHT0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1303583995&sr;=8-4And a mickey mouse ride on train which he mostly pushed around.http://www.amazon.com/Mickey-Mouse-34918-Plane-Ride-2dOn/dp/B000EX0DRSHe loved these other toys so much longer and used them more often.	
1. 	Ordered this one online after looking over potty seats in stores (the splash guards were all so small - why bother?) - my kid loves it, it's easy to clean, and the splash guard is comfortable.I took off one star because yes, you do need to take it completely apart and clean it (often!) as urine gets trapped between the parts. Still happy with the seat, though.	
- 1	First one we had didn't last a full year, the monitor stopped working unless it was plugged in (we replaced batteries and it still wouldn't work). So we continued to use and then the monitor stopped working all together. We replaced it after it completely died and the second one came straight from manufacture and the monitor didn't work at all.Only comes with one camera. For the price, it should at least come with 2 cameras to one monitor.	
1. 	My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.	
- 1	I put this carrier on our baby registry because it seemed simpler to use than many of the wraps and slings for newborns, and it's quite inexpensive, too.  As it turns out, the carrier is super-easy to use, just as I'd hoped - there's no wondering (as there is with some wraps) how to get the thing on or if it's on right. However, after our baby arrived, I found that the ease of wearing this product was of little value to me at the outset, since I couldn't use the carrier at all at first.  This product can't carry a newborn in any position in which he will feel comfortable - most newborns don't like to have their legs stretched out like this carrier requires.  Our baby fussed and cried the whole time he was in the carrier when we first tried it.  In terms of the positions in which this carrier can hold a baby, it's more suitable for when the baby is a few months old.Once our baby was comfortable not having his legs tucked in, I was excited to use the carrier, but at that point, he was 15+ pounds, and I found out I still couldn't really use it - he had become too heavy to comfortably carry in this product, as it distributes all the weight on the shoulders and upper back.  I have a pretty strong back - I did deadlifts through the second trimester of pregnancy, and I never once had an aching back during my pregnancy.  Pregnancy couldn't hurt my back, but this carrier kills it!  I couldn't stand to wear my baby for more than 20-30 minutes at a time.  Even the wraps tend to do a better job distributing the baby's weight.Since I couldn't use the product at any stage of my baby's development, I don't think the product is worth even its modest cost.Even if you can stand the back-killing engineering of this carrier, I'd discourage using it, since (as I found out after the fact), carriers where  the baby basically hangs by his crotch aren't good for the baby - carrying the baby in this position  can potentially cause hip dysplasia.  To avoid this risk, it's better to have a carrier that has some kind of seat pocket, that holds the baby so that his knees are about level with his hips.If you want to wear your baby, you're better off putting in a little time to figure out how to use a wrap when he or she is still a newborn and spending the money for a good ergonomically supportive carrier, comfortable for both baby and parent, for when your baby is a bit bigger.  If you're looking for something to carry your newborn in, try the Moby, a Slingling, or maybe the Ergo with infant insert. Even I was finally able to figure out how to use my Moby and like it now!  The Slingling may also be an option if you want something really simple to use, though it's not quite as comfy as the other two options. I'd recommend an Ergo or Beco starting when baby is 4-6 months old.	
- 1	We have an Ergo that is inward facing only.  Wanted something for outward facing, but was hoping not so spend the big bucks for the Bjorn.  Thought I would try this, given the inexpensive cost.  Its not worth it.As far as baby carriers go, it is a bit more complex with numerous velcro and snaps.  Its way more complicated than the Ergo, but pretty similar to the Bjorn in terms of hook ups.  However, it is by no means rocket scienceThe biggest drawback is the comfort/ergonomics.  All the weight is on your shoulders.  The lumbar support is comfortable, but by no means provides support.  After having my 13 lb infant in it for 20 minutes around the house, my shoulders were already getting tight.  I've worn the Ergo for 4 hours, and haven't had a problem with that at all.I also thought that for front facing option, the front of the carrier is a bit tall (even if you fold it down).  My 24 inch baby's face doesn't clear the front yet.Moral of the story.... spend the big bucks.  Your back/shoulders will thank you.	
- 1	Melts all over the place. Very messy.	
- 1	We needed a gate for the bottom of our stairs - the wall doesn't come all the way down to the last step on one side but the other has newell posts that we had to put a piece of plywood in between to mount the hardware too. We have a very odd situation for putting a baby safety gate in, but nevertheless, this gate seemed like the right fit.However, the expandable sliding mechanism kept sticking and after a few weeks we just couldn't take it anymore. We had to jiggle it back and forth to keep the sliding momentum going.In the end, we are returning it in lieu of getting something that slides to expand and contract a bit easier. Our friends have an evenflo that is similar so we are going to look into that.The wood color itself is nice, but with the non-working sliding part it kept getting nicked and worn so the wood got worn down - color wise.It is a beautiful gate if only the sliding hardware worked properly.	
1. 	I have used this for over a year and it works great and has held up well.  It must be dried on delicate (which I am fairly certain the directions tell you that) because I used medium heat and a small section melted a bit.All in all, a very good purchase!	
1. 	This mirror is easy to install but it does throw you off b/c the straps are backwards but if you twist one then it works great. You can see everything that your child is doing. I highly recommend this.	
1. 	My experience may not apply to you, if you don't have a ridiculously oversized tub that requires about $15 extra a month in gas and water bills to fill for a bath.  If such is the case, please feel free to stop reading here.  I won't be offended.But I do have a ridiculously oversized tub, and I'm so glad I bought this bath.  Yes, it's large, but that's a safety feature for me - my squirmy 11-month-old can't climb out and get trapped between the duck and the tub walls.  I have no problem filling or emptying the bath from my water spigot, so I'm not experiencing any of the difficulties with this that other reviewers have.  The suction cup on the bottom really is meaningless; the bath won't hang from my tiled walls because they're slightly convex, so I just leave it in the tub, upside down, and wipe it down with an antibacterial cloth after use.  The bath fills with air quickly and stays inflated, which is a novelty for me in the world of baby inflatable stuff.  I've had to top up the air once in the past seven months.  The hot button seems to me to be a bit sensitive, but maybe my child just likes his bath water warmer than average.  He loves the fact that it's yellow and the same shape as his duck toys.  He likes to put bubbles on the duck's head.  He kicks back against the tail and chills occasionally.  So I'd say he enjoys the shape, color, and style, while I enjoy the safety and economy.  All in all, I'm sad he's going to outgrow this tub, and that they don't make it in my size.	
- 1	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! If you are ok with that, then it's fine. However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. No thanks. I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.	
1. 	Our bed rooms are upstairs and I needed to have a second warmer and one which had a cooler.This is the best buy for the same reason.I simply love it and couldnt live without it.I have used it every single day so far .My son is now 5months and it works great I never timed how much time the bottle is in the warmer not I measured the water. I used to do it when I intially bought it but with a screaming infant in hands during night I stopped bothering about the measurements . even with such a rough use it still works great .never had a little problem with itBut I do make sure that I clean it throughly every week.The cooler part is awesome,saved me trips downstairs in the middle of the night.Being a working mom I am all about making things easy for me.This is what I recommend highly	
- 1	These are terrible, they don't stay in your babies mouth.  Try the Mam brand, sooo much better!  I have to think anyone who gives these a positive review haven't tried Mam.	
1. 	I used to wash bibs constantly, now I just have this one bib that is perfect.  I always wash it off right away when my son is done with it and hang it on the high chair so that it dries for next time and is always clean and available.  The velcro tie in the back is nice and fast, and my son loves it because it is trucks.  Worth paying a little more for this print if you have a boy!	
- 1	Do NOT buy these. They left my baby bloody more than once and they're going in the trash tonight. The first time I thought I might not be doing it right. So I went out and bought the Especially For Baby manicure set (with a much better clipper, plus scissors and emery boards) and had great success, so I thought I'd give this clipper a try again now that I'm better at cutting baby's nails. Bad idea! They sliced off a whole chunk of my little guy's thumb this time! These clippers need to be off the market!!!	
1. 	This nipple was the winner after trying 5 others for my breast fed baby. He has had no nipple confusion, gas, colic, or anything and goes between bottle and breast easily.  Love the price too!	
1. 	This pillow was very supportive to my baby belly and my back.  My husband was worried I would keep using it after our daughter was born, and I was tempted!  Will use again for 2nd pregnancy!	
- 1	maybe the one we got was defective but it wasn't accurate at all.  i love the idea of being able to swipe across the forhead to read temperature of sick child but it needs to be 100% accurate.  we were getting readings in the 60s...(!)  ended up returning it and keeping my rectal thermometer which while a pain to use is always correct.	
1. 	My newborn screamed through his baths until we ordered this and began to use it. Now he LOVES the bath! What a relief... This is the best bathing help I have found. It holds him securely so that I can scrub away. Keeps him warm and cozy the entire time.	
- 1	Someone recommended these to me as a more waterproof reusable pad, but they're laughably thin. I leaked within 2 hours, so I combine them with my thicker avent reusables and will make 4-5 hours without feeling more than damp. I still have to replace the combo at each feeding. Maybe when I don't leak so much they'll be more useful.	
1. 	I have owned one of these since 2006. I absolutely love it. It does what its supposed to do, stays where you put it, and makes picking up toys so easy. We recently had to put it up though, our shower in our apartment has curved walls and this does not work if your walls are slightly curved. We're on the hunt for something that will work for us until we move and hopefully have flat shower walls again.	
1. 	Great 1st year tub.  It is shaped to fit the baby at a size ranging from infant to larger.  Works very well with the baby, gives better control over moment and sliding down. What I really like about the tub it can be used in the kithchen sink (no bending over)!  It also has a plug that you can pull to drain the water out of it for easy cleaning.	
- 1	I'm pretty annoyed because I didn't realize it wasn't working right until now and I've had it a couple years. Thankfully, my family hasn't had any high fevers, so it really hasn't been needed. I most recently tried using it to chart my bbt, since it reads in .1 increments. I can't even get it to give the same reading twice. It's ridiculous. Do not buy, unless you like throwing your money away.	
- 1	Very cheap looking. The material had markings on it and the seams were coming undone. This looks like something from a dollar store. It is probably only worth $5 MAX. I was very disappointed. I had thought this would be a cute clothes hamper in my daughter's room. Maybe if I add ribbon to the yellowing ribbon over the wire parts, trim the loose threads and try to iron out the wrinkles, it might look a little better.	
- 1	I bought this set at Buy Buy Baby in a pinch. I had been sending the small Pyrex glass bowl/blue lids to daycare and they were starting to chip. I wanted a set that was safe so I bought this as well as the Innate lid/bowl combo at the store.Overall I am not pleased with the price/design of the ThinkBaby product.ConsLike other reviews, the words scrape offI think the cup will be useless and I won't be using the spoon and forkthe plastic over the stainless bowl makes for extra pieces to wash and store since you don't want mold between themthe bowls are bulky and I am sure they will leak if I were to put a thin liquid in themyou can't microwave them so I must send items to eat cold otherwise daycare will just transfer the food into a plastic bowl which defeats the purpose hereWith that said, I really do like the rectangle piece with the latch lid. I also really really love the Innate bowl. It is a stainless container with a silicon lid that turns into a silicon bowl. Daycare is happy to transfer the food into the bowl and can microwave the puree/or pasta I send without the issue of leaching plastics and chemicals.Had I designed the set, I would have made them rectangle and added one w/ a two compartment option. There are plenty of times that I want to pack two small purees/items for daycare and must put a stainless ramekin inside the cereal bowl to separate the items. I am going to buy LunchBots next. Smaller container with less spots and it has the two compartment option.	
1. 	the Mustela Dermo Cleansing 16.9 US fl. oz bottle it is a nice and real good working body washer for baby	
- 1	The water stream coming from his mouth doesn't travel horizontally very much, it makes it difficult to aim the stream of water away from my baby's eyes.  It's not very useful for watering my plants, either.  Looks great on the bathtub shelf tho!	
- 1	These barely absorbed when I had them in.  It was more like the milk beaded off of them.  I had high hopes but I was let down.	
1. 	I chose this soft food feeder because it was made in the US and the feeder bags weren't dyed.  Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth.	
- 1	Baby outgrew the small/medium size(7-14 pounds) at a little over 12 pounds, so if you really wanted to buy this product, I would recommend going a size up if he's at the borderline weight. Also fabric is thin so if it's very cold, it won't be enough to warm the baby alone. Only thing I like about this is it has foolproof wrapping/swaddling so you cant mess it up yourself lol.	
1. 	I would have given it 5 stars but it has some stitching in the middle of the pocket, (I guess to hold it up), and it doesn't seem to catch as much food as our other bibs.  I love the waterproof feature but it does take a little longer to dry than our nonwaterproof ones.  I guess you have to choose the features you need for each meal.  I like the sleeves because it makes it harder for our 15 month old to pull it off.  Overall I like it better than my other bibs.	
1. 	These are cute boats for the bath. Like all bath toys, after about 3 months they are starting to get moldy on the inside. Happens to all bath toys so I knew that when I bought them.	
- 1	Did not fit table right, my son was obsessed with pulling it off was a total pain to get back on, gave it away to my best friend hoping it would work on her table have never noticed it being put use there. Was an expensive waste of money....oh well you can't win them all!	
1. 	I like this manual pump best over other brands I've tried in the past. I like the quality of Medela and the design of this pump makes it comfortable to use and much less painful if you have wrist or hand problems but still need a quick, easy, quiet pump.	
1. 	I admit, I was extremly skeptical... my mother actually bought these for me b/c my preemie son was in pain all of the time from gas and the only thing that slightly helped was the Playtex Nursers, and he was still in pain a lot of times. We tried everything to help him. Then she brought me these.. and he has not had a problem since... My son is a happy baby again!!!! I am so happy with these. I read on here that cleaning them is a pain.. but that is just not so. I hand clean bottles anyways and it is so simple to clean these bottles, I can't believe that ppl are so lazy as to complain about a couple extra seconds to run a brush in 3 holes. Gimmie a break. I also clean a bunch of parts for my pump, so I just do it all at once. OH!!! And these bottles fit on my Medela pump, so I can just pump right in the bottle!!!! And we havent had any leaks, btw... these things are GREAT. Oh, and they also make a widemouth version that you can get at Babies R Us... I wish I had gotten these earlier.. my son is 7 weeks (he was born at 32 weeks, btw) and he is a different baby with these bottles.	
1. 	I bought these to use as a pad on the changing table, however they are so big that I also use them in the baby's crib.  I use them as traveling changing pads as well.	
- 1	This thermometer is about as good as not having one at all. On one reading it will say 102.7 (which nearly stops your heart) and the next reading (within seconds of the last) will say 95.3 - and the readings continue on like that. Each consecutive reading will have several degrees difference, so you have no idea what the true temperature is.	
1. 	It's great for what it is, I just wish it was a little bigger. However it is easy to use and looks cute! And I love that I don't need to waste money on bag refills, I just use walmart plastic bags or any other grocery store bag and that to me is greener! :)	
- 1	I couldn't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase. I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and sticks the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes. Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side. I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields.	
- 1	This strap is too small to fit around my double door handles on my fridge as you see in the picture. It's got some elasticity but not enough, either the handles or the strap would break in order to make it work. Very disappointed.	
- 1	I really, really wanted this product to work.  Even though I knew the large bubbles delighting the boy in the marketing materials had to be fake, I didn't mind because, well, I just expected smaller bubbles floating down into the bath tub. What I got were tiny bubbles that immediately popped as soon as they appeared - while still attached to the blower.  My son was intrigued by the noise of the machine, but I don't think he even noticed the baby bubbles that were constantly dying on the yellow wands.I tried newer batteries, thinking that the product needed more speed.  This did change the rate at which the wands turned, but nothing ever made a single bubble escape from the penguin. Huge disappointment.In case you have missed it, some other reviewers have found ways to make this work by taping part of it to affect air flow or something.  If you are willing to rig yours to work, I recommend searching for those reviews.  I did not try this because - despite how awesome the concept is - I decided that I shouldn't have to spend $15 on a broken product that I had to fix when my 99 cent bubbles turned out to entertain my son just fine.	
- 1	Of the few things you actually need from this bag-for the zipper to stay shut is a pretty big thing!! Since day one i have had problems with the zipper.  I can work with it to get it to zip up but when someone checking it at the airport doesn't realize that it didn't zip back up after they inspect it-could be a big problem!! Our last flight-which was from the US to Germany, this happened and so basically we ended up with an empty bag- and a beat up car seat...Don't waste your money!	
- 1	I had been using Thirsties covers primarily. I tried this as a cheaper alternative. The quality is a lot lower then any other covers I have. Sizing is definitely not one size. My son is 4 months old and this is way too big for him still, so I can't attest to leaks, washing, etc. as I haven't been able to use it yet.	
1. 	We bough this railing for our youngest son (age 2) when he moved from a crib to his big boy mid-high loft.  We thought/hoped he'd use the trundle, but he wanted to be in a bed like his older brother.  It is incredibly sturdy and covers almost the entire length of his bed.  That's good because I was honestly envisioning ways to cage him in his bed so he wouldn't fall (or escape...think Curious George and you have our little man).  It was simple to assemble and install (I'm naturally blonde and did it myself in 20 minutes, so it can't be that tough), and it is remarkably easy to clean and still looks like new after a year.  Our son has stood against it and leaned on it, but it still holds firm, keeps its shape, and prevents him from falling.  The straps were much easier to adjust and the railing is MUCH MUCH sturdier than our other son's railing (Dex Products), something that stopped us from using them on his brother's bed.  We feel confident that our son is sleeping securely and have never worried about him falling off, even though I was against him sleeping on the mid-high loft.  Buy this railing and you and your child will sleep safe and sound, too!	
- 1	Typically, it works alright.  However I have problems with the cutting mechanism almost every time I empty it, it will only partially cut through the plastic (and that was on the stage 1).  And after I empty it, I re-tie a knot and twist the top and the next time I put a diaper in, it just spins and spins with out actually tying up the diaper.	
1. 	We bought this turtle for a 3-year-old and he loves it! He turns it on every night before he goes to sleep. His mom says it helps keep him in bed, and has helped with his fear of the dark. The turtle also comes with batteries, which is a nice bonus.	
- 1	We have used this sippy cup for over a year now and had been moderately pleased with it until some recent discoveries...- The cup was never what I would call leak proof, but I felt the leak was not too bad. Now that I have many, many stains all over my wool rug, I have now changed my mind.- There are many pieces to take apart for cleaning and it is not easy to do so. If you don't line the soft spout up with the hard top exactly right when you are putting it back together, it will leak a LOT. If you don't screw the lid on VERY tightly, it will leak a lot. We had one that started leaking profusely (just during regular use, not holding it upside down), even though it was assembled just right. It seemed to be leaking from underneath the sealed yellow band that is part of the handle assembly.- We've gone through four soft spouts for this sippy. My 2 year old chews through the spouts easily.Now for the UNSAFE part that caused us to throw in the towel on these sippys:- We just discovered that under the little yellow rim inside the cup at the very top is a great hiding place for gunk, bacteria, and buildup. You would not believe the amount of black GOOP that we wiped and scraped out of there after discovering this. It has been cleaned many times by hand and in the dishwasher, and we were horrified that our son has been drinking out of this grossly contaminated cup for so long. Now that I look at the cup with a more discriminating eye, I can't imagine that you could really get it absolutely clean, given the design.	
1. 	I like these and I am using them since I have a tall bed... but yeah co sleeper is wobbly with them. Hasn't been an issue yet with my 3.5 month old. But I get nervous when my toddler tries to hang on the sides to see the baby.	
1. 	the vibration and rocking effect soothe my baby. she looked happy on it. best buy in amazon. the cushion is soft to touch and fine with baby's fragile skin. easy to assemble. definitely worth buying.	
- 1	While this is probably not the product's fault, neither of my kids will let me get this on their head.  Hair washing is still horrible.  Waste of money for me.	
- 1	I have used decals many times, from many different companies and have been really lucky I guess. I love skip hop products, but their decals just don't stay on the wall :( overall it still looks adorable, and you do get two whole trees (or really 4 half trees and leaves and stuff to do with what you please), but I was saddened by the immediate peeling, especially since I'm practiced and pretty careful. It's definitely just not as tacky as the other brands. luckily my daughter sees me smoothing it all out constantly so instead of wanting to rip them all down, she just mimics me and smooths it out again. I doubt that will last long though! :)	
- 1	Typically I use the Sassy Disposable Diaper Sacks (blue, come in a box of about 200) but the price rose and I decided to try these Summer Infant ones.  They are half the size of the blue Sassy ones (which would fit up to 3-4 pee diapers before I'd have to toss it) and only hold one, maybe two, diapers.  They are also very thin and my finger went right through one as I tried to slip my finger between the two sides to open the bag up.  I'll go back to the Sassy's as soon as I use up these Summer Infant ones - which shouldn't take long considering you have to use a new one with each diaper change because it will only fit one diaper and wipe!	
1. 	I bought this for my wife when she first complained of back and hip pain during her pregnancy. In her case it was around 15 weeks.She was sure that putting a pillow between her knees would be sufficient, but after two nights it was clear that would not work, as she was waking up complaining of a sore back and hip. I ordered this as a surprise and had it sent next day shipping with Amazon Prime.First Impression:The pillow is big. Like, really big. It came in a box that was easily four feet long by two feet wide and a foot and a half thick. The pillowcase was soft and the stuffing seemed soft yet supportive. It was a bit intimidating to look at out of the context of bed.Using the pillow:We put it in the bed (queen size) and she tried it out before actually going to bed. Her first impression was that it was quite comfortable to lay with. It took up a decent amount of the bed but didn't encroach my side too badly and I knew it would be worth it for her to be comfortable.She was sold on the first night. The loop that goes between the legs kept her hip in alignment and she woke up the next morning pain free. She said it did not sleep warm so she didn't get hot snuggled up against it. It helped her to stay laying on her left side for most of the night, as it made it tough to roll over with the loop between her legs. Now that she is more advanced into her pregnancy (28 weeks), the part that goes under her belly is providing good support to keep her back from getting torqued over night.She isn't experiencing any issues with the seams causing chafing as some reviewers have had.The only notable flaw is that the pillow case is getting some tiny pill balls, which is a little disappointing. However, they are very minor and would not stop me from buying the pillow again.Bonus: My dog and I also find the pillow to be extremely comfortable.	
1. 	Medela is the best and these membranes are perfect. Easy to replace and keep my pump running like new. Of course I'd get them again.	
- 1	It's not that I didn't like them, baby didn't. Nipple was way too small, he never took them. He is breastfed and his previous pacifier was a Hevea one.	
1. 	Easy to use, clean, store, warm quickly, and travel with.  The nipples come in slow or fast and are so much like the breast my daughter went back and forth without a problem.  the darker nipples are a little more pliable and my daughter much preferred them over the clear ones.  works with generic pre-formed bottle liners from target, wal-greeens, and wal-mart.  good investment	
- 1	They are small and doesn't cover the entire window as a result you still get sun rays inside the car.	
1. 	I needed a booster for my 2 year old and at first wasn't sure if this would be too small, but it turned out to be perfect!  He loves to sit w/ us at the table. I love how it extends three heights, so it can still grow with him.  (he is 27 lbs and 33 inches and he fits great, although he is a little small for his age according to averages I think there is def. room for him to grow in this).  He loves the table too--makes him feel like he is sitting w/ us at the dinner table but also has his special chair. Very easy to attach to a chair too--we have one w/ a cushion and no problems. Very secure. PERFECT item!	
1. 	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!	
1. 	what a cost efficient way to get rid of diapers.  We scratched the diaper genie and decided to do this.  Best decision yet because the diaper genie will only mask the same amount of stink as these baggies.  Best thing, you can throw some in your diaper bag and you can change him anywhere in the house without running to a diaper pail.	
- 1	Be wary of any diaper pail that requires instructions and a demo by your next-door-neighbor in order to use it!  After I figured it all out I found that it was a pain to fool with.  Also the refills are expensive and it doesn't hold enough diapers IMO. It doesn't lock out odors either.  It may have for the first week or two, but now at 3 1/2 months it SMELLS BAD.  I guess the diapers have gotten stinkier.  What can I say?The other thing that drives me nuts is that the first few diapers I put in after a refill change never go in correctly.  No matter how many times I twist after the first diaper, the second one always pushes right through the first twist and ends up hanging in the bottom - un-sausage-linked.  The only positive thing I can say is that when you do cut the links loose they are easy to dispose of in the outside garbage.You may want to save your money on this one and go with something less fru-fru.	
- 1	I bought it when my baby was one month old. She cries a lot and I wanted to buy a wrap so that I can carry her at home while doing works. However, she doesn't like it much plus it's too long and not convenience to use. I used it for two times only and it's now sitting at home.	
- 1	I bought these to use with my Pump in Style because I found the hard shields a bit painful at first. I had previously been using thePhilips AVENT BPA Free Manual Breast Pump, Whitethat had a soft areola stimulator that I found very comfortable, so I thought these might help make the Pump in Style more comfortable. Eh. It was slightly more comfortable with the Flexishields, but I felt like the suction was really decreased. Plus, they fit on the hard shields in a really weird way and were always falling off. Not worth the hassle. So I used them for about a week and then shelved them. I eventually got used to the hard shields and don't find them uncomfortable anymore.	
1. 	I loved this sheet it was exactly as pictured and fit great on my crib mattress.  I would definitely buy again!	
1. 	The bibs are soft and absorbent. Good value and wash well, but, because there is no lining, they soak through easily and clothes can be soiled.	
1. 	Great product, we use it quite often. Its easy to put on and take off. Baby falls asleep in it. Small quirks though, the only issues I have is with the bottom part where the babys bottom sits. It just doesn't seem ergonomic to the babys legs. It spreads them apart and is tight on the legs, especially when hes facing forward. Also, the top part that folds down is another issue, he puts his mouth on the fabric, which is fine but also on the plastic part that secures him to the chest, another design flaw. Other than that, I've been pretty happy with this carrier.	
- 1	I like the design of this cup a lot and my son thought it was funny. It always made him smile when I used it. But I took it with me on a trip and it immediately started leaking. I'm not positive where it was even leaking from. I have other Nuby sippy cups and have had good luck with them, but this one didn't work out as well as I wanted it to.	
1. 	I haven't used this one but I like that it's really compact & fits my diaper bag.	
- 1	I found the ultimate crib sheet to be much more trouble than it's worth. Lifting my daughter's mattress takes no effort: it's made of  lightweight foam. As a result, changing her sheets is also super easy. I just have to lift the mattress, and it takes two seconds. On the other hand, snapping all the ties on the ultimate crib sheet takes bending over the crib for five solid minutes (plus, the manufacturer recommends snapping the snaps before every wash, which means snap on crib, unsnap, snap again before wash, unsnap, snap on crib...) So, if you have a foam mattress in a corner of the room, I'd suggest just getting normal sheets and some of those stay-dry liners. If you have a coil mattress and keep the crib in the center of the room, then by all means, try the ultimate crib sheet...	
1. 	just like everyone else.. we like this rocker...our 3 year old seats in and our 1 year old can have fun in it as well...looks like a good gift to give and looks like it will last a life time around kids...P.S&#62; Fisher-Price CS is great.. so 5 star for that.--------------------If you fine my reviews helpful please mark it as so.. Thank you.	
1. 	Liked the fact that it can be easily used for newborns as they don't slip down and sink!It's very resistant and durable, the only thing I don't like is that you need plenty of space to storage it.	
- 1	My baby (just turned one year old) dislike the toy immediately when i present it to her.  The squeaky sound is way too loud and annoying.  She is actually scared of it and refuse to handle it.  I wouldn't mind spending more money on good product but unfortunately this product is not what i expected (mainly due to the squeaky noise i think the rubber is fine).	
1. 	While watching my friend lug her whole travel system out of her trunk, I can pop this baby open with one hand.  It's a great product, very maneuverable and light with an excellent basket underneath for all that baby stuff.  One drawback: the cup holder is small and shallow - won't hold a thermal mug, but holds a standard styrofoam coffee cup.	
- 1	This stool does stick to the floor and has good grip but as many other reviewers stated this is too LOW! My toddler is quite tall and it's still not proportionate! Maybe it will help him when he's like 5 but he's 2.5 now and I'm just unhappy overall with this! Other complaints are that the sticker is impossible to get off (so I've left it on) and this DOES NOT match the green froggy potty as other reviewers have stated! Completely different greens and in no way matching! Worth $5 maybe - definitely not $9.99. Get a taller stool if you want to use one for the toilet or hand washing.	
1. 	Firstly,I have to admit that I bought these to use &#34;for the wrong reason&#34; meaning not as intended to be used. My son is day trained and we are moving on to night. I wanted something to contain as much of the accident as possible but still let him feel wetness. These work perfectly. They wouldn't hold a big giant pee accident, but I wouldn't expect them to. They wash and dry well and are comfy and not too bulky.	
- 1	The thermometer that is stuck to the cushion is useful but the plastic is too sharp and pointy.  It's not completely flush with the cushion so when you lay your baby down on it, the thermometer will scratch your baby's bottom.  We have to use a wash cloth to cover the thermometer when we use it.  I wish they would have put the thermometer somewhere else on the cushion- like the side- that doesn't touch the baby.  Either that or make it so the edges are not sharp.  The cushion itself is nice and gives good support though.Update-- I have since pulled off the thermometer completely.  It's glued on and when I pulled it off a bit of the cushion came with it.  Not ideal but better than having a sharp edge scratching my baby's bottom.  We just use the thermometer separately to read the temp of the water.	
1. 	Good price. Works in dishwasher, no spills with lid. I don't know why you can't pick the colors, but we lucked out with our colors.	
- 1	My 6 month old loved it, but poor quality for three reasons:1.  He could pull it off of the base too easily so it was always on the floor.2.  The paint on the clear wings is easily chewed off.  Sorry, paint does not count as solid food!3.  The suction was inconsistent. Once an area it would stick to was found, I was fearful of moving cause it was temperamental.	
- 1	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings.  There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin.  First of all, the instructions are not user friendly.  Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret.  Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally.  During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place.  The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why.  The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle.  I also purchased the sterilizer which works great.  However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use.  Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart.  I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts.  Overall, this pump was very messy.  For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be.  And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying.	
1. 	This gate has been fantastic.  We have been using it for 3 years now, and it has been so easy to use.  I admit the opening is too large, but safe enough for everyone to get through.  It's easy to modify to suit your needs.  I recommend these types of gates, which swing open, as I tripped over a tension gate (freestanding style) and broke my leg.  Be safe, not sorry.  This gate is WONDERFUL.	
- 1	Worst product ever.  This window shade does not stay up.  I finally just threw mine in the trash.  I would have returned it but had thrown away the packaging.  Don't waste your time.  We ended up buying a different Brica shade that actually works.  I do not recommend this product.	
- 1	I ordered and currently use the original version of the Adiri Nurser bottle, as that was the only bottle at the time my exclusively breastfed baby would take. Thank goodness he has grown past that phase and now will take the Born Free bottles I had purchased and received as baby shower gifts. This NexGen bottle is too much trouble. All the different pieces and steps to fill and heat it are so cumbersome and time consuming. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for all of that. They really need to rethink the design on this thing. It's also hard to read the amounts. I thought I would love it, as I like the look and feel of it but boy am I glad I didn't have to actually use it too long.	
- 1	I exclusively pump, so my baby always gets expressed breast milk.  I switched to these bottles from the playtex drop-ins because my baby was spilling tons of milk from the sides of her mouth. These bottles work when they want to. You have to find just the right way to screw the ring/nipple to the bottle, but for the most part they leak. I have not been able to determine if it is the bottle itself or the nipple that makes it leak. If you close it too tight, then I have to interrupt feeding constantly so that I can vent the bottle, if I unscrew it to vent, it leaks all over the place. For milk storage, it is a great product, especially because it is compatible with the breat pump attachments as well as the medela cooler. However for feeding find something else please!	
- 1	My son did not like this at all. He was 7 months when he got it. He is 11 months now and has not touched this toy ever.	
1. 	Our kids love these toys and they're painted very well and extremely colorful.  The only issue, as any parent knows with these squirter toys, is that the holes are in really strange places, making it extremely difficult to get the water out.	
- 1	With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	I bought the SnuggleNest because my preemie son seemed overwhelmed by the size of his crib, and would fuss alot when I would put him down.  I didn't want him to get used to sleeping in the bassinet portion of the Pack 'N Play, so I bought this to use in his crib.  My son goes to sleep now with minimal fussing, because he no longer feels like he is sleeping in a big crib.	
1. 	I absolutely love the cosleeper.  We have used it for our daughter since she was a newborn, and it is still going strong at 16 months.  As a newborn, we used the bassinet feature against our bed as a cosleeper.  The bassinet feature was so wonderful to have;I didn't have to bend over to the floor after giving birth to pick her up.  It was also really nice to be able to see her at night right next to me, but not actually be in the bed with us.  Once our baby could kneel, we used it as a crib, a few feet away from our bed.  Now that she is sleeping in her own bedroom, we still have it set up as a crib for her friends when they visit.  If we hadn't received a crib as a gift, I think it would be a decent option as one.  If you are looking for a true travel crib, the cosleeper is not quick to take apart and is heavy to transport.  We have a top rated travel crib we love, but it is smaller, not sturdy, and I would not consider using it as a full-time crib.	
- 1	Not a big fan of these. These wash clothes are quantity over quality. I bought 3 packs of the Crayola wash clothesCrayola Washcloth SetCrayola Crayola 7 Pack Beginnings Washcloth Setthat are sooo much better. The crayola kind are think with a terry cloth like texture on one side and a cloth border around the edge.These have no border and are more like cut up squares of thin cloth.These washclothes have been relegated to second bathroom status and for on the go wipe up.If you need a thin and mobile washcloth - then this is your product. if you want something that will last and will actually be gentle and soft on your baby's face (and other places) then the crayola are your gig.As a bonus - the crayola's are also embroidered with the name of the color - good learning tool too !	
- 1	I returned these cups because my 10mo son could not extract the milk from them. It appears that you need to bite the straw and suck before you can get anything. Not a good product design. I ordered them because I like the look and functionality of the removable handles however, its not usable.	
- 1	Unfortunatly I wasn't so thrilled- I found them to be cheap and flimsy, the food doesn't stick to the stick part.	
- 1	We got this seat for my wife's car.  I have a Recaro ProRide in my car so my basis of comparison is between using these two seats.The side impact features are excellent.  The size, positions, and height is good.  The bolstering is enough but without being excessive like the Recaro.  The fabric is different than other brands, it cleans up well but in humid weather is is a bit weird feeling to me (clammy).  The integrated cup holder is much better than the add-on one that Recaro has.My only gripes are with the harness system, which is sort of the soul of a child seat.  The push button buckle is way harder to push than it needs to be.  It just about cramps the heck out of my thumb everytime I use it.  This button has loosened up a little over time but it still operates no where near as good as any buckle ought to.  It is also difficult to pull slack in the shoulder belts, almost like it is caught on something**.  The release buckle is pressed all the way but there is still something adding resistance.  The little shoulder belt pads are nice but if they slip out of the way, expect the belts to rub against your kids' neck.  The Recaro hero feature is hands down the better feature to avoid belt rub.All in all my wife likes this seat and I still feel it is an OK value.  Hands down the Recaro has Maxi-Cosi whipped in some specific features.  The Maxi-Cosi is good in all of the important features.  The only great thing it has is the cup holder.Made in China**Update: This harness binding keeps getting worse over time.  The harness is tough to release and tighten.  I took out the seat to inspect what the heck is going on.  The split buckle back there is rubbing against the back of the seat causing resistance (seat is not really smooth).  The worst part is a tab that holds the tether buckle to the seat, it sticks out quite a bit and hangs up on the harness buckle as it drags over the tab.  This should not operate in this manner, poor design.  Also this fabric shows stains pretty badly.  I have not tried pulling the cover off to wash it yet.  My past experiences never result in a re-installed cover fitting as it did.  One star removed.  In comparison, the Recaro operates perfectly and still looks new.  So I replaced this one with my Recaro since I have to move into Radians for my car now.	
- 1	I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles). Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price. Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing still	
- 1	What genius decided to make this thing so SHORT?! A lady who just delivered a baby doesn't need the added back ache of having to bend over nearly to the ground to throw away a diaper.Not only that, but the handle sticks (and then pops off the side) on a regular basis.Also, when you open the chute to dispose of a diaper, you get a giant nose full of everything that's in the bin.  In other words, the awful stink that is in the bin is scooped into the disposal chamber and wafts out into the room every time you throw a diaper away. This is definitely NOT odor proof.The old model was taller and didn't hurt our backs.The old model did not STINK every time you threw away a diaper.WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY CHANGE THE DESIGN?!	
- 1	The glass bottles are nice but the whole bottle is useless all thanks to the new nipples. Our baby had a very tough time maintaining a good seal around the nipple and as a result milk would spill all around his neck. We initially thought it was the flow rate on the nipple but after trying different Avent nipples (that have slower flow rates) and getting the same messy results we decided to return the entire bottle set and get the Dr. Brown's glass bottle set instead.	
1. 	I use this stroller for my baby and 4yr old and it has proved invaluable.  The only this is I wish it had more storage room, but I guess that would defeat the purpose of it not being bulky.	
1. 	I don't want a diaper bag so I bought this to hold wipes & diapers in & then just store it in my purse. It works amazingly & I never have to worry about my baby girl lying on a dirty surface or her dirtying a surface.	
1. 	I bought these to take on our 6 hour car ride so that I could pump in the car and not have to worry about clean up or taking extra parts.  They worked great.	
- 1	The mobile looks really pretty. However, I used this mobile for not more than 30 mins and the battery was dead. It uses 3 C batteries.	
- 1	Hello!  I just bought his for my 5 month out as he needs some interesting teethers to use.When I purchased it I didn't think about the bumble bee's sticking out...Now that he's using it I am constantly worried one of these bumble bees is going to hurt his mouth during use, i'm always turning it to avoid the bees, they're made of hard plastic and not soft teether plastic.  This has become a high maintenance toy.It might be safe but it doesn't look it!  Wish I bought something with smooth beads all around.We haven't had any paint chipping issues, but my guy doesn't have teeth yet!	
- 1	The colors on this puzzle stacker are muted. My son was not drawn to it at all. Not as pictured!	
1. 	I have mixed feelings about this seat.  I think the seat could be padded more and the material leaves little to be desired.  I'm not a fan of the pattern either. The toy bar isn't all that great nor does the music play for more than 4 seconds. However, and it's a big however, my 2 month old son LOVES it! As long as he is fully fed, he will sit in this seat in excess of an hour at times, cooing, swatting at the toys, smiling, and giggling.  When he begins to fuss a little, I put the vibrator on and he will usually give me another 10-20 minutes to get more done.  I can also see the toddler rocking seat being useful and fun for him when he is older.  All in all... this is a great little seat and you really can't beat it for the price.  I had to give it 5 stars since my son seems to adore it.	
- 1	I should have heeded the other reviewers who warned that this shade was completely black. You can't see your baby and, psychologically, it feels like you've locked your baby in a dark closet. I can imagine this being an effective shade if you are at a hot baseball game and your baby is sleeping. But if you are just walking through the neighborhood and want your baby to be able to see out and want to be able to see your baby, this is not the right product.	
- 1	Thought this was cute at first but the opening is way too smaill for toddler hands!  My son struggles to pull his hand out with his snacks.	
- 1	I had soft plastic one and inflate one before. this looked good but didn't work with our faucet cause it slips off all the time since the drain hook deal is not there to keep it hold on. if it works, product looks good though.	
1. 	I bought this crib in cherry for 245$, after reading every review about this and many other cribs and safety reports.My babygril is now 4 months old. she sleeps well in it. She slept in it sinds day one.It's beautiful, very sturdy, came in perfect state..but now it has a few scrates(mostely form a belt).It's easy to setup if you just follow the instructions, my boyfriend did it on his own in about 1 hour, I sat and watched...was 37 weeks pregnant. the cherry collor is just as you see it in the picture.I still have it on the highest mattress level, because my girl cannot situp on her own yet... but sometimes I wished it had a dropside because it gets harder lifting her out of her crib all the time, she's 7 kg now.. but then a dropside is dangerous. it weigh alot, but still is very easy to move arround when you need to clean.so if you like the looks... buy it..it's worth it. good furniture.my girl is now 21 months, still sleeps very well in her crib.I still am very happy with my purches. A great crib.	
1. 	I snipped the end off the net so the balls would fall thru and it became extra fun! Suction cups hold great. Only downfall is the balls have a tiny hole in them so water gets in and becomes moldy. But other balls I had fit and work good too.	
- 1	I purchased this tub because of the high rating. I hate it!Here are some pros...First, the sling works really well for the new born. It's very easy to bathe the new born. The problem starts when we removed the sling. Second, the hump at the bottom works very well. It helps my 2.5 month old baby sit while bathing.Here are the cons:1. The plug. I put this tub in the adult. Since the plug is at the bottom the dirty water does not flow out once I unplug it. It's block tightly against the big bathtub. I have to lift my baby up while my husband pick up the tub to dump the water out. He is wiggling in my arm, wet while my husband fill the tub again with right temperature water. It's definitely a two men job. This doesn't happen if you bathe your baby in the kitchen sink.2. The tub is too short. My baby start to kick against the plastic wall at the end of the tub. Everytime he kick it, he lifted him self and his back ends up on the hump. Again, my baby is very wiggly.	
- 1	I expected this to be a bracelet or necklace for me to wear not for a baby to wear.	
- 1	I paid 14$ for this thing and within 2 days it was leaking. The worst sippy I have ever purchased And my son would ask for milk and I'd put it in this thing and he'd start screaming. He hated. Munchkin pop & lock sippy is where its at. It is plastic so if you are looking for something metal move on. But they are incredible at not leaking. For a while I liked Munchkin mighty grip but eventually my son poked out the stopper.Edit to add: It broke my phone. I had it under the stroller w/ my phone. BIG MISTAKE.	
1. 	The hammock makes a huge difference. Baby is calm and happy in it. Mom and dad also feel more confident that he won't drawn in the tub.	
1. 	Highly recommend this.FANTASTIC BABY BRUSHThis is an excellent baby brush - we bought this for the brush alone - toothpaste will be a nice extra when we start using it (just water and the brush with an infant for now - and baby loves it).  He actually smiles and opens wide.  This is contrast to using a wet cloth to wipe his gums and teeth which made him cry.  It must feel like a baby gum massage or something.The brush is like a large, soft thimble with a mini brush (very soft) on the finger pad.  You put it over your index finger and rub it on baby's teeth and gums.  From what we read (including from the American Dental Association), you should start some kind of brushing this as soon as baby starts teething, but toothpaste seems optional for infants.TOOTHPASTEWe're not using the toothpaste yet, so I hesitate to comment on it - other that you can see from most of the other reviews that the toothpaste is a big winner too.	
1. 	We registered for this tub after reading reviews about several others, some much more pricey. This is THE tub for us. I love the cradle/sling feature for newborns! It's made of a soft, nylon-type mesh, which allows water to pass through while supporting a slippery newborn.There is a convenient built in pocket at the rear of the tub in which to store soaps, washclothes or rubber duckies. I like the drain feature, although I rarely wait for it to drain. I usually just dump it over after my daughter is out because time's a commodity with a screaming newborn. I honestly can't comment on the plug changing colors to make sure the water isn't too hot because hubby and I use our hands and own judgement to determine that. I don't think there is a device out there I would trust more than my own skin to determine if the temp is safe enough, though.The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the netting being a little slippery. Baby tends to slide down after a while. But that's hardly a problem, since you shouldn't turn your back EVER on a baby in water anyway. I highly recommend this to anyone, and you can't beat the price!	
- 1	Wish I wouldn't have purchased.  It is hard to set and I never really knew if I could trust it to work, so I really didn't get the rest I wanted.  Maybe it will work better with baby number 2.	
- 1	We used these in a pool that required we buy them before my daughter could enter (what a scam!). She's 2 and I bought a 2-T because she fit in the weight range, but they were way too big. If she had pooped/peed, it would have run right out the side. So I put her normal swim diaper on first, which fits perfectly and we've never had an accident with it, then I put this suit over it. This setup worked fine, but certainly defeats the purpose of the My Pool Pal suit. The biggest issue was the pink color ran terribly! I put her wet suit in a bag with mine, and my blue suit was pink when I pulled it out. This is after swimming and rinsing. I put it in the sink to soak when we got home, and the water turned pink instantly. Scares me to think what this would do to her skin!	
1. 	Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners. Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible!	
- 1	I bought these after a positive experience with a similar product in 2010. I wish I could find that other product again. This is not nearly as good. I bought a lot, thinking it would be like the other product I liked in 2010, and I made twelve ornaments  with this product in spite of the significant problems, so this was not a one time bad experience. I experimented with different kneading times and different amounts of pressure to make the print. Regardless, I was not able create an attractive product. Here were the problems I encountered.(1) It requires A LOT of pressure to make the imprint--more pressure than babies, or most adults make naturally, so you will have to very, very firmly press your child's hand (or foot) into each ornament your make. When my daughter was a newborn, this was impossible. I had another kit and saved it for later when she was seven months. It was still very hard. I did a lot of footprints, because she puts more weight on the feet naturally than her hands.(2) The finished product doesn't look great. From a distance on a Christmas tree, you would be hard pressed (no pun intended) to make out that this was the shape of a baby's hand or foot. It just looks like a white circle until you get close. And keep in mind, this was after considerable work to get a firm imprint from my infant. Even more disappointingly, you cannot make out the adorable, distinctive wrinkles in her foot or hand. It primarily just an outline shape pressed in. Both the other clay product I used, and ink pad prints preserve those adorable wrinkles.(3) The circle cut-out isn't sharp enough to cut the edges cleanly. At least this problem is easy to fix with an Exact-o knife or scissors, but it is irksome. I sincerely doubt the examples on the product box were made with this kit alone.(4) The circle shape is only 4 inches in diameter. My daughter's foot nearly fills it, and she is tiny for age seven months (just over 14 lbs). The average one year old's hand will not fit comfortable in this circle. You could lose their cut-out and make your own, but again, it is irksome to have to use other products after you buy a &#34;kit.&#34;I recommend saving yourself this trouble. If you can't find a better clay kit, buy an ink pad to preserve precious prints and make crafts with. It will look much better and be less hassle.	
1. 	We have had this frog for about 3 months now and i have to totally disagree with a few of the reviews i read briefly about it not sticking. This thing is like super glued to my bathroom tub wall with those stickers they provided. I have a TON of toys in it, some are very heavy and i probably shouldn't even have them in there... but hey, it works!The color is darker... its not like a light ugly bright green like the picture shows... Its darker and a PERFECT green frog color that i assure you is not at all bright. It matches his bathroom PERFECTLY!It was very easy to put up, i used an alcohol wipe from the dr office, wiped the wall with it (its like that 1 piece bath fitter or whatever plasticy wall thing), waited like 5 minutes and slapped the frog on. Its been sex-i-fying up my bathroom ever since!OH and its awesome because his big front feet hold his cup and stuff too.SO worth the money, if not just for cuteness alone :)	
1. 	When we first purchased this product new and took it out of the box, there were a lot of pieces to put together (but that is like any child's toy) which was modestly easy to do with the instructions.  It took both me and my husband probably around 20-30 minutes to get it up and running.  We bought this for my daughter when she was about 5 months old and stuck a thick blanket behind her to give her extra stability.  The ExerSaucer has easy adjustable legs to make it taller as your baby grows (3 total height adjustments).  My daughter is 7 months old now and is on level two and she is 27 inches tall.  The seat spins and has a locking clip underneath if you wish for your child to stay in one spot.  It can be claps with SOME effort.  It took us a little bit of time to learn how to collapse it.  The plastic clamps were really tight and we had to pop them open with some effort, but now that we did it a couple of times, the plastic has softened making it quite simple.There are springs in the legs so when she jumps it has a small bounce in it (though it isn't made to be a jumper.  The little circus tent spins around (on/off button) lights up and plays circus songs.  There are a lot of different toys that teaches the child to spin, rotate flip and slide along with different textures and sounds that the toys make.  It is a great investment!  I often sit my daughter in her ExerSaucer while I am making dinner and the only sounds I hear from her are giggles.	
- 1	Need to return and order something bigger. Sun still gets in my sons face no matter where I place it.	
- 1	The water vial that is attached to this unit just sits ever so gently on the side meaning IT FALLS OFF CONSTANTLY.  It was so annoying I returned it.  I'm a mom on the go so I would throw this in my bag and take it with me but it was always a chore to have to find the missing water vial.  I much prefer the Munchkin High Speed bottle and food warmer, the water vial stays firmly in place.  But with any bottle sterilizer you have to make sure you don't lose the ring that goes around the top, too bad those don't snap in.	
1. 	It was probably a great idea overall, but I did not find any use for it.When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine. At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster.The product is good, if you need it.	
1. 	The corner pockets were perfect for nursing pads or pacifiers. The print looked just like the picture and I got a ton of use out of this product.A little overpriced and does not wash well around the boning.	
1. 	This is the perfect sound machine for a baby's room....helps block out sounds that could wake baby.  Plays for up to 45 minutes which is really nice.  It's great because you can bring it with you when you are traveling...packs well.Not a fan of the whale sound option but the rest are great!	
- 1	It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)	
1. 	OMG this was the best thing I ever bought while pregnant, i used it for holding up my stomach while sleeping on my side it was invaluable. It stopped pulling and stretching of my stomach, kept my legs apart when I put it between my knees. If you are a man reading this with a pregnant wife, get it for her. I promise she will love it and you.	
- 1	The mirror comes with two different methods of attachment - suction cup or clip onto the visor.  I am using the suction cup and it seems to be sticking very well, though I've only had it up for a few days so far.  However, the image it gives me of the back seat is incredibly small, much smaller than my regular rear view mirror.  I'll be able to see general motion and that's about it.  I guess this is a side effect of the wide view but I don't need to monitor three kids, just one, so it doesn't need to be wide.  There is also a small amount of distortion, right above the center of the mirror, which is annoying.If I can find the packaging I'm going to return it, but I may have already discarded some or all of it.	
- 1	Loved the idea, but this didn't really work for my two-year-old twins.  It seemed to frustrate them and water still got dumped.  Tried removing insert and tried doubling-up the insert as suggested by another reviewer.  Doubling-up was a good idea and did slow the flow, but still just frustrated my kids.  Haven't used in a while, so might try again.  I can imagine it working well for some - depending on age and readiness.	
- 1	After spending a frustrating hour or so trying to install this gate, my husband and I quickly decided to return it back to Amazon.  We brought it to confine our puppy when we need to leave her alone in the house, and wanting something easy to setup and store away we went for the Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate, thinking it would be the ideal solution.Firstly, this gate did not fit our standard sized doorways.  We'd been hoping that as the gate was advertised as being a travel gate, it would fit both small and wide openings.  Not so.Gladly, the gate did fit our hallway, so we decided to set it up there instead.  Unfortunately, this soon led us to realize the biggest problems with this product:  it is extremely awkard to assemble and put away.The buttons are concealed beneath the thick fabric, which is slippery and difficult to grip.  The buttons themselves are awkward to locate and hard to push.  The instructions are astonishingly lengthy and were vital in order for us to figure out how to put the gate up.  There was no way I could manage to put this up myself (my husband did it for me).It wasn't very easy to put back into the travel bag either.  It took both my husband and I to get it back in there!  We heaved a sigh of relief when it was packed back away, and returned it back to Amazon immediately.  Not a good product, at all.	
1. 	I love this tub. The insert was perfect when my daughter was just a few days and weeks old. Now I only clip the head rest part to it and my 4 month old leans against it while I wash her. The pieces that come with it are perfect for washing and also as toys to keep her attention. I especially love the drain in the bottom.	
- 1	Thought I had purchased a decent item. My 9 month crawled up to the plug today and removed it from the outlet. She then thought they were toys and starting taking all of them out and carrying them around. Absolutely do NOT recommend this nor would I purchase again.	
1. 	I have several baby carriers and I prefer my Mobi wrap and my Infantino Flip because I feel they are more secure, but this one is great for the hip carry.  My daughter jerks back a lot though, so I still always have one hand on her at all times.  I like it to carry her around when she's cranky and I don't need both hands to do something.  It's great for going for a walk, but not when you need both hands for something else like pushing a stroller or carrying groceries.  If your baby doesn't jerk back, then it's great!	
1. 	I have the pump so I got extra and they are solid build and  it is good quality.	
1. 	No more spills when taking his bottles of milk, water and juice to places and no more problems with liquid waste in his bag.	
- 1	I bought this bag after our last cooler was outgrown by our baby. I searched for a cooler that was sturdy and had enough space for at least two bottles and food jars. The only reason I am not giving it 1 star was because I was able to pack the above and then store the spoons in the front zippered pocket. After  a month and half of use the inside stitching came apart and the foam underneath became visible. Very poorly constructed. I have to say that my final decision fir purchase of this product was based on brand as Dr. Brown is known for quality products. I was very disappointed.As a side note, I did not buy this product through Amazon but through a large baby retail store.	
1. 	I bought this for my infant but it did not work out well for us (got the Moby instead) but once she was 6 months it has been an easy way to have a free hand while doing laundry or walking to the mailbox, without having to get all strapped in. I think this is a must have for an older baby for quick uses--where you just need 1 hand. The pattern is fantastic by the way. Very nice.	
- 1	I love osocozy! I use their prefectfit prefolds! Thought I would live these! Nope! They are very thin! & after a couple washes the fabric starts to ball up! Wouldn't purchase again!	
1. 	I really like this product.  I put in the Huggies pop up wipes and don't really have any problems.  When the wipes are getting down to the bottom, they sometimes fall through the top so I have to pull them back through.  I re-wet the fresher pad everytime I add more wipes and I've never had dried or browned wipes.  Besides, what baby doesn't like a warm wipe versus a cold one?	
- 1	I have had this product less than 2 weeks and the inside liner is pulled apart on the seams already.  I have never been more disappointed in a product.  I haven't really even used it to carry to capacity only a few bottles back and forth to daycare so I was really disappointed to notice that the inside was already ripped.	
1. 	I've been using this sling for over 1 year now. Baby gets excited as soon as she sees it bc she knows she's gonna be on mama or papa. I can still (at almost 20 mos) walk her around and BF or put her to sleep. The material isn't as soft as other slings I've seen, but considering the amount of times I've washed the sling, that's actually a good thing bc it still looks brand new. Regardless, the baby looks comfy in it and she's never complained of being uncomfortable.I have 2 other carriers, the Moby and the Beco. The Moby was good while she was a little baby, but it was cumbersome and too hot for the weather in south Florida. I also love the Beco, but the sling is so much easier to use for shorter periods of time.	
1. 	This is the first time we bought latex nipples, so maybe they are all a little noisier than the silicone ones.  But those ones leaked horribly for us, and these don't have that problem.	
- 1	This barely moves any air - not worth the money or batteries.  Doesn't clip easilty to anything - just falls out of place.  Don't waste your time or money.	
1. 	I loved this carrier until my daughter was about 15-18 pounds. After that it was way to heavy for extended period of times. When she was small it was perfect we could go for walks, get errands completed around the house, or just hang out outside with it on. I tried it at the store and at the mall, but after a while my back started hurting. My daughter was actually pretty comfortable in it. My husband wore it a few times to and he said it was comfortable.Con-When My daughter could be placed fron forward the top of the carrier rubbed on her face and would not bend down, so that was a pain.	
- 1	I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static. I could not hear my baby at all! I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead ... and I'm very satisfied with the exchange.	
1. 	This is an excellent product.  My husband, who had never held a baby before we had our daughter, was able to swaddle our little girl like a pro using this product.  Even my mom who use to work Labor and Delivery as a nurse loves this product.  I loved it because I didn't worry about her getting her blanket loose and then getting it over her face.  She stayed snug in this blanket whenever she slept.	
- 1	If your thinking about using this on your infant baby then think twice. the magnifier may not be useful as you think.  I have never used the magnifier to cut my baby's nails because it has proved more difficult to use a magnifier to cut a babys nails. In other words your better off getting a cheaper brand to do the same task.	
- 1	I bought the pink one...wanted to love this cup...paid $$$ a lot for it. Brought it home from the store...assembled it...tested the nipple part with my mouth...barely any liquid water came out. I had to turn the cup to the awkward edge of the nipple and squeeze and then liquid came out. You naturally want to put your mouth over the obvious wider flatter head of the nipple, but nothing comes out AT ALL. I am an adult too with heavy suction ability...NOTHING....but sideways, at a weird angle, I can get some out. Also, this frackin bottle leaked all over me. You have to really really really attempt to line up the nipple head with the screw indentions on the bottle. It doesn't naturally screw on. Poor Design.Update...the top is getting easier and simpler to screw on properly. But I still don't use it because of the nipple...I don't want to cut it either.	
1. 	Haven't had any issues with sticking. My 13-month old has tried pulling at it, but haven't succeeded. Not sure if it's due to getting the product on right or his lack of interest and attention to it. Or both.	
1. 	I really don't know why exactly I am attracted to these things... but I think they are fun and look hysterical. Although if the baby is very young this brand tends to be on the heavy side and the baby may not be able to use it.	
- 1	My daughter really likes the cold of the frozen teether rings, but just can't seem to hold on to it long enough because it's too cold for her hands. I thought this would be great. After staying in the freezer overnight, this teether stays cold for about 15 seconds. Plus, the green leaf part (which covers half of her face) seems to be the only part that stays somewhat cold. It's not her cheeks that need soothing!	
1. 	These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product.	
1. 	Great for spare parts for vintage baby bottle collection.  These were purchased to complete nippleless bottles I got for my collection (hey, some folks collect fishing lures, salt/pepper shakers, rocks, shoes&#8230;. there are more bottle collectors than one might think !!). Playtex is a reliable brand, and latex is the authentic material for many bottles.	
1. 	Love it, love it, love it!  I love that you can use regular plastic bags and don't need to buy refills for it.  Once in a great while it will stink a bit but only when I used too big of a bag and have a LOT of diapers in there.  Wipes up nice and clean with antibacterial wipes.  My daughter is starting potty training and I'm still using it.  Great buy!	
- 1	I should have listened to the other review. The tray is way to far and my baby has to pull himself to get whatever's on it	
1. 	This pillow is wonderful. There are a number of ways to manipulate it to support whatever part of you happens to be aching that day. I use it to support my back, belly and neck mostly. It can be a bit cumbersome, but instead of trying to get out of the pillows grasp, I remove the pillow from the bed instead.I am only 5'2&#34; and there is quite a bit of extra pillow -but I just wrap it farther around my body and it's very comfortable!Tag reads that it meets California's flame retardant standards but even brand new, right out of the package, there was no toxic smell.	
1. 	Love it, I have no idea how anyone could get through a pregnancy without it! Highly recommend and great price.	
- 1	I have had these for about 6 months and my 20 month old just has not taken to them as of yet.  I've tried showing him that he can scoop all sorts of things in his net - he likes to take things out of the net instead of using the net to catch things.	
- 1	The knob is constantly coming apart from the scrubber.  Next time I would just purchase the regular brush.  It's very inconvenient to clean Dr. Brown bottles to begin with - this brush just makes the process way more annoying!	
- 1	Our son is just turning 3 months old and has started teething.  He hasn't started putting toys into his mouth yet, just his hands, so we were worried that he wouldn't take the normal teething toys, but he used to like his pacifier so we thought these might work.  Let me just clarify that our son USED to like his pacifier.  He only takes it once in a while now, however, and we still thought he might like this.  They seem to be a wonderful design, I like that they come in cases, and can be put in the freezer to chill.  They have little nubs on the front of the chewy part, so it's perfect for teething the front teeth, although I don't know how much use it will be for the back teeth.When we gave it to him, he would kind of gnaw on it a little, but really didn't know what to do with it so he'd eventually pull it out with his hands or push it out with his tongue.  We are hoping that if we wait a little while, and he learns that putting things in his mouth actually HELPS the teething, then he'll be willing to take this teether.**UPDATE:  It's been several weeks now, and our little man still doesn't like this chew toy.  He much prefers his Sophie or Nuby that looks like a peanut.	
1. 	I bought these to go with a baby food maker so that I could make my own baby food for my son. These trays work perfectly!! Just like an ice cube tray, I let them sit out for about 5 mins, the twist and the cubes pop out. I haven't had any problems with the lids like others had either. Mine have fit every time. I make a good amount of food at a time, so I don't leave food in these for the long term-for that I use freezer of vacuum seal bags. I have only hand washed them, so wonder if some of the other issues have come from the heat in the dishwasher....Would HIGHLY recommend!! Just wish I had more!!	
1. 	Great teether and toy. Mulitple materials, teething surfaces with different designs to chew on, twists in multiple ways. Like it a lot! Good for little hands to grip. He doesn't manipulate the twists yet, we do it for him, but its still a hit (5 mos).	
- 1	I bought this for my son to use when laying on his back.  He has a pretty bad flat spot.  The pillow seems to raise his neck and head and leaves a gap between his shoulders and the floor.  My son seems pretty uncomfortable when laying his head on this.  I'm now trying to use it for tummy time, but it's not the best option.	
- 1	I bought this on a whim and and now I know why I love reading reviews and value their input.  I wish I would have read about this thermometer.  It does not read the same temp. from using any of the different methods.  It also does not read the same temp. when I use one method and test mine or the babies temp. a few times in a row.	
- 1	I have two year old twin girls who have made it their mission to figure out child safety locks. Some locks take longer than others, this one took them under an hour. Not the most creative design, but might do the trick for an unmotivated toddler.	
1. 	Love this! Protects the seat and it is easy to clean. I'd recommend this. Plus, I like the mesh holder in the front.	
- 1	Maybe we started her on this too late.  She as already walking on her own at 12 months and we just wanted an easier way to hold on to her. But she HATED it.  Tried it twice and had to return it.  The quality was nice.... I think it was just our kid that didn't like it at all.	
1. 	I do like this product but it wasn't what I was expecting. That's not to say the description is misleading, but I think I had it in my head that this was just a blanket with a waterproof backing. It's not! It's all made of a nylon/plasticky material. The top is silky but not fabric. It wipes off easily and it's not hard to fold up like some foldable blankets I've used. The carrying pouch is handy too. We keep it in the car for times when we need a little stretch on the grass. We have the Cocoa Bubble pattern, which is quite cute.While I do like this, I wouldn't use it if we wanted a soft place to snuggle up for a long time, like watching an outdoor movie or something. For that, I would just bring a softer regular blanket to lay on top. But if you're looking for a tough, waterproof ground covering you can easily tote around, this is perfect.	
1. 	We call this tub Moby Dick in our house on account of it's size, but this has been a great tub for my now 16 mo old. He really cannot slip in this tub and has ample room to play and splash. I use the baby side to shampoo his hair.All in all, a great tub!	
1. 	I use it with the re-usable cloth diapering Dekor Bags and it has been WONDERFUL.If you haven't already added it to your baby registry.... DO IT!  Love the low profile aesthetic as well!	
1. 	I bought this gate for the top of the stairs and for me its been money well spent.Its easy to install and quite sturdy.The auto close feature works well though it is a bit loud when it closes.The opening is a bit narrow but overall it is doing what it is supposed to.	
1. 	My 7.5 month old daughter enjoys these cups. She loves mouthing them and banging them together. The cups easily fit into one another. The cups can also be stacked into a tower, but not securely. The cups are numbered on the bottom and have small holes (each cup has a different shape hole...star-shaped, etc). Each cup is a different color and all the cups are easy for my daughter to hold. My package came with a free plastic link, which was great to attach certain toys to the infant car seat. However, the link cannot be attached to any of these stacking cups! Oh well. I still like free things!My daughter enjoys simple toys, such as these. She doesn't like toys that play music, have blinking lights, wiggle, or talk. If your baby seems to enjoy classic style toys or you're not sure, then you should get this toy (or any type of stacking cups/blocks). My husband found a great way to entertain our daughter. He would line up the cups, do some spirit fingers over the cups, quickly place the cups into one another and then give a ta-da! She always laughed :)	
- 1	Firstly, make sure you get them in a pack of 2 for the same price! Companies are splitting them and selling them separately.I was so desperate for this to work, but sadly it did nothing for me. The notch on the edge prevented it from fitting the standard flange so there was no seal at all. It seems from all the negative reviews that this really needs some design improvements. And also it seems that it only works if you are the exact right size. It seems only the minority of women are.I love my Ameda pump, but the customer support is absolutely useless for this Stimulator. No info at all. Just a pdf with inadequate instructions, since none were provided with the purchase. Also, they only have phone support, no email. Expect long wait times.	
- 1	I ordered this to use with my Britax B-Agile stroller.  I Velcroed it on a few months ago and I've never had to touch it again.  It is discreet and sleek and folds right along with the stroller.  This is great for drinks, keys, my iPhone etc.Update...after a few months of use the strap on this organizer just ripped right off!  It is useless and now I am going to spend the money on the Britax one I should have gotten from the start.  I suppose it is partially my fault for going the cheap route and getting the knockoff basket but the Britax one is a lot nicer.  I really wish Britax supplied it with the stroller but i wish more that I didn't choose to buy the cheap one first...ugh...	
1. 	My 5 1/2 month old loves this new toy. Oslo, the dog is her new favorite chew thing. She likes pulling apart the panels of the box. She likes chewing the flaps and looking in the mirror. I can fit in a few more of her favorite soft rattles and pack the box in her diaper bag for trips out. She can be entertained indefinitely with this.	
- 1	At our Newborn Essentials class before our child was born, I asked the instructor if she had heard of the Woombie.  She said that she had heard very mixed reviews on it.  Nevertheless, I was excited to try it out since my baby broke out of every swaddle.  He hated it.  He was only a few days old but it didn't seem long enough.  It sorta looked like his head was attached to a bag of angry kittens.  I would say try to buy at a store so you can take it for a test-run and see if your baby will tolerate it.	
- 1	My toddler son received this monkey lunch bag as a gift and we both loved it.  It's really adorable and just the perfect size for his lunch.  The zipper works well, and I like the pocket on the inside.  His school has a fridge that the kids can put their lunches in, so I cannot attest to the insulation of the bag.After a month of use, however, my love for the bag started to diminish.  The bag is fabric, and the fabric isn't coated either on the inside or outside.  So anything moist or liquid that comes into contact with the fabric soaks right into the fabric and you can't simply wipe it clean.  Spot cleaning does NOT work.Fabric bag + young kid + food/drink = gross and smellyUnless you have time to thoroughly wash the bag every other day (or even weekly) with soap, water and a good scrub - but if you have a small child, I'm doubting you have the time for that.  Or the energy.Not only does it start to look grimy after a few weeks, but I'm sure it is teaming with more germs than the average parent would find acceptable for their kid's food storage system.After a couple months, I ended up getting theCrocodile Creek Classic Lunchbox - Solar System 10 x 7.5, which you can spray with cleaner and easily wipe down with a wet dishtowel to get it reasonably sanitized and cleaned.  However, the Crocodile Creek isn't perfect either: the zipper often gets hung up on the bottom corners.  It might be frustrating for young fingers.  But overall, it's a better choice than the Skip Hop in my opinion.	
- 1	Very sharp and too much hassle. Can be taken off by couple month old baby (thereby becoming dangerous). I prefer to stick with plain prefolds in BumGenius diapers or with All-in-ones.	
1. 	This cover is REALLY beautiful, and it doesn't scream: Hey, i'm nursing my baby!!! like those apron style, patterned covers. I know they give a better view of the baby, but you really only need to see what you are doing the whole time on the first few weeks, and I don't get out of the house much on those weeks anyway.  This one does'nt even look like a nursing item, covers front and back, takes up minimal space on a bag, and washes well. The neck opening is big enough that I can see my baby while she is getting latched, then quickly rearrange it once we are all set, for more modesty. I have the Grand Sand color, it's a little darker than in the picture, but very beautiful anyway, and goes well with most of my clothing.	
- 1	This bag was too small once i got the diapers, wipes, change of clothes and a blanket and a toy.  the bag ended up being so over stuffed that i couldn't get the top flap to close back down, and would end up leaving the bag half open. I since gone over to a backpack. Its the easiest diaper bag, and keeps my hands free to chase after and hold my toddler.	
- 1	I got these to prevent my baby from rolling out of bed if she co-sleeps with myself and my husband. So far she hasn't rolled out of bed but these bumpers don't seem very safe. They are always twisting on their sides and getting pushed off the bed if I roll against them in the night. They do not stay in place well at all. Having them in bed also decreases the usable area of your bed which is unfortunate if you have a wiggly infant that likes to monopolize the bed. I'm probably going to buy some traditional bed rails.	
1. 	Out of the 2 seat/stools we've tried, we definitely like this one better.  At first, we used it as a seat while bathing my young son.  Much easier than kneeling or sitting on the edge of the tub.  Now that my son is climbing onto everything, we place this against the couch or bed so he can climb up himself instead of needing us to pick him up onto the couch/bed.	
1. 	GAME CHANGER!!My 7 week old LOVES this! I mean- LOVES it. It provides all the stimulation she needs and keeps her endlessly entertained. Because she's so young we have not used the music or lights yet, but we will transition into those features as she matures. It is unbelievable how much she enjoys all there is to look at. It also buys mom and dad precious time!Quality fabrics, smart patterns/design, effortless to assemble. Other gyms pale in comparison.As you review which gym is right for your baby, note the dimensions. Some are quite small, making its longevity limited. This gym is the perfect size for baby to grow with.	
- 1	Baby just slides out of it! Pushes his legs and slides out ! Sue the manufacturer for unsafe product! gotta return this one and get a 4-sided instead.	
- 1	I bought this with the hopes that it would be great but sadly it did not live up to my expectations. You can only set it for up to 8 hours which means it will wake your baby up if they are still sleeping after 8 hours. Something most parents don't want! Never wake a sleeping baby right?!?! Also, I thought the music selection was horrible and did not sound very soothing. The little mobile pieces kept falling off too. The only think I did like about this product was the light feature. Its a great idea in theory but the actual product was not so great.	
1. 	The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the drain plug that is difficult to set in place. Once it's on everything works good, my boy likes it and I'd buy it again.	
- 1	I can't even use this bottles yet because they arrived with FAST flow nipples, although the picture clearly shows a box with SLOW flow ones! Annoying, inconvenient, and a hassle. Thanks amazon. Urgh.	
- 1	I was looking for a food pouch that doesn't leak. Found this one and was glad that the opening was difficult to open. That's good right? Wrong. After a while of having to tear open the opening and spooning in food purees into the small opening, it got tiresome. In addition, after sipping out half of the contents of the pouch, the rest can just be sipped as well, the food puree has to be pushed up to the top portion of the pouch. This is not the case with other pouches I've used, nor the Plum Organics etc baby food pouches.The only plus I see with this food pouch design is that the cap is large, much like the food pouches sold in stores.	
- 1	My kids played with these for about 3 days before at least two of them were broken.  One broke the very first day when my daughter dropped it on the wood floor.  And from her height at the time (about 30 inches) it was not a long fall for the toy!  Now, a few months later, all but two of them are broken.  If my kids were especially hard on toys, I wouldn't be surprised, but I have not had this experience with any of the other dozens of toys that we have brought in this house.  The manufacturer needs to work on better construction. Until they fix those issues, I would save your money!	
1. 	Washing and reassembling Bouevard car seat is a nightmare if you don't know how - just follow these instructions (they're not in the manual).  My baby threw up in the car and it is hand wash only, drip dry, do not machine wash & dry or else.To unassemble, first remove the harness straps from the shoulder slots; then gently take off the cover from the headrest, putting the EPS and foam inserts aside; finally, remove the car seat cover. Don't try to take off the cover if the headrest isn't removed as it won't come off easily.I washed it in Woolite in a large sink, then rolled it up in a towel to take out the excess water, and hung it up to dry. A day later, it was dry, but putting the car seat back together was like a puzzle. Unfortunately, the instructions just say put cover back on with no tips at all of how to do it without going nuts.The car seat has a headrest that's independent of the shell, with EPS foam lining that you have to be careful not to break. After many failed attempts, as the cover doesn't stretch and the headrest will break if you try to bend it, I realized that if you slide the cover gently over both wings at once (sort of like putting your pants on both legs at once), and then wrap the fabric cover around the top, it's easy and you won't break the headrest. I had a few tense moments thinking that Britax has to sell replacement parts, as the EPS foam is very easy to damage if not done this way (Huge hint to Britax - clearer instructions?) You have to put the headrest contraption on before putting the harness straps back into the shoulder slots - I forgot and had to redo the whole process.Threading the harness through the fabric cover was also nearly impossible. You're not supposed to remove the components of the harness, and you don't have to either. It's easy if you just take out the harness strap out from the top slot of the grey rubber holder (leaving it threaded through the bottom slot), enough to slide the chest clip up a little bit beyod the rubber part. Put each part individually through the fabric cover's slot (chest clip, rubber thingie folded in half lengthwise, buckle with the metal tip first). When you're done, you slide the chest clip down again on the strap and rethread the strap through the top slot of the rubber holder. The Marathon is similar in case you ever need to wash it.Then you rethread the shoulder staps through the back, making sure the straps are not twisted and that it's well secured to the metal yoke in back.Half an hour later, though, and I'm done reassembling, and the cover came out fine without shrinking or fading. But I understand now why Britax sells replacement covers and why you shouldn't feed a baby before you put them in a car seat.Other than this it's a great car seat though, don't let the washing bit dissuade you - it's easy once you know how. This car seat fit great in a Honda Accord, Toyota RAV4, Nissan XTerra, Lexus SUVs, and surprisingly, a Subaru Forester.	
- 1	I have a boy, so having him run around with a neon pink sport cup isn't really my cup of tea, luckily my sister had a beautiful baby girl that will love it once she starts walking.	
- 1	This item is ridiculous.  I actually bought this because of the Amazon Prime feature and because I haven't slept in 8 months since my son was born.. so my mind isn't functioning properly.  Once I got it, I realized I had an extra table spoon in my drawer and didn't need this, but it wasn't worth the money and time to return it.  SO, I still own this. The photo shows green but the item is GREY. (Again, something my mind missed.) It is good quality.. but I can't believe I spent almost $8 on a piece of plastic.  Seriously.. don't waste your money.  Don't let sleep deprivation do to you what it did to me.  THINK TWICE.	
1. 	This is great for on the go!  And your tray is always clean!	
1. 	I got this as a gift and love it. You have to experiment with the water tempature first.- I used regular milk so I wouldn't waste formula. I like the compact size. I move it to the bathroom by the nursery. I put in the bottle (avent) and it's heating while I change her diaper and finished just in time. I used a black marker to mark the fill line so it can be seen easily at those 2AM feedings. The biggest downfall is that you have to wait 10 minutes to reheat again. For the price it is well worth it.	
1. 	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.	
- 1	I got this attacher today and was pretty disappointed in it. It's not worth paying even the 5 bucks but then tack on the 5 dollar shipping as well that they charged me and it's definitely not worth the price. It's a piece of ribbon attached to a clip. Not all that complicated. I would NOT buy this again for myself or a friend. I got a bink link off of amazon.com and at least it's got some style for the price. Don't waste you moolah on this one!	
1. 	Purchased these breastshields for use with my pump in style medela breast pump.  The box contained two, hard plastic, breastshields which attach to connectors (sold separately). You will also need valves and membrames.  I purchased because the shields that come with the pump in style were size M (24mm), which didn't fit.  Good purchase and good price compared to other online and in-store products.	
- 1	This worked well for a month or so.  Then it became increasingly difficult to slide, and finally got to where it would just hang, and I had to pop it open to open and close the oven door, even though my hands were full of whatever I was cooking.  Finally it just melted one day after my husband was cooking something because it got caught in the door.  This allowed the oven knob covers to melt, too, sooo... we were really disappointed with it.  We're trying the other brand this time.	
1. 	good thing i only bought one package because one pack had enough to cover all the outlets in my house.	
1. 	We purchased this exersaucer because of all the activities that it includes.  My daughter is 4 months old and we just started placing her in it.  I like that the height adjusts to accommodate babies of all sizes.  She loves the lights and music.  She is still a little young, obviously, to fully use all of the toys, but she manages to activate the book easily. What she cannot do, her 3 year old sister does for her.  They both love the pop up apple.  I love that it folds up compact to take anywhere.  I look forward to her growing into it more and being able to use more of the toys.	
- 1	I really, truly do not understand the 5 star reviews. This bag is a piece of junk. As another reviewer stated, it looks much nicer in the pictures. When I finally saw it in person, it looked cheap. The worst part is that the zippers are very low quality. Not only is it tough to actually zip them up, but the main zipper already broke and I'd only been using the bag for about 2 months! The only plus is the large storage space inside. If you thought this diaper bag was a bargain and too good to be true, you were correct. Spend a little more and get a skip hop or other brand. I am using a hand-me-down skip hop bag now since this one broke, and the quality is so much better. Especially the zippers. Don't waste your money on this bag!!!	
1. 	My son loves this chair, I enjoy that it has a tilting back so he can be in different positions.  I like that the arch has a musical element but I do not like the other elephant toys and my son has no interest in them and he can't reach the musical one in the center.  I have two other fisher price chairs and I think the toys on those are better.  I got this as a replacement for the Fisher Price Deluxe infant to toddler rocker (left my deluxe one at grandma's house for visits), but I think at some point I will switch them out to get the deluxe one back, it sits deeper and higher on the sides.  I also find that because this chair has a board at the  bottom for the seat it makes considerably more noise than the deluxe which is just taught fabric.  I would recommend the deluxe over this one, but it is still a good chair.	
- 1	Cheaper at Walmart :-( Wish I looked there before buying these. They are great and I use them every day but seriously just go to Walmart and save some money and you have them the same day!	
1. 	These bibs are the best.  They wipe clean easily and are easy to put on my kids.  They aren't really good until your kid is a little older, 6-8 months because of their size, but my 2 year old still wears hers and loves it.  I do not put mine in the dishwasher.  A quick rinse and they are ready to go again!	
1. 	My baby has used this chair from almost the beginning. Now, seven months later, it's still our favorite. It's got metal legs, which are more sturdy than a lot of the competitors out there. It's got a fiberboard seat (under the fabric, of course) so it's not uncomfortable like metal would be, but supports enough. There are two positions, one is more in a sitting-up stance. As your baby gets bigger, you do have to watch out that she doesn't pitch forward and fall out, but we haven't had any issues with that, since we are always right there. Our little one loves the mobile and the elephant print behind the head. The umbrella in the center of the mobile plays a tune when you pull the string. The cover is easy to wash and simple to get back on the frame. It's a great product and I highly recommend it.	
- 1	The dispenser pack is nice, but these liners have a tendency to fold in on themselves.  Folding a prefold with a wiggly baby doesn't leave me with enough hands to constantly straighten out a diaper liner as well.  If you can get them into place, they do the job.  But, there are other brands that are easier to work with and more economical as well.	
1. 	My 4 month old son has such a cute ALL STAR room. WE have all the bedding, the lamp, wall boarder, and diaperstaker. His walls are navy blue and the wall boarder is on the top and bottom of the walls. The bedding looks so precious on his natural wood crib. The only piece of the whole set that dissapointed me was the crib sheet, it didnt fit too well so I just use it over his changing pad and use a different sports sheet instead. My son LOVES staring at his bumper and he will just look at it for HOURS sometimes, seriously! Well we also have the aquarium bed attatchment which works well. I couldnt pick a better set for him and I like thats its not cars like his 20 month old twin brothers were. I love this set and it washes VERY well, doesnt rip or fade. A perfect set and just absoulutly adorable!	
1. 	This is the net that you imagined to have for your kids. I went thru three, but finally landed on this one for its size and depth to hold many stuffed animals. My kids are happy and I am happy they are not cluttering the house	
- 1	Completely inconsistent temp readings. 103 mysteriously becomes 96 in a separate reading just seconds later. It's a nice idea to read from scanning the forehead, just poorly executed by The First Years.	
- 1	I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. It is a terrible product. It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby).I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk.	
1. 	There's nothing I hate more than washing the pumping gear at the end of the day... except maybe having NOT washed it and realizing that right before I need to use it again.  These make it easy even when I'm traveling!	
1. 	These are a must if you are starting out or have been making baby food! Shopped around and like these the most. No nasty plastic made in china. Good sturdy safe material. Not sure about other posts about ease of getting food out bc it was super simple for me. I bought 1set of 2 to try out and then loved them so I bought another set. To get food out simply let it set on the counter for a couple mins or run water along the backside. You don't even need warm water, i just turned on the water and ran it along the back of the tray and you can hear a little crackling and you just twist the tray like a regular ice cube try and pop out. I bought different brands of trays and enjoyed them, but there were cons and more pros for this tray. The lids are nice too. They may not come out as fancy as other trays, but its food! Once frozen pop food into freezer bags! Dishwasher safe, but I normally handwash. Good luck!	
- 1	This toy is hard for little ones (even young toddlers) to push down on their own. Once it is pushed down (by me, since neither my baby or toddler can do it) it travels far, but my kids do not seem super excited about it. The main think that I don't like about this toy is that every time I push it down I feel like I am going to get pinched! My fingers just about got pinched one of the first times I tried it; I worry about little ones getting their fingers hurt! My husband thought the exact same thing. Definitely not my favorite toy.	
- 1	We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget. Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times. After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1) It is NOT particularly lightweight, and even though my son was a smaller baby, it still got really heavy really fast. After about 3mos. I refused to use it anymore. We put it in hubby's car and put the convertible seat in mine.2) The straps adjust from behind, and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually. So, if the season changes (or you just live in a variable region like we do) you'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie. THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm (lighter clothes) day. And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time!3) The handle was not very steady. What I mean is, these seats are pushed and pulled constantly, usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip. I found that after just a few trips, the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side, and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4) Last thing, but definitely my biggest concern. The anchor strap slips! You don't notice it the first few times, and you probably won't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally. Because it was in my husband's car, we didn't notice it at first. Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE! The strap (it was the LATCH strap) had gradually gotten looser and looser, even though we used a towel to even out the seat (as recommended) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible. We fixed it, then found that several weeks later it was loose again!I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat (since I've never heard anybody else complain of it), but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again. Go with Britax or Chicco!	
1. 	I was tired of of putting blankets on my daughter and figured this was easier.  It's easy to put in the car seat but I thought it actually went on the seat in replace of the original car seat cover.  It only has a band that goes around the top and sits on top of what's already on the seat.  There's nothing that attaches the bundle me at the foot.  The original reviewer was right when they said the top is really long when you unzip it.  Overall though I think it's a great product to keep her warm so I don't have to mess around with sweaters and blankets.	
1. 	I have tried so many bottles. Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go.	
- 1	I'm so glad I'm not the one who paid $50 for this pillow! God bless my friend for thinking of me, but I wish her money could have been better spent. She said her daughter loved it, and maybe the Snoogle works well for some women, but after three attempts at using it, I stuffed it in a plastic bag, and there it sits on my bedroom floor to this day. Here are the reasons why:1. It's way too firm. I could not get it to support my tummy from underneath at all; all I could do was try to sort of lean against it, but that didn't offer any support. Same thing with the back support -- the whole pillow is so firm, it was more of a leaning thing than a support thing.2. Maybe this is more of the same firmness complaint, but I couldn't get used to using the pillow part. It wasn't soft enough to mold to my head and neck, and I ended up trying to push it far enough to the side that I could use a regular pillow instead.3. The fabric is, as others have said, not very good quality and itches if your bare skin touches it. The farther I've gone in my pregnancy, the more sensitive my skin has gotten; I can't even imagine trying to use it now. Assuming I could stand the pillow itself, I'd have to buy one of the covers (though I don't have one, so I'm not sure of their quality, either) or make one myself.4. The curve is too confining. I felt like I had to curl up all the time. I'm 5'6 tall, so you can use that as a measurement tool if you like. I just can't stand not being able to stretch out comfortably, and the Snoogle didn't allow me to do it.5. It's H-U-G-E!!! God help you if you're trying to share a less-than-kingsized bed with your spouse or significant other AND this gargantuan thing. There won't be room for the three of you.6. Don't even try to roll this thing over with you. Talk about a wrestling match!Maybe I can recycle the Snoogle into a sort of TV-watching pillow; it's certainly firm enough for that. But it's not something I'd recommend or buy for a friend or family member. The Boppy Wedge is an INFINITELY better buy for the money (see my review of that item), not to mention being a better product overall.	
- 1	The duck is cute and might work for some bath spouts (hence the 2 stars), but on ours it does not stay on at all. Our bath spout gets slimmer towards the front and as the duck is fairly big and long, the adjustable wings of the duck are in a place where even making them really tight does not keep the duck on any more. It just keeps slipping off.As my daughter seems to like the duck, we will see whether we can use it for something else in our home, but so far I have not been able to come up with any creative ideas.In summary, this bath spout cover is completely useless to us.	
- 1	Yes, I read all the reviews saying that these are impossible to clean.  I thought: oh I'm not some OCD clean freak; plus I'll clean it right after use, unlike all those OTHER people.  Silly me!  Everyone was right.  You know how they sell those bottle brushes, complete with nipple brush?  That's because we don't want bacteria in our babies' foods, right?  Since they don't sell a brush in the world that could clean this thing, there is really no way to get it clean.  And I don't want my sweet boy ingesting some banana from last week.  It was fun for a one-off experiment! But we like to be more sustainable than one-off excursions into plastic.  Oops.  Humble pie is mine.	
- 1	A couple of reasons why this wasn't so great for our stroller.I have an Eddie Bauer Trail Hiker stroller. It fits well over the top, it fits well on the sides, but it's not long enough to keep my baby's feet dry. He's only 5 months so I can't imagine it's going to get any better in the future.The vent holes are covered up by the strollers canopy, so it kind of makes me nervous.Of course it may fit your stroller differently, but this was how it fit on mine.	
- 1	I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old.  So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid.  What a waste!	
- 1	Bought this for our 5-month old (who is now 9-months) for her high chair.  The bib's tray is so high it ends up getting pushed shut by the high chair tray.  The neck does not adjust small enough, and liquids seep through the seem around the neck, staining clothes.  The stitching near the tray and the neck makes it difficult to keep clean--it takes some scrubbing.  Because the top is fabric, it can create its own little shelf if the bib isn't allowed to hang free.  The only feature I like is how when it's rolled up, there's a little fastener that keeps it closed.  Buy an all-silicone bib and save yourself the hassle.	
1. 	This thing is amazing!  The first seat we tried was a hard plastic one, and my son would sit for a few minutes, then say 'mommy, booty hurt.'  This one has never caused a problem.  We have no problem with urine spraying out, and have used the top part on the toilet as well. If only it could fold up and go in my diaper bag, I would never need anything else!We did get the flip-down seat for our toilet, but my son prefers this one.  He's only just turned two, so I'm sure in time he'll graduate to the bigger one:http://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-86CP-000-NextStep-Non-Tarnish/dp/B003IKONT8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1300941595&sr;=8-1	
1. 	The membranes arrived slightly curled as if they'd been stored in a hot warehouse for quite sometime. I ran them under some pretty hot water and flattened them on a towel. No harm no fowl so far. Some of them do rip if I'm not careful pulling them off the yellow valve, but I think that's me trying to be quick (and thus too rough) more than anything. I make sure to have quite a few of these on hand at all times, just in case.	
1. 	These are thoughtfully designed. Our 14 month old uses them easily for snacking on cheerios. He loves to hold the container by its handles. Yes, sometimes he drops a few cheerios, but this still prevents a ton of mess. They are BPA free and seem very sturdy and safe. The munchkin packaging (not the shipping packaging, but the packaging on the actual snack catcher) was a pain.	
- 1	Its too flimsy to make a real difference...if you are looking into co-sleepers because you are afraid to sleep with your baby in the bed you are better off getting an Arms Reach co-sleepier bassinet, because this product won't instill too much sense of safety	
1. 	YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS FOR SMALL CHILDREN! I have a two year old that gets into everything! This keep her out of my kitchen	
1. 	We have 2 of these and love them. We are hoping baby still fits in them by the time the cold weather comes back around instead of using a blanket in the crib..	
1. 	I was looking for a changing pad that had 4 sides for more protection. It is comfortable and very thick. Love it!	
- 1	Babies play with it briefly, then move along.  It just never held their interest very long.  I would not purchase again.	
1. 	I received two bathtubs at my shower.  We tried this one over the other simply because it would fit over a kitchen sink well.  This turned out to be so great that we returned the other fancier tub.  I loved the hammock for newborns!  I loved the temperature colored drain spout.  I have a temperature duck also, but liked having the back up built in to the tub in case I misplaced the duck.  Now our daughter is in the sitting up stage for bathing and this tub still works out great!  Highly recommend it!	
1. 	For our daughter we chose not to go the convertible crib method and at about 1 1/2 she was ready to move into her first big girl bed.  We went with this DaVinci and could not have been happier.  It was very sturdy and stood up well to her occasional bouncing sessions and Daddy (165lbs) taking little naps with her.  Now that she's 3 1/2 years we are ready to move her into her a single bed so we can use her crib mattress for her brother.  Had he not come along this toddler bed could easily have been used up until she was 5 or 6.	
1. 	They do their job of cleaning out all the holes and crevasses of those darned Dr. Browns bottles.  These bottles really are great for keeping gas and reflux to a minimum, but boy are the a pain to clean.  You can't clean them without these things (and shouldn't, because if you don't get every crevasse, ick will build up on the tan colored plug thing especially - talk about nasty germies!) so buy a pack or two today!	
1. 	I needed something to use on top of my changing table and not hanging on the side.  This works great! Super easy to clean and stays in place without sliding.	
1. 	For some reason I lost the original ice pack that came w/ my medela pump, but this replacement came on time and in new packaging, it's EXACTLY the same one that I lost the first go around and it fits perfectly in the insulated breastmilk storage bag that comes with my breast pump.	
1. 	A must have (along with the side rails!)  The crib is 100% protected and it was really easy to attach.  Most importantly my son is 100% protected (no more paint flecks on his face) and 100% happy (because he can chomp on his crib to his heart's content).  Really easy to maintain, I machine wash (regular cycle) and hang dry mine and they have already survived 3 rounds of washing in the first month.	
1. 	My daughter suffered with serious colic during her first three months.  These bottles saved the day.  They really do work, and trust me, it is worth it to spend a little more time cleaning the bottle for the peaceful tranquility that you will have because your newborn isn't up screaming with stomach pains.  Granted, not all babies need this, but my daughter certainly did.  Once you get into the habit of cleaning them, it's no big deal.  Plus, once your baby gets ready for cereal, the Dr. Brown's Y-cut nipples are wonderful.  I don't know if they sell them online, but I get them at the local BRU store.  These bottles are a little expensive, but I would have paid twice the price for the relief that these bottles gave my daughter.	
- 1	I received this stroller and I agree that the instructions were a little difficult with respect to the front wheel assembly, but other than that simple to put together.  I've previously owned a used BOB and a Schwinn jogging stroller.  The positives with this stroller is that it is easy to manuever, very light (or seems to be....I haven't hauled it around in the car yet) and the designer for the cup holder is great...it doesn't bounce your stuff around when you're running.  The negatives are that the design of the seat is just ridiculous.  You cannot adjust the particle-board seat back past a certain reclining point and the strap used to adjust it is really flimsy.  My poor child has to use his ab muscles to sit upright...super uncomfortable. Also the tires are always losing air for no reason and need aired up every two days.	
- 1	I ordered this thinking I was going to love it. It ended up just being ok. I usually love all of OXO tots products but this was a flop. It is a great idea and would have been so much better than ziploc or the eco-fabric baggies. Everything in them always got smashed in my bag. But the lid fips open barely trying. I liked that my daughter could open it by herself, but if it was closed and she tripped it would pop open and the snack would go all over the floor, which defeats the whole purpose of putting the snack in something at all. If they could just redesign the lid just a bit I am sure I would give this another try.	
- 1	My sister-in-law has two of these (which she told me after I bought this that she got it much cheaper than I did) so I figured I would get one too. I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg on a nursing cover.CONS:Since the neck part doesn't go end to end, it flaps under and over and basically cuts the cover aspect in halfThe neck isn't stiff enough to hold it open to see my daughterPROS:Cheaper than other coversPretty printCovers SOMETHING at leastMy daughter is 2 months old and we've only used it twice (I try and plan around feedings), so maybe I just need to practice with it more, but overall I'm not happy with it. I would suggest spending the extra money and getting a better brand. I'll continue to try and use this one because I've already paid for it and I can't afford to just be buying all kinds of covers.	
1. 	Lightweight and breathable! I even threw them in the washer and dryer and they turned out perfect!  Great for a baby learning to eat  cereal and food!  So much easier than trying to clean by hand and dig out food particles in the seams!!	
- 1	The pressure mount at 34 inches felt to insecure. We added 1&#34; wood on either side to make it sturdier. Also used longer screws for the mounting rings. Retraining self to be conscious of the white bar at the bottom, not to stub toe or trip over it. Especially as ours is at the top of a stair.	
- 1	I don't know how to stop it from getting moldy since no matter what there is a small amount of water sitting on top of the spout.  Design flaw, but probably necessary to create the shape of a duck (or whale).	
- 1	I bought these JJ Cole bibs a few months ago, loved them.  They were high quality waterproof with canvas backing.  sturdy, machine washable.  These are flimsy plastic, no canvas reinforcement, hand wash only, and sold AT THE SAME PRICE.  Returning both the bibs I purchased.	
- 1	I love Dr. Brown's bottles but after trying this sippy cup once or twice it's been shoved to the back of the cabinet and I doubt we'll try again.  My daughter hates it - I think the flat spout is very much unlike a bottle so I am not sure why it is designed that way for training.  I tried drinking from it myself and I found it difficult and was getting a lot of air along w/ the liquid, so I'm not surprised my 9 month old didn't like it.	
1. 	This is a great little duckie .. no water can enter it and hence no mold issues ever, it is just perfect!	
1. 	I think the worst part of safty shopping is for the gates. So many out there boast that they are the best; so I started to read customer reviews. We were moving into a two-story house and needed a great pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs. First I got the hands free one from I think it was safty 1st, with the pedal at the bottom...my daughter figured out how to open it, so it had to be returned! After a few more misses, I bought this one and I love it! The opening is wide, but not too wide. I am a bigger person, and I have no problems getting through this gate with child in tow! It works perfectly in our home and I am completely pleased with it!	
- 1	Would be a great toy and a thermometer, but this beeping noise never stops unless you take it out of the water, but then whats the sense of all the  turtle toy????!	
- 1	This was part of a baby shower gift, given to me with a baby tub. Was a great idea, looked cute, and I was very happy to have it on hand when my little one recently decided to start trying to stand up in the tub, and grab at things such as the spout. Well, my husband and I went to blow up the spout cover tonight and the valve won't stay closed AT ALL, not even for a few seconds!  This means the cover is totally useless and I won't get a single use out of it. It's cheap plastic, I know, I didn't even necessarily expect it to last that LONG, but to find it won't hold air for even a single use is ridiculous and a total waste of money/wasted gift. Extremely disappointed. Debating whether to contact the manufacturer and waste my time over a $5-6 item. Never had a valve that wouldn't close at all like this, no excuse for that level of poor construction.	
- 1	I really didn't care for these. They were soothing at first, but once they warmed up to your body temperature they didn't really seem to do much of anything.  Wish I had saved my money.	
1. 	This was a Christmas gift for my 13 month old niece. She immediately took to it and loves taking the pieces out of the barn. She is still working on getting them back in. It definitely holds her attention.	
- 1	I loved this seat at first, but it lasted less than a year. It eventually cracked in half. The bottom is poorly designed, it's just exposed foam that turned disgusting colors from becoming stained with urine no matter how much I cleaned it. The splash guard was awesome, but it just didnt last.	
1. 	I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while	
1. 	I was going to give it 2 stars because, like some other reviewers, I was sure that the speakers did not work - but I gave another try, and figured out that you have to pull speakers really strongly and make them click. So, after over a month using the silent bouncer my son can finally listen music. He loves it! He listens and tries to sing! This changed my evaluation dramatically. The mirror also attracts his attention. I do not like the cover material - too rough for tender baby skin - my son turns his head and rubs his face against it sometims, so I have to cover it with a cotton flannel blanket, otherwise his facial skin is irritated. At his 2 months my baby is 22 - 13lbs, but seems like in couple of months he with outgrow it, no way to use this up to 3 years! And anyway, such bouncers should not be used for babies able to sit without help. I have to keep the rattle arms down most of time - his hands could stuck under it and it is not very safe. The bouncer itself is nice and good quality - if I was rating just a bouncer I would give 5 stars definitely. My little boy likes bouncing in it and often falls asleep. But I think it's a little overpriced.	
1. 	seems simple, but both my 6 month old and 3 year old enjoy playing with this toy. the sounds are also pleasant and not as annoying as most musical kids toys.	
- 1	What I like:- Colorful- Hanging objects are mildly entertaining- SmallWhat I Don't like:- Baby was only entertained for about 5 minutes max- Musical part was two 5 second tunes- Claim that it will grow with baby. I think baby will not be amused by it as soon as theres anything else to look at.- Pillow is so small its uselessThis will be the first to go when I start to sell my baby toys. I wouldn't bother saving it for my second child.	
1. 	I used this at a company picnic and occasionally in the backyard. It's made well enough to not feel sharp sicks or grass poking through. It also doesn't appear to have any undone seams or rips.  Water that spilled seemed to bead up and wipe easily.I love that it folds up into a perfect little &#34;purse&#34; and has a carry strap. There is a &#34;guide&#34; of sorts that helps you fold it perfectly every time. It is a hardened panel stitched in that you fold around and it ends up being the rectangular little package that makes it easy to transport. It fit well in our stroller basket inside a mesh beach bag.The print is very nice and neutral. Not too loud.I used it for me, my husband, my 2-year old, and 4 month-old all together sitting at once. My husband 5'11, was able to sit with his legs extended and so was I, 5'4&#34;, while our little ones lying down in between.I had the KidCo Peadpod tent on the side as a private area to change diapers and store our valuables. It was so nice to have our little &#34;haven&#34; to eat our lunch and relax in between playing at the playground and activities.The only thing missing for next time would be a mini cooler with ice and drinks cause it was hot outside!The only cons I have are that it was just about the right size to fit us all. I wished it would have been larger so we wouldn't have been so confined, but then again, I can't complain since it suited our needs. I think if it were bigger, it would probably make it heavier or more cumbersome to lug around.	
1. 	I first saw these blocks at a photo shoot that we did for my 1st grandson!  I loved them so much I researched until I found them!	
- 1	This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back.	
1. 	This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!	
1. 	We purchased this bouncer simply because we had the aquarium swing (which is fantastic).  We figured our daughter would enjoy seeing the same fish that she sees in the swing.  She really enjoyed the bouncer.  The vibration pack could be a little less intense-our floor really moved with it!  We stopped using the bouncer though recently as her fidgeting around made me nervous because there are no sides.  The Fisher Price bouncer we borrowed for the first few months, had a canopy cover that went around the sides and made us feel better.	
1. 	This item is awesome. My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight. No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out. There's no way of getting out of this one. My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one. The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot. So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating. I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.	
- 1	We had high hopes for this product.  After receiving it, we attempted to take off the bumper piece that goes between our childs legs, after following the directions (turning 30 degrees and lifting), a piece of the plastic locking it in broke off.We returned and ordered a 2nd one, thinking it was a fluke, but the same thing happened, only this broke on the 2nd attempt.We will steer away from this product, buyer beware	
1. 	I really like this magic cube. Our toddler plays and dances to it a lot. The sounds it produces are really sharp and the music is great. We enjoy it.	
- 1	we have a 5in mini crib mattress and it does not fit. only fits the 1in pad that comes with crib or pack n play.	
- 1	A lovely and well-made toy, yes, but not safe for babies who like to swing/rattle/shake things (which I assume is every baby). My baby liked it at first, was intrigued by the colors, but soon started to whip it around at which point it became essentially a weapon! The design--long and wooden--makes it especially dangerous. I can't believe they're marketing this as a baby rattle!	
- 1	This was a bit of a pain to fill, but the real issue was that it broke after a few days.  There was a hole somewhere in the outer lining, so it didn't hold the air.  Too bad, becaue it's a cool concept.	
1. 	I bought this as a gift and they love it.  They have brought it over to my house many times and find it very portable.  Both of their children seem to fit comfortably and have no problems in it.  It fits in almost any type of kitchen chair, even a folding card table chair.  The tray is nice and it cleans up well.  It is very study and seems like it will last for a long time.  Will buy again if I need to purchase another one.	
1. 	I use this organizer all the time!! It holds my Avent bottles perfectly.  It has a place for everything!!  I do have leaks somethings but thats only when I don't hang it over the side of the sink (duh, right).  It also doesn't take up that much space on my kitchen counter.**update**My baby is now 7.5 months old and I still use this organizer! She is now learning how to use the sippy cup and it fits on here perfectly as well!  I put the valves in the little valve basket!  I still give this bottle organizer 5 stars!!	
- 1	Unfortunately this monitor didn't come on when. Our baby cried. Luckily we discovered when I just happened to turn the screen on and our baby had just started crying. Not safe as didn't work as expected.	
1. 	When my daughter was younger,she was a runner, and FAST. She could dart away in a second. Holding her hand tighter never worked, and twice resulted in injury to the escaping child (who would wrench her hand away with such force, she dislocated her elbow and shoulder, on separate occasions). She was able to get out of the stroller and shopping carts as well. My sweet baby was exhausting, in her Houdini antics. To her, it was all fun and games. To me, every outing was stressful in the extreme. Even with a 2nd adult, she'd manage to get away.Enter Mommy's Helper; She had her freedom, and I was able to keep her safely by my side. In fact, with this harness on, she no longer felt the need to run off, because she could indulge her desire for independence while still remaining safe.  Any time a passer-by asked her if she was Mommy's Helper, she would literally beam with pride, and nod, making it very easy to get her to put it on for trips to the grocery store.Her sister never needed a harness, because she was content to sit in a cart or stroller, hold my hand while walking, or be carried, and never left my side out in public. If SHE had been my first (or only) child, I might not have understood why parents use these. But their little brother.... wow - he's not even walking, and it's already clear that we'll be dusting off Mommy's Helper once again, as soon as he is.And to the VERY rare person who made rude comments to me when we used this, I always sweetly replied, better on a leash than a milk carton. Or the grille of an oncoming car.	
1. 	We were always losing paci's and I was looking for some way to keep from doing that without attaching it to my baby. This was perfect and it is soft and I love that it has teething corners. Bought two of them because we loved it so much.	
- 1	My baby is only 2 months old (weighs 14 pounds) and the infant insert is already so difficult to use. As a petite woman, it is difficult to lift the baby entirely over my head so that I can slide him inside the infant insert... and when I do, the infant insert keeps folding up or his legs keep getting caught, which requires me to do it over.  I had to do this so many times that my baby even threw up.  It may be easy to put the infants in if they weigh less than 7 pounds because they are small but I had difficulty putting my baby in even when he was a newborn at 8 pounds.	
1. 	Let's start by saying I love this thing - it was easy to put on the stroller, it's easy to take off the stroller, and it zips right up to baby's chin to keep her warm.  I love it; it is exactly what I wanted.  HOWEVER, it does not attach perfectly to the Britax B-Agile stroller.  Because the B-Agile seat is attached at the top, you cannot hook the cover over it and slide the elastic down.  You have to hook it over the top of the back pad, which makes the cover less than securely in place.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.  Also, it doesn't attach anywhere on the bottom (legs area), so when you fold the stroller up, this cover is loose and it's a little annoying.	
- 1	I searched amazon for an organic soft toy for my baby and ended up choosing this bear. It is cute, but kind of stiff and just not really fun or snuggly for baby. I think adults like it more than babies.	
1. 	I LOVE Sassy products! They are amazing value and always do their job perfectly. My baby is now 3 mths old and loves grasping and mouthing toys. This is a really great slection, colourful, imaginative and fun. He especially likes the fish and holds him on every journey we make. I wasn't expecting this pack to have so many different styles and to be so well made, but it really is lovely. Buy it!	
- 1	I bought this for my 13 month old son to keep him safe at my mom's house which is not baby proofed.  It is very difficult to snap the pieces together and then even more difficult to get them apart.  The hinges also have a clicking mechanism that hold them in place, so that if you want to change the angle between them it is also difficult to do.  So if you are planning on using it in a way that you would be changing the shape or opening and closing frequently, it is a real pain.  It is very lightweight and so easy to carry, but then again you would have to set it up when you get where you're going and that's a huge pain.  Because it is so lightweight my son just pushes it around with him.  We actually ended up building a small square of just 4 panels and he just pushes it around the house (wood floors).  That way he can't get to the dog or anything else that isn't baby proofed, but he can still get around a little to follow us as we move around.  However, since the sides have the small mesh, he is now learning to stick his toes in there so that he can climb the sides.  All in all, a pretty disappointing purchase.  We have the other style at home where the panels are thicker and look more like a fence with straight up and down panels instead of the lattice work. It is much easier to open and close and reconfigure if needed, but obviously heavier and less portable.	
1. 	This is a great starter kit. It comes with plenty of bottles and extra nipples. Prior to these we used Dr Brown bottles. Everyone we knew used those and raved about the Dr Brown bottles. I thought they were great but they were tedious to clean. It had a bunch of parts and little nooks and crannies to clean. These playtex were a lot easier and faster to clean and gave me great results. Babies fussiness did not change and it was like we never took him out of the Dr Brown bottles. The way the bottle is shaped is great too. It makes it easier holding the bottle too. Overall I think these are great bottles compared to the Dr Brown ones.	
1. 	This has worked great in our bathroom.  We put all the toys in the frog and then were able to hang things from it's toes.My daughter and son both think it is funny and like to clean up after themselves (the only place they like so far).Recommend it for even small bathrooms as it fits in our tiny one just fine.	
- 1	We are loyal to the Soothie line of bottles and so forth, they have always worked well for us. I tried these hoping that it would help my baby sleep better with less gas but there were several problems right away. She didn't seem to like the shape, and it was kind of awkward for her. It was really hard to get the top just so, so it wouldn't leak. And the bottle will not fit in most warmers. I wouldn't choose this one again.	
- 1	My daughter is a strong little girl and though she needed to be swaddled in order to actually sleep...she fought it most of the time. I bought this item in hopes that it would be comfortable for her and easy to use. Needless to say she unswaddled herself easily and could not sleep as a result. Admittedly not all children make valiant attempts at getting out of their blankets, however my little girl was pretty intent. I never could use this item and had to revert to using larger blankets until she no longer needed to be swaddled.	
1. 	This fits well and is so soft.  I haven't found it to be the best with waterproofing, though.	
- 1	this is so bad, I had the original, the european &#34;doomoo-nid&#34; for my first baby 5 years ago, to concept is great, and baby was super comfy and happy in it, I loved it bit I stupidly gave it away not thinking I would have an other kid, so bought this one instead as it looked like the same thing. well it just looks like it, first the material is awful, really, awful is the word for it, you can even hear sheets of bad thick plastic when putting baby on, then the styro beads insides are big ones, so not comfy or easy to adjust, also it's too full, baby was arced belly up with his head lower, I have no idea how they managed to get this picture, I'm nearly thinking that's not the actual product... anyway, so so so badly and cheaply made, I rather not have any.	
- 1	It took 2 of us to get my son in this carrier and if he was squirmy it didn't work at all. When we were successful he was very comfy and seemed to enjoy it. I much prefer my Moby wrap...I can carry him front, side, or back without any help or trouble.	
1. 	Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together. He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through! The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily. We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!! It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it. It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too! The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me. It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.	
- 1	poor quality didn't like it at all. i put them straight in the garbage	
- 1	we bought it and used it once. what a waste of money! the middle part is too flat and my baby was uncomfortable with the bulky sides.	
- 1	The distortion of this 'mirror' is really a drag (it's a mirror laminate on a plastic backing of course, due to safety issues with real glass hanging over baby's head in a moving car). Like looking into a funhouse mirror from the back seat.	
1. 	I received the smaller, portable one as a gift and so far, it's been a life saver!I'm a big fan onThe Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longerand subscribe to the 5S theory because it's worked for us as first-time parents.I love this sleep sheep because the sound options are all great and soothing.  I attach it to the bassinet handle at night and during the day, it's small enough to either take with me to the baby's swing or inside the baby's stroller.The only reason I'm leaving off a star is because the longest you can leave it on is for 45 minutes.  I wish there was a longer time option because I notice my baby tends to start moving around and making noises when the machine turns off.  I'm sure this helps conserve battery power if you accidentally left it on but I would love to leave it on through the night, as every parent knows, the longer sleep sessions would be greatly appreciated!I would highly recommend this... would be a perfect shower gift because it's cute and useful!	
- 1	This mat is very cheaply and poorly made - also much smaller than other similar mats. We purchased this when my baby started rolling around at 3-4 months... the mat would not stay together and all of the pieces would break apart from hardly any movement. We returned it and got an awesome mat we love from costco!	
- 1	I just got this in the mail today. I put the battery in, correctly. Nothing happens. No LCD display, no light, nada. What a piece of junk!(The battery also has an expiration date of December 2011, so, maybe I have to go buy another 9V battery... this is so disappointing.)	
- 1	Very disappointed with this purchase and with Amazon's customer service.  I bought this item for my baby after hearing how wonderful it is.  I purchased it from Good Products LLC and realized something was wrong when I received the package.  It's a fake!  To those that are wondering how to tell, here's a quick list of differences on the fake:1)  The packaging is different2)  Image quality on box and instruction manual is very poor3)  No DVD included4)  Logo is slightly different in color5)  Large waist buckle says warrior instead of stealth6)  Warning label on inside is in 5 different languages instead of 27)  Poor stitching (especially noticeable looking at edges on front waist belt)8)  Thinner padding on shoulder strapsQuality control and safety standards are NOT what makers of fake items care about!  If you have one, please make sure it is the correct one!  I'm going to purchase it at a big box store, just to be safe.  Yes, it will definitely be more expensive, but worth every penny for my baby's safety!	
- 1	This thing rattled from the moment I moved the car, even if leaving the driveway at 2 mph.  Drove me crazy.  Found this is a common problem when I searched the reviews for 'shakes' and synonyms like 'vibrate', 'rattle', 'wobble', etc.  Also heard that the mirror can pop out of the ball-bearing joint in a crash.  I returned mine.  Same issue with the similar Britax model.	
1. 	Really the best product for the kid . Soft and hard enough at the same time. WOnderful colors, great toys ...Love it till every little bit of it.	
1. 	This play pen is great in that it is so much more roomy then my childs standard size one. it has the great colors and added toys on it to keep him happy and busy.	
- 1	Should have read all the reviews before i ordered this OXO brush.Cleaning a bottle also means you are gonna take a soap shower :)The bristles are very soft and pulling the brush out of the bottle, is really a mess.But: It does clean the bottles very nice though. LOL.The nipple-cleaner = useless. This plastic nub is not cleaning anything. I ended up, not using it at all, after 2 tries.Poor execution OXO.I really like the color thought - I ordered the green. The brush-holder works pretty good as well. It's sturdy enough and is not falling over with the brush sitting in it. At least something positive with this brush.My opinion: Waste of money. My 1-Dollar-Brush gets the same job done and it actually has a nipple-brush which works. LOL.	
1. 	Did the job, but my kid just lost interest and moved on. If your little one wants to crack into this, they likely can. Ordering another set as 2 of the previous one got broken at an adult party - they were left open and bumped into...that's all it takes.  Still...better than nothing and a helpful deterrent.	
1. 	We got this crib in Natural.I've got to say, it's a beautiful crib that is pretty much the focal point in the nursery.  It's sturdy, even if it does tend to scratch easily - the only thing I was tempted to deduct a star for.The fact that it's convertible... well, we haven't gotten quite that far yet, but it's very nice to know that we won't need to spend any more when the time comes.	
1. 	i have 2yo twins who love using chopsticks, but as a wohm i don't have the time to endlessly wrap rubber bands around disposable chopsticks to help them.  i found these online and they're great!  even at 2yo, my boys are too old to use the stage #1 training bridge, but they love using chopsticks just like mommy and daddy and have gotten quite good at feeding themselves bite-size bits of chicken and sticky rice.  we're asian and trust me, these trainers have made my life much easier.  to boot, we can adjust the grip of the chopsticks to accomodate their little hands so my kids can really learn technique, and not hold them like little tongs.	
1. 	We loved this carrier for both tiny infant stage (facing in, with neck support) and older infant stage. It was pretty easy for one person to use and our daughter enjoyed it (she loved being up high for walks and could even conk out for a nap when she'd had enough).  Alas, our quick-grower was too big (tall and heavy) by around 13 months, but I'm sure we can pass it on to someone else.	
- 1	Our Summer Infant Best View (no longer in production) finally stopped working.  We had a tough time finding a replacement product that had all of the same features we loved: good range, quality picture in both light and dark, remote pan, portable handheld monitor, and good parent reviews were a few of our top priorities.  The description of the Graco True Focus, along with the price and reviews seemed to fit the bill with the one exception of remote pan, which we could live without to save the extra $70 it would cost to get that feature on another model.Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and we ended up returning it.  The biggest drawbacks for us were the night vision picture, and the limited range, which came in nowhere close to the claims on the box and the website.  After having other video monitors work well in our house - both our Summer monitor as well as visiting friends' other brands, we were very disappointed at the constant Linking error that would come up regularly when we were a mere 50 feet away (again, nowhere close to the 1000 ft claim on the box).Pros:- Price for the features claimed- Daytime picture clearer than other video monitors I've seenCons:- Effective range of less than 50 ft. compared with well over 200-300 feet with other monitors (we were able to walk a few houses away with the old monitor, and still have a reliable signal)- Night vision picture required constant fiddling with brightness settings - sometimes appeared to just be a big white screen, with little definition of what was on camera.  I could have lived with this if the range had lived up to claims.Luckily Amazon took the return after we tried it out for a little over a week - desperately hoping that it would somehow begin to link more consistently.  We definitely wanted it to live up to expectations, but unfortunately it did not.	
1. 	I have been using this guard for about 3 weeks now, and it does exactly what it is suppose to do. My son is tall, and was reaching up for pans, and is now unable to get to them. I am very pleased with this product.	
- 1	This item came missing an essential part. The lower latch on one side, which the upper bar of the bassinet connects to, was missing. The manufacturer made us take pictures and email them to prove it was defective. We also had to email our proof of purchase. You would think they would take something that involves infant safety more seriously.After all that, they couldn't send us the replacement part because the frame did not have the holes pre-drilled. Then, they wanted us to package up and return the frame. I had to insist that they send a replacement in the meantime so we would have something for our baby. The next day, however, they called to say they no longer have that color in stock.In the end we had to mail them back the frame so they could repair it and then return it to us. All of that hassle and nothing to show for it except a repaired item that should have been correct in the first place.	
- 1	The 3-in-1 idea is excellent, this little potty looks attractive and like a miniature normal toilet, but we have found this toilet pretty useless honestly.- You have to buy the specific Arm and Hammer wipes that fit in the slot, as well as the specific air freshener for the top inside of the lid, so that's extra money if you care about keeping up with those features. For starters, you shouldnt need an air freshener on this potty, seeing as it doesn't flush obviously and you would immediately be cleaning it out after your toddler finishes using it.- This has a lot of parts, something that my two year old son just wants to play with instead of use correctly.- There are grips on the bottom of this thing to prevent it from sliding when your child uses it. (That's the lime green rubber strip on the bottom front and back.) Everytime my son sat on this, it still scooted back, and we now use it as a stepping stool for him to get onto the big toilet, and it still moves when he is just sitting on the toilet and his toes are scraping it a little.- On the seat, there is a urine guard that comes up a little to keep pee from splashing. My son is an average size two year old, and this seat opening is just not big enough for him. His junk sits on top of the urine guard unless we reposition him and show him to move himself around...How we have still managed to get our money from this thing:- NOT buying the air freshener or refill wipes at all.- Giving the seat portion, which pops off for easy cleaning, to my mother-in-law for the time being because it snaps onto a regular toilet seat so they can fit on it for a transition stage to the big potty.- We use this entire toilet for nothing more than stepping stool for my son to get on and off of the potty, which like I said it does slide a little on our tile floor and makes me son go Whoa! Whoa Mommy! hah. Or also for him to wash his hands.- I am planning on reselling it once my son doesn't need the seat adjuster at my In-law's house anymore.In my opinion, I don't think these toddler potties are worth the money. Buy the adjusters for your toilets in your home, and a travel seat to throw in your diaper bag. This is an unnecessary baby item, as are so many these days.	
1. 	Whenever we use our Bjorn in the winter I don't have to worry about bundling up our son or having to wear a jacket for me that's big enough to wrap around him: this is perfect!  I love it!  In Tacoma, it rains: A LOT!  And I've gotten a lot of complements on it too!  The Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover is lightweight and super simple to attach, plus, it's so cozy and warm, I never worry about our baby being too hot or cold: it's perfect!  I love it!!!  *Excellent gift idea for baby-showers too!!	
- 1	Not really worth the little bit I paid for it.  It had a tiny hole in it where the plastic folds met.  My 4-month old HATED tummy time, and I was desperate for anything that would stem the wailing - even for a minute.  She was distracted by the colors enough to be quiet for a moment, but once she realized she was getting wet she would freak out.  On a related note, if you're having this experience, keep at it - she eventually loved tummy time (around 5 months)!	
- 1	After receiving 3 of the newborn size Halo SleepSack Swaddles and loving them, we decided to purchase 2 of the size small version because our daughter quickly grew out of them.  The first time we used them, her breathing sensor went off because she had stopped moving (had not stopped breathing, thankfully), because the swaddle cloth was up over her mouth and nose! We were terrified and thought that possibly we hadn't wrapped the swaddle tight enough, but for her next nap, we wrapped more tightly (much more than we ever had to do with the size small) and watched her closely as she slept.  Slowly but surely, the cloth wiggled its way up towards her face as she moved in her sleep. We immediately removed her from the swaddle and returned them. Now we still use the newborn size, but don't zip the bottom all the way and let her bottom and legs stick out. It looks silly, but it's much safer. I have no idea why the newborn size doesn't ride up and the size small does, but we aren't taking chances with our daughter!	
- 1	I was very unhappy with this product and ended up returning it. It was very poorly put together. Loose strings were falling off all over the place. The way it hooks the baby in was not very sturdy. I ended up using one from BrightStarts instead.	
1. 	The Diper Depot works well with our Prince Lionheart whipe warmer. It's ridgid, plastic construction makes it a stable platform as compaired to the soft vinyl organizers. My only whish is that the hinges on the lid, of the diper dispenser, could be made a little sturdier.	
- 1	This was ok but I stopped using after awhile and started laying bags flat to freeze then putting them in big ziplocks. This was too bulky for my small freezer.  I never had leaks and did try with multiple brands of bags though incl the enclosed first year brand, medela, Tommy tippie and lansinoh	
- 1	ok these is nice looking but all the cirles come out and its just a pain to clean, and move around, all the cirlces fall out when you move it maybe when my son is older he will enjoy this puzzle mat but for now i do not like it and prefer the abc 123 ones that i found at toys are us lol	
- 1	Unfortunately the top of the brush began to rust. We had to throw it out and buy a different one.	
1. 	Other reviews have said that this product is difficult to cut, but I used a pair of ordinary scissors and didn't have any problem whatsoever. Also, the foam is a bit stretchy, so your measurements don't have to be exact. I cut the foam a bit short and then just stretched it to fit. While it's true that the tape won't last forever, it is also true that it won't leave a mark on your furniture once you want to remove it permanently. Simply apply more double-sided tape when the adhesive breaks down. Easy!	
- 1	This cup leaks pretty bad, and my teething baby chewed through the straw when he was about 10 months old. Love the weighted straw though, and the handles.	
1. 	I researched sleeping options a LOT before my baby was born. I came across arm's reach and decided this would be the way to go for us. My baby took to the co-sleeper immediately...only to hate it a few days later. I completely gave up hope on the co-sleeper, hoping it wouldn't be a complete waste seeing as I could use it as a play pen. At about 4 months, my little girl decided she liked the co-sleeper after all and she has been sleeping in it ever since. I love having her so close to me and night time feedings are a breeze.Just because Arm's reach talks about easy night time feedings does not mean that your baby is going to magically appear by your side everytime you have to feed. You obviously have to lift him/her out of the co-sleeper to where you are sleeping. So, people looking not to move a muscle at all to get your baby fed at night will have to keep looking. For others, this is SO much better than dragging your groggy self to the crib and lifting the baby out. I absolutely love the arm's reach co-sleeper and will be keeping it after my baby's done with it for when I have my next!pros:1. Having baby close to you, knowing she/he is safe and only an arm's reach away.2. Feeding in the night. You don't have to get out of bed AT ALL.3. Waking up to that beautiful sleeping face in the morning, nothing beats that!4. Can be used as a stand alone bassinet and changing table, too.5. Converts to a play pen for when baby grows out of the co-sleeper position. (holds up to 30lbs as a co-sleeper and up to 50lbs as a play pen)cons:1. The terrible sheet. Coarse and thin. Instead, I use Eddie Bauer's playpen sheet.Eddie Bauer Quilted Playpen Sheet - EcruThey fit perfectly, wash really well, are soft, thick and cheaper than the co-sleeper sheets. To keep baby safe, I also added the basic comfort sleep positioner. Basic Comfort Sleep Soundly My little girl stays on her back through the night and I sleep with peace of mind.2. Yes, it takes up quite a bit of space next to your bed, making getting out of bed a little bit of a challenge. I had quite a difficult time maneuvering myself out of bed every morning right after the delivery but I'd definitely choose that over getting up and walking, on very little sleep, to baby's crib everytime she cried or wanted to be fed. It just depends on what's more important to you. After a month or two, I got used to it.3. Packing it up into its bag is a huge struggle.Update (january 2012): My now 4 year old used the arm's reach as a co-sleeper and then as a play pen, which held up very well. After she outgrew the play pen, we packed it in. We've now hauled it out of storage for baby # 2! It is still in excellent condition. I've now boughtAmerican Baby Company Organic Interlock Pack N Play Sheetto use with the arm's reach. The sheets are soft, of good quality and a great price!	
- 1	Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.	
1. 	The baskets arrived very quickly and were much larger than I expected - both a plus. The only downside is the liners - very poorly made, already fraying.	
1. 	This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.	
1. 	Really like these bibs because they keep their shape. The &#34;trough&#34; is nice and stiff so that any food that misses baby's mouth falls into it; the baby may pick it out to eat later or it just catches the stray food so that it doesn't go on baby's lap. The closure around the neckline is a little better than velcro, harder for baby to take off. But, like my child, when she was determined to get her bib off, she just undid the closure and threw the bib on the floor. That's the only downfall I can see. Easy clean.	
1. 	A must have when breast feeding.  These are however a little on the thick side.  You need to be wearing a heavier shirt or sweater/ sweat shirt to conceal pads in place.  Comes with nice small nylon bag to wash them in.	
1. 	These are cute, durable, and I love that they tie instead of velcro.  However, I think they could be a bit longer.  They barely cover my toddler's lap, and sometimes he gets food on his pants if I'm not careful to watch him.	
- 1	The mirror comes with two different methods of attachment - suction cup or clip onto the visor.  I am using the suction cup and it seems to be sticking very well, though I've only had it up for a few days so far.  However, the image it gives me of the back seat is incredibly small, much smaller than my regular rear view mirror.  I'll be able to see general motion and that's about it.  I guess this is a side effect of the wide view but I don't need to monitor three kids, just one, so it doesn't need to be wide.  There is also a small amount of distortion, right above the center of the mirror, which is annoying.If I can find the packaging I'm going to return it, but I may have already discarded some or all of it.	
1. 	although these are NOT the original Playtex products, they are good.  I wish Playtex would return to the original size and style.  These nipples are designed for cereals, thicker foods, etc.  Great product.	
- 1	I know this sounds counter intuitive but they seem like they are harsher on my 14 month olds skin than most traditional baby wipes.  They are do not have any moisturizer which is what I think the real problem is.  They are a thinner and compare to the pampers sensitive product.  They are fragrance free but that does not mean they smell like nothing.  In my opinion they have a light chemical scent like something you would smell in a hospital which is not immediately familiar.  Overall, a decent wipe but I would not buy them again.  I really enjoy the lightly scented wipes that have the lotion or aloe built in.	
1. 	I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.	
1. 	After searching and buying many many sippy cups to find the perfect sippy cup i finally decided to buy these. They work perfect for my 12 month old son. I always skipped over this product because of the low price, automatically made me think and the cups are cheap and do not work good. I wished i bought this cup MONTHS ago, it would have saved me so much money and trouble. This is the perfect sippy cup, does not spill or leak unless it is turned upside down but not to much. Easy to take with me wherever i have to go. The only thing is that i wish i can find more of the to go spout covers. But these cups are so cheap I have no problem buying more.	
- 1	My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy, swearing it was the most comfortable thing she'd ever experienced.  I loved it for the first night or so, but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably (since the entire pillow is connected, when you move one part, the rest wants to move with it).  I eventually curled it into an O shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV.  I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat, rectangular body pillow, as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them.  A million times better than this un-tameable monster.  Thanks, but no thanks on this one.	
1. 	I really wanted a soft carrier, and the Bjorn had great reviews...  but it's pricey.  Luckily, my mother-in-law was feeling generous with the baby gifts, and she bought us one.At first, my son hated it.  When he was little, I would put him in it, expecting him to sleep peacefully like so many other babies I had seen.  More often than not, though, he would thrash his head around and mash his face into my chest.  Boy was I glad we hadn't paid for this!But we kept trying...Once he was big enough to flip around...  he loved it!  I use this mostly when I am out and shopping, rather than putting him in his baby bucket in the cart.  He loves to be up high and look around.  Everyone remarks on what a quiet, happy baby he is.  (If they only lived with us...)No matter how much of a fusspot he is being, putting him in the Bjorn almost always makes him happy.  I keep it in the basket of my stroller when we go for walks, so if he starts wailing (as he usually does after about 2 miles) I can switch him to the Bjorn and he will be happy until we are home.He started teething early and one great thing about the Bjorn is it puts something soft and squishy right at mouth level for him to chew on.  Dealing with a baby who is teething but lacks the developmental skills to hold and use a teething toy is maddening - so this is a great little side benefit to the carrier.The first few times I wore the Bjorn, it did feel a little hard on my back.  Now I have no problems with that at all, and my baby is about 16 1/2 pounds.  (He's a big 4 1/2 month old...)I have no fears of him falling out of this thing, it holds him quite securely.  It's a little akward getting him into it when I am by myself and want him to be forward facing - but he doesn't seem to mind being flipped about and arched back over my shoulder for the little bit of time it takes.  It would be nice if there were some way transfer the baby from person to person without removing him from the Bjorn, but doing so would probably make the carrier a lot less secure.The longest I have ever walked using this carrier is about 1 1/2 miles.  Before he was born, I really thought this would be great for nice, long, arm swinging walks, but it hasn't really worked out that way.  At about that point, we both start to get a little fussy.  Also, his hands get really cold, I think because the top edge of the carrier cuts into his armpits and cuts off circulation.  I have tried adjusting the seat height, but I can't seem to find a way around this.  It doesn't happen if the top flap is fasted over his shoulders, but he likes to have his arms free and doing that restricts his arms.I haven't tried any other soft carriers to compare this to, but I did get a Maya Wrap sling.  My husband liked the sling when the baby was little, but I was never comfortable using it.  It made the baby so folded up, I was constantly checking his breathing, as well as constantly supporting his weight with my arm, which rather defeated the purpose of using the sling in the first place.  I really like how the carrier allows me to have my baby close, be arms free, yet still feel my baby is safe and supported.It would be nice if they made the regular carrier with just slightly longer straps.  This size works just fine for both my husband and I, but I really find it annoying how you have to pay so much extra for just two more inches of material if you and your spouse are very different in size.One more sort of so-so point about this is, they say you can use it for nursing, but I can't understand why you would want to.  I understand how to do it in theory, but I have never tried it and doubt I ever will.	
- 1	I have been using this for about 3 months and it doesn't seem accurate. It's very large and I have to take it out of the infant bath tub before I put my baby in so it's not in the way. The reading always seems colder than the actual water temperature and I have started just using my elbow because I don't trust the reading. Wouldn't recommend.	
1. 	I bought this head support for my 7-mo son for Bob jogging stroller. It fit well with the stroller straps and it is adjustable, so I could set up the width to match his head size. The only note is that though I bought the one with bear, I received the package with Monkey. Customer services let me know that they are not produced with bears anymore. I do not like monkeys, so I settled on a partial refund with the seller, bought supplies, took the needle in my hands and transformed the monkey into a bear myself. The item is very cute and super soft but as it is light in color, I expect it to get dirty at some point. I have used it for less than a week and my son does not eat in this stroller, so I do not know yet how fast this item would get dirty and how it withstands the washing machine.	
- 1	So, apparently I didn't read the reviews thoroughly enough, but this device makes a terrible loud static bark every minute or so. I had to return the product, as there was no reducing or fixing the issue, and we wouldn't have been able to sleep through any of that.	
1. 	I hated the Avent pump, but loved the bottles. I hated the Medela bottles, but loved the pump. This solved my problem!I could used the Medela pump with the Avent bottles now. Perfect world.	
1. 	I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big.  She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in.  I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat.  Hopefully she will grow into this one.  She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.	
- 1	I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.	
- 1	Save yourself the $4 for this product and buy the version that has the flexible strap.  This one has a hard/non bending strap between the 2 sticky parts that connect to either side of your appliance door.  The strap only comes out of the lock by pulling it out.  This works fine when you are holding it.  When you actually attach it to an appliance, put the strap in the lock and then hold the unlock button while opening the door, the strap forcefully flies out, but works.  The issue really comes when you try to close the appliance door and put the strap back in the lock area.  You cannot get the strap in since it does not have any bend to it and you cannot move the strap side of the latch away from the lock side of the latch since they are both stationary stuck to the appliance.  I took it right off before it really adhered and threw it out.  Waste of money.  I will try out the flexible strap version of this instead and hope it works -( [...] ).	
- 1	These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash!  Pathetic.  The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off.  Plus the velcro tab is really small so they don't adjust much, making a gap between my baby's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway.  Seriously, if you want throw away bibs, these are for you.  If you want something that is going to last, look elsewhere.	
1. 	I purchased this for my 6 month old Grandson and he just loves it. He has cut 2 teeth, so this has been a very welcome teether. Definitely am glad I purchased this item.	
- 1	I hate this product. I used this for two months when my daughter was a month and a half. Then I noticed that her ears started to stick out, so I stopped using it. But it was too late.  She looks like a hobbit now. I tried using hats to flatten back, but nothing works. No one in my family or my husbnd's family have ears like this. I even looked at all photos taken before I was using the noggin nest and her ears were fine.  The problem is that is your baby, like mine, moves her heads around a lot, the round pillow part pushes their ears forward. And bc she kept sliding off the pillow it didn't even help with her flat head. Instead it just put a weird indent in her head. I so regret using this!!	
- 1	For baby carrier, all i can say is that you get what you pay for.I am just like any other mothers out there who is always scouting for cheap and good deals. I come across this carrier on amazon while I was in search for a good carrier for my newborn. I have heard good things about the popular Ergo baby carrier but being a student (mom), I have to live on a budget. I cannot afford a $100 sling (or so i thought). I was super elated when I found this Infantino Baby carrier for a fraction of the price and with moderately good reviews too. I purchased it without second thought.However, I have to say that the baby carrier served me well up until now, where my newborn baby is not so much a newborn anymore. She is a 7mth old baby weighing 17lbs. We were still using the infantino carrier for a stroll or grocery run in Walmart. We didnt think much of it until my husband keeps complaining of back pains. We realized that the carrier is actually hurting our back so much that we have constant back pain the next day after carrying our baby for more than 30 mins.My advise is that if you are looking for carrier for a baby who is less than 15 lbs, this maybe a good buy. But if you are looking long term (as in back pain surgery in 10 years time..) then it is more worth it to spend that $100 and save on the surgery in the future. We are purchasing our first ERGO baby carrier today and welcoming our way to a happier baby, and happier mummy and daddy.	
- 1	My 6 month old loved it, but poor quality for three reasons:1.  He could pull it off of the base too easily so it was always on the floor.2.  The paint on the clear wings is easily chewed off.  Sorry, paint does not count as solid food!3.  The suction was inconsistent. Once an area it would stick to was found, I was fearful of moving cause it was temperamental.	
1. 	I'm very happy with the purchase but just a heads up for everyone.#1 - the pillow fits only small size mom (works for us).#2 - the white cotton (or whatever material inside the donut) comes out from the surface once in a while. We have to clean up the little cotton mess on our bed. It's not too serious but it happens. You will see little string sticking out from the donut, don't pull it as it will get worst.#3 - to keep it clean, make a cover for it or use it with a towel on top. Due to the losing cotton problem I mentioned above, I doubt it's safe to wash in a washer.	
- 1	I bought this on a whim and and now I know why I love reading reviews and value their input.  I wish I would have read about this thermometer.  It does not read the same temp. from using any of the different methods.  It also does not read the same temp. when I use one method and test mine or the babies temp. a few times in a row.	
1. 	This is the perfect little mobile for above a changing table or a pack and play, etc. It's smaller than a traditional mobile you'd use above a crib. The graphics are clear and stimulating and both of my twin boys loved it. They would get so animated during diaper changes and talk to the mobile. One of them has a vision impairment and I believe that focusing on these illustrations really helped him learn how to focus, etc. Love this mobile.	
1. 	this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.	
- 1	I was excited to get this product as it seems like it would work better than the stick-on foam edging, which my baby would pull right off of the table.  When it arrived, I immediately tried it... and then immediately packaged it for return.The Medium size is supposed to fit tables that are from 141-192 in size.  Our table is 176 and this made me think that the bumper would fit somewhat snugly, since we aren't at the bottom of that size range.  Wrong.  It's so loose that the long sides sag, and if baby were to pull up on the short ends, she could merely pull the bumper right off as she falls, thus smacking the head that I am trying to protect.  In theory this is a GREAT product but it needs some kind of cinching ability - perhaps a drawstring that can be tucked into a zippered compartment or something - to make it fit snugly.  Otherwise, any baby of pulling-up age will simply pull it right off the table.If I were crafty, or had oodles of free time, I could figure out how to rig this - some people have sewed it, I think - but I don't, and I suspect that most people ordering this product don't have the time to finagle it either.  Sadly, I'm returning this.	
- 1	Well these clips are way to hard to undo and cause much fuss. Also the glue on these are just faulty! Once my son figured out that if he just grabs the straps and pulls down he pulls it right off the drawers and it's rendered useless! Great Idea poor craftsmanship	
- 1	We bought this instead of the pull back shades, thinking it'd work well and be easy to install.  Was very hard to get flat and straight on the window and pealed up when you lowered the window (this wasn't a huge surprise and was discovered by accident).  Wouldn't buy again and would just get the pull down shade in the future.	
- 1	While having a digital baby monitor is a novel idea, the execution of this particular product left me unimpressed.  It is sturdy, however the battery life on this is non-existent.  My iPod statys charged longer than this baby monitor.  And it does not have a rechargeable battery pack. So it is best to keep it in the docking station using the AC adaptor.  The display monitor is adequate, but a bit dark. I did like the voice activation feature though.Recommend pursuing a baby monitor with the option of rechargable batteries rather than this one.	
1. 	By far, this is our favorite baby gift! Our little one is 5 months old and she has used this toy several times a day everyday for the last 4 months. It keeps her smiling. I love the bright colors and lights. The music isn't annoying for parents. When  my baby was a month old this kept her entertained while I drank my coffee, priceless! I also love the other rainforest items  by Fisher-Price. Baby loves them all.	
- 1	This product is okay, but I'm skinny. Not anorexic, but normal like a size 6/8 (lost weight after pregnancy) and there is wayyy too much fabric that hangs down. If I was a much larger person I think it would fit much more comfortably but I have to wrap it around me and my baby so many times just to keep the straps from dragging below my knees. I'm 5' 4&#34;. It ended up taking so much time to put it on and take it off after a month I quit using it. I also don't like that I need assistance to put my baby on my back. My husband is military and has been away through the pregnancy and care of this baby which is why I bought a carrier. I don't have someone to help me get her on my back with this. I ended up having to by another one.It is very durable, well made and comfortable, but not functional for me.Bottom line: If you are petite like me it's too much of a hassle to deal with all the extra fabric in the straps. It would be nice if they had different sizes, but they do not.	
1. 	We've been using this seat on our elongated toilet seat and round seat and it works perfectly.  It's much better than having to put a step stool and a potty seat down everytime my daughter has to go, cuts down on the fumbling and the clutter.  I've read some of the reviews about the elongated seat and so far I haven't had any issues.  I put the Mommy's helper on top of the elongated toilet seat not on the bowl and it fits perfectly.  I guess maybe some of the reviewer's have extremely elongated seats because I haven't had any stability issues at all.Also, for all you tall people out there, my daughter is 26 months and off the charts tall.  The step on this is perfect for her tall self and the seat sits far enough back for her to sit comfortably, stand up and check out her 'business' and sit back down again.  I didn't know this going in but shopping for potty seats & step stool combos for tall kids is pretty difficult.  You don't want to end up with their knees too far up or have the seat settle in such a way they can put their feet up and get pee everywhere.  You also kind of want to avoid the dangling feet if you have a curious tot that needs to check out everything that comes out. lol  The Mommy's Helper is a great combo for us.	
1. 	These are colorful and do not fade after washing. I bout them when my son was about 3 months old and are still looking great not to mention they are water proof. I love and recommend them!	
1. 	So convenient. Don't worry about the suggested age range; my toddler is 15 months old and she still uses. As long as your child is drooling, these bibs will be perfect for them. I bought my first 10-pack when she was 6 months old; just bought the second 10-pack.	
- 1	I love the idea of a mini-diaper bag for those instances when you don't want to lug around a full-size bag. Unfortunately, this Brica version is too skinny to actually function as a diaper bag.The diaper pad takes up the entire width and length of this thing so anything you add needs to be very skinny otherwise the velcro won't close. Adding just two size 5 diapers already causes the Brica to start bulging uncomfortably. This leaves hardly any room for wipes. You will need a very slim container or a near empty package of wipes. There is a good chance you will need to pack some stuff separately which defeats the purpose of not having a full-size diaper bag.I give credit to Brica for having a very good build quality. The materials are attractive and seem durable. The integrated bag holder is a nice touch. An integrated wipe holder would have been much more valuable though.	
- 1	My daughter seemed to like the MAM pacifier so I bought this product.  There are too many parts to clean and too much of a margin for error when using these as it is easy to screw them together skewed, resulting in leakage.  Also, heating up the milk by putting the bottle in a cup of hot water does not work as the milk escapes out the bottom holes.  Also, when my daughter attempts to eat, though rated as slow flow, the nipple drips too fast and she can not keep up with it, resulting in her choking and milk getting everywhere.  I really wish that I had purchased only one of these bottles instead of a pack of three!	
1. 	Our daughter loved to sit in it and watch the lights and music play at about one month old. (With the constant play switched on)&#60;br /&#62;At two months she figured out how to kick and make the lights go herself.  She was rewarded by kicking her feet.  I was worried it would be hard to make it work, but even the little kicks make it work.  She had her first laugh in this bouncer.&#60;br /&#62;She is now 4 1/2 months old and still loves to play in it and make the lights and sounds go.&#60;br /&#62;I also love to put her in the bouncer without the toy bar on so she can sit where I can see her and talk to her better.&#60;br /&#62;A must have.	
1. 	My husband bought this swing and we love it so much.  Our newborn loves it too, she slept 5-6 hours at night and also she loves the music.  I will recommend it to all my friends... Nice Job Fisher Price!	
1. 	My baby was breast fed for the first 2 months. We used a nipple shield by Medela but as she got older the nipple shield was just not cutting it when it came to my baby being full. I decided to pump but when my baby was fussy I couldn't pump every 3-4 hours like I needed to so my supply dropped. I didn't buy this starter set, I bought a few 4 ounce bottles and gave my baby what milk I had pumped and formula. I have now bought the 8 ounce bottles and use them also. These bottles are great. My baby burps right away and is never gassy. With breast feeding she hardly ever burped. We use the drop in liners and have had NO problems with leaks. I also heat her formula up by putting hot water in a cup, putting the formula in a liner and dropping the liner into the warm water. Then I mixed it up with a spoon to make sure there are no cold spots, test it and put the liner into the bottle and feed my baby. You also don't have to worry about water dripping off the liner and getting on baby because of the plastic they are made of, the water does not stick to the liner. When I pull the liner out you can't even tell it has been sitting in water.(...)	
- 1	I figured with all the great reviews these bibs would be awesome. I feel like I really wasted my money. I used these with my daughter when she was around 6m old. She pulled it up and started chewing on the neck part. If I made it tighter she just tugged and tugged on it. Plus, I figured they would be bigger and a bit softer. They are too stiff and don't fit comfortably in front of her in between the tray and her body. She is now 13m and we still don't use them. Wish I could get back what I paid for them. The food pocket catcher is nice, but if it can't fit down between her and the tray it does no good. Now I'm searching for a good long-sleeved bib.	
- 1	these are very flimsy and really don't hold anything. I took them off my grass and use the grass by itself.  not a very well thought of product	
1. 	This product serves it purpose. We needed something a little bigger. But for the price it is fine. The plastic is sturdy enough. It was very easy to put together.	
- 1	I have twin daughters. They started eating &#34;solid&#34; food (by which I mean they were spoon-fed purees) around 5 months of age. By about 8 months of age they were able to self-feed small bits of food. By 10.5 months they were able to feed themselves their entire meal. The Nibbler is indicated for children 10 months and up. I tried it earlier based on recommendations from others and my girls both hated it. By the time they reached the designated 10-month point, I tried again several times, but once again, both girls did not want to eat from the Nibbler. At that point, I gave up -- if a baby can self-feed using their fingers why would they need this gimmick?Perhaps your experience will be different if your child isn't self-feeding at 10 months. But, don't buy this product ahead of time presuming it's essential. It's not.	
- 1	It works well as a buffer to sharp surfaces.... however, you have to watch out and make sure the baby doesn't start trying to chew and suck on the texture.  I had to keep distracting my son from trying to put his mouth on it.  It breaks down into little bits of white material with saliva---watch out..The adhesive is inconsistent. In some places, the adhesive failed and became unsticky. But months later, I tried to take the cushion tape off of an end table-- it was impossible to get it off, so most of it is still there... what I was able to remove also pulled the varnish off of the furniture. Don't use this on anything nice.	
1. 	My 10 month old is in the 95th percentile for weight.  Shopping cart safety belts rarely fit him properly, if at all. The Leachco Safety Strap has made shopping with the baby so much easier, safer, and more comfortable for my baby.  I have tried using the safety strap on a regular chair, as suggested, and find that it does work, but I feel compelled to keep one hand on my child at all times, because it would be easy for him to wriggle off the side of the chair and slip out of the strap.	
1. 	We like this booster seat because it comes in an unobtrusive color (grey) so we don't mind having it always out in our dining room. We also enjoy the ease of which you can move it between seats because it doesn't feature straps and our daughter seems to find it really comfortable.	
- 1	This bag doesn't seem to be up to the quality you would expect from Ju-Ju-Be. The item also arrived with what looked like oil spots and a dirt mark under one of the front pocket flaps. I wonder if this is a factory second or a returned item that is being resold, but advertised as new? Also - there were two changing pads and I think it was only supposed to come with one .. neither of them had any kind of padding. Overall, very disappointed in the condition and quality. Thankful for Amazon's return policy as this bag went back the same day!	
1. 	Cute Duke, very good. My baby play it when he was bathing. It can show the temprature too high,a good toy	
1. 	Love this playmat! We also have the baby einstein ocean playmat and they are both great... We love the sounds and effects on this playmat and our son has loved it since day one (about 3-4 months old)..Now that he can crawl he will lay on it for a few minutes and chew on toys, but we like to leave the music and lights on for him while he crawls around and plays.. He can flip it over now, and he thinks that it is funny, but it is sturdy and he never could flip it when he was younger..	
1. 	When my daughter got too old for her bath seat I decided to purchases a transitional tub to ease her into the big tub. She loved this! I think it also helped in her liking baths in the big tub because she never once seemed scared of the transition when she got too big for this duck.	
1. 	So worth the price. I put mashed bananas or frozen baby food in them and let her chew away. It really helps with teething!	
1. 	I bought this booster when my daughter was 9 months old to use at restaurants instead of a high chair. She seemed to like having her own tray, and I found this booster more secure and more sanitary than using a restaurant high chair. My daughter is now 20 months old and she has outgrown her high chair and we use this seat at the table every day when we eat. I have known another mom that never used a formal high chair and only used this chair strapped to one of their kitchen table chairs. This booster takes up a lot less room than one of those huge high chairs. I love that the height on the chair is adjustable and the price can't be beat. This is one of my must have baby products. We even bought one for Grandma's house when we go and visit.	
- 1	I followed the exact care instructions and the whole thing got ruined and fell apart.  Do not purchase.  The whole thing will melt and stick together.	
1. 	I have used these bottles to supplement nursing for the last eight months. Since the liners are steralized, all I have to do is wash the nipples and other parts in very hot water and let dry.  These are convenient and easy to use. Try the rubber nipples as well as the bottle series with the solid color tops that close down on the nipple - I like those the best because they are so compact.	
- 1	this is the same thing i posted on another 1 star review's comments: I don't care if it is made on corea, china or venus, every time I lay on that mat to read a book to my child I have to stand up. Im very sensitive to chemicals, can't be in new cars, etc. This doesn't mean Oh, well, then you have a problem. No, it means I can smell things most people cannot. and i get nausea every time I get on that carpet. It was outside airing for a month, I washed it twice with cold water and soap, and it has been in my living room for 5 months and it STILL smells when you get close to it.-I am a veryfied buyer, you can read all of my reviews.-I'm very sensitive to chemicals, this carpet makes me dizzy!!!I read people's comments attacking other 1 star reviewers, save your time. put your baby on the mat if you want to, I don't care. But i will say what I think.	
- 1	Do not get what is in the picture. I was buying this for a baby shower gift cause my two kids loved them. What I received was an extremely cheap version. I will be returning. I will never buy these again from amazon only from a baby store so I can see it before I purchase them. If I received what was in the picture I would be 100% satisfied but I didn't :(	
1. 	Easy to twist and use for formula or snacks. Make sure it snaps all the way shut, so formula doesn't go into the next compartment.	
- 1	I have been using my pump 5 times a day every day for 4 months.  I thought pumps were made for moms who couldn't nurse, but apparently this pump cannot perform as often as I need it.  We had a strong storm, so I will give the pump the benefit of the doubt and blame the storm for blowing it.  However, my Medela from 1998 also endured being plugged in during power surges and did not blow out.  This Medela model was my favorite.  I loved the easy let down and gentler pumping.  Too bad I WASTED my money on the new model.  Four months of use and now nothing.  It is not even coming on.  AT ALL.  I didn't buy it off Amazon, but I figured I could at least review it here since this is such a trusted site.  I had read that Medela no longer makes the cut as one of the best pumps.  Now I know why.  The machine that is 15 years old still works, and my brand new model doesn't.  I do not recommend this pump.  If you do buy it, plug it into a storm strip and not directly in the wall.  I hope your luck and $260 is better spent than mine.	
1. 	I have never been dissatisfied with a Prince Lionheart product. For the money, this is a nice dresser-top organizer. It has plenty of space and compartments for everything I use to diaper my son. I got this for his &#34;big-boy&#34; room, since we have a 6 week old now. It is so neutral, it blends right into his big boy decor, without calling attention to itself. I felt good about spending so little on something I knew we wouldn't be using for long because we are going to potty train soon. The product's construction is solid. It's a great buy.	
- 1	I expected Carter to have good quality but the fabric is not that and colors fades after few washes only.	
- 1	My sister was paranoid about good breastfeeding after a difficult start and wanted her son to use these bottles at grandma's house when she began working, but he cried and screamed and made bottle feedings impossible for grandma.  I tried giving him this bottle also, and watched the outer nipple buckle in, so he was literally not able to latch on to it.  Grandma switched to a basic regular nippled bottle and he did much better.	
1. 	This cover works fine and is pretty soft for cheap, thin polyester. It doesn't stain, but I've learned to put old burp clothes under my baby's bottom when I see that she's had a blowout so that I don't have to wash these changing pad covers every single day.	
1. 	This is a great bath time toy - but I've not had any luck using the &#34;HOT&#34; indicator to reliably tell me anything. It always looks like it says hot, faintly. I assume the white would get brighter if the water was actually too hot?! Regardless, my almost 7 month old plays with this during bath time every single night. We sing &#34;rubber ducky&#34; and she splashes at the ducky and holds it and chews on it. It's a good size for her little hands.	
1. 	My 13 month old son got this turtle for Christmas this year and loves it.  It is soft with a plastic shell so he can safely play with it. He can turn the colors on and off himself by pushing the buttons as they are easy to push.  I turn it on every night for him and the nicest thing about it is it turns off on its own after 45 minutes. It creates stars and moons on the ceiling but is not too bright to keep them up. Got a great deal on it too during Black Friday deals.	
- 1	Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.	
- 1	Let me preface this by saying I don't usually write such harsh reviews and it's unfortunate that this product missed the mark.  But I also worry that the reviews may be misleading and perhaps even false- something I've heard about before but haven't encountered in many years.I am always looking for ways to organize my home since I like it neat.  So when I came across this product, I ordered immediately.  Especially when I saw all the great reviews.  BUT, I'm not so sure all those reviews are fully accurate and have reported this to Amazon.  Notice how most of the reviews are not verified purchasers, entered within the month of April within a span of a few days, and if you click on the see other reviews by that person many of them only review this or this and the other universal product.  That makes me wonder- not making an accusation, but seems odd doesn't it???Now, when the product arrived I was actually quite hopeful because it seemed like good quality.  Decent plastic (another reviewer said it was flimsy but I thought the opposite), VERY EASY to adjust to the three different sizes, came with an additional basket for storage that could be useful, and was about the right size to fit in a cupboard shelf (maybe a little big for the fridge or freezer though).Make sure you note that if you try to put assembled sippy cups in there, the lids will make it all get stuck.  The same with bottles- you'll have to store them in pieces if you want to use this product.  This might be a personal preference but I always take the extra few minutes to roughly assemble things so I can just grab and use.  If you use the basket to separate this might not be a big deal, but you'll have to use the same brand to avoid extra effort.BUT, even when I took them all apart, things just don't fall down smoothly at all.  I tried bottles, sippy cups, cans, baby food, etc. and NOTHING flowed smoothly.  I made sure to have all the same brand and it sort of worked here and there.  However, at least 75% of the time, when I got to pulling two things out, it would get stuck behind the big center column.  There's just too much space right there for it to really work.  This appears to be a design flaw- instead of being so vertical, it probably would have worked if it were more horizontal.With my first son, I hated all the equipment just being in the cupboard so now that I've had a second I want more efficiency since I have less time.  This is a GREAT idea.  It reminds me of the old soda dispenser/stackers that a large plastics company used to sell and my mom had.  Those worked well but were annoying to fill up (now they aren't needed since the soda companies are making those boxes with the flap to remove).  Too bad this didn't work as well.  I'm printing my return labels now.	
1. 	I like this product, as does my son (though he hasn't quite figured out how to jump yet). But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper.	
1. 	When baby can &#34;escape&#34; from a traditional swaddle blanket, this one is the only one that worked. It helps my son sleep through the night. Phew! We started using it at 2 months (about 23 inches, 14 lbs) and still use it now (4 months, about 26 inches, 17 lbs), although it's getting too small. Highly recommend for parents who have a baby who flails during sleep and wakes himself up. This keeps the arms tight, and my son seems to be very comfortable and happy when he is in it. It will be a sad, sad night when he can no longer use this awesome swaddle.	
1. 	This gate requires common sense, not instructions.  There is no sense in down-grading their rating for this reason.  Why does toothpaste have instructions?  People like you, who lack common sense and basic problem-solving skills.The height is better than the taller Evenflo model, because even at 5'4&#34; it is still possible to step over the gate, even while holding a laundry basket.  We've had this gate set up on the stairs (prior to setting up a permanent gate) and it is possible to step over the gate and down one step without issue.Bear in mind that the bottom corners must be placed above floor molding so that all four rubber nubs have equal pressure against the wall.  Even with the added height, it is easy to step over.  This is not the type of gate you want to unlock and replace every time you want to go by.We have permanently mounted gates in addition to these pressure gates since each gate has its own benefits.  Permanently mounted gates are just that, you never intend to move them, just pass through.  If you go this route, be prepared to use the screws they provide since they are not strong enough to hold back toddlers without the extra reinforcement.These pressure gates are for blocking off an open slider (the nubs fit into the slider so it is impossible to dislodge) or the kids' bedroom during play time.  We also use them on the front door when we are looking for a cool breeze.After a few weeks you will notice that the metal leaves marks in the commonly used settings, so it is quicker to install over time.	
1. 	This was our 6th bottle/nipple to try on our daughter who refused to take the bottle.  It finally worked!!!  And the whole Playtex system is so easy and convenient to use.  I wish I had started off with these and not wasted so much time and money on the other fancy and hard-to-clean bottles.	
1. 	I ordered these for my son based on the reviews, and I have not been disappointed!  I use them day in and day out and I can't say enough good things about them.  They are lightweight and 'breathable' yet totally waterproof.  After every meal, I rinse them or wad them up and squeeze a drop of dish soap on them to wash them out.  Then I wring out the excess water and hang them on a towel rack to dry and voila, they are dry and ready for the next meal!  Periodically I toss them in with a load of laundry for a deep clean. I love how they don't get wrinkled or creased like the plastic bibs- they still look new after 18 months.  The pocket does a great job of catching food.  Seriously such great bibs!  I am ordering more.  (The only thing I'm not in love with is the pattern, Suess is cute and all but these are kind of busy.  That's no biggie at the house but they clash with and overpower his cute outfits when we eat out.  But that's just my silly sense of vanity!)	
1. 	We bought this for our curious 9 month old and love it.  She's cruising and likes to play with everything.  When we make it a play yard she screams...apparently she likes her freedom.  So instead we opened it up and are using it to block her way to the TV and computer.  This way she is safe from sharp corners and cables, but can still wander around the rest of our baby-proof room.  It is heavy enough that she can't move it and as long as you have plenty of bends in the thing (don't make it a straight line) it doesn't fall over.  We still have it held up on both sides by heavy furniture because I'm paranoid that she'll suddenly get a power burst and pull it down, but so far it's just been overkill.When the baby is in bed, we move the play yard to our front porch and our dogs can come out and enjoy the evening with us.  I don't know that this would work for all dogs, but ours are scared of baby gates and things so it works for them.  Most other large dogs would jump this thing in a second.I also wanted to note that we bought this at Babies R Us because we had a gift card for that store, but it is cheaper here by almost $10.  We'll come back to Amazon if we decide to get the 2 panel expansion.	
1. 	I bought this for an upcoming vacation.  I tried it out once at home to see how it compares to the Medela PIS and I was pleasantly surprised! This worked just as well, if not better, than the electric! I would recommend this!	
1. 	We had been using Dr. Brown bottles exclusively, but our little one was getting gas and seemed fussy after meals.  We bought one of the Ventaire bottles- just to try- but ended up with a fast flow nipple- much too fast for our three week old.  So, the bottle sat unused on the bottle rack for a week or so until I found slow flow nipples at a local store.  I brought them home and we tried the bottle out again- what a difference!!!  First of all, it is so much more comfortable to hold compared to the Dr. Brown!  Secondly, there are much fewer parts to assemble- and wash.  Thirdly, and most importantly, our little one is much less fussy and gassy after meals.  I went out today and bought 3 more of the 6 ounce bottles- they were the only size that came with the slow flow nipples.  We are going to keep the Dr. Brown bottles, but the Playtex Ventaires are our new go to bottles!	
- 1	The waterproof covering on it is very thin and punctures very easily. Once torn, the material underneath it reminds me of those old styrofoam trays meat was packed in. I had bought this at a store before I read the Amazon reviews (others have warned of lack of durability.) I have upgraded to a Baby Care play mat (made of rubber, flexible, and durable) that is much better than this product.	
- 1	The distortion of this 'mirror' is really a drag (it's a mirror laminate on a plastic backing of course, due to safety issues with real glass hanging over baby's head in a moving car). Like looking into a funhouse mirror from the back seat.	
1. 	A friend bought me this pillow as a gift during my first pregnancy.  I am now 5.5 months through my second pregnancy, and I consider it an absolute necessity.  I don't think I would have bought it for myself because it seemed like too much money to spend on such a specialized pillow that is huge and a pain to store.  BUT--I am now convinced that it is essential for sleeping during pregnancy!  It is so much more comfortable than any arrangement of other pillows, and well worth the price.  I credit this pillow for helping me get more sleep during both of my pregnancies.  My husband even likes it--he uses it when I am out of town!It is quite big and bulky--like another body in the bed.  There is no good way to make the bed with this pillow in it, so we've just given up on trying to make the bed look normal with this pillow in it.  It either gets moved to the floor when the bed is made, or we pull the covers up over it and it looks like someone is still sleeping in the bed.  Oh well - It is well worth it for the 6-9 months of pregnancy that it helps me sleep!	
1. 	not too sure what others are refering to when saying this gate is difficult to use... it sets up like any other pressure mounted gate out there.  to set up, of course you need 2 hands [another person is so NOT needed] line it up with your wall, choose the size, and push the bar down.  to take down- you only need 1 hand, simply pull the bar up.what i love about this gate, is that when taking it down you can pull the bar completely up and not have to worry about the gate coming apart.  there is a locking feature that prevents the two slats from going out the other end.  you'll know what i'm talking about if you've owned the cheapy 10 dollar gate.it's tall, very sturdy, and fits bigger doorways.  i use it both for dogs and children.  perfect for both uses.unless you're using too tight of a setting it will not damage your walls.  and of course if it falls down easily, your setting is too loose.  other than that, it's easy to get up and very easy to get down.	
- 1	I can't fit much in this bag without the magnetic closures popping open.  The stitching on the liner on the inside that seperates compartments came undone after less than a year and is flimsy.  I've got two in diapers now and there is no way I can continue with this one any more.  Three diapers, a half empty bag of Kirkland wipes, one change of clothes, and an insulator pack for breast milk, prooved to be too much for the main compartment.  Pockets for the bottle and a water bottle on the sides are the only perks I can put on here, but most diaper bags have that, sooooo...I think I've said enough.	
1. 	I found this product cheaper at Walmart.  The only difference is the middle portion is white.  I like that I'm able to turn the shelves to view the baby food.  I don't like it doesn't allow you to turn each shelf individually.  I also wish it would hold more than 24 jars of food.  But for less than $9.00, it's a great deal so I recommend it.	
- 1	Followed the instructions re: cleaning with alcohol and drying... several times.  Subway tile.  Flat.  Clean.  Not crossing grout lines.  I dont understand why, in these reviews, its working in some cases and not in others. Perhaps there are more temperature shifts in my home that arent in others, and this has a role... ??  Whatever it is, I (and others, clearly) found this product wildly disappointing.  After a year of trying everything except drilling through my tile (thought about it!), I just got rid of mine.	
1. 	My husband insisted on this for the boy, because he cried when we changed his diaper for the first month and a half of his life.We still use it. It is attractive to look at and does a great job warming the wipes. We have never delt with stinky or dry wipes and here is why.We are analy clean. We pour approximately 1 whole cup of bottled water into the container either before or after putting the wipes in. They absorb the water and stay warm and wet.We also buy the special anti-germ pads for the bottom. We change the bottom anti-germ pad every 3 months and there is no smell or dry wipes. So if you use the pads and more clean water than it calls for you should be very happy.	
- 1	He is breast fed so I thought these would be similar to a &#34;natural&#34; nipple but he did not like them at all. We have never used them. I will say that a friend of mine used them and loved them but each baby is different. The nipple that I would recommend if you are having a hard time getting your baby to take a bottle and you are breast feeding is the NUK ready to use nipples. They are awesome. A few friends of mine were having the same issues I was having and all of our babies loved the NUK ones. We use them with the Dr. Brown bottles and it works! Good Luck!	
- 1	This cup leaks and the lid doesn't screw on well after awhile. I won't buy it again. You get what you pay for.	
- 1	This cup was kind of a pain to assemble--you have to fold the nipple in half to squeeze it into place, and then run your thumb around the bottom of the lid to make sure it's sealed, and it still leaks.  Maybe ours was just defective, but it seemed to leak out the valve hole.  I ended up tossing it after just a couple of weeks of cleaning up the floor after every use (we never had this problem to this extent with Nuby cups, or even Take & Toss cheap cups).	
1. 	This set is great for a baby that is a few months old and is drinking more.  I received the neutral kit that included green and yellow bottles that would be appropriate for either a boy or girl. You get three 9 ounce bottles with fast flow nipples.  I have the newborn Playtex kit and continue to use the slow flow nipples because my baby is a fast eater and this helps her slow down. The nipples are also supposed to be naturally shaped to aid in breastfeeding, but my baby is exclusively fed pumped milk, so I cannot attest to that ability.The bottles are different because of the Ventaire technology. The bottom of the bottle twists off and a rubber vent fits inside. Make sure you twist the bottom on correctly, or milk will leak. They are a little stiff, but after more use it is easier to twist them off and on. Tiny holes in the bottom of the bottle allow air to escape, so your baby is not taking in extra air while eating. I saw bubbles popping and could hear the air escaping while my baby ate. Very cool.The bottles are shaped with a angle which allows for mothers to hold the baby in a more upright position while eating. This helps reduce gas and supposedly colic. It comes into narrow sides that the baby can grip when it is able.All of the bottles come with caps that fit very tightly, making transporting milk easier. Cleaning is easy, just twist off the top and bottom and remove the nipples and vents.  All parts have held up well through multiple washings.I would highly recommend these bottles. I have also used Avent, and they are good, but I do believe the Ventaire technology has made my baby less gassy and less fussy.	
1. 	It is a very very nice product. It works for my infant baby. My baby barely can open her eyes when the ocean is turning on. I love the sheep. Of course it is bigger than I expected, but anyway, the sheep is a very good sleep-helper.	
1. 	We didn't want more furniture if we could help it and this was a good compromise.  This fits right on your chair, or you can use it on the floor.  It has 3 positions, so it was easy to use when he was just starting solids.  The tray is easy to put on and take off and the whole thing is easy to clean	
1. 	We like this and have used it often. However, only seven of the eight utensils will fit with the lid on the case. This didn't matter much for us, though - we just leave a spoon at home! Also, the fork tips are rounded, so our son has a little trouble spearing things with it. He is old enough (fifteen months) to be able to use a pointier fork, so I will be checking soon to see if one of our sharper forks will fit in the case.And, as it says in the title, colors can vary. Ours is orange and yellow, which I like better than the pink in the picture since it's more gender neutral.	
1. 	This is by far one of the best purchases I have ever made.  The gate is fantastic.  It is so secure that adults can't even figure out how to open it (really funny to watch)!  I will admit that it took a couple of tries to get it tight enough but once it is in place - it doesn't budge!  The only thing I don't like but understand it is necessary is the very loud click it makes when it closes.  It confirms that it is locked but if my son is sleeping, the click can be heard in his room.  Oh - make SURE you following the directions completely - I accidentally cut the straps off from the beginning which is why my installation took longer.	
1. 	this is such a good price for this base. It was easy to assemble and I love how easily it folds to fit in my car.	
1. 	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.	
1. 	Fits perfectly on the crib, helps with having the right items needed for changing time at hand. Like the material also, can be easily cleaned and sterilized.	
1. 	We put this on our registry thinking if we get it great, if not oh well.  We LOVE this entertainer.  It's light and portable to go to our family's house and great for our house also.  It keeps our son busy for just enough time to do the dishes or get a shower.  We have a family dinner at my husband's grandma's house every other Sunday and we take either this, our Deluxe Take Along Swing, or our Bumper Jumper with us every time and it keeps him and his cousin busy long enough for everyone to eat and then pick them up again.  We give this saucer an A+	
1. 	I bought this for my brother's family. They were living with my parents for a few months due to family health issues, and their baby was quickly outgrowing his bouncy chair. They didn't want to invest in a high chair when they'd be moving across country in a few months, so I picked this up for them.  The baby, 6 months old, loved it and they loved it because it allowed the baby to sit at the table, the same height as us, and enjoy the dinner time while giving mom and dad a chance to eat, too.  They said they might not even buy a high chair they like this so much. The baby does need to be able to sit up by himself for this seat to work.	
1. 	My son started to resist going to bed at night so I bought this turtle to make bedtime more entertaining and provide a nightlight until he fell asleep.  He LOVES it.  It really is so cute.  It lights up his whole room and he likes to change the colors and point out the moon.  I was concerned that the shell would be too hard to leave in his crib, but it's fine.  I like that the turtle has a timer and shuts off in 45 minutes.  The &#34;tootell&#34; is already very well loved by my son and I would highly recommend it to other moms.	
1. 	These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product.	
1. 	Unlike the previous review we loved these bottles, and yes we have a baby that spits up alot and the bottles do make the difference. Our son loves these bottles, they help on the gas and the spitting up and he is able to latch on and drink with no major effort. We also love having a different choice of nipple sizes. Both of my children were given ceral bottles at young ages by there doctors and with my first we had to poke hole in the nipple and hope it worked. With my son we are able to buy stage 2 nipples and not owrry about him getting too much formula too fast. These are wonderful	
1. 	We opted to not buy a high chair with our child and use this instead. It's been great. We don't actually use the white feeding tray and just use the tray instead. We started using it when our son was about 4 months old and has been able to grow with him. Now that our son is getting older, we can leave leave the tray off and slide him up to the table for meal time. Such a nice way to transition.	
- 1	I am a little annoyed by Fisher Price because of this swing. We found our original swing (Fisher Price Cradle Swing Little Snugabunnyto be so indispensable that we had to buy one for the grandparents' house, too. For something different, we chose this swing rather than the same Snugabunny, also by Fisher Price.This swing is only battery operated and noisier - something I should have noticed in the product description, but annoying nonetheless. But, more importantly, it is considerably smaller than the other. It's not something we noticed at first, but as the baby grew, we realized that she was quickly getting far too big and unsafe for this swing, but fit comfortably in the other. Both swings say newborn up to 25lbs, but this is not true.10 months later, we packed up this swing two months ago, and the Snugabunny still fits her perfectly - and was a godsend when she developed a cold and needed to sleep more upright. Don't save a few dollars by buying the cheaper swing that will only last a few months. It's cheaper in the end to get the other.	
1. 	We have 2 sets of twins, 8 months old and 3 years old. Surprizingly we dont have many gates, just 4, one for the top and bottom of each staircase. These work very well. They were easy to install and do not leave marks on teh walls. They are easy for me and my husband to open and close (even with babies on the hips) but too difficult for my 3 year olds to operate. They are very safe and hold up to much abuse, including my 3 year olds grabbing the bars and shaking it. It serves its purpose, though I didnt try it in a doorway. I dont need any others seeing tha tmy house is VERY baby proof. but these are nice looking easy to use and very sturdy.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product and was excited to buy it when I became pregnant but am now hesitant to let my baby use it after reading about the recall in Europe. Apparently, as I understand it, their toxin standards of measurement are lower than ours so they have not been recalled here (apparently we are OK with low levels of nitrates in the toys our children put in their mouths, but Europeans are not...hmmm)...Be that as it may, toxins registering even CLOSE to a dangerous level made me nervous about using. After digging around online I did discover that the company claims to have changed the product after a certain date and lists manufacturing codes so you can check yours (those listed were made after a certain date and are said to be safer). Sadly mine was not made after the &#34;improved&#34; date but I could not return it because there was no formal recall in our country. I considered returning it and hunting for one with an approved manufacturing date but man that was just too much work. Bummed but not ready to take a risk with my baby.	
- 1	My son doesn't like wearing this necklace.  I am not sure why.  I will give it another try in a few weeks.  I wear doubled up around my wrist sometimes, but I do not notice any difference in pain management when I wear it.  We will give it a shot later and see how it works!	
1. 	Takes up no space when deflated and is perfect for stays at grandma's or on vacation. Easy to inflate/deflate and drain to dry out after use.	
- 1	It must depend on what kind of cabinet that you have but ours continually fall off.  We stuck them on, applied pressure and didn't use for 24 hours.  The next day my 13 month old daughter goes and yanks open all the doors.  The locks went flying.  Not impressed at all.	
- 1	The level of music is pleasant enough, and it is a cute little song.  The problem I have with it, is it plays the same song, two different versions of it, but still the same song.  Other than that it is pretty good.  For these suction cup toys I just use wipe a little condensation off of my water glass because it doesn't take very much moisture to get them to stick.	
1. 	This infant bath is huge! We decided we'll be hanging it in our bathroom out of the way, once the newborn phase is over.I think it will last throughout infancy and am glad we received it.	
1. 	Okay, so I'm pretty sure that they could make breast shields out of rainbows and sunshine and I would still hate pumping.  That being said, I did find these shields more comfortable than the hard plastic shields.  I could create a better seal with it around my breast which led me to be able to pump a little more and a little more efficiently.  I was getting an extra ounce or so per pumping session (and considering I would get 2 oz or so with the other breast shields, was a HUGE improvement).  If you are having trouble, I would definitely say give these a try.	
1. 	These containers are great BECAUSE OF the size. First of all, they are perfectly sized for newborns. And, once your baby gets a little older, and requires more milk, these 2.5 oz. containers are the perfect supplement to combine with a 5oz storage bag when thawing to make a bottle. Other reviewers claim these containers are awkward, but I would suggest not pumping directly into them. If you own a Medela pump, or the like, simply pump into the 5oz container that comes with the pump and transfer into the smaller storage container(s) for freezing.I always make sure my mother in law/nanny has 12 frozen Medela (2.5 oz) containers of milk at her place (in deep freeze) in case my baby needs a snack if I am running late to pick him up after work.Oh, and they are BPA-free. Bonus.I highly recommend these.	
- 1	I got this one in black with baby blue lining .... Well, after using it for a few months the lining got poopy stain on it and because of the kind of fabric/nylon used (not smooth) it's impossible to get rid of the stain because it goes deep inside... Not happy abt this product at all.	
1. 	This bib works perfectly for my 6-month old, who's just getting used to having solids put in his mouth. It rinses off in two seconds and catches everything. I can't imagine using a fabric bib, or one without a nice, open pocket like this one. Baby would have half his dinner in his lap.UPDATE: My son is now 2.5 years old and this is the best bib on earth. We use it for every meal at home and even some meals out (it's a little big for that, but oh well). No other design could conceivably prevent food (especially applesauce or yogurt) from going into the lap. I have no idea why any other bibs are even still on the market, except for drool-catching and spit-up absorbing.LOVE THIS BIB! Get two. You will want two.	
1. 	They are soft, I'd say bigger than average (length-wise), have ample sized velcro sections in the back that are secure.  Great price also.I was concerned they would be too small but they are perfect for my teething (constantly drooling)  toddler @ 14 months. The neck is also ample - definately bigger than an infant bib.  We've had them for about a month maybe longer and i've seen no signs of wear with weekly washings.	
1. 	My husband and I LOVE this co sleeper. I think it helped keep us sane.This is our first baby and I don't think either of us knew how hard it was to care for a newborn. This kid woke every 1.5-2 hrs... We still had to get up but now that she's 2 months old, sometimes she's just crying for her pacifier. It's so nice to just stay in bed and reach over to give her the pacifier and also know she's safe in the co sleeper. Sometimes she's just fussy because she's cold so we don't even have to get out of bed to give her a blanket. It's compact for storage too so we'll be saving this for our 2nd baby. If you can only put one thing on your registry, put this!	
1. 	We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers. At first she seemed like she was avoiding it. Then one day (just about 2 years old) she started asking to go to the potty by herself. It is easy to clean. It is stable. It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it.	
1. 	helped with aches and sleep trouble for 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  will definitely use in future pregnancies and recommend to anyone who has trouble getting comfortable.  slipcover is easy to remove and wash, but pretty hard to put back on.  worth the trouble though.	
1. 	Lightweight and breathable! I even threw them in the washer and dryer and they turned out perfect!  Great for a baby learning to eat  cereal and food!  So much easier than trying to clean by hand and dig out food particles in the seams!!	
- 1	I purchased this necklace based on positive reviews, its washable, and the thin cord. As soon as it arrived I gave it to baby to play with and get used to it. Her thumb got stuck in the small (small!) pendant hole. I was able to snap the necklace once and since then it hasn't worked. I can never use this as intended; a way to keep her occupied during nursing instead of looking around at every noise.I had read other reviews that babies liked the cord over other similar necklaces with smaller beads and I knew my baby would too. Once she started sucking on the cord I realized that it could easily become a choking hazard if she sucked too much into her mouth, which I hadn't thought of at the time of purchase but in hindsight it seems so obvious!I believe I'm going to try and return this despite her liking to chew on it.	
- 1	I purchased this one some months ago before my baby was born and it cost me $70 aprox. I see now it is much more expensive (almost $100!!)Honestly I think the theme is beautiful and all but for being Hello Kitty (I've worked with this license in my country) the materials are not good enough!! It is most polyester than anything, the fabric is not nice, looks bad quality and is stiff. Would it had been 100% cotton things would be completely different. I don't think the material makes justice to this beautiful character and theme... Only if you are a great fan of Hello Kitty it might be ok to buy this but other than that I wouldn't recommend this set at all, worse for the price... I don't think it's worth it. I decorated my baby's room with the entire collection and everything looks so cute but the fabric is so bad I feel sorry I didn't choose something else on Amazon.Hope Sanrio takes note of this and choose another licensee to manufacture these stuff, and supervise the material is good enough for a baby. I myself wouldn't sleep in such a stiff material! :(	
1. 	I love this photo album since you can put the photo in front and on the side. Plus its simplicity makes it really nice. Will buy more of this!	
- 1	Very disappointed with this product. I am unable to use it because there is not much space to push the buttons in on the sides and turn to open the door. when I turn the handle, the bottom of the lock rubs the door frame & makes it near impossible to turn to open the door.	
1. 	You should feel good about purchasing Haba toys, and the rattling caterpillar is no exception.This is a great toy to hang from a carseat or bouncer.  My daughter is very interested in the sound it makes when you pull on the ring and the pieces make a clacking noise.  She likes to chew on the caterpillar - it's great for teething.  And since it's a Haba toy, you don't need to worry about lead or unsafe paints.	
1. 	The first time we used these we tried to spell out our sons name only to realize there is only 1 of each letter.  Makes spelling things tough.  They stick to the tub well and the bright colors are great for our son.	
- 1	We found these Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets to be very pretty, too small in size, and of not of such good quality compared to other receiving blankets that we purchased.	
1. 	We really like this item because it keeps a bit of everything you need for baby within arms reach. Sturdy and easy to use.	
- 1	I love the size of this sound machine and that it lays flat and can easily be pushed to the side of my daughter's dresser. It could be a nicer color but even that is no biggie... what I do not like and what the whole purpose of this is the SOUND! The sound quality is awful. The rain option sounds like static, the heartbeat just sounds like a drum beat, the thunder doesn't sound like anything that I can tell and is not smoothing sound at all. The other sounds are also not smoothing. I think we have tried this a few times but found it useless. I have since taken it out of my daughter's room. Very disappointed.	
1. 	Thinner than some of the other bibs out there.  Easy to clean and take on and off.  Perfect simple bib.	
1. 	First off, this is not a cup for a parent with a child that throws cups or pulls lids off or flips cups upside down and shakes them on a regular basis. If you want one of those then you need to get a cup with a valve that's closer to a bottle. However if you need a cup that won't make a huge mess when knocked over then these are the right cups for you.These are nice cups for kids transitioning to regular cups or for older kids that are in situations where a regular cup would be inconvenient. I used these for years after my daughter had transitioned to a regular cup when we were in situations where a spilled drink would have been a disaster, such as for her cup beside her bed at night, the cup I put her juice in when she was sick and for trips in the car. They're cheap and they stack in the back of your cabinet so you can just pull them out when you need them.The cups are dishwasher safe, they do crack when chewed on but besides that they're fairly strong for something that is disposable.	
- 1	I was unable to use the adhesive part of the lock because it wouldn't stick to my cabinet.  I needed a lock that required no drilling and was sad when these didn't work.I returned the product this morning.	
1. 	I purchased this toy for my 5 1/2 month old and she loved it right away.  She got the hang of pressing the red button to make the balls go and stop and has a lot of fun with this.  I agree that the balls make loud noise and it is hard to hear the music but we have found that if you only use 2 balls it is not as bad.  Taylor is now 7 1/2 months old and she still loves this toy.  We have had no problem with anything breaking or not working and one of her favorite things to do is to manually stop it from spinning.I recommend this toy as it is a lot of fun for babies and adults (Her dad loves to play with this toy as well!)	
- 1	I bought this set a month before my baby was born. One of the smaller bags tore when I filled it with my babies toiletries. The bags are cute, but they are not durable. Once the bottom tears open you cannot use them again. I was very disappointed that they tore before my baby was even born! Ziploc bags are much better, and they're waterproof! Unlike this set of bags.	
1. 	I LOVE Sassy products! They are amazing value and always do their job perfectly. My baby is now 3 mths old and loves grasping and mouthing toys. This is a really great slection, colourful, imaginative and fun. He especially likes the fish and holds him on every journey we make. I wasn't expecting this pack to have so many different styles and to be so well made, but it really is lovely. Buy it!	
- 1	You get what you pay for! Baby hates these. They are so hard and too short under the lip so baby can't even auck properly on these. Soothies are the way to go!	
- 1	The bed is beautiful but has scratches aand gouges on one side. Thank goodness is is the side facing the wall. If possible, buy in person...	
1. 	When I was pregnant I couldn't understand why these were so popular especially at the cost of $20 each.  I could get cheaper ones at target and Carter's Baby and to me that was good enough.  Anyhow the cheaper ones never really took off, the sleeves on the Carter's ones never fit him properly and were too warm, the bags were also not that big and constricted him so using them was always a battle.  I quickly gave them up.  Anyway my now nearly 6 month old loves grabbing things and after a night episode where he wrapped the blanket around his face twice the next day I was at babiesrus to check the Halo sleepsacks out.  I bought two in size medium and love them.  The zip is inverted which allows for quick diaper changes without unzipping the whole bag.  The bag is also large enough for him to kick, lift his legs and move freely.  The armholes also fit nicely without being too wide.  I am sold!!! I see you can get up to XL so I guess I will be using these for a while! I am going today to buy two more for him to use at daycare.	
1. 	I used to wash bibs constantly, now I just have this one bib that is perfect.  I always wash it off right away when my son is done with it and hang it on the high chair so that it dries for next time and is always clean and available.  The velcro tie in the back is nice and fast, and my son loves it because it is trucks.  Worth paying a little more for this print if you have a boy!	
1. 	So far, my 2 year old has been able to pull the cords out, but hasn't been able to get his little fingers down near the outlet, which is really the important part. One nice plus is it actually neatens the look of the power strip, instead of making it look tackier.	
1. 	I used these in the first year of my daughters life to store expressed breast milk.  I have the Avent pump (which I LOVE) so with the adapter I could pump right into these, very convenient. I had a lot of milk stored in my freezer I really appreciated how nicely they stacked and that they didn't take much room.  I never had problems with spilling.  As a disclaimer to that, I will say that I didn't transport milk daily and that I rarely filled the cups completely.I appreciate them even more now that I'm done pumping.  While bottles and plastic bags are either causing clutter in my cupboards or have been thrown out, these are still frequently used.  They're a perfect size for on the go toddler snacks.  I also use them to store sides for my husband and I when we take lunches to go or to store small amounts of leftovers (usually headed for my toddlers lunch the next day).Overall, these are a good choice for milk storage based on their potential long-term usefulness!	
1. 	Turtles are my favorite animal so I got some turtle bibs because babies always need a few gave one to a friend and one to a cousin	
1. 	This arrived nicely sealed with all parts.  One note is that the shields are one piece with the connector, so you can't switch the shield to a smaller size.  I would have liked this kit better if you could order it with smaller shield sizes, and if it included the tubing.  Overall I wish Medela had more kit options--there was no way to order just what I needed.	
1. 	Meh, I was hoping for some great USA made products when I bought these for homemade baby food but I'm a bit disappointed.  The white plastic is flecked with black spots (I'm hoping against hope it isn't little gnats or something - that's what they look like) and two of the four lids are nearly impossible to seal.  They do the job and it is nice to be able to stack them in the freezer, they just aren't as great as I had anticipated.	
1. 	My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!	
1. 	I bought this one (in pink)for my daughter after using and hating the diaper genie with my son. I loved that I would be able to use trash bags not refills and how easy it seemed to use. I am pleased to say that this was a good choice. Yes, like some other people said the wipes can get stuck in the drum, but I always wrap them in my diapers anyway. I have not had any trouble with the drum or diapers getting stuck. The only time I smell anything is when I go to empty it, but that's expected. I would recommend this pail in a second!	
1. 	I purchased this for my daughter when she was 7 months old primarily to use as a stationery walker.  She absolutely loved the lights and music and I liked the fact that she not only could spin in a circle but actually WALK back and forth.  When she began walking I removed the seat and she loved to run and stomp on the piano keys to activate the music.  She uses it more than any toy she has.  It is by far the BEST stationery walker on the market because it lasts from infancy well into toddlerhood.	
1. 	Excellent and colourful and makes bath time fun.	
1. 	Very simple, very economical and it fits small babies. We started poty traning our son at 5 months and he loves to be on the poty. The splashguard protects well. It is easy to clean - overall full satisfaction!	
1. 	My 11 month old twins get into EVERYTHING.  These cabinet locks work for us, in large part because of the reclosing protection feature that actually keeps the cabinets slightly open about an inch and a half (depending on installation).  This means everything to me, as the twins working together have still been able to get their little fingers caught in hinges and cabinets with other locks.  With the Safe-Lok, I actually always leave our cabinets open that inch, so that they can never open OR close the doors on each other.  I just make sure to never have anything in the cabinets that could fit through the small opening, which is pretty easy to remember.As for installation, it took my husband a half hour to install locks on all 8 bottom kitchen cabinets.  He definitely used a ruler, pencil and drill to do so, but with a modicum of engineering smarts these were no problem at all to install.	
1. 	Everything was as expected. Great bottles for a reasonable price - better than what I have found in local stores. I have no complaints and would recommend to others.	
- 1	We bought this last year for our cloth diapers. i thought it looked like netting but the picture wasn't good. We've been using them for clothes but do NOT use these for diapers!! Anyone who does is insane! They are netting, for sanitations sake, use a wet back for diapers! I would never use this for diapers, it would leak everywhere, they would not hold anything in like wet bags. ugh, disgusting...the very though of using them for diapers makes me sick.	
- 1	We got this as a baby shower gift and have had problems since day 1. First, the noise sensor doesn't work so well. The monitor will turn on if a car drives by, however, my baby could be screaming and it won't click on. We attempted to work with Levana to get it replaced, but they wanted us to mail it back to them while they looked at it before they could replace it (thus leaving us without a baby monitor for at least a week). We decided just to deal with it and keep the baby monitor &#34;on&#34; instead of in &#34;vex mode&#34; (sensor mode). Well, after 6 months of use, this monitor has officially stopped working completely. We will attempt to work with Levana again to get it replaced, but I am not too excited about dealing with this company again.	
- 1	I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem. I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag. However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet. I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle. I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook. I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded. I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.	
- 1	Ok who designed this piece of junk? First of all there is no dangling fish like in the photo, and no lights like the description states. It is a hard plastic thing with fabric fish. It cannot be hooked to a crib so my baby can only play with it on the floor. When you press the fish there are 3 options. Classical music- but it only plays ONE SONG over and over, a tactile tune- again ONE sound for each fish, and a silly sound- and yes again ONE SOUND. The textures are stupid. The only one worth anything is the furry fish. The others aren't overdone enough for the baby to get any satisfaction from touching it. There is a tiny crinkly fin, bumpy fabric, a felt fin, and rubber fish. It is too big and bulky for baby to pick up, and the fish are too hard for babies to push. My daughter is 8 months so well over the recommended age- she should be able to push them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get something that your baby can pick up and feel, transfer from hand to hand, chew... etc.	
- 1	First of all, I've had it for probably 9 months now and doesn't seem to be anywhere near breaking.Unfortunately, when you turn it on, that's it; it's on.There's no flow or time button. For instance, if the bubbles came out at a slower pace, and then would run for about 10 seconds and then waited a minute, then started again, that would be AWESOME! However, it doesn't. It's on/off and at a moderate pace which is just too much.Overall, waste of money. If redesigned, then I would spend more money.	
1. 	I searched far and wide for a booster for my two year old.  I thought that this looked like the best one, and the price was not too bad.  I was right!  My favorite thing about this booster is that it is very easy to clean! No nooks or crannys for food to get stuck in. It wipes clean very easily.I also like that it is low profile and not offensive looking.The seat does not slip off the chair and feels pretty sturdy.I think that this chair is the best value to price out there.  I just ordered a second for the grandparents' house!	
- 1	My mom got this car seat for her car so that I wouldn't have to deal with dragging mine through the airport with a one year old while traveling by myself. It took me 45 minutes to install it rear facing and it was never secure. I tried everything. I read the instructions over and over, yet it would move a significant amount side to side. I even had two airport workers help amd they couldnt get it to stop moving around. The fabric is cheap and seems uncomfortable. The straps are a huge pain to adjust and there is nothing to protect their little legs from being pinched when you are buckling them in. I never felt like my daughter was safe in this seat. I felt sick when we drove anywhere and avoided going to many places because I cringed at the thought of putting my daughter in this thing. Next time I will just drag a car seat, stroller, Boba baby carrier, 3 bags, and a diaper bag through the airport to avoid using this piece of crap. Please just spend a little more and get a better seat, a few dollars saved is not worth the peace of mind you will lose using this flimsy seat.	
- 1	I was thinking that this would be really handy for outlets that I use more frequently and I am sure if could be if I had not had trouble installing it. I removed my old switch plate and replaced it with this one. However when I was installing it (using the screw that it came with) the screw broke off and the tip is now stuck in my outlet box. I now have to turn off my electricity and remove the outlet box to try and fish the screw out from the other end. In the meantime I have an exposed outlet which kind of defeats the purpose of getting a safety cover. Hopefully once I managed to get this item installed it will be smooth sailing.	
- 1	These bottles get 2 stars from me for being decent quality - no leaking or other issues, volume markings are clear on the outside.  Unfortunately, they were not at all natural in my (primarily breastfed) baby's mouth and did not work for us.  Just because it looks like a breast by eye doesn't mean it will work for every breastfed baby.  Make sure to check that your baby's latch on the bottle nipple looks just like it does/should on the breast.  For my 6 week old daughter, her latch on the avent natural nipples caused her lips to curl completely in/under instead of flanging out.  The transition from tip to base is just too abrupt, it's too sharp of an angle.  Worst of all, she frequently choked while drinking from these, which was rather scary.  I assume, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, that these must work for many babies.  Just don't make the mistake of assuming they will work best for every baby; try multiple bottle nipples until you find the right one for your baby.  For us, it was the Lansinoh mOmma bottles.	
- 1	We have an elongated toilet and I don't know of anyway to hold this seat in place. My daughter has trouble sitting back far enough because when she tries to scoot back, the whole seat goes with her. So when she pees, it gets in between the potty ring and the toilet seat and makes a big mess.	
- 1	The case is very difficult to open one-handed, which is pretty important while changing a diaper.  It's not really EASY even with two hands.  Maybe with lots and lots of use it will wear out a little and become easier to open.	
1. 	My son has had acid reflux since he was a few days old, and after dealing with 2 months of severe spitting up I finally saw an ad in a magazine and bought these bottles.  What a lifesaver they have been!  Within days, he was spitting up less and had less gas too.  It was such a noticeable difference that it had to be the bottles.  I could tell using Dr. Brown's that my son wasn't taking in as much air as he was with the Avent bottles we had been using.  I do suggest, however, that you read carefully and follow the directions included with these bottles.  For example, if you are going to put them in a bottle warmer, you MUST take the nipple off first or the liquid becomes piping hot and even explodes through the top.  Other than that, they are very easy to care for.  I thought cleaning them was no more difficult than any other bottles...the extra steps are worth it to me.	
1. 	They're my go-to favorites as far as bibs go.  Easy to clean, don't collect mold like others do.  Great designs.	
- 1	If your comfortable with dirt, this toys for you! Baby toys that cant easily be cleaned are a terrible idea. My 6 month son loves this thing but after he teethes on it for a little while it is completely soaked, the he drops it on the floor where it gets coated with who knows what (not that my floors are very dirty) it gets very gross. then he wants to put it right back in his mouth. Which I can handle for a day or so, but after that I want to throw it in the washer so hes not eating day old drool/spit-up/floor dirt mud. But the music box is not washable and not easily removed. I have disassembled  this thing twice to clean it (not an easy task, requiring wire cutters, a sewing needle, thread, and removing/replacing stuffing and tiny wires) but its becoming much more hassle than its worth. I am just going to throw it away before he becomes too attached. I would hate to have to tell him he cant have his favorite toy. What a shame they didn't make the music box removable because it really is a good toy.	
- 1	Doesn't really hold the cloth diapers, child complains its to tight, two of the clips have already broke with in the first day would not recommend.	
- 1	The product packaging says that the gate is 31&#34; high but it isnt. It is only about 28.5&#34;. If you have stairs like ours where the distance between the top and bottom mountable point on banister is more than 28.5&#34;, it obviously will not work. Had to return. Disappointed.	
- 1	I put this carrier on our baby registry because it seemed simpler to use than many of the wraps and slings for newborns, and it's quite inexpensive, too.  As it turns out, the carrier is super-easy to use, just as I'd hoped - there's no wondering (as there is with some wraps) how to get the thing on or if it's on right. However, after our baby arrived, I found that the ease of wearing this product was of little value to me at the outset, since I couldn't use the carrier at all at first.  This product can't carry a newborn in any position in which he will feel comfortable - most newborns don't like to have their legs stretched out like this carrier requires.  Our baby fussed and cried the whole time he was in the carrier when we first tried it.  In terms of the positions in which this carrier can hold a baby, it's more suitable for when the baby is a few months old.Once our baby was comfortable not having his legs tucked in, I was excited to use the carrier, but at that point, he was 15+ pounds, and I found out I still couldn't really use it - he had become too heavy to comfortably carry in this product, as it distributes all the weight on the shoulders and upper back.  I have a pretty strong back - I did deadlifts through the second trimester of pregnancy, and I never once had an aching back during my pregnancy.  Pregnancy couldn't hurt my back, but this carrier kills it!  I couldn't stand to wear my baby for more than 20-30 minutes at a time.  Even the wraps tend to do a better job distributing the baby's weight.Since I couldn't use the product at any stage of my baby's development, I don't think the product is worth even its modest cost.Even if you can stand the back-killing engineering of this carrier, I'd discourage using it, since (as I found out after the fact), carriers where  the baby basically hangs by his crotch aren't good for the baby - carrying the baby in this position  can potentially cause hip dysplasia.  To avoid this risk, it's better to have a carrier that has some kind of seat pocket, that holds the baby so that his knees are about level with his hips.If you want to wear your baby, you're better off putting in a little time to figure out how to use a wrap when he or she is still a newborn and spending the money for a good ergonomically supportive carrier, comfortable for both baby and parent, for when your baby is a bit bigger.  If you're looking for something to carry your newborn in, try the Moby, a Slingling, or maybe the Ergo with infant insert. Even I was finally able to figure out how to use my Moby and like it now!  The Slingling may also be an option if you want something really simple to use, though it's not quite as comfy as the other two options. I'd recommend an Ergo or Beco starting when baby is 4-6 months old.	
1. 	This thing actually fits her mattress. I've struggled for nearly 2 years trying to put the sheets on her mattress over top the mattress protector, even ripping holes in several of the corners because the sheets simply do not fit. I understand they are supposed to be snug, but good grief. This sheet is WONDERFUL. It's pretty soft, and fits with those fantastic &#34;deep pockets&#34;. No more frustrating bed linen days!	
- 1	This is a horrible product.  Waste of money since I now have to throw them all out.My 17 month old just pulled one out without any problem.Useless and Dangerous!	
- 1	I give it 2 stars for being a good idea and it worked for about a month until little hands figured out the Velcro and now it is pretty useless. It can be removed from both inside and outside the crib no matter how it is positioned, so it does little to stop the teething on the rails.	
1. 	Being a first time Mommy, I was having minor heart palpatations every time my little daughter made a squeak in the back seat and I could not see her.  I won't confess how many times I actually pulled over on the side of the road to check everything out....oh dear!I bought this, my husband had to prop it up a bit with a little burp cloth tucked underneath to position it correctly, but other than that it works great.  I love it, I can see her very clearly (the mirror is bigger than most) and the music is not too annoying.Great purchase!	
1. 	100% cotton and good size for homemade baby wipe use. They do stain but can be bleached.  Definitely worth the price...good quality!	
1. 	I get the question all the time: &#34;wow, I've never seen one that looks that comfy! Where did you get it?&#34;This is great for most shopping carts. I say most because there are some where the fit isn't quite right, but hey, we adjust and go with it. The main issue with fit is that sometimes the cover doesn't reach all the way to where I hold the cart so he can still get his hands on grub when it's not stretched out over it.I loved it when he was really little (e.g., 6 months) because the side pillows would help to keep him propped up and in the center of the seat. I still love it because it's comfortable and it has pockets in the back for anything you need (e.g., water bottle, pacifier, toys, shopping list, etc.) and it folds up with a velcro strap for easy carrying. A great product!!	
- 1	It's like pushing around and old fashion steel shopping cart full of watermelons. When the car seat is on it invades the second seat so my son can't lean back comfortably, also you can't hang a diaper bag on the handles without compromising the second seat or standing are. It's a heavy hunk a junk that is hard to fold and takes up my entire back seat, really regretting this purchase!	
- 1	When you think of a rattle you think of that annoying noise...right? Well you are not gonna hear that here. As it is a great product it should have been put together better. The foot &#34;rattle&#34; kept falling off and he got really bored of this product after 2 days. There must be something better then these.	
1. 	After having this product for 8 months of my daughter's life I'd say I have used and still use every product except the medicine syringe, as it didn't contain enough suction to hold any medicine. The case is too bulky really for a diaper bag, I have never needed all these products on the go, but it does get a lot of use by the changing station. I'm pleased with the kit overall and would say 11 out of the 12 products being of use I'd rate it 5 stars nevertheless.	
- 1	Not sure why there are so many good reviews, this blanket is not soft at all!!!  In fact, it's feels quite scratchy.  I gave it 2 stars for at least it's a decent size blanket.	
1. 	I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter.  Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-).  One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden.  But overall, this is a really great invention.	
1. 	This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.	
1. 	when i saw reviews online that said it was a pain to adjust to fit the first time, i was a little leary of getting it but then i tried it and it was VERY easy.  of course you'll need someone to help but it can be done quickly.  took about 5 minutes if that.  its great for when they are fussy and want to be held all the time.  my sister love it because she can carry her neice and do what needs to be done around the house.  i use it everywhere i go.  if i walk to get coffee, i take it because its easier to get around in a store without a stroller.  always use it in the grocery store.  i hate putting her in the baby seats that are attached to the carts.  and she is still too little to sit up in the cart so the sniggli works wonders!  would recommend it to everyone	
1. 	This is an awesome item!  It helped my colicky baby sleep much better!  Now that she is over the colic, she still loves the swaddle me blankets.  It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket, because she can't squirm out of it.  She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.  She wakes up several times during the night without this, but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me, she sleeps 8 to 10 hours, and she is five months old!  It's a wonderful product and I don't know what we would do without it.	
- 1	Only comes with one so don't drop it!! I ordered some from Tommie Tippee (I think that's right) and they come in a pack of 2 and they are much better built.	
- 1	I just received my sleep sack that I was planning to use for my 3-month-old daughter.  The side seams are badly twisted on both sides, and the sack does not lie flat.  It looks like it was either sewn improperly or washed or dried at high heat.  Other reviewers stated that items made in certain countries were of lesser quality.  The one I received was made in India.  These have gotten such great reviews, and I really don't want to use a polyester sleep sack, so I plan to order another one in the hopes that the next one won't be defective.UPDATE: I just received a second sleep sack after sending the first one back.  I now know that the first sack sent to me had been washed and/or dried improperly and then returned.  It was about half the size of the new replacement, and came with no instructions or tags.  The wool on the inside was also pilly.  The reason the seams were all twisted and wavy was because the garment had shrunk but the seams hadn't.  There was no way it would still fit my baby at two years old.The new one was quite large and laid flat, and came with a pretty mesh bag as well as instructions for use.  Unfortunately my baby hasn't been weaned from swaddling so I haven't gotten any use out of it yet.  I tried putting her down for her nap in the sleep sack and she wouldn't stop crying.  I gave up and swaddled her instead.  I will update this once we're able to wean her from swaddling (hopefully soon).  I will also be very careful about how I wash and dry it, since I know what will happen if I do it wrong.	
1. 	I use this every day to keep my pumped breast milk cold at work.  Excellent product.  Thick plastic that does not warp once liquid freezes.  No leaking.  Everything from Medela is great.	
1. 	My son is 4-months old and the sleepsacks I had were all way too thick and warm for the summer. This cotton sleepsack is think, breathable and soft for him to wear in the summer to bed and for naps.	
1. 	We use these bath toys inside and outside of the bathtub :- ) they are very well done, good quality and grab your Childs attention of you are looking for this kind of activity in the bath tub. They also hold up pretty well. All and all, I would recommend this set.	
- 1	I bought this monitor from Walmart.com and it broke after a week. Since I didn't save the original packing they won't take it back.  So disappointed, I used to have good luck with v-tech products.	
1. 	Seems to help with my son's colic. Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it. Air will flow through the nipple. We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving.	
1. 	Unlike the previous review we loved these bottles, and yes we have a baby that spits up alot and the bottles do make the difference. Our son loves these bottles, they help on the gas and the spitting up and he is able to latch on and drink with no major effort. We also love having a different choice of nipple sizes. Both of my children were given ceral bottles at young ages by there doctors and with my first we had to poke hole in the nipple and hope it worked. With my son we are able to buy stage 2 nipples and not owrry about him getting too much formula too fast. These are wonderful	
- 1	I was so disappointed in this monitor. If you want to put the parent unit in sleep mode it turns the sound off and then it only activates when a sound is made. It also has an alarm that goes off when the baby cries (as if you couldn't figure it out on your own from the actual crying.) It fails mostly because you can only choose between beeping or vibrating, you can't turn it off. As if the crying wasn't enough now you have to listen to the monitor beeping or vibrating at you. Impossible if you let your little one cry it out. When we first got it. The sensitivity was too high and the fan in his room was setting it off so we turned it down a little. Then it was the air conditioning setting it off every time it kicked on. That was a fun night... So we turned the sensitivity down some more. Now I can hear him crying in his room before the monitor goes off. Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this product. We went with the motorola and are very happy. You can turn off the screen and still hear. There's no stupid alarm and the picture quality is great!	
1. 	i couldn't make up my mind about which rearseat mirror to get, so i ordered a few at once to try.  this was the winner.  we have a jeep, with the rear facing carseat in the center of the backseat, this was the only mirror i could position off the back drivers side passenger headrest and get a good angle to the middle of the backseat where the carseat was.  the adjustability is great with it, a much better system than the others had, if they had one at all.minus 1 star because i think the mirror could be slightly larger, or slightly magnified.  my eyes aren't that bad off, but you have to look up for a good long second to focus and really get a good look at babies face	
- 1	I bought this for my son to use when laying on his back.  He has a pretty bad flat spot.  The pillow seems to raise his neck and head and leaves a gap between his shoulders and the floor.  My son seems pretty uncomfortable when laying his head on this.  I'm now trying to use it for tummy time, but it's not the best option.	
1. 	I got this playpen in the multi, because at the time it was the cheapest, and I really didn't care. Now, it is a little garish, but at the same time I actually really like it-it's bright, sturdy, and is about  1 1/2 in. taller and 3 in. longer than my Graco pack and play. I like how the ends are solid, sometimes my 11 month old isn't exactly crazy about being in the playpen, but if she sees me walk away, it gets worse. The solid ends allow me to sit in the same room, but out of sight, which lets my daughter play by herself longer. I gave it 5 stars, because I have yet to find any flaws with it. Granted, it isn't as elegant? as my pack and play, but as already stated, that wasn't important to me. So far, it is sturdy, sets up quickly and easily, and I like that it comes with a storage bag, which as yet I haven't tried, but since that is what it came in, I know that it fits. The pocket on one end is a good place to store the bag. I have been very satisfied with this purchase, and I would buy it again. Oh, and the picture shows it having the ends taller and curved, but they aren't, all 4 sides are the same height.Update:I have used the storage bag twice, and it is very easy to get in the bag, and the handles make it easy to carry-I'm liking it better than my Pack and Play!	
1. 	My daughter loves this stool. Its great for use in the bathroom in front of the sink. Also light enough for my daughter to move around.	
- 1	I bought this because of the reviews and the name.  I had never seen it in person and if I had I would have never bought it.  I have a boy and the pee shield is very low.  When we first bought it he refused to use it so we just hung onto it. He's had a set back with potty training and I decided to take it out one more try to give it a try.  He used it.  He peed. All. Over. The. Floor.  Luckily I was standing right there to help him, how shall I say-direct-him where he need to go.  But it was too late, he peed down the front of the seat right where I needed to pick it up which mean I either clean it before I empty as well as after I empty it or I get pee on my hand.This seat doesn't have the high seat like the other one does but I think all that will do is cause them to lean back and have a bigger chance of accidents.The non-skid bottom is nice but I don't know of any potty chairs that don't have them.  Not having a lid is a good-bad thing.  We have an extremely small bathroom which means we also need a stool for him to reach the sink, if it had a lid it would take care of having the extra item in the small space.  However, having a lid is just one more step a child has to do when they are bouncing around trying not to go.The potty seat came in an unsealed, plain plastic bag in a the Amazon box only, it did not come in the Babybjorn potty chair box.  I couldn't help but wonder if I received a returned item.	
1. 	First of all, when I read the ingredients on the package I went yuck. But the more I looked at them, I realized that it wasn't actually bad at all - it was actually excellent! The main tooth decay ingredient is Xylitol. Check out the wiki page on this to get a better feel for how good this sugar alcohol is. It has all kinds of studies indicating that it can help tooth decay significantly and has no known toxicity issues. The sugar alcohol is derived from trees and seems very safe.This is important. My kids are not old enough to realize that they can't swallow the toothpaste and I still need to keep their teeth clean ...As a side note, they use Xylitol in chewing gum. In fact it is in many of the more expensive chewing gum brands that promote healthy teeth.This is the only beginner toothpaste we use in our house. Check out the wiki page on Xylitol  and I can say pretty confidently that you will use this as your only toothpaste with kids that may swallow their toothpaste.Other than the Xylitol, the rest of the ingredients are pretty innocuous and are claimed to be all natural. So there you are.Thanks!!	
- 1	Our Graco stroller is a regular stroller, nothing fancy. This netting is nowhere even close of big enough to fit it.	
1. 	I'm a first time mom and was confused when I bought a pretty expensive stroller and the sun always hit my daughter's face.  It got to the point where I actually stopped taking her out for walks because I could see she was getting annoyed with the sun...and who could blame her.  I bought her two hats and even sunglasses, but they all wound up on the ground.  So I did some research and found this and it works great! It doesn't work on my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller, but works very well with the other one.  You just tie it on, shape it, and that's it.  It's flexible too, so when I stuff my strolled in the closet, I just bend the shade back and when I'm ready to use it...it just pops back into place.  This is really wonderful; I am so happy I found it.UPDATE:  Rain, sun, or wind...this thing is still in excellent shape and works great.  Anytime I see a baby in a stroller squinting because of the sun, I tell mom or dad to buy one of these from amazon.  I was literally in traffic one day and I saw a baby that could've really used one of these, so I made a u-turn, rolled my window down and told mom to buy one of these...that's how well it works!	
- 1	I wanted something to protect the padding on the sleep surface, something easily washable with a reflux baby.This was the only thing I could find for it so I ordered it.The only good thing about this sheet is it fits the Travel Lite but it almost fits it a little too well - it is a little too hard to get on and off!  (I do put a thin waterproof absorbent pad underneath for spit up.) I understand you want sheets snug, but wow.It's scratchy and horrible feeling, plus our daughter's face breaks out every time we use it.Ugh, it's just horrible really!I learned that changing table pad covers work PERFECTLY with the Travel Lite!  We use soft velour changing pad covers with a thin waterproof pad underneath it for spit up. and know she is super cozy and not on a scratchy surface.  Now we don't even use this at all unless absolutely necessary.  I wish I had read reviews before that would have mentioned using a changing pad cover!  I haven't tried using a king size pillowcase yet, but I've heard they also fit nicely and could see how they would!Don't bother with this!	
- 1	I purchased these and thought I would use them in the hospital on delivery day...too bad they were way too big, and just fell off of my baby. Small socks worked better than anything else. Save your money.	
1. 	My strictly bottle fed 11 month old has used these bottles from day one and has done fine with them. I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child. I'm really liking what I'm reading about the Dr. Brown's, but will possibly try a couple other brands as well. I'm realizing that saving tons of money isn't always what's best for my daughter. We'll see!	
1. 	I would actually rate this about 3.5 stars.Pros:  The white portion of the product is soft and flexible, so if your child falls into it, it's going to hurt LESS than hitting the hard metal faucet.  I'm not saying it's not going to hurt at all, just less chance of a more serious cut or injury.The water fans out in a waterfall, so your child can sit further back from the faucet and still be able to play with the water as the tub fills.Cons:  The resevoir for the bubble bath sometimes leaks, from the outlet where it's supposed to come out, but occasionally around the sides too.  Not enough leakage to make a big mess while the Boon Flo is on your faucet.  If you want to remove it for your own bathtime, however, the flip-top where you pour in the liquid has a VERY loose seal, so you have to be careful where you store the Boon Flo when not in use, as it will leak.Also, I usually only get two or 3 bubble baths out of how much liquid the resevoir holds before I have to refill it.  Maybe my brand of bubble bath doesn't suds as much as others.Overall, not bad.  My daughter loves the waterfall, but the bubble bath dispenser could be better designed.	
1. 	I am surprised that all reviews are not all 5 stars. This sunshade is perfect for my Graco Stroller (Travel System).  I read some reviews that it is too much work, NOT AT ALL. You just tie it to the stroller and that is it. Yes, you have to take it down, but really it only takes 1 minute and that is it! I rather take the time (which really is not much at all) to put it on the stroller and take it down so my son can be protected from the Sun. I am so glad I purchased this. Simple, easy to put on, and your baby IS protected and shaded. :)	
- 1	we got this holder along with the car seat and its flimsy. the cup holder tilts outward away from seat and falls off easily. not impressed.	
1. 	This is the best bib we've found. Highly recommended, but even with regular washing you'll want to replace it every 6-9 months as it grows mold inside the seams. We just bought three more since they are still a great deal if you have to replace them every 6-9 months. Very happy.	
1. 	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.	
- 1	Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it.Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.	
- 1	I purchased these in size two to use on both my 14.5 pound 3 month old daughter and my 30 pound 2.5 year old daughter. First, the good: they seem like they are constructed well. The cotton is soft and fluffs up nicely after being washed and dried several times. The bad: these are waaaaaay too long for both of my girls... Even the 2.5 year old at the top of the weight limit, and she's long and lean. They are also far too narrow, even on my 14 pound 3 month old... Forget about trying to snappi/pin these on according to the instructions on the package, or using any method for that matter. They're too narrow to pin, and too long to work well just trifolded with a cover. They do work trifolded... But only if you are okay with folding 6-8 inches down and having a really bulky and lumpy diaper.	
- 1	Unless you start using one of these when your baby is a newborn, they probably will not like it.  The baby is SOOO close to your body it almost feels like neither of you can breathe.  I  had my husband try it on his back and the baby looked so uncomfortable.  I would not recommend this for the price.  I ended up returning mine.	
- 1	No doubt this is a great seat, but it isn't made for infants, no matter what the description says. Even in its most inclined position, it isn't comfortable, legs are at a 90 degrees angle which is horrible for a newborn, and the baby's head is never well supported.Better buy a Maxi Cosi or an other infant seat !	
1. 	This is a great starter kit. It comes with plenty of bottles and extra nipples. Prior to these we used Dr Brown bottles. Everyone we knew used those and raved about the Dr Brown bottles. I thought they were great but they were tedious to clean. It had a bunch of parts and little nooks and crannies to clean. These playtex were a lot easier and faster to clean and gave me great results. Babies fussiness did not change and it was like we never took him out of the Dr Brown bottles. The way the bottle is shaped is great too. It makes it easier holding the bottle too. Overall I think these are great bottles compared to the Dr Brown ones.	
1. 	These are adorable but were a little smaller then I expected them to be.  EIther way, my son loves them and has enjoyed them in the tub!	
- 1	Not at all thrilled with this. I love the idea but the potty seat doesn't sit well on the actual toilet seat and doesn't seem very steady or secure. I ended up buying something else after being disappointed by this. Save your money!	
- 1	After trial and error with soothing and trying to get my baby down for naps and bedtime without crying and upset, I recently purchased the Sleep Sheep on the Go.  Reviews had stated that the regular one was a bit large and we didn't feel we needed the heartbeat for my 16 month old.  We love the sounds although the Whale recording is a short loop and not as good as we had hoped.  The problem is that the one we received does not shut off automatically at the 23 or 45 minute intervalls.  It also stopped working altogether and this happened the same day it arrived.  I am requesting a replacement but we are disappointed in its workmanship as my baby just loves her Sleep Sheep!	
- 1	This does not work with the Britax Advocate. The straps are too long and it doesn't tighten enough. It would work if it was an actual suitcase but not a carryon type suitcase. You can save yourself the money and just buy a metal ring. We used that to attach the latch and tether strap. I used a ring off an old purse. Save your money and buy a metal ring.	
- 1	Dont use silicone use natural rubber for your baby. I use Nuk rubber Orthodonic nipples because they are natural and work perfectly.	
1. 	I bought this for my son, he is 12 months old and he is always messing up his cloths when he eats :) This really helps cut down on the mess! I love that its waterproof and has long sleeves. Also it is big enough to grow with him! The only thing that I wish were different is the tie in the back, they should have made them snaps instead.	
1. 	When we bought this, I thought of it as a luxury item, because you don't really need to sterilize that much, but we never use the dishwasher and I thought it would be easier and safer than boiling water.  Turns out that we were diagnosed with thrush and had to sterilize many times a day.  So glad to have had this!!! Some have complained about the condensation but this is really just the very fine mist of the boiled water on the items.  Shows it's working.. just rinse it off with water and put the items in the drying rack.	
- 1	I got this for my 1 year old son, in order to get the water out he has to bite on a specific area of the straw so its not the easiest to use. On the plus sode it does not spill when dropped	
- 1	I started my daughter out on the Nuby Super Straw Easy Grippers and I think she was so accustomed to those, that this was too difficult for her to use.  Maybe if I started her out on this, she wouldn't have had such an issue.	
- 1	No matter what we tried, we could not get these bowls to stick or stay stuck. These bowls were a complete waste of money.They do work as regular bowls, of course, and I like that they have lids, so I did give them one star. But because they are advertised as stay put suction bowls...they only get that one star.	
1. 	That's how comfy this little seat is! My 4-year old hasn't moved her little butt out of this thing since we got it earlier today, and I don't blame her.  The soft cushy foam is so comfortable, but not to the point where you sink down into it - it's very sturdy.  This fits perfectly on any standard kitchen chair and I love that there is enough 'grip' to the bottom of it that it does not slide at all when she gets in and out of the seat.This is exactly what we needed in moving her from a high chair to a booster seat at the kitchen table - the right height and width (with room to spare and grow into).  It's not heavy or clunky - my daughter is easily able to carry this around when she wants to - it would be perfect to take to any restaurant or the movie theater.The surface is easily cleaned - just some warm water and a sponge, a little dish soap if needed.  Unlike with some foam/plastic products there was no strong 'plasticky' smell when I opened the box, which made me very happy.  Overall we love this product - and it's a fantastic price!	
1. 	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.  We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail...one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.Here's what we love about this pail...*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!! (we wrap them nice and tight)*we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!!*holds the odor in nicely! (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol)*easy one-hand use*impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pailEvery now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.  Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.  We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.	
1. 	This is a great nursing cover. It covers well and the weighted bottoms keep it down. I also like how you can see baby to help latch or relatch. Very soft and looks nice too.	
1. 	I thought baby bottles were pretty basic, but the improvements Playtex has made do seem to make a difference.  When Sarah, my daughter, recently gave birth, she received an earful of advice from well-meaning friends and relatives who were also new moms.  Many used and recommended Playtex VentAire baby bottles.  Sarah listened, starting out with the VentAire newborn bottle gift set (wide bottles & nipples).  She also has these standard bottles (slimmer bottle/nipples).  At this point in time, mom and baby seem to prefer wider ones.  Sarah finds them easier to clean; baby likes the nipple shape better.  That preference will probably change as baby gets older and wants to hold a slimmer bottle having a faster flow of milk.Of course, that wasn't the only advice that went along with VentAire bottles.  Sarah was warned they might leak if improperly tightened (don't overdo the bottoms), or if the pieces were wet while assembling (particularly the vent area).  She has never put them in the dishwasher (more motherly advice) even though Playtex information says pieces are top-rack dishwasher safe.  As a result, the bottles work well and baby rarely has spit-up, burping or gas problems.  Mom and baby are happy.	
1. 	This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child. My 8 year old cannot lift it.  But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it. It will not topple over as this is impossible. I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street. Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it. But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone. It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it.	
1. 	best bottles for your money these old school bottles are not expensive and work better than plastic all the time	
- 1	I wanted to return it because in the description it said the large size was larger than it actually was.  I was trying to fit a training toilet seat in a bag, and this one did not work for the size I needed.	
- 1	These pads are definitely due for some revamping. When women can buy nearly customized bras based on chest width and cup size, it's ridiculous to have a one pad fits all type of product. I have read other reviews and women complain about washable/reusable pads, but after trying everything out there, I would argue that washable pads:*fit better*look better from the outside (these look like you're stuffing with Kleenex)*are a lot easier to put back in one-handed while holding a baby - no messing around with annoying adhesives and strange folds in the materialDisposable do tend to be better for women who leak a lot, but before settling on these pads, try both. I bought every kind out there, both reusable and disposable, and found some I swear by from Mimi Maternity. They fit well, aren't noticable, and won't leak.	
1. 	Love it.  Fits comfortably around my baby's neck, no itchy areas.  Keeps him relatively clean.  Washes easily in the sink after each meal.	
1. 	My daughter has been showing definite interest in going potty.  Based on the other reviews, I purchased the Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up and both my daughter and I are super happy with it.  We just started introducing her to the potty last week, and so far, so good.  No, she hasn't actually had any bodily functions (short of an epic toot) yet, but she can set it up on the potty, climb up on her own (my hand is hovering behind her to make sure I'd catch her if she were to slip), turn and sit, and then come back down after we've watched part of the episode of Daniel Tiger using the potty (which I highly recommend doing!!).Hubs assembled it and it did not take him long.  It's made of plastic, so it's not super heavy and could very well topple if my kid were to lean too much to one side; but, since I'm sitting on the floor in front of her, I doubt that's going to happen right now.  We've tried it both on the seat (where it fits much better and doesn't wiggle around too much), as well as on the rim itself (it wiggles more, but even then it's not likely to tip over).Hoping she actually goes in it pretty soon!!	
- 1	This cup would be great, except for the fact it is so hard to clean all the little parts, and then to put it back together.  It definitely wasn't worth the money. I've since purchased other brands with straws that are much easier to clean and easier for my child to use.	
1. 	I was pulling my hair out looking for baby proofing stuff that wouldn't require a hardware install. These are perfect for my 50 plasma. Just a note, because I didn't see it in any of the other reviews... You have to pull the clips open to insert the plastic strap. The instruction page that comes with them doesn't mention how you're supposed to join the clips and it took me a bit of puzzling and trying to thread the strap before I realized you need to snap them open. Maybe I am just slow today, but there it is if anyone is wondering! I will absolutely recommend and buy these again.	
1. 	Yes, sometimes it overheats the bottle if you don't take it out as soon as it's done, but it gets the job done quickly and easily.  And at this price, I was able to buy a warmer for both grandparents' houses.	
1. 	He sleeps like a rock in this. Not sure if it's just him or the sleep sack but he is now 10 weeks old and sleeping 12 hours straight a night. I'm nervous to wean him off this when he's older :)	
1. 	Great bath tub and my toddler is 3 now and we are still using it.Yes, this is  a bit more expensive than some other models and brands, but you really get what you pay for.The fact that we are still using it after 3 years, that alone is worth the price.We have given this product along with a bottle of Argan oil (I love the brand Vitaville) to many of my girlfriends for baby shower.	
1. 	This is a genius product, we always have one of those right on top of our changing pad (we still use a changing pad cover of course) and we also use it on the go when we change our baby outside. This disposable pad saved us lots of trouble in those times when accidents happen, it is just does not let anything go through it so the underlying changing pad remains clean, just finish the change and throw this paper away. We keep using the disposable paper until it gets dirty and only then do we throw it away, so that we do not use too many of them, but when an accident happens at 3 in the morning these are a saver!	
1. 	Okay, I'm a huge geek and I went to baby stores and tried LOTS of carriers on (with my baby in them). We have two Snuglis (one a hand-me-down and the other for the hubby around the house) but this is my carrier of choice.Make sure to read the instructions and adjust the back support properly (*this may take a while to get right, but you'll feel the difference*) and you'll have a lot less back pressure than with other soft carriers.My baby loves this carrier- especially now that he can face forward in it.  I also recommend the Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover to keep baby warm and dry in inclement weather.	
- 1	I was so anxious to buy these because I wanted high quality bottles for my baby. However, after using it a couple of times I saw that most of what my baby was drinking was leaking out and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out. The cap was on fine, the nipple fit also but the milk managed to leak somehow.	
- 1	Fiddly, way overpriced for what is just a piece of material. Try wrapping this long piece of cloth around yourself, and then getting an impatient baby into it... and you have to tie it really tight for it to give sufficient support to the head, with the result that its too tight around their little legs. Or - like the lady in the photo - you have to keep holding their head, which sort of defeats the purpose.It also can make them way too warm. Maybe that is OK for European winters, but not otherwise.I am getting rid of mine (and I see that lots of people are doing likewise) and now using a rucksack-style carrier - MUCH less hassle.	
1. 	I purchased these for my 11 months old grand daughter to use in our water table outside, pool and bath. She loved them. They are so colorful and she loved squesing the water out at her cousins. Her older cousins ages 7 to 15 had just as much fun with them as her. They all float and seem to call for you to play with them. They also have a tecture that seemed to please my grand baby as well. I would recommend this to my friends.	
1. 	I received this as a gift and I'm going to buy it for every expectant mother I know.  We attached this right to the side of the changing table that came with our pack and play and it holds everything you could possibly need while changing your baby.  We hated the thought of having diapers and supplies just laying around downstairs, but were not about to run upstairs to the nursery every time we needed to change the baby.  This solved the problem...everything is right at our fingertips for diaper changes.  It also keeps our dog from going after diapers!	
- 1	we got this holder along with the car seat and its flimsy. the cup holder tilts outward away from seat and falls off easily. not impressed.	
- 1	My baby is due in five months.  But I am on a roll getting all the things ready for the nursery. Wanted to have extra time to select the most efficient, quality and reasonably-priced things. So, I did a bit of digging (I am a public interest lawyer, so digging is second nature to me) and discovered that about 85% of all baby and children's stuff is treated with carcinogenic and neuro-toxic chemicals, flame retardants PBDE and Chlorinated Tris to name just a few of the poisons they put into our baby stuff.  This Rock n Play is treated with flame retardants.  So, this thing would be perfect for someone who chain-smokes as they rock their baby to sleep.  I am not planning on bringing poison into my home and keeping my baby on it.  Pretty upsetting if you think about what they are doing to the people: poisoning us right in the crib... literally! The least I would expect the retailers to do is to put a warning label up front on all products treated with this stuff apprising the public of the carcinogenic, neuro-toxic and endocrine disruptive properties of what they sell. The information about the flame-retarding treatment is only found on the label of this Rock n Play.	
- 1	I'm sure this jumper is a hit among other babies, but not mine. It was way to overstimulating for my son. He would spend about 5 minutes in it before he would start crying to get out. I tried turning off the music, but he found the toys boring. He would often get his finger pinched on the elephant and like other parents said, it seems like the toy is made more for parents.  Also, after doing a lot of research about jumpers in general,  I found that it can be harmful for a child to jump before they are developmentally ready.  If you do purchase this device, in my opinion I would limit the time your child is in it to just a few minutes a day. We got rid of ours soon after purchasing.	
- 1	I was recommended this nursing pillow by a few moms over the Boppy pillow.  I tried to use it 2 or 3 times and really didn't like it.  It's too stiff and I could never get my baby into a comfortable position.  I ended up buying a Boppy instead and was much happier with that purchase. And the Boppy seems to have more uses beyond feeding (it's great for getting your arms into a comfortable position when holding the baby and great to prop the baby up when lying down).  My daughter is now 18 months and she still uses the Boppy to lounge on.	
- 1	The only nasal aspirator that works well is the one that comes home with the baby from the hospital. I have no idea where you can buy those, but they are most effective.	
1. 	love the bright colors, easy to match up with what my boy is wearing. these bibs really do absorb spit up and drool, so they are very effective. i've thrown them in the clothes dryer on a cool setting and they've been fine. the reason for only 4 stars - the velcro could be more skin-friendly and gentle. do be sure to fasten these before you wash them or you'll ruin whatever else is in the load. overall i would reccommend and buy these again.	
1. 	These bottles work well. They do their job, as designed, and reduce gas. In fact I very often try to burp my baby for several minutes and nothing happens. Spit up is greatly reduced as well.There are a lot of of parts, but they are easy to clean, albeit a bit tedious (but easier than some other bottles). I typically wash them by hand and I'm a little leery of washing them by dishwasher, I'm not sure if they'll get thoroughly clean if I leave the bottom assembled and I don't want to fish the small parts off the bottom of the dishwasher if I disassemble them.The slow nipples seemed to work best for my son. The fast made him sputter and make a mess. (Be sure to note which nipples you are using, the speed is imprinted on the nipple, and is easy to overlook).Overall, I like these bottles very much. They work well, and are more affordable compared to some of the other high end bottles.	
1. 	I love this product.  It works great.  I would recommend purchasing 2 to have the maximum storage ability.  Great to heat the bottles up in as well.  Be careful not to over fill the bottles.  Leave room for the milk to expand in the freezing process or the bottles will split.	
- 1	If all you want to hear is static, buy this monitor.  Everything interferes with it.  One of the worst baby products we've purchased	
1. 	well, i purchased this at a local store despite erroneous reviews found here.  its a great device, at first it seemed wasteful since i could just microwave some water (3 minutes), then soak the bottle until it warmed up (3 more minutes) but now i can just pop in a bottle and the whole thing is done in under 3 minutes.  if youve got an extra $40 i recommend it.	
1. 	I've used these sleep sacks with both of my kids, each born at complete opposite times of the year as the other, and I love them.  They do get a little bunched up sometimes but nothing that I've constituted as dangerous and they keep the kids warm without getting in the way.  The only thing I wish is that they made a long sleeved version so I didn't have to put on a long-sleeved onesie to keep my kids' arms warm.	
1. 	I love the coverage these bibs provide, especially on the shoulders. They are also easy to rinse and reuse; laundering is only needed after a few uses. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the neck does not fit well enough on my son to keep all the food and moisture from getting onto the tops of his shirts. If I put an absorbent bib underneath, though, he is usually dry and clean at the end of a meal.	
1. 	We have 2 twin boys who are 20 months old. They used to use an old wooden highchair at grandmas, but there was only one and it was falling apart. She bought these because they could work for my niece (3 years old) without the back and it could work with my 20 month olds as a highcahir. This chair is so convinent. The snap in tray is great, just like my Aquarium chair at home! It is also nice that it adjusts to the tray can rest on the table. I love that its VERY easy to fold and carry. My boys love sitting in it, and its SUPER easy to clean. We would buy one for restaurants, but we just use a floppy seat, less room and we need ALL the room with twins. I love this booster and its perfect for grandmas, houses with limited space, for going out to eat, or just instead of a highchair if you have multiple children! We love this chair, and would never use another one for grandmas.	
1. 	Our baby is over 6 months and we still use these nipples.  When I'm not at work she is breast fed.  This slow flow nipple helps her work at getting the milk similar to when she's nursing.	
- 1	This stroller has good storage space but after that my liking it ends. It's really large and bulky. To fit it in our trunk we had to take the seats off. Really was more of a pain than anything. We ended up selling it to get a City Mini stroller instead.	
- 1	This gate is too flimsy for our baby, we returned it and ordered the more expensive metal gate by another maker.  I hope it works out better.  Also after seeing the quality of this gate/play yard, my wife and I could not believe it cost just under 100 bucks!  Seriously, this thing should be about $29 MAX!	
- 1	I had to return this because the music was so off key.  Visually, it is perfect and not scary like some jack in the boxes.  The little bear is very cute and soft to touch. When you turn the crank, the mechanical parts move smoothly. It's too bad that the same care was not used to be sure that the music was pleasant to hear.  If a jack in the box has music that is unpleasant, it pretty much defeats the purpose of having it, so all the other positives about the toy are moot.	
- 1	This seat is TINY! I opened up the box, put it together and thought, oh, is this one of the play doll seats? Oops, I thought it was for a baby! My daughter isnt all that big, she barely fits in it. She looks ridiculous sitting in it. It looks like a giant baby sitting in a dollhouse seat :) The backrest barely goes to the middle of her back. She is 16 months old, 30, I dont think you could fit a toddler in it. Its best for 6 months and under IF your baby is small for their size and can sit by themselves. Yes, its inexpensive, like they always say, you get what you pay for!  I will keep it to take to restaurants, and get a regular sized one for the kitchen table. Also, the toy that attaches just easily pops right off, so, it gets tossed to the floor right away! No suprise, though, there is a giant baby sitting in the seat!!!	
- 1	My baby is not even 6 months old and having read the reviews about it not being in proportion I bought the 12 month size. It STILL does not fit!! The legs barely cover his knees, and he is a small baby, 40th percentile in height. Based on other reviews I thought it would be adorable for his winter christening, but after receiving it I went with a traditional christening jumper instead. I highly recommend the Laura Ashley christening jumper with short sleeves and long pants, its really really cute. Do not waste time with this like I did, having a baby at home who has time to waste on making returns??	
- 1	The materials used to make these attractive bowls stinks! It comes out of the dishwasher with white crust that won't come off. When I washed the first bowl I thought it was a fluke and even tried to scrape of the stuff (didn't work). Then I realized it happened with all three bowls. I've thrown them away because now they're ugly!	
1. 	This protector does the job on preventing dents in leather seats.Remember that these days any type of professional is afraid of a lawsuit, and do not want to use any type of aftermarket product that could interfere with their professional installation. That is why no one will approve these mats, or even cupholders on strollers anymore!!!As a carseat safety fanatic, and being pretty educated on carseat installations I felt confident that I could make a decision if this was inhibiting a proper installation. I see no problems. To be sure the carseat is strapped in super tight, I sit in it as I pull the straps. It doesn't budge one centimeter left or right, or front to back.This saver was easy to put in the car, and did not need to be adjusted a million times as I tightened in the carseat using LATCH & tether (we use the Britax Marathon). A previous saver bunched and made installation impossible, but this one is very thin, firm and stays put. The add on back was the perfect height, and did not block the tether strap in our F150. It also stayed upright as I put the carseat into place.This blends in nicely with our black seats and looks good. It's available in three colors - black, tan, and grey. Let's face it - if you're interested in this product it's because you care how things will look long term!This saver is a great combo of safety and function. While it may not perform perfectly with every single carseat/car combination - if your seat is moving more than an inch in any direction it's not installed correctly whether you are using seat saver or not!	
1. 	Works well - can easily see baby day or night. I have not had issues with picking up other people's monitor signals even in our big apartment building.	
1. 	We use these bags for throwing away poopy diapers in our kitchen lid top trash can. The bag works as you expect; make sure to tie the handles so that there is no opening in the bag. If you cost compare b/w having a diaper genie and its refill bags vs these sassy bags, this might be a cheaper alternative. Plus these bags can go in any trash cans.	
- 1	I gave the review 4 stars for a great product.  However, I subtracted a star because the small is too small for our 5 months old, weighs 13 lbs and 23 inches long (small for his age).  He can't stretch his legs out and looks very uncomfortable.  Halo does not make a swaddle blanket larger than small (took off another star for that).  I'm lucky that we were able to last as long as we did.  My friend's kids sized out at 3 months.  Yikes!	
- 1	So I made my own pumping bra by just cutting holes in a sports bra. It worked great with the shields that separate from the connector. I'd put the shield in. Point the end through the hole, then connect the connector on the outside. Perfect.But this one piece contraption doesn't work like that at all. Not sure how I'd even adapt a bra to work with it. I'd have given it one star, but if you're only doing one side, it works great. So I guess it just depends on how you want to use it.	
- 1	The thermometer function in this tub worked for about 5 baths, not it is completely out of order and alarm starts to sound at temperature 85 (measured with another thermometer) showing that it is over a 100.Also, we bought this for a new born and it was rather uncomfortable in the beginning because he would slide all over the place...now that he is 2 month it's already getting small for him...would not recommend this product.	
1. 	This is a great product! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones. You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand! I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while' if the bag is very full, I may notice a slight smell.  But it is truly worth buying! I love mine!	
1. 	My little one is intrigued by this mobile!  He stares and smiles at it!  I love the variety of colors and prints.  I like that it's interchangeable so baby stays entertained.  Great product for the price!	
- 1	Okay so first and foremost, any wrap style carrier is a PAIN. There is an insane amount of fabric (this thing is LONG) that you have to wrap around yourself. It's SUCH a pain when you're going to the grocery store or whatever, trying to keep the fabric off the dirty ground. It's simply inconvenient. It's so much to deal with when all you want to do is run into the store with your baby attached to you.Secondly, my little one screamed every time I tried to put her in this. 4 out of 5 times she simply would not have it. SOMEtimes she would be okay, but always kinda fussy. She's just not a &#34;cuddly&#34; baby personality (some babies are, some aren't) so she HATED the wrap thing. She loves buckle carriers like the Bjorn and the Ergo, but she hates the Boba.I would have given it one star, but the Ocean pattern is really pretty, and my back never hurt when I had her in this--it was very comfortable. But just not worth it to me for the inconvenience and the fussiness.	
1. 	My son needed sheeting options for his new toddler mattress and I am not into cars and trucks.  I prefer a a more modern aesthetic.  This print is fabulous and I love the deep pockets.  We have a thick organic mattress, so deep pockets are essential.  The sheet is soft and comfy, not as soft as luxurious Egyptian sheets but soft enough.So why 4 stars?  I finally made it out to Target this week (hard to do with two toddlers) and this exact same sheet and print is only $9.99 there.  I feel ripped off but I guess I got the convenience of online ordering from home in my [ASIN:B0045ZHISI Dixie Belle Lace Slip]].	
1. 	I was wanting something small and sturdy and this fits the bill! Some of the ones you find at Target that are plastic are very flimsy. This has rubber on the footings and on the top and is exactly what I was looking for.	
1. 	I have twin girls, When I would take them to a friends I would take my Bumbo seats/trays with me so I had somewhere to sit them to eat. Eventually they outgrew the Bumbos and I was either stuck holding them or had to drag my highchairs with me.Then a friend recommended these travel boosters when someone gave her one for Christmas.  I looked into them and decided to give them a try. I LOVE them.They are not teeny tiny when folded up but are small enough to keep one in a baby bag, or carry both in a stroller. Maybe the size of a large, flat lunch box? I leave them both in the car.They have a carry handle and are lightweight.It only took a few breaths to inflate the bottom portion of the seat and was just as easy to deflate when it was time to fold back up.It strapped to the chair easily and was quite stable. It wasn't wobbley or anything. It strapped in tight....granted it was a square chair seat and back. Ideal.It was way more sturdy than I thought it was going to be. The base even though inflated with air is sturdy, solid and firm. The frame is not flimsy at all and the straps are nylon.The only two things I noticed:The seat is smaller than I thought it would be. I use them with my 14mo old twins who are also on the small side and they fit perfect. Unless they hit a massive growth spurt and work their way up the percentage chart I could see them using this booster well after 2yrs old. But again, they are on the slender, small size.The second thing is the seat has small crevices which are a pain to clean smushed food out of. I took note of this after the first use and now cover the seat with a tea towel before strapping in the kiddos.Overall - LOVE. I will definitely recommend to a friend.	
1. 	Great product for those of us who want to feed our babies healthy, wholesome foods.  Great for home or travel.  No more lugging around premade, store bought baby food in breakable, glass jars!  You can feed your baby practically what ever you're having and grind it up fine enough for their precious little mouths to chew and swallow without the fear of them choking on something cut too big.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.  Would even work for those who are older and need their food pureed.  Can't say enough good things about this very valuable, easy to use, easy to clean, handy product.	
1. 	I read a lot of the other lower reviews about it being over priced, it's just a step stool or the grip is bad or it tips over...........Did you buy the same product?This is a clean looking great stool with good traction and easy to use for little onesIt's a trusted brand which I would highly recommendWhen you pay a little more you get better quality	
1. 	Made baby food a few times and works great! It's easy to use and easy to clean. I like how the blade is removable for easy food transfer. I like how it's small and compact for storing.	
1. 	I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all.	
1. 	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	I got this product and boiled it as directed to sterilize. I now have 10 bottles that are partially melted, same with the caps and the little inserts. Worst part of it is that I now have melted plastic on the bottom of my good pot!  I am still using the bottles to store milk, but not really happy with the product.	
1. 	Our changing table has curved ends, and it still fits nicely on the end! The top is the perfect size for a variety of diaper cases, and diapers fit nicely underneath. The little baskets on the side slide on and off, so you can choose whether or not to use them. It's made from a nice strong plastic, though it would break if dropped like most clear hard plastics, do. I highly recommend it if you need extra storage or shelf space!	
1. 	Boy, is this stuff great!  I can't use the oatmeal wash on my child because it broke his skin out in a rash and burned.  But the rest of their products are wonderful.  I particularly like the berry wash but they're all just great.  I bought some of the Baby Magic and spilled some on our dark blue carpet.  Believe it or not, it bleached the rug!  Now, just how gentle is THAT!  That's why I'm sticking to Gerber.	
1. 	I have had this high chair for 18 months now and I love it!  It has such great features that grow with your child.  The 3 positions of recline let you put your infant in the chair before they can actually sit up.  My son was not the best napper, but he very often fell asleep in this chair in the reclined position.  When he was a little older and started eating solid food, I really appreciated the removable tray cover.  When your toddler is covered in avocado slime or smearing butter in his hair, sometimes you need to just remove the food from reach.  The tray cover snaps off easily but leaves the tray in place until you can wipe off those little hands and let them down.  The tray also slides out a few inches to make room to lift baby out without catching his feet.  Another feature I like is the double sided cloth cover.  When it gets dirty, just flip it to the other side.  It washes beautifully... dries quickly and keeps it's color.  A friend of mine has the Peg Perego with the plastic wipable seat cover, but her son sweats too much when sitting on the plastic and there is always some sort of dried food caked in the corners.  You can't throw plastic in the washing machine.  I'm so glad I didn't spend twice as much for the Peg Perego!!	
- 1	The product I received is not the one pictured.  It has completely different colors and the starfish is funky ... which is NOT what I wanted.  However, it is quite a bit larger than I expected, which is a plus I guess.  But I am just disappointed I didn't get what was being advertised and cannot return it as it was a gift.  I know the baby won't care... but it really is ugly.	
- 1	I've had then wet bags for about 2 years now and they are just okay.  The drawstring gets stuck, so bad that I replaced the string with something slicker to try and alleviate the issue.  It's better, but still frustrating.  It's only one lays and pretty much equivalent to any plastic bag (ie shopping bag) but you can wash and reuse.I keep them in my diaper bag for dirty/wet cloth diapers and they only hold 2 diapers so they aren't really large, but a good size for this use.Online now to order another brand, because I'm tired of fighting the drawstring.	
1. 	This bib has changed mealtime for the better!I tried all sorts of fancy bibs because I thought this bib would be uncomfortable for my tiny baby.  Boy was I wrong!  After the initial fuss she now loves this bib.  She is comfortable and clean!  The bib catches every drop of food, water and her super staining vitamin drops!FYI Even this fantastic bib can't shield you from unexpected baby sneezes during feedings!I stained and ruined so many cloth bibs before I finally took this out of the box and now I only use this one!  Plus one in my car for on the go feedings!More colors please Baby Bjorn!	
- 1	I ordered these because I like my sons bib to match his outfit for the day and there just isnt a good enough selection of colors out there. They are way too thin and everything leaks through the bib and onto his shirt!	
- 1	After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub. It is bulky and a pain to use. Our daughter never liked it. Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need, in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.	
1. 	I wouldn't suggest using these to store milk for every pump session, because they are not reuseable, nor are they eco friendly. They are great for storage in the freezer though. They save room, they are easy to use, and I can write on them. They come with the attachment you need to hook the pump onto your bags.They tend to be hard to work with while pumping, they're supposed to stand up but they like to fold in half and dump milk all over me.But I would recommend them to anyone looking for freezer storage options.	
1. 	I hated the Avent pump, but loved the bottles. I hated the Medela bottles, but loved the pump. This solved my problem!I could used the Medela pump with the Avent bottles now. Perfect world.	
1. 	These are a great quality toddler bib and we have a lot - everyone should have them in both long and short sleeve!	
1. 	I've been using this gate for a couple of months now and it has been a great product. We used it first to create a barrier in the living room and now that my son is walking, we separated it into 3 pieces (1 to block electronics) and 2 other sets to block access to the kitchen when we are cooking.  Great product overall	
- 1	I rarely use these. I usually wait until I HAVE to to pull one out. They are too thin, I always end up using two. Bett	
1. 	This is a lot bigger than I anticipated. I know it says jumbo, but I just didn't realize how jumbo it would be. It works great though and holds a lot of stuffed animals!	
- 1	I bought this as a 2 pack with a coupon and got it for free, but it is not even worth it for free.  It is a terrible product.  The suction cups are constantly coming off and the whole shade falls off which does not seem too safe if baby is sitting under it.  I threw them right in the trash.  First years makes a better product.	
- 1	In actuality it measures 3 inches shorter in length than the package promises. (34 vs 37 inches long)Either it was bought, washed & shrunk, then returned & resold or the manufactures are selling defects.Others had this similar complaint and I should have listened and not wasted my time & money buying this!!!	
1. 	These work great, I have 3, one on each of the windows in my toddler's room and one on his sliding closet doors.  They are easy to pry off which is a plus for me when I want to open the door or window, but as long as they are out of reach of the child they won't pop off.  Great for travel too, particularly for sliding glass doors at Grandma's, since they are non-permanent and non-damaging.	
1. 	I bought these to replace the &#34;Soft Shields&#34; that came with my Medela Free Style years ago. They are not THAT soft and hurt where the soft part met the harder parts. I figured if I might as well get a set that has no changes to cause chaffing at all. They feel as good as I can feel when pumping. I only pump a few times a week as I'm a stay at home/work at home mom of 3.	
- 1	I really loved the look when they first arrived. However, as soon as i out them to use, they started showing little cracks - 1 got 4 and all had the same issue. Within a month or so, all broke. These are meant for toddlers and infants and are super expensive. I wouldve expected them to last longer than they actually did.My daughter did love them while they lasted though - easy to hold, easy on the eyes!Had i written this review a few months back, i wouldve given a positive review. Not recommended at all!	
- 1	I thought this was cute but Its not realistic when it comes to trying to pump with it regularly.  The Nipple openings were really close together and didn't fit me (I wear a 38D)  I didn't like that it clips together....I prefer a zipper because its faster getting it on and off.	
- 1	My son did not like these also the netting came apart. They are also hard to open.	
1. 	At first I thought I was being a tad frivolous by registering for this, but I'm so glad I did! We have hard wood floors. We use this on top of our daughters play mat so that she can lie on something padded while she bats at the hanging toys on her gym. She loves lying in it and looking around the room, and it slightly elevates her head so she's not flat on her back. Not a must-have, but it's certainly a nice to have!	
1. 	These bottles are exceptional and do everything they claim they do. They are a natural shape and make it easy to feed the baby. The ventaire system does significantly reduce the amount of bubbles, which means less gas, burps and a happier baby. They are easy to clean, and I love the fact they have covers to keep the nipples free of dirt/dust, etc. Overall, a great set of five starter bottles for twenty dollars. I highly recommend.	
- 1	I haven't used these yet, but I did wash them all and everything seems to work great. None of the bags broke on me as I was opening the zippers and yes, the opening seems a little small, but big deal, so I use a funnel to fill them. Great price ($10.00 for 6) so I'm not complaining.***So I've had these about 3 mo and noticed some things that I don't like at all. I've had 2 of the 6 zippers break on me, I only hand wash them and I'm VERY careful when I open them. The zippers just don't last (even though I've had them 3 mo, I've only used them a handful of times). Also, I fill it with yogurt when I do use them, and its really tough to clean in the crevices, like REALLY tough. I've tried bottle brushes, sponges, and finally used a butter knife to get at the bottom. I'm typically someone who loves to save money, but I'd probably buy the more expensive ones next time and get more use out of them.	
- 1	I thought this set would be perfect for my 1.5 year old. Unlike other reviewers, I don't find the size too small -- I think little bites are easier for my child. My issue is the materials -- my son started chewing the handle of the spoon, and within seconds he had bitten off a chunk of plastic! Turns out the spoon is covered in a plastic material instead of being one solid piece. If you're using them to feed your baby, fine, but for active toddlers who put things in their mouths, this is a real hazard. Please watch your child carefully when using these utensils.	
- 1	I used this on my baby who had a 102 degree fever.  She was hot to the touch.  This thermometer read 98.  It read low when I tested it on myself too.  I threw it away.	
1. 	I liked this brand of car seat and base.  The base was easy to install and easily adjusted.  It was durable.  I had no problem with this base during my daughter's first year of life.	
- 1	I have a love and hate relationship with Aden Anais... When I originally got the muslin blankets, I wasnt quite sure what to use them for at first... living in the midwest with frigid temps, I didnt think I could use these lighteweight blankets but after a few months, I ended up using them for everything, burp cloth, blankies, etc. My baby loved them so much that I bought her the loveys and the dream blankets... so then I decided to upgrade to these.. boy was I disappointed. Yes, they are soft but they are so much thinner and fragile than the originals which makes them useless. The fabric is also so delicate that they are easy to snag. For my intended purpose these blankets just didnt cut it. I am sticking to my beloved original muslns.	
- 1	I got this from our registry and had to return it because there was not enough room for all the stuff that babies needs.  It also only has one compartment to fit one very small bottle. This would be great for a quick outting to the super market but definitely not good for a long day out with the baby.  It also didn't feel as comfortable as what other reviewers wrote about.  I'm 5'4 and about 125 pounds and it just kept slipping to the side and didn't hold still.	
1. 	I used the heck out of this when my son was first born.  It was my life saver to get things done around the house & go grocery shopping.  He fell straight to sleep or just looked around & NEVER cried when I put him in it!  A MUST HAVE for any new mommy!  Its super easy to assemble, too.  (I seriously don't know what I would have done without it!)	
- 1	First off, I love the Tilty cups and so does my 8 month old. However, these lids just don't work very well. I'm not sure if they are intended to go over the original sippy lid or replace it, but either way doesn't make sense. If they replace the lid, you have to find a place for the sippy lid to go while you travel, which is a pain. Plus then they have the awkward sippy top sticking out still. If it goes over the sippy lid, it doesn't seal at all and pops off all the time. Either way, the little tab is perfect for getting caught on things and pulling off. This sort of works to just keep the sippy spout clean, but serves no purpose as far as containing liquid if you want to put the sippy in a diaper bag. I really hope they would redesign this lid!	
1. 	Just bought this the other day and got them in and already have them hung in my little girls closet! I am a organizer and these are perfect for organizing your childs closet!	
- 1	Money wasted. I bought 4. The pink one is hard to find too so she's stuck on the green ones.	
1. 	My 14 month old son is just learning to use a fork and he hasn't quite got the hang of it yet so these bibs have been invaluable. I had other similar bibs from sassy but they were hard to clean- these wipe clean so easily. They also do well in the wash too. They are a nice size and cover most of his shirt. I like that it isn't bulky and doesn't bother my son to wear it. These are the only bibs he doesn't try to take off. They are thin so they fold up really nice for travel or in a diaper bag. Lots of cute prints too.	
1. 	Worked very well for when my son began walking at around 12 months and would fall into everything.  I purchased the colour that best matched our fireplace mantel	
1. 	By 6 weeks, we had determined that our son was a hearty drooler and spitter-upper.  I knew terry bibs were absorbent, but they would also soak through to baby's clothes.  Made of terry with a waterproof layer in the middle, these bibs were my answer.Pros:-I stick them in the dryer with my regular laundry, and they come out just fine.  They're not crinkly, they don't curl.-Solid colors!  Nothing with silly sayings or designs!  I don't love the peach color in this pack, but we just put that color on him at home.-They're very thin yet soak up a surprising amount of spit up and drool.-They take up little room in your diaper bag, so you can toss 5 or 6 in there.-They've fit my son since he was 6 weeks old.  He's 6 months now, we're still using them and they still fit great.-The shape of these bibs is perfect.  He's very well protected, but if he's wearing a hood in the cold or strapped into his car seat, I can still comfortably pull the bib out to protect him.Common Sense Tips:-These never soaked through for me, but I also change his bib regularly when it gets wet or soiled.  These are inexpensive enough that I bought 3 packs, so I always have a clean bib that coordinates with his outfit.  If the color doesn't bother you, you don't need to buy that many.-Fasten the velcro before you toss them in the laundry or they'll stick to your sweaters.-I put a clean bib on over the dirty bib, and then take off the dirty bib underneath in one motion.  My baby knows when that ten second window of bib freeness is and will hork on me otherwise.-If you're concerned about the velcro rubbing baby's neck, put it on so the soft side of the velcro faces baby's skin.  I haven't had this problem because the velcro holds so securely and is completely covered when fastened.-Sometimes spit up rolls down the front of the bib based on the angle.  If you're quick and fold the bib to catch it, it will soak up the mess.  Bib change time, but not whole outfit change time.I love these so much that I've started to send them as baby gifts to friends.  They love them too!	
- 1	The case seemed durable but after a couple of weeks of use the red cap broke off and the case would not stay closed.	
- 1	I'm VERY disappointed with Britax over their car seat travel bag. It does NOT come with instructions on how to utlize it. My B-Safe seat's manual also does NOT explain how to use this optional bag.I discovered thru trial and error (NO thanks to Britax), that you need to place the seat upside down in the bag. Also, the seat base level (angle) should be tilted all the way forward. If you incorrectly place the seat and base into the bag right side up, you'll have the seat base's sharp edge painfully DIGGING into your back, and you'll be applying excessive stress to the bag and zippers. Why no instructions? How much would a piece of paper cost?The bag SHOULD have an internal reinforcement under the grab handle stretching the full width of the top of the bag. But it doesn't. Thus pulling the bag on its wheels or picking up the bag is an awkward and clumsy affair.The wheels do NOT feature pull over cover, for use during backpack mode. Thus, the back of your pants become horribly dirty from the wheels when you carry it as a backpack.The shoulder straps have MINIMAL padding. Very uncomfortable.The enclosure for the owner's ID card (located at the top of the bag) has no provision for retaining the white paper card. If the bag is placed on its side, the card falls out (a rather purpose defeating design flaw)I'm shocked that in year 2012, Britax did NOT design the zipper heads to accomodate a travel lock. Any time you would check this bag in rather than carry-on, attaching a (TSA-approved) travel lock is a must nowadays. In fact, when traveling abroad, many airlines require you to sign a disclaimer if your checked bags don't have locks.What could have been a great car seat travel bag is full of short sighted design flaws. I'm extremely unhappy with Britax's execution.Update: One week after receiving the bag, I put it to the test carrying my new B-Agile stroller. I traveled on United, on 4 aircraft. Now, there are 2 puncture holes in the main body of the bag. And, the reinforced material at the bottom has 2 areas rubbed on the verge of puncturing. In this day and age, there are nylon luggage materials that are highly resistant to abrasion and punctures. However, Britax did NOT use such materials in the construction of this bag. For the premium price, they certainly should have. I'm extremely disappointed.	
1. 	Holds adult weight.  Terrific value.  We purchased organic mattresses to go along with it.  It matches the DaVinici mini crib.	
1. 	I can't even tell you how many times I've seen something in my daughter's nose, and thought I wish I had those tweezers right now. My baby is now 2 years old, and if she would let me, i'd still be picking her nose with these.Yes, it can be scary to think about sticking these into a tiny babe. I didn't start using them until 5 months old. A few times I was probably overzealous, and may have  hurt the babe a little. My advice is to go slow, and get help holding the baby down if they move too much. It is a strange feeling to have boogies pulled out of your nose, I'm sure :) but it works VERY well on those hard, dry, crusty ones that won't budge otherwise.	
- 1	A friend of mine swears by this cup so I bought it but my son never took to aspirate from it, I think the spout is just too thin and small for him. So it's sitting here taking dust.	
1. 	much longer than the 24mm shields. it is  not a big deal but just a little awkward sticking out so far.	
- 1	I would not recommend this. It's awkward, doesn't distribute weight properly, and doesn't support baby. I purchased a lillebaby carrier after and love it. The lillebaby is pricey, but in this case, for me, I got what I paid for.	
1. 	Bed came well packaged (box is heavy).  Espresso color is beautiful, bed is made of quality durable products. There were a few &#34;nicks&#34; on a couple of the pieces the mattress rests on, but since they will be covered, I didn't mind.  Easy enough for one adult and a very helpful two year old to assemble in a half hour or so (although a second set of hands would have made it even faster/easier).  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFEs very durable!  Our existing crib mattress fit PERFECT.	
1. 	This was the only blanket that my little one didn't kick out of. She used it until she was five months old and way too old to be swaddled. It's light weight, so she didn't get too warm, but also easy to tightly wrap. No annoying velcro in the wrong places, just soft stretchy fabric and plenty of it. I now buy this for every pregnant friend.	
- 1	This has some useful things in it but not enough to merit the purchase.  Get a nosefreida instead of the bulb thing, get baby nail scissors instead of the clippers, the teething tablets have been recalled and I can't get the medicine-dispensing pacifier open to put the medicine in.  Also the syringe tip is too large to fit in the opening of the pain reliever so doling it out is a pain on its own and the markings rub off the syringe making it useless after a few uses.  I don't use the teething toy.  I think the only thing in here that I actually use is the thermometer.  In the end, it's just easier to purchase the things you need separately.  This doesn't have anything magical in it that you would overlook...when baby has a snotty nose, you have to clean it; when baby has a fever/pain, you have to relieve it, etc.	
- 1	My 8 month old son HATED this carrier, sadly. We'd had high hopes based on the reviews.  But he didn't seem to feel secure in it.  Because of the way the carrier is positioned, he was able to push against my back with his feet and try to stand up, and the unpadded straps holding him into the backpack would cut into his neck and leave horrible marks.  We had a difficult time getting him in and out, because the clasp for the straps that secure him are placed very low in the carrier, and the carrier is very narrow, and we couldn't see the release buttons to get him out.  We also had a diffult time with the very stiff metal stand -- it's hard to put your kid down when you can't get the stand to release behind you!  Finally, the lack of any type of chest or waist strap was a big problem from an ergonomic perspective, and our kid is only 17lbs.  I can't imagine have a much heavier one in there.It arrived yesterday, and is being returned in the morning.  You get what you pay for, I guess....	
1. 	I hate that I have to use this, but I'm not one of those women that is able to discretely breast-feed my baby, and a nursing cover is a necessity.I love several things about this item.1. Great design, with the metal loop opening the area in front so you have view down to see baby2. Great design, with the soft, heavy corners, to pull it down and keep you covered.3. Nice choice of fabric designs.... Hot dots, the one I chose, is cheery and fun and colorful, IMO.4. Big enough for large chest and large baby.5. Folds small enough to easily stash in diaper bag.Only complaint: fabric is not very breathable, so, on hot days, baby and I get really hot using this.Recommendation:  I almost went with a dark , plain cover, thinking it would help me to be discreet.  So happy I didn't for several reasons:1.  Nursing is wonderful and although I don't feel the need to flash the world with my boobs, I am glad people know I'm doing it.2.  Dark colors in the sun are hotter (see my only complaint)3.  Baby is wonderful and joyful and fitting that he can eat under a happy cover!	
1. 	Those are my daughters favorite sippies. They are dishwasher safe and work fairly well. Unfortunately like every sippie we have tried so far these do start leaking after a few months as well.	
1. 	Overall I really like this. My daughter hates car rides so I needed something to distract and amuse her. The toys are all really cute, she likes the rattle the most though, and I'm not really sure what the point of the mirror is, it's tiny and blurry, but my biggest complaint is this thing is suppose to be held togther by magnets, I wouldn't mind if it actually stayed together, but it's suck a pain because everytime I pull the carseat out it comes undone. I actually recently just tied it in a knot, my daughter loves it, I just wish it wasn't so easy to undo.Update: Due to my frustration with the magnets I stopped using this, my mom got me the Bright Starts Hop Along Carrier Toy Bar and both my daughter and I like that one a lot better, she played with it a lot more. So save your money on this one and find something that stays strapped on	
- 1	the center of the brush is way too wide in diamater and does not fit in any pump parts, it also has a hard time going through certain baby bottles. the vactum idea is great but that is about the only positive thing about this brush	
- 1	Yes, I followed the directions and ensured the mouthpiece had proper seal. The lid itself where it screws onto the cup leaks the heaviest, and there is no avoiding that.	
1. 	This is my favorite baby scent! I lightly spritz my son's clothing before he puts it on.. it lasts all day too! We get tons of compliments on how sweet my baby boy smells!	
- 1	I ordered this because we had a diaper cover in the same print and I thought it was really cute, but clearly I wasn't thinking, because this thin strip of fabric isn't large enough to even show enough of the design, so it's really blah, and then after wearing it two or three times, it broke, because that tiny little ribbon can't be securely sewn to the fabric. Sigh. Our two ulubulu pacifier clips have held up for months, and my son wears them every day. Skip this, because even though you think it's cute, it's just going to be that much sadder when it breaks.	
- 1	This is a beautiful piece of equipment. Of all the items I received at my baby shower, this was the one I was most excited about. It's very well designed and I love all the features - especially how cuddly the seat is and the fact that we could also hook in our car seat. The only problem for us was that our son really didn't like it at all. He would occasionally sit in it for 5 minutes or so, but most of the time he would start wailing the minute I got him anywhere near it. At his daycare, they have a Fisher Price Papasan swing and he LOVES it. We ended up buying one of those and sadly, the Sweet Peace is sitting in our basement in hopes that any future babies may enjoy it. The Sweet Peace is really nice, but if you can, try it out before you invest $$ since it doesn't work for every baby.	
- 1	After solely breastfeeding my baby for 3 months, my husband and I wanted to be able to go out and have him babysat. In order to do so we had to get him to take a bottle, after many tries and fails, we finally found a nipple he would take, and unfortunately this one wasn't it. He just kept spitting it out and wanted nothing to do with it!	
1. 	these are better than ice cube trays because they have lids which keeps the food safe from other food smells and they are bpa free!!!!! stack and wash well. these are the best! also made in the usa.	
- 1	We were given the Tripp Trapp chair as a gift, and sadly I bought tihs baby set on my own without reading the reviews on Amazon first.  This chair is literally TORTURE on our little one, and we have literally thrown away and purchased a different set for a fraction of the price that does not inflict severe harm on our baby.As mentioned in the other reviews, the baby can only be inserted in the chair by forcing the legs at such a weird angle that his/her legs are contorted at the very best.  TEARS and more tears.  clearly this was NEVER designed as a baby chair, and to throw this baby set in as an afterthought is absolutely fraudulent and cruel to TT customers' babies .Interestingly, in wondering how anyone could rate this product anything better than HORRIBLE, I read in one positive review that one can simply pinch the tab that holds the baby seat on and lift up ,and voile, the baby will come out without breaking his/her legs in the process.  Excuse me?  This is the tab than holds the baby seat down in the front, and the plastic is hard and stiff so the idea of pinching it is a joke.  More like, get your husband and two neighbors to help squeeze the incredible stiff pieces together while kneeling under the chair, and then take a hammer (all with your baby still in the chair) and pound on the tab until it pushes up through the extremely tight hole.  THIS PIECE IS BUILT TO REMAIN INSTALLED, and the idea that one satisfied customer has to literally remove the entire baby seat in order to remove the baby (without the baby's legs being broken or hyper-extended) simply confirms the reality that this baby seat is defectively designed.  That this customer is furthermore satisfied with this makeshift solution to a horrendous problem only shows that they are clearly desperate to avoid admitting that they have wasted their money on this horrendous product.I also feel horrible about this complete waste of money and have tried with my husband to figure out some way that we can live with our mistake, but at the end of the day a real high chair is not that expensive and it is more important for us to be have something we actually feel comfortable using, that does not involve me breaking my nails and using a hammer to hammer the baby seat off every time I want to remove my baby.  (Imagine him choking on something, clearly every high chair should feature a quick and easy release.)If I were TRIPP TRAPP I would immediately recall this product before a baby does die of choking while stuckin the chair, or breaks their legs being yanked out during a choking fit.  This is literally a dangerous product and I am surprised it is even on the market.	
1. 	We bought these after spending far too much $$ on other more expensive outlet gadgets and we ended up getting back to basics and these are great!  Our daughter can't pull them out and it takes some effort for Mom and Dad too but that's the point, right?  Absolutely!  Great buy!!!!!!!!	
1. 	Its great, works just as expected, I do think Halo could make sure with sleeves, or removable sleeves. Otherwise, I have piece of mind knowing that baby's head won't get covered up by a blanket.	
- 1	The Diaper Genie does the job of keeping odors away, but otherwise it is a real pain!  If you shove the diaper down and accidentally miss the clips you have to reach down and pull up the messy diaper and wipes!  Ick.  Particularly icky at 2 am.And contrary to what one poster says, a monkey definitely couldn't operate this thing.  The refill directions are lousy.  It took us over a half hour to figure out how to install the refill, and we're all college-educated professionals (and my dad, a retired mechanical engineer, couldn't even figure it out!).  It's hard to get the refill in, even when you do figure out the part that's ommitted from the instructions.  When you're busy with a newborn, the last thing you have the time or energy to deal with is a challenge like this!And why does the obvious dial at the top cut the liner instead of sealing off the liner for the next use?  Yes, you realize that's what it does after reading the directions.  But we have to tell anyone helping care for the baby not to turn the noticeable dial because it doesn't do what you think it will.If you do decide to purchase this product, don't turn the liner multiple times after use as the directions suggest.  The only reason they say to do this is so you'll run out of the liner faster and have to buy their refills.  One or two turns is sufficient once you get the diaper lined up in the Genie properly.I wish I had taken a better look at competing products.  I realize now there's a real reason other companies decided to come up with other models.  The Diaper Genie has some major flaws.	
- 1	As has been said previously, these bottles don't work. the only one that works is the one that isn't for use with the disposable drop ins. The tops simple will not grab the threads on the bottle when the drop in is in place and I too have spilled milk. I even tried filling the drop in with water so i could experiment and found no way to get the darn thing to close. DONT but this. Buy the ones that are not for th drop in disposable insert. the nipple is great (that's why i give it one star)!	
1. 	When I did my initial research for baby proofing our hearth I was disappointed to find poor ratings for every pad based product I found. For some reason this product never showed up in my search. Feeling defeated I ordered a very expensiveNorth States Superyard 3 In 1 Arched Decor Metal, Matte Bronzeand installed it around my fireplace. The gate was effective but took away from the beauty of our fireplace.As my son got older and started visiting his grandparents more I became nervous about the similar raised hearth in their home. I knew my mother-in-law wasn't going to allow me to install a huge baby gate around her hearth and I honestly wasn't looking forward to shelling out a ton of money again. I was very close to ordering theKidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupeand gluing it to the hearth like one reviewer suggested. However, just the idea of gluing something to my in-laws fireplace made me uneasy. I finally stumbled across this metal hearth guard and I ordered it immediately.Out of the box I was impressed with the construction and design. You really get what you pay for. Unfortunately, the first guard we received was missing a spot weld on one of the corner brackets which made it impossible for the guard to tighten properly on the hearth. We sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement the following week. Once the replacement was installed I was thrilled  when my almost two year old walked up to it and tugged on it. It didn't even budge.Sitting at home for a few weeks I became jealous of my in-laws open fireplace while mine was gated. I finally gave in and ordered my own hearth guard. I am so much happier now that my fireplace is free from its jail!	
- 1	I bought this to add to some old panels and was glad they are compatible, as one panel did not get fully assembled.  The first customer service person was downright rude, but the second time I called, I was helped by a courteous woman who agreed to send a replacement panel as it was unclear which part(s) were missing.  I have yet to receive the new panel and that part is frustrating.  The product is well constructed and compatible with a set I had purchased for dogs years ago.  The mechanism used to separate is a tad tricky to do initially, but after a few tries we had success.	
1. 	My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.	
1. 	I use this little zipper bag as a sort of gadget purse for baby health things.  Even with everything in it I can find room for a Desitin tube, a bottle of Mylicon drops, a bottle of Baby Tylenol, Q-tips, and a little sample bottle of Eucerin cream for baby's exema.  On the side is a net pocket where I keep my pediatrician's appointment cards and medicine instructions.  Also, on the inside are a couple of pockets where phone numbers are kept on a provided card; I keep a pocket-sized record of baby's immunizations (that my nurse gave me) in there as well.  Very handy.	
1. 	We bought one for our son and it works wonderfully.  Prior to this, we were using blankets to swaddle him, the way they taught us to in the hospital.  He always found a way to break out of the swaddle both in the hospital and at home.  So we bought it, and it has done wonders because he no longer wakes up because his hands got out of the swaddle and startled him.  He's three months old, and we continue to use the product.However, our advice is to consider buying a cotton one before you buy the fleece.  Most of us heat our homes to around 70 degrees, so the fleece might end up being too hot.  We noticed that our baby was starting to develop a heat rash, so we switched to the cotton Kiddopotoamus SwaddleMe blanket.  This worked well, and the heat rash went away.Another tip - we've noticed that our baby can get his hands out of the swaddle now.  The way we prevent this is get him to put his arms parrallel and along to his body inside the blanket.  If you allow him to fold his arms on top of him, he will be able to get out as he gets bigger and gains in strength.	
1. 	These trays are wonderful!  I began making my own baby food when my daughter was six months old.  You cook and puree the food, then fill the tray and freeze it.  The thick, rubber lid stays on the tray and does not pop off in the freezer like some other product lids (Baby Cubes in particular).  The food can then be popped out of the tray (like regular ice cubes) and placed into a zip-lock freezer bag for long-term frozen storage.  The product is durable and of high-quality.  I love using these trays as they hold a whole batch of food at one time.  Once I freeze the food and transfer it into a zip-lock bag, then I just pull out what I need (usually 1-2 cubes of food) for each feeding.  I then wash the trays and they are ready for the next batch of homemade food.  I have put everything from pureed and cooked pumpkin to spinach to fresh plums in these trays, and the food comes out tasting great every time!  I highly recommend these trays...you won't be disappointed!	
1. 	They are just like the brushes that come with the bottles! They met my expectation! Too bad my daughter won't take Dr. Brown's... :)	
- 1	I purchased this product knowing I will be making my own baby food, and this should be of some assistance in the process. I loved it... it mashes fruits very well, is easy to serve from and clean with a brush. I was going to purchase another one and stumbled upon  the negative reviews. I was horrified when I found out this was made with #7 plastic, and the health risks it poses to my baby. I used it for over two months but have since stopped and WILL NOT be using this to crush my baby's food. I hope in that period of using it my baby wasn't exposed too much to the chemicals contained within to cause any permanent harm. I will rather be safe and use a fork or spoon to crush foods. It's really cute and eye-catching though... Don't be fooled.	
1. 	I've used these bottles for all three of my kids as they are the only thing I've found that most closely resemble the breast. We've all read about nipple confusion and it concerned me since my kids attend daycare and I still nurse when I'm with them. All three of my kids took to this bottle with no issues and I like that you can take them completely apart for cleaning. The two size option is good as your baby grows and his appetite follows.	
1. 	These are the best bottles ever.  The unique design cuts down on the amount of gas your baby swallows. This leads to less spit up and gas fussiness.  Just a good healthy burp!The bottles are easy to clean and assemble and clean up well in the dishwasher.  I'd suggest the Dr Brown's bottle drying rack as well. It will make the job much easier.	
- 1	These seem to be a sturdy long use product. Unfortunately there are a couple design issues. First, the side flaps with velcro are molded in such a way that when you undo the diaper they instantly fall into the dirty diaper unless you fold them under and hold them there which can be really tough with a screaming and squirming baby. This means the enclosure area gets dirty very easily so you can't reuse the diaper for many wears without washing. Secondly, the material stains easily. If you don't want to use bleach (we can't, gives the baby a rash), your diapers will look dirty even when they are clean.	
- 1	We did use this for the first couple of weeks until we got tired of replacing batteries every day. It goes through batteries WAY, WAY too fast. It does track useful things but, as other reviewers have mentioned, it only tracks when something happened the LAST time. It does not help you answer the pediatrician questions (how many times a day baby poops & pees, how often baby eats, how long baby sleeps). Either get an app for your phone OR do what we did and put a big white board in a central location in your home, divide into columns, and just make tally marks. Save your money!	
- 1	The covers look nice and make my old crib look new again, but the scent, OMG.  It smells like bad chemicals.  So I washed it twice and it seemed better.  Until a few weeks later.  Then it started to smell again!  Not sure where this was made but I am actively looking for something to replace it but my son is able to stand up and put his hands and mouth on this product.  That is not ok in my opinion.	
1. 	After minimal use, my TT's lights went out. Probably some kind of short or something. I was pretty disappointed, and contacted Cloud B to let them know what happened. I have read other reviewers say that Cloud B didn't help them at all, but my communications with them were very helpful and friendly. I very nicely (get more bees with honey than vinegar, right?) informed them of my problem and asked what their recommendations were. After some emails back and forth to troubleshoot and verify authenticity, they emailed me a postage paid FedEx label to send the non-working turtle back. About two weeks later I received a brand new TT. I am very pleased! I will update later though, if this turtle has the same problems of the lights going out.	
1. 	I have 8 children ranging from 24yrs to 5 weeks. I have never used a formula dispenser before. I found this product by accident and thought I would give it a try. What a lifesaver in the middle of the night and for diaper bag use. It saves me time and effort. It also saves the formula from landing on the floor or the bottom of the diaper bag. It also allows you to work one handed. It's a small addition that makes life easier.	
- 1	This cup is easy for my 10 month old to hold, shake, and hold upside down.  It is very hard for him to drink out of.  It is also extremely drippy and leaves a puddle of water behind every time.	
- 1	this is impossible to use. Its very very very warm . I live in Beverly Hills and we have a very hot weather anyway, but i keep my bedroom cold. However , when you are [prego, you flush anyway, so having this was a nightmare that I ahd to return	
- 1	This would not suction to my wall. My tile is slightly the textured but not much. Not sure what to do with it now.	
- 1	I bought this and Kissa's pail liner when I started cloth diapering a year and half ago. For the first few months I liked them equally, couldn't really see any difference. But after a few months of wash and wear (I machine wash them and line dry, never put them in the dryer), Kissa's antibacterial liner is clearly the winner.The problem with this one is, the PUL side, the side that repels water, for some reason always flips inward. When washing pail liners, you want to turn the bag inside out so the PUL side is on the outside, otherwise it's impossible to rinse off the soap residue on the PUL side. Planet Wise's liner usually flips back after being tumbled in the washer. I don't understand why it does that and why kissa's seldom has this problem. It might have something to do with the elastic or the bag design.Now with this liner, I have to hand wash in the sink after I take it out of the washer to rinse off all the foams and who knows what other dirty stuff on the bag.	
1. 	I have 3 of these gates and use them to block large openings for my dogs when I need to keep them away from company. They are very easy to install. Sometimes a little hard to get a panel moving but over time they get easier to slide.	
1. 	very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.	
- 1	My husband purchased these locally, not on Amazon.They're great if you have a cabinet you want EVERYONE to be locked out of. Try cooking dinner and being in the thick of it, and not being able to access your cabinets because you as an adult can't get these POS's to work.Don't buy. There has to be something better than this.	
- 1	I originally bought this to keep the cat from opening the door where her food is stored. I put it on and all of a sudden she was able to open it more easily than before!I didn't rate it then because the lock is intended for toddlers, not cats, and perhaps it would work better there.I just tried it out with my toddler and sure enough: now he can get into his sisters' room more easily than before!	
- 1	Thought this toy was kind of different and since my little one loves crawling I got it for him to push around.  But he wasn't really impressed with it.  Plus, I saw it at toys r us for half the price.	
- 1	we purchased this swing after watching Harvey Karp's Happiest Baby on the Block DVD (which is awesome). He did not endorse this swing, he just recommends swings in general. We purchased this swing because it is small and transportable. To our dismay the settings on the swing were not fast enough. Even on the highest setting the swing barely moved. Our son only weighed 11 pounds at the time, so it is not a weight issue. It is also very loud and he responded negatively to the vibration. The swing is currently collecting dust in the baby's room. The upside is that it is compact and light weight.	
1. 	My husband and I have come to find that swaddling our baby before sleep really helps him (he is now 5 wks old).  We have other blankets and also the Swaddle Me blanket, but the miracle blanket is definitely the best at keeping him swaddled through the night.  I haven't experienced the miracle of having him sleep through the night with it yet, because he is too young right now, but we use it every night nonetheless.  We highly recommend it.	
- 1	I thought this product sounded great, but I have to agree with the other negative reviews on here.  The tweezers do not open wide enough to be effective.  You have to force them open in order to grab the boogies.  The design just doesn't make sense.  Save your money.	
1. 	This is the best sunshade I've ever had.  It is so easy to install, it stays on, and I can still roll down the windows if I want. I just purchased another set for the other car and couldn't be happier with these.	
1. 	It fits perfect. Good quality sheet, since all it is is a sheet there isn't much more to say about it!	
- 1	I looked everywhere for a tub without all the grooves for baby's body - I wanted something that would submerge nicely from the neck down and this looked like it would do the trick. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold any water to submerge anything than perhaps the feet. Leaks horribly, bulky - we gave up, returned it, and now we just bath with baby. Nothing works better than you own hands on your slippery baby anyway, and you can avoid sore knees from bathroom tile and stiff back from bending over the tub.	
- 1	I ordered an additional camera despite being hesitant since our first camera has already had to be replaced and now a few months later needs to be replaced again due to the camera no longer turning or picking up sound.  This monitor had problems from the start too.  The night vision doesn't always work- and it had pairing problems at first.  These baby monitors are some of the most expensive monitors out there and now that I have had three and all have problems- I am thinking its more than a lemon or two out there.  And motorola customer service is TERRIBLE.  I am dreading having to deal with them again.  I would never buy a motorola baby monitor again.  The features are great- but now- a lot of other companies have these great features too and hopefully more reliable monitors! Stay away.  It's not worth it if you get a bad one....Update: I finally called Motorola dreading dealing with their customer service, but shockingly- things have changed! For the better!  It doesn't take away that I need to replace my monitor twice now, but they have changed the way they go about it.  They now send out the new monitor first and it comes with a prepaid box to ship the old broken one back!  They used to make you pay shipping, send it the monitor and when they received it, they would send you a new one- so you could go several weeks with no monitor.  So if you are willing to chance it on the monitor, at least you know the warranty is handled much better now!	
- 1	I ended up throwing these out.  The mesh is too stretchy and doesn't hold the items very tightly.  As a result, they move around during the wash cycle and don't get clean.	
1. 	Great product for the winter in Philadelphia. My daughter stayed nice and snuggly in this. I hope we get another winter of use out of it!	
1. 	The deluxe booster seat (DBS) is a lot more compact that its big brother, the space saver high chair (SSHC), and I actually prefer it. I removed one star because the tray is a little difficult to get on and off. I have also found that the add-ons to the tray are pretty useless (they are the only difference b/w the deluxe and non-deluxe versions), so you can save a few dollars by going with the non-deluxe version. What follows is a comparison between the DBS and the SSHC.Features of the SSHC:ReclinesRemovable Padded Cloth CoverRemovable Upper Straps for a 5-Point HarnessRemovable Seat BackFull-sized Tray with One-handed RemovalThe seat in the SSHC is rounded to allow for the chair to recline. When in the upright position it seems to make my children slouch because of it. The reclining feature, the cover, and the upper straps were used for a very brief period of time (only about a  month). If you need your child to be reclined when first feeding them, I would recommend putting them in a bouncy seat or in their car seat instead so that you don't have problems with slouching later on. The seat is also very deep, and has a large pommel. The pommel prevents my three-year-old child from being able to easily climb into and out of the chair. The deepness of the chair means that my child sits low relative to the tray, making it difficult for him to feed himself (especially when he was younger). The back is very high on this chair and makes it difficult for him to tip back enough to drink from a sippy cup, and even though it is removable, I hesitate to remove it because of the way the chair makes my child sit he usually leans back and so uses the back for support.The SSHC tray is huge. And while it advertises a one-handed removal, you almost always have to use two hands. The size of the tray makes it difficult to wash (while dishwasher safe, it's so big it's not going to fit in your dishwasher so plan on washing by hand), and it won't balance in our dish drain, so we almost always end up toweling it off immediately. To attach the tray to the seat there are two long &#34;arms&#34; on either side of the seat. These arms make the booster seat very wide (even without the tray), and prevent the chair from being able to be pushed up to the table for an older child's use as just a booster.Features of the DBS:Compact and Fold-able for easy transportThree-Point HarnessAdjustable Seat HeightAdjustable Snap-on Tray with Inset and CoverThe seat in the DBS is right angled, more shallow and narrow, has a small pommel, and a much lower back. My child sits much more comfortably in this chair, and the tray is at a great height for him to be able to easily feed himself. The DBS tray is much smaller, yet still has plenty of room for my child's food and drink. It is much easier to wash. Its only downside is that it is not as easy to put on and remove as the SSHC tray. The DBS chair can be pushed up to the table, and it is height adjustable, so I can put my child at the right height for the table.Basically, all the extra features in the SSHC seem like they are a great idea so you can transition from feeding a four-month-old to a four-year-old, but in reality, it makes the chair awkward and not good for any age. The tray is way too high for a self feeding child, and you can't pull the chair up to the table so it is useless as just a plain booster. The simplicity of the DBS helps it to be a better seat for any age. I have read some reviews that complain that the chair is too small and that their child outgrew it quickly. However, my children are on the lower end of the charts, and the DBS works well for both my one-year-old and my three-year-old.	
- 1	Upon receiving this, I followed the assembly directions explicitly and made sure everything was in place correctly before placing my baby in it for the first time.  Once he started playing, I noticed the stand seemed a bit wobbly and so I took the baby out to check the base.  Sure enough, the stand was clicked into the base as it should be, but it wasn't as secure a fit as I feel it should be.  The stand should be secured to the base with something more substantial, like screws, but it's a click in-click out type of assembly.  I suppose that is to make it easier to disassemble, but it's more important to me that the bouncer be safe than convenient.  I am returning this to Amazon.	
1. 	This was such an essential item for us. The miracle blanket was a bit pricey, but was an EXCELLENT swaddling blanket. I can't recommend it enough for infants. A must for new parents.	
- 1	We purchased this item last year for our son and now that we have had baby #2 we started using it again, we noticed that on two of the chargers the wires were exposed (that's awesome considering it could have caused a fire) and then we noticed our second monitor won't even turn on now.  Like I said the item worked great for us at first but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.	
- 1	I really want to try these since the Dino Dudes print (no longer an option) is the same as my twins' nursery so I bought 2. At 11 and 12.5 pounds the covers are still too big. I am pairing them with a Best Bottom insert and maybe they are just too trim. I'll keep trying them..	
1. 	Provides the right amount of cushion. My son was pulling up on furniture by 5 months but was very clumsy. This product was great and came with lots of strong double sided tape.	
1. 	My baby was born is September 2003, and we just started using the Bundle Me. The big velcro closures make it very easy to attach to the car seat, and to take it off as needed(good for this crazy weather we have!) I looked at other car seat covers but none came even close to this one. Some of them you had to put over the car seat and take it off everytime you had to take baby off the seat...a hassle! You can easily open the zippers on both sides to control the temperature, and even take the cover off, leaving only the back part on the car seat. It seems very safe and cozy, and everywhere I go other Moms ask me where I got it.It's great 'cause we don't have to struggle with blankets anymore, and don't have to dress our baby in snowsuits either! You can attach it to the stroller too, which is great for cold weather - and especially great for those who go jogging or walking with their babies, since there won't be anymore blankets falling off all the time!I recommend this product, and it makes a great baby shower gift! I will be buying the Bundle Me Big once our baby outgrows this one.	
1. 	This cushion is a must have if you already have the Svan highchair.  It makes the chair much more comfortable for the child.  I would recommend getting two so you have a spare when you need to wash one.  They are machine washable (which is awesome!) and very easy to get on and off without having to remove the buckles from the highchair.	
1. 	I'm not sure how much there is to say about a wipes warmer, except that it works really well. We use it for cloth wipes, we replace the little pad thingy every six months, it keeps wipes at just the right temperature, and works great. Obviously, you cannot use the pop-up feature for cloth wipes, but that isn't a problem for us. We tried not getting one and I ordered one about a week into the baby being born because he already didn't like diaper changes and then a cold wipe on his tush just made it all the worse. This did help. Thus, especially suggested if your little one is already not a fan of diaper changes.Great shower present - not something people think they will need, but very nice to have.A+	
- 1	What a waste of time &amp; energy!  This pump lasted a week before it lost its suction on me. Before it did, I could only get an ounce out at a time if I was lucky.  Buy any Medela pump instead.  I ended up buying a Medela when this one conked out even though I'm a stay at home Mom and don't really need to use it very often.  Sigh.	
- 1	We received this monitor as a replacement for our Summer monitor that broke. The resolution on the video was awful (compared to the old summmer monitor and another brand we have recieved). I like all the features of the monitor but couldn't get over the bad video quality. Also we had an issue with the actual monitor breaking and you have to buy a whole new system at discount(at 109.99). I received a lot of recommendations for Summer monitors but this one was not great. We also had an awful experience with customer service. I recommend either looking at a different model of Summer products or a different brand all together. Unfortunately due to our experience, we went with a different brand.	
- 1	I've tried several times to use this sippy cup with my son. Every time water spills out. I read other reviews that suggest making sure everything aligns, but I just can't seem to make it spill proof.	
- 1	Might work well but at the time I ordered this, the description did not have the max width of the door ( 1-3/8&#34; )... Check first before you buy!	
1. 	my son loves it!i bought 4 different brands for him to try out and this is the best one!perfect shape, perfect comfort, perfect size for a 4 yr old. (potty trained now)sometimes, he sits on this for a long time....so i know it's very comfortable....LOLthe handle helps germophobic mommies. and it easy to wash too.the pee cover should be higher though as he has to hold down his thing so as not to pee all over the toilet floor.even with that, it is still a 5 star rating!	
1. 	I use this on a Dream On Me 3&#34; Foam Playyard Mattress with a Graco On The Go Pack and Play. I had to bend the foam mattress to get it to fit into the closed elastic corners. The mattress was a little bowed before I put it in. I just pressed it tightly into the frame and it fits amazingly. The sheet will NOT come off because the corners are sewn closed about 5&#34; in at each corner. It fits firmly and flat on the mattress, not puckered.Quilting is thick and luxurious, but not overly fluffy like a down blanket. Soooo soft and snuggly. I'll switch to cotton in the summer but for cold months this is PERFECT!! So happy!!!!	
- 1	I purchased two of these cloth diapers about 2 weeks ago. When I got them in the mail and opened the packaging I was super excited, I felt like I finally found a cheaper version of a Bum Genius. These GoGrean cloth diapers feel extremely durable, have sturdy colorful snaps, an extra protective barrier to keep everything inside the diaper, and were insanely cute! However, none of that matters because as soon as my son urinates, it leaks out through the leg part of the diaper EVERY SINGLE TIME! I've tried everything to keep his pee from escaping the cloth diaper but nothing works. I've verified that the diaper is fitted properly, that none of the cloth is hanging outside of the diaper and that his private part is pointed straight down (as i've learned ya gotta do with the boys!). Nothing that I do will keep his pee from escaping, so then I realized that I can't do anything about it; GoGreen should have created a better diaper that actually does its job!No matter what I do, this diaper immediately LEAKS!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I will NEVER purchase this product ever again!!For the record, my son is 3 months old and of average size; about 12-13 lbs. Also, my son has never gone poo in this diaper so I'm unsure of how it will hold up against that movement.	
- 1	I have purchased several other American Baby Company products in the past year and have been pleased with the quality.  So I was very disappointed to open the package and find such a skimpy piece of material.  Sure, the price is a value but you get what you pay for I suppose.  Still, I thought I could look past the cheapness of the fabric if the sheet fit the mattress.  Wrong.  I have to fight to put this sheet on theDream On Me 3 Foam Playard Mattress, Whitebecause the tight elastic makes the side seams pull up over the length of the mattress, causing it to bow in the middle.  It's just not worth the hassle.Yet all is not lost.  I found a new purpose for these sheets - changing table pad covers!  They fit like a glove on theSummer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.  Here's to silver linings.	
- 1	This is a good product for those free spirits who are organized enough to use it.  Maybe I  am too prudish, but I felt so stupid walking around with these things on that I cringed every time my husband walked into the room.  I have a friend that found this a Godsend, especially when she returned to work and had to pump.  Just not for me.	
1. 	I haven't tried food in these, but they do work GREAT for teething babies.  Just put some ice cubes inside.  They just suck on the cold water.  It is perfect and a LIFESAVER.  I would buy this product just for that!  I do give it four stars because this product is meant for more than just ice....and I don't know how it will work with food.	
- 1	To set it up, it requires that you download a free Android or iPhone app. Now this was a bit odd that a product cannot be set up using my computer. I'm surprised that the set up requires using an app from the Android or Apple stores. Unfortunately, our Android devices (two smart phones from Motorola and an older tablet) are running an older version of Android for which this supposedly free app is not available.We have Windows Phones (Nokia Lumia 920) but I'm not going to blame Motorola for not releasing an app for the Windows Phone. However, this prerequisite of having one of the latest Android or iOS devices to set it up should be mentioned clearly in the description of the item. I guess if someone doesn't have one of the latest smart phones, they should not buy this camera.But what really intrigued me is this: The app it requires us to use to set up and manage this baby monitor is not one developed by Motorola but some third party company called binatonetelecom based in Hong Kong. So if the software vendor stops updating the app or pulls it out of the store, this camera may become useless. As I mentioned, I could *not* find the app from the Google Play store on my device because my Android device was running a slightly older version (2.2) of Android OS. If you are thinking about buying this camera, it should concern you that even though this camera has a Motorola logo on it, the app that controls it doesn't come from Motorola.Lastly, there is a website to manage the camera called monitoreverywhere dot com. This is where they require you to register by creating an account. On that site, there is no mention of Motorola anywhere. Their FAQ doesn't even mention Motorola once.  If you click on Contact Us, it takes to a page that shows their Hong Kong address with no company name and no phone number. Now again, this is the site that will be used to manage this camera's live feed and control the camera. To me, this is a serious privacy concern.I would not even give this product as a gift to someone I care about - let alone use it.*** Update ****After only a few weeks, it stopped powering on. I don't know if it's powering on or not because when I plug this to the supplied AC adapter, I don't see any LEDs coming on. They there used to be a blinking LED which when it was plugged in. I thought I'd try one of the several universal IP camera apps to somehow get it be detected so I can properly review it but I have not been able to get it to work.	
- 1	This toy is very cute. I think my baby will be interested in it when she gets a bit bigger. I was slightly disappointed at how weak the rattle sound is and also I didn't like how the material gathered dust easily. I don't think I will be allowing this in her mouth anytime soon.All  in all it was an ok product.UpdateI had to lower it to 2 stars because its still too difficult for her to hold or enjoy. I don't think its a very good toy and its still dirty no matter what.	
- 1	The quality of the material looked higher quality than other mittens I've received in the past. I brought these to the hospital with me to use on my newborn. However, it kept coming off my baby's hands so it didn't really serve its purpose for her. The baby clothes with built in mittens that folded over worked better for her.	
1. 	This really helped out when we went back to see the parents. my 30 lbs 3 year found it comfy enough to sleep on.	
- 1	It was nice while is lasted, but the fan blades already ripped and it won't even spin anymore, after just over a week of having it. Waste of money and paid a lot more than current price.  Kick myself. Don't buy, worthless and expensive.	
1. 	Probably my favorite baby item ever! These bibs are a soft plastic, so it's comfortable for my child to wear but it holds its shape. It doesn't bend or anything so once it's on, it's staying in place. The lip is the perfect width to catch food. There isn't a gap between the table and the bib for food to fall down. Other bibs similar to this I have tried, the lip is more flat or doesn't hold its shape and therefore doesn't catch any fallen food. The collar is very adjustable, so I can fit it perfectly around my child's neck, and there isn't that gap between the bib and the shirt for food to get on the collar of the shirt.  I always have hated how when i put a bib on theres just a tad bit of shirt collar showing and it always got stained. well not with the baby bjorn! It wipes clean or can be put in the dishwasher. And it doesn't stain... You know how some foods like pasta sauce or carrots always seem to stain plastic containers and such? Well I have left spaghetti sauce on this bib overnight and it still did not stain it. The bibs look as clean as the day I took them out of the package. If you have a kid eating solids, you have to buy this bib. It's the only one that actually succeeds at keeping food off if your kid.	
- 1	It leaked all over, baby didn't know what to do with it, on several failed attempts. Assebly is not self explanatory as the pieces all look the same :( Don't recommend it at all.	
- 1	These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash!  Pathetic.  The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off.  Plus the velcro tab is really small so they don't adjust much, making a gap between my baby's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway.  Seriously, if you want throw away bibs, these are for you.  If you want something that is going to last, look elsewhere.	
- 1	This cup is not meant for me, so I rated it on how my daughter respond to it. She almost hates the thing. I have tried multiple times to get her to drink both milk and water from it but after attempting to use it and sometimes just handling it, it is a) give back, b) dropped, c) thrown across the room.I like the designed but since I am not the one drinking from it, what I think does matter. She has the chewy top cups and hard cups like this and drinks from all of them. This thing, she won't even touch now after all my attempts.	
- 1	My son and I hated this tub. He was always sliding down, and he would cry during his bath time. There was really nothing I could do to help. He would slide left or right or down, especially when he was a newborn and couldn't support himself. Also, it wasn't easy to fold-up at all. I'm due in January with another, and I will definitely not be purchasing this. Spend a little more and get something much better!	
- 1	I'm addicted to Amazon and I love reading reviews and subsequently buying a LOT of here. All I can say is that I should have listened to others about this product. I really wanted to love it. I have the Playtex insulated sippy cups and they've always been AMAZING. However, I liked the idea of being able to see how much was left in his cup with this OXO sippy. Ugh, I should have just stuck with what works.What I like:- It's clear and has measurements so I can see exactly how much is left.- It's pretty cool looking.What I hate:- The lid and the grooves where it screws on is really cheaply made. Does not feel sturdy at all and one time my 20 month old son dropped it and the ENTIRE lid came off. Milk everywhere.- The rubber stopper/flow regulator ALWAYS seems to fall off and into whatever he's drinking. Therefore, you have to go fishing for it and then clean up the mess it made leaking all out.I'm pretty lenient with most things and usually can make most things work. Unfortunately this is isn't one of them. This thing is just junk. Save your money and get something else.	
1. 	The Dr. Brown's bottles come with a cleaner but its nice to have extras on hand in case one is lost. These cleaners work well at cleaning all the parts that come with the bottles.	
1. 	This bathtub is excellent because you can use it from birth to toddlerhood.  I started using this for my son's first bath and it was great.  I just put a towel underneath him and he was safe and secure.  Now he's over 20 months, and we still use it, and he's still very comfortable in it.  Sure, we could probably just use the bathtub, but this will use much less water and I feel he's much safer in it.  If he accidentally slips backwards, the sloping backrest catches him without injury.It's nice and big - for me, this is a plus as I think he'll continue to fit comfortably in it for at least another year.  However, if you have a really tiny bathroom that is shared with multiple people, this could be a drawback.How many baby products do you use, basically every day, for the first 3 years of baby's life?!  Not many.  Considering this fact, it's $25 well spent.Also, it might be nice for some to know: if the stopper/gasket breaks, the company will send you a replacement free of charge.  Given this fact, the bathtub could last for generations!  ;)	
- 1	When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security.  The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath.  Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down.We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper.The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us.	
1. 	This is fantastic!  It easily straps to any kitchen chair.  It also folds flat and you can throw it in the car when you travel.  The tray washes off easily too.  My only complaint is the tray liner has become really loose and my seven month old can pull it up off the tray.  I no longer use it for that reason.	
1. 	Was so glad that I didnt need to spend a ton of $$$$ for an electric breast pump.  This manual one did the trick and I had no complaints whatsoever. It's compact and very easy  to use.  I would definitely recommend this product to other moms out there on a budget.	
- 1	This cup states it is leak proof, but my son could not even drink out of it without it leaking horribly. He was not turning it upside down or anything crazy, just tipping it slightly to drink from it- immediately a fairly large stream of water would leak out from where the lid and cup screw together. I thought surely I just had the lid on incorrectly- but after repeated attempts and using this cup, it continues to leak horribly. I am returning this today.	
1. 	My baby loves this tub.  I have one question - why on earth would you pay $44.99 for this thing when you can buy it from Target for $9.99?!??  My daughter is 10 months old and we have been using this tub since she was 4 months old.  Love it but would never pay this much for it!!	
1. 	I bought this toy to hang from my infant daughter's car seat the day after she screamed nonstop in that seat while we were eating in a restaurant.  I really like the assortment of hanging toys.  The turtle has a mirror in the belly, the snail is a rattle and the butterfly is filled with colorful beads to shake.  I also like that I can hang the toy from the car seat handle in two ways - one to keep the hanging toys up high and spread out, the other to keep them hanging lower and group close together.  But, my favorite feature is the car-window hanger.  I might be tempted to keep the car seat handle up while we're driving so my baby could look at the toy (which would be a safety hazard), but having the suction cup on the window lets me move the toy off the car seat but still let my baby play with it while we're driving.  A great design and a great toy!	
1. 	I couldn't get comfortable using this item, so after the first try, I ended up washing it and giving it to a friend who wanted it. She has had more use out of it then I have.	
1. 	We bought this because we are going to grand parents and friends homes who don't have a high chair.  The price was right, and it folds down to a pretty portable size, about 2 large shoeboxes or so.  I much prefer my keekaroo for daily use at home, but we leave this one in the car trunk and we are always ready to go.  It's also nice when we have friends with kids over, we already have an extra chair for them.	
- 1	I was going to try blueberries, but my sister said that the blueberry skins are hard to get out of things like this.  We tried bananas instead.  I didn't realize bananas were so pulpy.  The brown pulp in the center of the banana (sorry if it has a real name) is like glue and got stuck on everything he was wearing.  His shirt and the washcloth were ruined.  After several washes it wouldn't come off and looked disgusting.  Thankfully we had one of those awesome Summer bibs, which weren't affected.  This has been sitting in a drawer ever since.	
- 1	My husband and I planned our last pregnancy and we researched and checked out everything! We were given the iglide by my mother for a baby shower gift. It was WONDERFUL for the first 8 weeks! My daughter slept in her swing on glide every night next to my bed. Around 8 weeks in, I noticed it would stop working when she woke up in the middle of the night. I'd put it on glide, check to make sure the lock was in place and it would do a half cycle then shut off. It worked fine in rock mode, but the glide had some kind of issue. My husband actually took the time to open it up and check the sensors and anything visible and it was all fine. I don't know what happened, but I was really disappointed.It also states it goes up to 22lbs, I don't see that happening. My daughter is currently 7 1/2 months and a little over 18 pounds and the thing doesn't move well. She hasn't been able to use it for several months due to it's inability to handle the weight.*sigh*I thought we did well in our research and product tryout. I guess I will go with a generic one next time.	
1. 	I got this because I have very, very limited space and it fits perfectly on top of my baby's armoire.  I put flannel receiving blankets down as covers-- they are easier to change out when soiled and have more uses than changing pad covers.	
- 1	Bought an used Ipod touch instead.  Downloaded whitenoise app.  Worked better.  this was not loud enough.  Was not impressed at all.	
- 1	Well, I bought these and I bought Bamboobies. These nursing pads were not absorbent enough, but also shrunk when I washed them. I washed the Bamboobies all the time and they do not shrink, they absorb well and they super soft.	
1. 	Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.	
- 1	Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside	
1. 	I was given this giraffe at my shower. I love it and was hoping my son would too.  Within 2 weeks of use (just for music as my son is too young to interact with it) the seam has opened up and the leg is falling off.  I don't know how this happened as it hasn't been used much. I feel like it was just not stitched well. I have contacted the company so I hope they will replace the giraffe.**Edit 2/27/13: I had contacted the company about this problem who asked me to send the giraffe back. We did so and have since received a brand new giraffe and are very happy.  I have changed the rating from two stars to five for the satisfying customer service.	
- 1	Please Please PLEASE do not use this aspirator without a back up!  It works great fresh out of the box, but six months after purchasing it I have laid it to rest in the garbage can.  It has multiple design flaws, the largest of which is that it requires fresh batteries every 2-3 days for frequent use.  And if your baby is congested, you need to use it frequently!  Thank heavens I ordered theBabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue)and it's arriving later today...since this one died 7 hours ago, and my poor baby is so congested he can't drink his bottle without throwing up!  :(	
1. 	I was told that you can warm up water in the microwave or just put it in a bowl full of hot boiling water. But, in the middle of the night after weeks of bad sleep, the last thing you want to do is exactly that!! With the avent express bottle warmer is the easiest way to warm up your bottles with less trouble. The only thing that I dont like of this product is that doesnt have an on/off switch. Otherwise, its great!!! ( avent products are the best out there...)	
- 1	These developed holes and shredded after only a couple of months.  They are too thin.  My OsoCozy Unbleached flats are a bit thicker and have held up wonderfully.	
- 1	I am not familiar with this brand, but this particular monitor is pretty bad. I would never pay asking price for this monitor. The battery life is terrible, the image quality is non-existant, and the range is poor. Forget about using it in the dark! It is quite grainy and sometimes, even when it's on and supposedly working, it's not producing video, or sound. I have had numerous instances when I was doing laundry, or the dishes and I thought the monitor was working, only to check on my baby and find that he was crying. I had no idea and felt awful. I stopped using it and and would not rely on it again, even if the company sent me a better-working version. I'm sure there are better options out there for the money. Avoid this one!	
- 1	These stuck to our windows okay (even in winter in Utah), but they hardly provided any shade. We returned them for something else. I wouldn't recommend them.	
1. 	I was initially concerned about spending so much on a play mat, but it is worth every penny. My 3-month-old daughter loves the rain forest gym and stays absolutely entranced with the brilliant colors, flashing lights and butterflies. This has also helped encourage tummy-time, which she hadn't previously been too keen on. I like the extra loops on varying levels that allow me to attach more of her toys. The only thing that would improve this product would be to have the butterflies spin on their own.	
- 1	This cradler just pushes my sons head forward rather than supporting it when he falls asleep. I bought this thinking that he would have a place to lay his head when falls asleep in the car but he hates it because the banana shape actually forces his head forward,	
1. 	I've had these installed on my son's dresser and bookcase for almost two years.  They seem very strong and I've pulled on the dresser with all my weight and they've held.  The great thing is that you can remove the zip tie style connector without having to cut anything (meaning they are reusable).  I've found it's not that easy to remove them because I have my furniture very close to the wall, so I don't have much clearance, but I've had to disconnect them a few times when my son throws toys back there.  Very good product that keeps my son safe.	
1. 	I heard this product from others, haven't use it for my love because it's a bit of bigger, I may use it later.	
- 1	These are indeed a very cute idea, but they don't really work.  Ideal if your baby sits perfectly still at a diaper change, but my baby never did!  (In fact, I don't know of any who do.)  I spent more time trying to keep this thing in place, and then the minute it slipped off, he peed anyway.  It's all part of the joy of having a baby boy!  Better just to work quickly, and you'll get quicker with practice.	
1. 	The twilight turtle is a great, functional item for any child's room! I ordered one for my son when he was about two and started having a fear of the dark.  I love how the the Twilight Turtle actually has the constellations and some educational value, and my son loves how it lights up his room like the night sky.  My son is now 4 years old, and it is part of his nightly routine to have the turtle on.  It is very durable,lights up the room well, and is not too bright. I also like how it automatically turns itself off, and lets you choose the color of the light. A great buy, and I plan on buying another when our baby decides he wants one as well!	
1. 	Great for baths! Or for those babies that love chewing on things lol. I always thing bath toys are fun for lil ones	
1. 	A must have (along with the side rails!)  The crib is 100% protected and it was really easy to attach.  Most importantly my son is 100% protected (no more paint flecks on his face) and 100% happy (because he can chomp on his crib to his heart's content).  Really easy to maintain, I machine wash (regular cycle) and hang dry mine and they have already survived 3 rounds of washing in the first month.	
1. 	We put these in our diaper bags, cars and when we travel. They are small enough for one diaper, but in a pinch can fit a few. They tie up nicely and keep the stink out. We use them after swimming for wet clothers and on rainy day changes at daycare. Great multi-use product.	
1. 	These are very handy snack holders.  Easy for tots to grab onto and hold.  I attach a handle to a No Throw strap for when she's in the stroller.I was disappointed that they don't all come with a stay fresh type of lid, so if you leave snacks in it for even a couple of hours, they do get stale very quickly.Today, I came up with a solution!  I noticed you can buy the lids to go over them to help keep the food fresh, OR...  *Drum roll please*  I happened to have an 8 oz. Daisy Sour Cream container lid lying around and VOILA - it fits perfectly snug over the rubbery top!  It's basically air tight!  I'm all about reusing/recycling so this was perfect!I'm so excited that I'll be able to fill up the snack cup, put the reused 8 oz. sour cream lid on it (on top of the rubbery part), and not worry that it will spill all over the diaper bag (it's not spill proof by any means!), and also that it should help to keep the snacks fresher!I was surprised at how flexible the rubbery top is - good because it won't hurt your baby's fingers, but bad because it doesn't rigidly stay in place (more spills).  My 20 month old daughter is getting really good about not pouring out all of her snacks, so these are getting more use now than they were a few months ago when purchased.Hold up fabulously in the dishwasher.I don't think I will buy any more of them, but I would recommend them for someone to try.**UPDATE**I have purchased another set of 2.  As my daughter gets older (27 months now), they are getting used a lot!  Before the snack catchers, I used to just let my daughter have a few pieces of snack in her lap (in the stroller).  I also occasionally let her eat snacks out of a ziploc bag, however, she will dump it out.  Going to go back to the snack catchers while shopping and see if she stops dumping snacks out.	
- 1	My babies only 9 lbs 5 oz at 2 months.  Skinny little girl.  I've been using Flip Covers on her with great success but got lured in by the cute patterns on the Best Bottom diapers.  The single row of snaps at the waist cause the flaps to stick out in the front.  The gussets are so bunched that they leave very significant red marks on her thighs.  I imagine those will be even worse when she doesn't have itty bitty thighs.  I wish I had just stuck with Flip covers.	
1. 	These pads have definitely come in handy. They are super absorbent, very easy to clean and a perfect size for many different things. When my daughter first came home I used them under her, on my counter near the sink to sponge bathe her. I have one on my changing table that came with my Pack n Play. I also use on on the floor under her activity gym (Sparkling Symphony Gym)since it doesn't include a mat. I also have two at Grandma's for changing and laying on the bed. They are used frequently and really do hold up to alot of abuse. I would recommend buying a pack even if you don't think you'll need them because I guarantee they will be put to good use.	
1. 	Our 14 month can't get enough of these great blocks. He stacks them, knocks them down, and generally has a great time playing with them. We rest assured knowing that there is no toxic paint on them, especially since these frequently end up in his mouth. We know he will enjoy them for years to come.	
- 1	Not sure, why its called safe sippy.Using it as a straw-cup it leaks everywhere. Horrible. Have not tried the sippy-option. Not using it anymore, because its a mess, if my 14 month drops it on the floor.Waste of money.Neat idea, poor execution.	
- 1	After washing, the fabric was extremely wrinkly and doesn't seem to hold up as well for its purpose. I would say if you feel comfortable not washing it at first, then do not wash.	
1. 	I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter.  Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-).  One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden.  But overall, this is a really great invention.	
- 1	We ultimately used them but they don't stay stuck and it's only because my daughter doesn't really care about these particular drawers that they haven't already been ripped off.	
1. 	Just what I needed. Overall loving this product so far and would recommend. No issues upon arrival. Happy about my purchase!	
1. 	Dont bother experimenting with other bottles, these are the best.  Baby has no hickups, no gas, and no other ailments caused by  bottle feeding.  Flow is fantastic and natural for baby.	
- 1	THESE ARRIVED BROKEN AND WHEN I TRIED TO INSTALL THEY DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL.  SO I DECIDED JUST TO RETURN THEM INSTEAD OF EXCHANGE SINCE THEY DIDN'T WORK.	
1. 	I have to try this pottie out this weekend...so it should be interesting to see if my kids want to use it or go run and hide from it.	
- 1	I must not have paid attention when I ordered these because I thought they were crib bumpers that go around the crib.  These zip around the slat of the crib so you need like 20-30 of them depending on how many slats your crib has.  I returned these because 2 doesn't do much, and to buy how many I would need would cost way too much!	
- 1	Todas estamos desesperadas cuando no sabemos porque no paran de llorar nuestros bebes. Pero tengan paciencia!!! una semana y se les pasaran los c&oacute;licos. Esto no lo necesitamos!!	
- 1	First I will tell you, I purchased this tub because I liked the idea of the baby being more fully submerged in the warm bath water, so as to avoid getting a chill. However, what I find is that getting my hands down in the tub with baby, to support and bathe him, is awkward. And I have small hands. If this product were shorter and wider, I would like it much better.	
1. 	I would've given this 5 stars, only I'm not sure if it was the blanket or just a coincidence?  I used the blanket for 2 days without much observance of any huge improvement in my 3 month old son's sleeping...but then again I left his arms out during those 2 days because I am trying not to swaddle him too often.  However, on the 3rd day, I swaddled him the correct way and he slept for a 7 hour stretch for the first time!  On the second night I swaddled him properly, he slept 6.5 hours.  So I'm guessing it was the miracle blanket, or it could be that he just turned 12 weeks and is starting to sleep longer stretches.  But so far, I have no complaints about this blanket!  Definitely worth a try.	
1. 	Of all things related to babies and toddlers etc, this one by far is THE absolute best invention by Fisher Price! With so many 4+ star reviews already, you know you got yourself a winner with this product.The durability, convenience, portability and overall use of this booster seat will end up being your best purchase ever. There's many imitators out there but the one by Fisher Price is the one you want in the end. Because the item breaks down into a neat little package, it saves space (especially if you live in a place where storage is limited) and makes it extremely easy to take with you to restaurants, events where eating is involved and even as a high chair rather than wasting twice (if not more) moo-la for a high chair that is bulky and can't go anywhere beyond your dinner table. It's dishwasher safe so you can easily break it down into the parts shown and add it with the rest of your dish load. The plastic is made of super durable and strong material so you don't have to worry about it cracking, breaking or warping. It comes with adjustable straps so it allows you to control the fit for your child when it's used, providing security from any tipping or accidental slide outs.And as always, Amazon offered the best price than anyone else (believe me, I checked!!!). Great functionality, great price, great use - what more can you ask for? &lt;(^.^)>	
1. 	This was a great project and really easy to use. It cleaned up easily and gave clear prints for our baby book.I ordered one set and there was plenty to do 2 hands and 2 feet.	
1. 	This bouncy seat is great.  It was so simple to assmeble and the parts are very well made.  My daughter is almost 2 months now and she really loves this seat.  She is comfortable and loves the vibration.  It usually puts her to sleep rather quickly.  I love how the toy arch is so easily removable.  While she sleeps I take the toy arch away and put it back on for her to play with when she awakens.  I look forward to many months of enjoyment from this seat.  I do hope it will become a reading chair when she is older, as the boy on the box shows.	
- 1	When I first recieved it, it looked really pretty and thick, but after a few washes it started to tear. I wouldn't recommend it.	
1. 	Your basic, sturdy little potty. Kids don't need all the flashy crap on the more expensive potties. The big toilet doesn't cheer or play princess music when you pee. Why set them up for disappointment? ;PMy son has no butt so he kind of doesn't fit on it and gets scared but maybe eventually his butt will get bigger or he'll get over it. Who knows haha.	
- 1	The spoon always tips and falls out of the baby's bowl...food goes everywhere. Opt for something with a lighter handle.	
1. 	I just purchased this today. My baby will be born on Dec. 30th and I have already put this together. It looks cuter in person than in the pictures. I like that u can add more Miracles & Milestones toys to it. I will have to do an update review once I get to actually use it. The mobile has a mirror on it so the baby can see herself. Cute colors too!	
1. 	this pump is great!  i'm not going back to work so i didnt need an expensive system.  in the beginning when breastfeeding is still uncomfortable, this pump was comfy.  i had to go back to the hospital after delivery, and couldnt bring the baby.  i used this pump 24 hours a day to keep my supply up.  that was when she was a week old.  i love it so much that it killed me to put away when i had to stop breastfeeding.  its quite speedy with getting the milk to flow.  easy cleanup and i was extremely happy with it.	
1. 	I have primarily used these travel bibs until I recently tried Bibsters.  I quickly switched back.  I like the crumb pocket design.  It holds well and catches food.  The neck closure has positives and negatives.  It is a sticky seal.  As long as you press it together well, it holds well.  My daughters pull on them, but quickly stop when they can't rip them off.  The problem is they have long hair and no matter how hard we try, we end up pulling their hair.  We put the bibs on in front (under their chins,) then twist the bib around.  After they eat, we rip the bib to remove on the side, rather than trying to open the seal.  This has reduced the hair pulling, but we cannot seem to keep it from happening completely.  Overall these are my favorites.  We have not had any issue with food leaking through the bib.	
- 1	I was rather disappointed in these sheets. They aren't at all soft to the touch, but are bumpy and a bit rough. I hoped that washing would improve the situation, but after several washings they're nearly as bad as when I took them out of the package. In addition, they have a strong astringent (chemical) smell which is - very slowly - being washed away.If you're looking for a soft organic crib sheet, I highly recommend this instead: [...]	
- 1	I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.	
1. 	I haven't had any issues with the suction cups staying stuck to the windows; but with that said, I did take a moist sponge to them before sticking them to the windows of my car and holding those suckers down for about 30 seconds. The issue I've had (which is so close to a non-issue it's not funny) is that the hot indicator stops being effective after a particularly hot day. It's been 40 degrees outside the past week and my hot indicators are still white. Also, do you really need a window shade to tell you that the car is warm inside?Other than the ridiculous white hot indicators I like these shades; they've been the most durable I've used yet over the past 2 years.	
- 1	I don't know if I should have forked out the money for a full sized Sophie to experience the magic but this little guy does nothing for my son.	
1. 	I LOVE this blanket and everytime someone sees it, they ask me about it.  I keep it in the car and we use it all the time.  Washing is fairly easy.  I put it in the machine but then air dry it as I don't think it would stand up to the dryer.  Great item!	
1. 	I have tried the Mobi wrap (which is like working with Rapunzel's hair) and the snap on carriers; both drove me nuts! The wrap was long, couldn't put it on in public places, had too much material for my size and the snap on carriers were bulky and uncomfortable. This is the first ring sling I have ever used and I am in love with it! The biggest pro is that it takes two seconds for you to put over your head to wear it. I don't have to try and rush wrapping 50 yards of fabric around my body or try to reach snaps while I have a baby screaming at me. I am a foster parent and right now I have a 3 month old boy and a newborn girl; this helps me tremendously! I can shove this in a small diaper bag perfectly!*One thing I will mention is the first five times I tried it I felt like I was doing it wrong. The video's didn't help me, I just had to keep trying with the baby in different positions until we both got used to it. The 3 month old loves it! The newborn is so tiny that I am afraid to put her in yet.	
1. 	I've been using the infant bathtub for about 3 months since our daughter was born, and was hating it more and more - I didn't like that the baby kept sliding down, and water was barely covering her legs. I started looking for a deeper bath tub, but found this seat instead. I think it's better, although, not superb. Baby doesn't slide down, and when the seat is in the normal bath tub I can regulate water level. She seems to love it too, btw! I also loved the price tag, and decided that it was worth a try. I now have no problem washing my baby alone (before it was very hard, because it was hard to hold the baby and wash her at the same time) I'm thinking about getting the smaller tub from IKEA, like one of the reviewers wrote, and place the seat in there.	
1. 	I have to clean mine about once a week with using it for both of my boys. I really love this chair and we take it with us everywhere. It doesn't fit tables that have a leaf stored underneath it, which has been inconvenient.	
- 1	Too small. It is harder/denser that the Boppy, but this also makes it more rigid, making it a little more difficult to position the baby	
1. 	This is a good bib.  The waterproof material and pocket to catch things have made my life easier.  Recently my son gave himself strangulation marks trying to pull this off, so I have stopped using any bibs.	
1. 	Our 9 month old has been known to throw a tantrum or two.  Changing, feeding, bathing, all can become a battle of wills and a test of our patience.  All that said...  she has never given us even an ounce of hassle about brushing her teeth.  When she sees either my wife or I coming with the little finger tip brush, she opens right up and let's us brush her teeth...  all two of them.  While she does bite down, she hasn't bitten down with the force of the other reviewer's kid, and for that I guess I'm grateful.  Anyway, the toothpaste is apparently great tasting and my only advice is to remember to replace the finger tip brush the same as you would any toothbrush.  It wears just the same, and in fact, ours wore down before we finished the toothpaste that it came with.If you are need for a product to clean your baby's teeth/gum, I recommend this one.	
- 1	Couldn't find a table that it would attach to. I ended up returning it and got the cheap $20 booster chair from target that works great!	
- 1	I purchased this step stool along with the Munchkin folding stepstool. I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height.  The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees.  An intersting design!  However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!	
1. 	Love this product - good price, easy to install, and works well.  I've only had one intermittent problem with the product, which I describe in the update at the end of this review.This product was easy to install and came with the hardware needed to do so - namely, a longer center screw.  Two nice touches: 1) the screw head is painted white so that it blends in with the cover, and 2) the cover comes with a thermal gasket to insulate the wall opening around the socket and hopefully save you energy/money.  (Note: if you buy the bulk pack of these, you only get 5 thermal gaskets for the 25 covers.  But if you buy the single outlet cover, which is what this review covers, every cover comes with a thermal gasket.)  All you need to install your outlet covers is a flat-head screwdriver.  One reviewer mentioned having to go to the hardware store to get a longer center screw.  Not sure if Mommys Helper has started including a longer screw in response to customer complaints, if this reviewer  just didn't notice the included screw, or he got a defective cover.  In any case, all of mine came with the necessary hardware.The product also seems sturdy and to work very well.  When the center screw is tightened, it fits firmly against the wall, just like the original outlet cover. The sliding covers snap back very smoothly and quickly when you unplug something. My baby hasn't yet shown an interest in electric outlets, but as well as these covers seem to be designed, I don't see how he'd be able to get to the socket with these covers installed.  (I'll update this review as he gets older if he figures out how to circumvent the sliding covers, but I'd be surprised if he did.)Note: this particular version of the product works only for outlets with one center screw, so if you have a different style outlet, you'll need a different baby-proofing solution for your outlets.UPDATE, January 2012: I've discovered one problem with these outlet covers, and it has caused me to dock one star from my initial rating.  Namely, sometimes when I plug a really heavy plug - or more often, a plug with a long heavy cord attached to it - into outlets fitted with these covers, the plugs have a hard time keeping contact with the socket.  For example, when I use my carpet shampooer, which has a fairly heavy plug and cord, the power supply to the shampooer will sometimes waver, causing the shampooer to flicker on and off, even though the plug looks like it's seated properly in the outlet.  Normally, just pressing the plug more firmly into the outlet fixes the problem, but occasionally it does not, and then it's maddening to try to shampoo!  I only have this problem with a couple of outlets in the house, and I can't figure out what makes these outlets different, so I basically just try to avoid using them when I'm running the shampooer.	
- 1	The old model had horrible motor issues and this is no better just a new color. The slides are the same, music is the same and the same bad motor, very loud and gets stuck. Mine lasted 2 weeks and the motor stopped working. Exchanged it and that one last less than a week. All you do it plug it in and turn it on or off, how hard is that? Wish the company would make this better quality. The Munchkin one is way better and lasted longer for us. Still working now 3 months later.	
- 1	Thought this was a great idea. Cute & kid-friendly...But I wouldn't know because it broke before I could even test it.  Not meant to be dropped on the floor, so I don't see how it would survive long if a child used it.  Disappointing.  Not fixable.Let me note that before I dropped it, it wasn't charging properly, the blue glow kept skipping completely, and the color changing mode was not a smooth transition. Probably not a good idea for epileptics.	
1. 	This conversion kit allows me to pump into the large 9 oz Avent bottles, which is very helpful as the Medela bottles only allow up to 6 oz.	
- 1	I found I liked other product designs better and we really didn't like the aquaduck color selections. Just not my favorite product.	
1. 	Fits my Baby Jogger City Select perfectly. My stroller has a very thick, square handle bar and it fits with plenty of room to spare.	
1. 	This was easy enough for my toddler to put on the toilet. It's simple to clean and fits well. We very much preferred this over the potty seat that doesn't sit on the toilet - my son wanted the &#34;real thing&#34;. We really love this toilet trainer.	
1. 	My baby love this toy! it is colorful and cute and keeps her entertained for hours! this is a great choice for a gift too!	
1. 	I love these bibs! At a glance, they are pricy. But in the long run, these are far cheaper than the cheap bibs I could've picked up at my local Target or Walmart.  We have some cheapies and they quickly curled and the velcro lost its stickiness. These are machine-washable and the velcro has held up well. They have been used for several months at our house and ours still look new. I'd highly recommend these bibs!	
1. 	These are the exact same ones that came with our Medela breast pump. It's nice to have a spare set!	
1. 	We bought my son a Bumbo and were really excited about him being big enough to use it. Once he was capable of sitting up without support, we started feeding him in the Bumbo and putting him in it to play with his toys. He really enjoys his time in the Bumbo. After hearing about the recall, we realized how ridiculous it was... we would NEVER leave our son unattended in the seat. As a result, he thoroughly enjoys spending SUPERVISED time in the seat.Ultimately, he doesn't spend quite as much time in the chair as I though he would... therefore, while I was pregnant, I thought it would be a necessity, but looking back, I would probably add it to the nice to have column.	
1. 	Very nice bibs - practical, light, easy to clean, wonderful colors and pattern. Unlike the Baby Bjorn plastic one, which I also like, my son can't open these up and take them off. I have about 20 regular bibs, which I won't use at all, after I got these. Definitely recommend them.	
1. 	I have to try this pottie out this weekend...so it should be interesting to see if my kids want to use it or go run and hide from it.	
- 1	Some people rave about fuzzy bnz but I did not like them.  They ran small.  They have the snaps but they are much smaller than other brands.  Once my baby was around 9 months the diapers seemed small even with the adjustments let out.  They also leaked.  They worked well when she was newborn and not urinating much but around 6 months a fuzzy bunz could not be left on for half an hour.  They leaked around the legs every time.  If she poo'd it too would leak out the legs.	
- 1	I'm on my second unit now(after three months) and this one is starting to die. Im simply going to list its short comings and you make up your mind.-The unit turns off more than twice every night, so you wake up to your child screaming from across the house, not weeping in the monitor so we can help before my 10 month old cant figure out why were not there for him.-The battery life changes from day to day but I'd say on average this battery lasts four hours or so.-The microphone occasionally turns on my daughter tells me and she can hear our conversations.-The range changes from day to day but somedays you can go across the house or somedays you can barely be across the room.--Every fourth or fifth time you turn on the monitor it either displays a dozen random colors, won't turn on at all or displays a garbled mess of the two cameras accompanied by a large popping noise! Yippee!So ask me if Id buy this thing again, I'd say absolutely not. I'd expect problems like this from a five year old monitor that's been on since it was taken out of the box, not a month old second unit that is used 8 hours a day.-Cheap Chinese Crap-  CCC	
1. 	Very portable easy to attach and take off chairs, small and lightweight. We keep this at my parents house during the week since they watch our 8 month old while I work, and take it with us whenever we go anywhere to eat so we don't have to use those yucky highchairs at restaurants!	
1. 	After reading some neg comments abt this I wasn't sure what to expect but all I can say is - get it and you won't be sorry. Works great - DOES have plenty of volume contrary to some reports and is easy to use	
1. 	Good product. Fit my medela swing pump so I save directly in fridge or freeze.	
- 1	These are kind of flimsy unless you screw in all the parts. We didn't want to ruin our cabinet doors so didn't screw in the hook part. Maybe that's our fault because if my 15 month old pulls hard, she can yank the whole thing off. The lock also sometimes jam so it's hard to close the door unless you take the whole hook out and you have to maneuver in a way to get it to unjam.	
- 1	This thing is crap. I have tried it many times and it just is not accurate at all. I can put it the same place the same way and it says different readings. I had one before that did work for a while then it just quit but this one came not working accurately. I know how to use it I have worked in a hospital where they have the expensive hospital grade artery thermometers but this one really just is not accurate. Rather go for the old fashioned kind then this waste of money.	
- 1	I ordered this for our 2nd vehicle and it served its purpose well, except for the fact that the leg holes are are too small.  I ordered it because of the low price, but paying a little more for bigger leg holes may be best. It was always a struggle/hassle to get my son's feet/shoes through them or out of them.  After only 2 weeks of having it, we were ready to buy a replacement like the Bright Starts Comfort & Harmony Cozy Cart Cover, Calypso Blue cover we already had. It usually took 2 of us to get his feet in/out.  He's 22 months, so maybe this works better for younger kiddos.  Needless to say, we lost it while on vacation (it must have fallen out of the trunk while pulling out the stroller), so I'm ordering a different brand today.	
- 1	I wanted to purchase a diaper bag that didn't look like one.  But I do wish I had searched around more.  The Diaper Dude is bulky.  It's hard to find what you are looking for in the larger storage area and it's always in the way.  A backpack-style bag would have been a better option.	
- 1	We were very disappointed with this monitor (and in fact are returning it).Pros:It has good range.I think the battery life seems good, but that's based on only about a week of use.Its voice trigger seems to work okay (it filters out the music of the mobile on the crib, but not the white noise function on the white noise maker).Cons:It is REALLY LOUD STATIC! We can tell when baby is making noise, but we can't hear what sort of noises are there because the static is overpowering.It makes random beeps-- sometimes a couple times an evening, sometimes a few times an hour. I'm not sure what's causing that.Anyway, the static was a deal breaker for us, and we're returning it.	
1. 	We have 3 big dogs and this gate works perfectly to keep them in or out. I love that it is secured into the door frame and that it is so simple to open and close!!!	
1. 	They worked great when my son was 6 mo &  7 mo.But, not after that - it was taking him too long to get through his milk after that... more than 20-25 minutes to finish 5 ounces! Bedtime especially had become a really long ordeal. I switched toPhilips AVENT BPA Free Natural Fast Flow Nipples, 2-Packafter that - its so much faster now!	
1. 	I wouldn't use on an 8+ month old (or so), because it really isn't that good for a sitter upper who isn't very good at safely climbing off things, and worse for an active toddler trying to climb on everything.It was very nice before then, because it laid back nicely and reclined nicely, and it looked comfortable for a little baby, and later less reclined for an emerging sitter.  It was also good for training him to drink a bottle by himself, and he seemed very comfortable in it.I used it one day with my 16 month old, when he was very sick and just wanted to recline and relax in front of the TV.  The next day, he was once again trying to climb up the back of it, and I had to put it back away.  Not that a toddler wants to sit around in a chair anyway.	
1. 	Our newborn desperately needed to be swaddled in order to feel calm, and this swaddle was the best one we bought.  The all-in-one design is superior to 2-piece swaddles because there is no way the swaddle can ride up and get around the baby's face.  There is also less velcro to contend with in the laundry.  We used this not only at night, but whenever our newborn went ballistic during the day - just a few minutes in it calmed him down.	
1. 	I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.	
1. 	I really like this stool. It's sturdy and well-build. Only complaint is that it could be a little wider for me. I like to keep my feet apart somewhat when I nurse.Amusingly, my toddler thinks this is his chair and uses it when we read books before bed time.	
- 1	This mattress looks like a good deal, but it's not. 4 months in and it is sunken in where my son sleeps. If he's on his stomach (which he can do since he rolls over) then his face can easily fall into one of the indentations in the mattress and I worry about him not getting fresh air. It also smelled really strongly of plastic for a week and we had to let it air out. We are going to try and return the mattress for a better one.	
1. 	This is much better than the curved bottom munchkin formula dispenser we bought at the store.  This one has a more positive lock.  That being said it still isn't perfect at keeping the sections segregated.  It also can let a small amount out when tossed around in a diaper bag.  Overall though it functions pretty well.  The curve at the opening allows for the formula to dispense quite easily and the call had never came off accidentally even in the diaper bag.	
- 1	November 25, 2011 update:I have dropped my review from the original 5-star last January, to today's 2-star.  After 10 months of use, things about the monitor are horribly wrong.  First, the battery included with the monitor quit on us about 4 months ago.  Won't hold a charge anymore.  The instruction manual said to contact Motorola for replacement.  So I did.  THE BATTERY IS UNAVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE.  So Motorola sells a baby monitor with a rechargeable, replaceable battery but they no longer carry the actual battery.  I even Googled the battery and I can't find even a 3rd Party selling it.Second, I commented originally that the parents' monitor needed a larger footprint.  This has become such a annoyance.  Even in the light, even with us awake, the monitor is nearly impossible to stand.  It invariably will back onto its front or back.  It is nearly impossible to stand upright.Why still 2-stars instead of one?  While it has to remain plugged in, the monitor is an awesome monitor.  Clear, no snaps or pops.  We get incredible range within our home.  It still is very handy and used daily.January 2011 reviewI was surprised to find Motorola making a monitor.  You just don't see them in stores.  But knowing Motorola's rep with regards to handheld radios, I figured if Motorola was making a monitor, it must be pretty good.  It is.  We get good distance with the unit and more importantly get loud operation with no annoying blinky lights going off in the master bedroom as we sleep.Good looking monitor too.  My only drawback and it is minor, is that the parents' monitor needs a larger footprint.  It is a very tall unit for the size of its base.	
1. 	Smells so good and seems to work well for cradle cap!  It's a good amount of the money, too. Love it!	
- 1	Read the great reviews, but very disappointed with this cup.  The lid has so many grooves and crevices, which makes it impossible to clean well.  Its difficult to control the amount of water coming out, and a pain to get it just right.	
1. 	I bought these to shake the bottles and to put on the bottle to prevent them leaking in the diaper bag. They never leak and they can be sterilized over and over. I use the Dr. Brown's steam sterilizer. Great product...worth every penny!	
1. 	This item is awesome. My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight. No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out. There's no way of getting out of this one. My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one. The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot. So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating. I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.	
- 1	Too many nooks, crannies, and parts to clean!  Milk also got trapped in the lid/straw area, and there is no way to open up that area to wash.  My toddler had trouble opening up the cap, so I always had to help him with that.  I even had trouble opening the lid a few times.  It was also very difficult to sip liquid from the straw.  I ended up having to remove the plastic covering from the valve to get liquid out.  I like the size and shape of the cup, but it has too many design flaws.	
- 1	Baby just slides out of it! Pushes his legs and slides out ! Sue the manufacturer for unsafe product! gotta return this one and get a 4-sided instead.	
1. 	Ever since utero, our son loved being curled up in a ball. When he was an infant we had him in the HALO SleepSack that tucked his arms in also (wrapped him like a burrito). As he got older, he liked moving his arms around so we purchased this. It was always perfect for him and he slept better with it on (we removed it and he slept terribly those nights). We started moving away from the sleep sacks at about 10 months old and he now just wears pajamas.	
- 1	If this bottom of this product was just flat, it would probably work fine.  However, it has a little raised ring on the bottom, I'm assuming to help it seal better.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit our tub.	
1. 	After recently having a baby after waiting 13 years between this one and my next youngest child I was just like a brand new parent all over again. These bottles were great to have. The cap fits snuggly on the bottle so there is not spillage in the diaper bag and the design is great for both baby and the person feeding.	
1. 	Nipples are not one size, neither should these shields. The standard size was restricting the milk extracting, made the switch and we are swimming in it!	
1. 	I ordered this product before our son was born, and along with all the other things I bought along my pregnancy and after he was born I forgot about it, after two months of waking up every two hours to nurse I remembered it... swaddled our 10 week old son and to sleep he went for four hours..( dont let them sleep to long studies show babies get most of there nutrition at night time feeding...read on about.com) anyway he woke up, ate, and went back to sleep after a diaper change in it. he's napping better in it now! Thanks so much! Well worth the $ spent on it!	
1. 	This little fence/playpen is one of the best things we bought for our daughter since her birth! We bought this PLUS one 2 panel extension...and put it on an 8' x 6' puzzle mat! It gives her a huge space to play in while we are able to make meals, do dishes etc... without having to worry about not having our hands on her constantly. We have had as many as 4 adults in the pen with her at the same time...and had more than enough room. Way better option than one of the TINY traditional playpens that really are like little baby jails!One suggestion is that when we first got this we set it up in a square at almost 6' x 6' However, when you have two panels straight together...it isn't super stable...it works only OK. If you think...Octagon and bend the fence a little between each panel...it is way more stable and works fantastic!!!Highly recommend this product. Daughter learned to stand in here AND started cruising all around the pen within days of standing. Would give it 10 stars if I could. Oh last thing, it comes apart and folds up very easily for transport...we take it with us to the grandparents house to use when they watch her for us and when we just visit overnight!	
1. 	I bought this when my son was born 27 months ago and have never had one problem with it.  Replacing the moist pad is easy and affordable.  They last for a few months if you soak them in water to clean them between wipes refills.  I could not have lived with out this wipes warmer the past two years of changing diapers.  I highly recommend it!	
- 1	I don't know if my house is the problem but even with this stepping stool my almost 2 year old can't reach the sink.	
1. 	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.	
- 1	Every time I scan I get a different reading, even when using it on myself. It's OK to give you a ballpark number on older kids, but you end up scanning over and over for an average.Our pediatrician requested a temperature reading from a rectal thermometer for our infant which she said was most reliable. Yet, they use ear scanners in her office. I probably should have gotten one of those instead.	
- 1	I have a PIS pump, and this replaced the tubing that fits my pump, 87212. However, for some reason I couldn't get enough suction using these to actually pump milk. Only one of the original tubes that came with my pump needed to be replaced, so when I switched to the Medela tube from this one it worked perfectly. I'm disappointed.	
1. 	This is an excellent mattress.  Good firmness and support but not too hard.  Baby sleeps wonderfully on it every night and most all naps.  Standard sheets fit it well, and it's light enough that's it's very easy to lift out of the crib for sheet changes.  Great buy!	
1. 	We got these for our twins (now 3 years old) and we LOVE them.  The boys had to have cereal in their formula and they couldn't get it out of the fast flow nipples.  I found that they work Great for a little cereal and when we got to the point that we were giving them more cereal in their formula (we called it formula shakes) I cut 1 tip of the the Y part and it was perfect.  You may not have to do this with your little one, we did because they both had alot of trouble sucking so this assisted them.  Don't cut to far or it will rip.  I also found that you have to buy new nipples every once in a while because they can split BUT it's worth it.  Do what works for you.  These were perfect for us.	
- 1	This potty seat worked well for us, but only for about the first 3-4 months.  When we were at the beginning stages when we were placing him on the seat ourselves, it worked great.  He was very secure and comfortable.  It was also easy for him to put on and off on his own.Now that he wants to be more independent and go all by himself, he finds it difficult to climb onto because it sits so high up off the top of the toilet seat.  Some mentioned that it was easy to clean.  I agree...but only in regards to the smooth topside.  The bottom side is a different spongy 'texture' that I find more difficult to get clean (almost seems like it's permeable and absorbs pee stains).  The other downside that revealed itself after some time was the cracking of the inside of the seat that is shown by others in their customer photos.  I also felt like the suction cups lost their sticking ability after a short time (not a huge problem though, because it doesn't really move around a lot).I am back here on Amazon again looking for one that doesn't sit as high up off the toilet seat and is a solid surface that will be easier to clean.	
1. 	Child refuses to keep a blanket on. They are great on my now 16 month old who has figured how to take her pants (and occasionally diaper) off, but has not figure out the upside down zipper!	
- 1	When I first started researching diaper covers this one came highly recommended.  Why?!  It doesn't have leg gussets, so there isn't that extra protection from blow outs.  The fabric is stiff and seems really uncomfortable.  This is my least favorite diaper cover.  I think the proponants for this cover like the durability of it.  Yes, you can probably wash it a thousand times and it will work fine, but there are so many better covers out there that will do the same.  If you are looking for an all around comfortable yet durable cover check out Thirstys Duo Wrap.  The fabric is water proof but very pliable.  You may have to treat it a little kinder than this stiff plasticly thing, but you baby will be able to move around and not feel like he/she's wearing a plastic shower curtain.  Another great cover is Kissaluv's Marvel.  It is in between the Whisper Wrap and Thirstys Duo Wrap in terms of stiffness, but the fabric is sooooo water (and poo) resistant and becasue it's a solid color it doesn't stain (except the white obviously).  Happy hunting!  Please don't waste your time with this cover!	
1. 	I like this changing pad cover. It is easy to put on and off, and it has cut outs for the safety straps. It is really soft and comfy!	
1. 	This bib covers the whole front of the baby's body including his shoulders, upper arms and the whole belly. The pocket does not necessarily stay open to catch all the food, but if you have your baby seated in something with some kind of a tray, you can just lay the bib on the tray and it catches the food pretty well that way. It's made of very durable waterproof fabric, and I like that the white rims are made of the same fabric too. It's super easy to clean. I usually wipe it with a wipe on the go, and then come home and wash it in the sink and hang it dry. I would wash it after a use and it's usually completely dry for the next meal. I have washed them in a washing machine and they came out in perfect shape. They fold up very compactly. I just fold one and roll it up with a spoon and keep it in my diaper bag with his food.	
1. 	they are easy to use and operate.  Baby can't take off or manipulate, and they kinda look stylish lol...i constantly get compliments. maybe they are joking when complimenting, but i really do love these things.	
1. 	I use this under our co-sleeper mattress and it works great.  It gives our baby the lift she needs in her crib and it is a safe height.	
- 1	I got this chair for my boy when he was only about a month old so I didn't try it right away but it did look cheap and way too much plastic exposed. I started putting my baby in it when he was 3 months old and this chair is horrible the back is completely flat which lets the baby slide from side to side and down, the cover is way too thin not even soft enough to let the baby sit there for more then a few minutes. The sliding and the cheap cover turned out to not even be the worst part when my baby began eating solids this chair is even worse since the straps are hanging in from of the baby and he prefers to eat those instead of the food! I wish we didn't throw the box right away I would've retuned it.	
1. 	This is the best &#34;teether&#34;gets in the tough areas and he doesn't realize he is brushing his teeth.I have a million teethers and toothbrushes. This is the ONE to buy	
1. 	Well made durable and I love the cushioning. Especially for a younger baby or preemie like ours.I wish they had more colors/	
- 1	The suction cups won't stick to the formica around our tub.  I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile, but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can't get it to stick either.  Now that I think about it, suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too, so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder.  This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money, I'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead.  I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.	
1. 	I purchased a Tiny Love Gymini, FP Ocean Wonders Aquarium, and some other misc. toys to entertain our little one (now 2m).  I thought they were cute.  He couldn't care less about them....at least not right now.  He loved this mobile from the moment it was pulled out of the box.  He will stare at it, talk to the animals, coo, and giggle.  It keeps him entertained for a whole 15 min. and sometimes longer which gives me time to put in a load of laundry, grab a quick bite to eat, and etc.  He'll even stare at it when he's not in the crib, which keeps him entertained during diaper changes.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Two thumbs way up!	
- 1	This material was so thin that the pattern on the pillow showed through.  It also had a waxy feel which may have been for waterproofing, but not what I wanted.  I have a softer organic cotton cover that I greatly prefer.  Would not buy again.	
1. 	If you happen to live in a tiny studio without a full kitchen this is a great thing to have.  Sterilizes your bottles in minutes and keeps it sterilized up to 24 hours.	
- 1	This spout cover does not serve it's purpose.  It is so hard that there isn't much different between hitting your head on a metal spout or hitting your head on a metal spout with this hard piece of plastic over it.It also does not fit a standard spout and has not flexibility to it to make it fit.  We tried it and our spout was an 8th of an inch shorter than where the hole was on this so it kept filling with water and shooting it out the back.We returned this item and purchased an inflatable spout cover which is far superior.  It's softer and because it's inflatable, it's easy to flec it around your spout no matter what the size.	
1. 	I got this so I could put my son in the Bob stroller without using a car seat.  At 5 weeks it worked great - he was cozy and snuggled and very well supported.  I compared this to the snuzzler in the store and IMO this one was much thicker and more supportive.  In the store the price was about the same between the two so I went with this one.  Love it!	
- 1	Melts all over the place. Very messy.	
- 1	They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick. It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated !!! Think of nightime feeding !!!!	
1. 	This is perhaps the one #1 MUST HAVE item I would recommend to alllll parents. They tell you, you can swaddle a baby yourself with a blanket but good luck finding a blanket with the right proportions and establishing a good tie down that doesn't unravel. The Miracle Blanket is foolproof, is the perfect size (even as your baby grows), it never unravels, AND it allows your baby's hips room to grow.PROS:SoftEasyDurableMachine washableUser friendlyHip wiggle roomCONS: NAWould I recommend it? YES! I recommend this product to every parent I know.Important note: My baby was in the 90% percentile for height and it fit great even when she was 4 months old. My husband and I were sorry when the baby started rolling and we couldn't use it anymore. The Miracle Blanket is a godsend and I really believe it's the reason she has learned to sleep through the night.	
1. 	This worked great for when my baby was in daycare. We packed her lunches in it. We also use it for nearly every car ride to take snacks and drinks with us. It has held up very well with heavy, every day use. I will be purchasing again for my next little one. I highly recommend this plus the Medela ice pack (it's curved so it fits bottles well).	
- 1	Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!	
- 1	Thin but not invisible. Flat with no shape at all. Hurt nipples cuz of weird surface and material. Dont buy! Safe your money. Buy Evenflow!	
1. 	We had other, more conventional monitors, but as my son co-sleeps with us, we wanted to be able to keep an eye on him if we couldn't be in the room with him, as he falls asleep before us. This monitor has freed up our lives, and we will never part with it. As a bonus, you can buy an extra camera through the manufacturer, and set it up in another room... that way you can use one channel for one room, and the other for another (like if you have two kids!). THe color feature isn't that great, but that isn't a big deal for me. Also, the night feature is excellent; it casts no ambient lighting in the room at all, but works perfectly. Buy this monitor!	
- 1	I was really excited for the Skip Hop Elbow Rest. We currently use the very popularAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Bluebut I don't like how bulky and difficult it is to stow away between baths. This elbow rest seemed to solve all of my problems, it even has a handy loop to hang it up.Out of the package I was excited to see that it has Velcro to keep the side flaps tucked together when not in use. It also has a nice, thick pad to protect parents' elbows.Unfortunately, that is where my excitement ends. I have sliding shower doors and the flaps of the elbow rest aren't long enough to reach over the door tracks and attach to the tub wall. The elbow pad itself is only 16 inches long (6.5 inches shorter than theAquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue). For me the elbow rest has two functions. To keep my elbows comfortable and more importantly to protect my son from the shower door tracks if he slips in the tub. This doesn't come close to covering the edge of the tub. I don't expect it to cover the entire tub but 1/3 of it would be nice. On the flip side are a total of 3 suction cups. 1 on the tub side and 2 on the parent side. My sons likes to take apart everything, I doubt that is enough suction cups to keep it securely attached to the tub when a toddler is involved.If I were Skip Hop I would add at least 4 inches to the length, 1 inch to each of the flaps, and more suction cups. Then they would have the perfect elbow rest.I've added photos to the customer images section. Check them out and please let me know if you find them helpful! Thanks!	
1. 	I love this product.  I put it in my baby's bassinet and it keeps him right in the middle of the bassinet.  Plus it's a little softer than than the thin cushion my bassinet came with.	
- 1	This cup leaks unbelievably. It's almost impossible to stop it. I've tried tightening it as hard as I could and barely tightening it at all and everywhere between. At best, the lid drips slowly. At worst water comes out like there's no lid at all. My wife heard great things about this cup and insisted upon getting it. After reading the reviews I insisted we get this and the Lansinoh cup. We're both very happy we bought the other one. The Lansinoh cup is more round than we'd like, but it seals great and I really have no complaints. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the weight at the bottom of the straw is well designed and allows you to get all the liquid inside.	
1. 	Just perfect !!! works great, small, easy to use very practical! For the price it's great! Work with my glass and plastic bottles...	
1. 	I like the crib. My last crib was about 19 years ago. They have changed - a lot.It was much easier to assemble than I expected. When my son was nearing the point that I needed to lower the mattress, I was cringing at the thought. As it turned out, my grief was all for naught. Four screws out, then back. It was done.Sturdy it seems. Some thread-lock might have been a plus. It seems the sides get a little loose now and then. A simple screw driver fixes that, but you have to be alert to the potential for things getting too loose.Lastly, there are bite marks 3/4 of the way around the front and sides. Good thing these are the rails that will go away as the crib converts into a bed.I liked it so much I got a second one for my daughter who is still in a bassinet.	
- 1	The reason I dislike this pacifier is because the grip handle stays up and hits our son's nose... it annoys him, he cries... and it kinda defeats the purpose of the pacifier - it shouldn't agitate him!	
1. 	Better than most. We send these off to daycare as they are cheap and we do not care if they get lost. Solid bib.	
- 1	Our spout has the knob for the shower closer to the wall instead of the end of the spout, so this was completely useless.  It's a bummer because the whale is cute and serves a good purpose.  Maybe I missed it in the description somewhere, oh well.	
1. 	My son could not get enough of these.  We would put a piece of melon in them and put them in the freezer, he would get so happy and excited as soon as he saw the colors and knew he was getting some relief and some sweet melon.  We tried grapes, bananas, carrots, and several other things.  The veggies did not go over so well, the bananas were kind of hard to clean but most of the other fruits were great.	
- 1	I had read the reviews about how short it is and I still bought it.  Wrong move, womp womp.  I don't like that you have to get your arm placed PERFECTLY in order for it to do it's job.  My husband hates it because he doesn't carry it on his arm and has to take it off every time he wants to pick up the car seat.  If the baby is sleeping when he wants to take the cushion off, baby will wake up for sure because of the loud velcro.	
- 1	After reading all the positive reviews I went out and purchased this item and was disappointed at how difficult it was to use with one hand.  Think about it....in most cases you're going to be holding a squirming infant in one arm and trying to put this thing on a shopping cart or high chair with the other.  It does come bundled up in it's own cute little sack, but it takes two hands and about 30 seconds to actually work the thing out of it's sack.  Once out, it's not super easy to get on the cart with one hand but can be done.  No biggie there...the real trouble comes when you're done shopping and you once again have your squirming infant in one arm and are trying to remove and repackage your floppy seat.  This thing is not small and trying to get it back into it's cute little sack takes some doing. And because it's so big, it's not the kind of thing you want to keep out all the time, loose from it's baggie. Too much work I say, for something that could and should be more convenient.  I exchanged mine for a Buggy Bagg. At first I balked at the price of the Buggy Bagg but later realized it is worth the extra 20 bucks.  Super easy to open, set up, remove and store all with one hand.  Plus it's got a ton of room in the diaper bag compartment so when we go out shopping or dining we don't need a diaper bag anymore.	
1. 	This towel is very cute and does it's job well.  It' not as thin and flimsy like a lot of baby towels but it could be a little bigger.	
1. 	I like to keep lots of these on hand.  Make sure you pick the colors you want if you are picky.	
- 1	Be aware these pacifiers are MUCH harder than the 0-3 month ones. I ordered several two packs and it didn't say what age they were for. When they showed up one said 3m+ on them and when I went to wash them I noticed they felt a bit less squishy but I didn't think anything of it. Well my eight month son is not having it. I gave him one, he put it in his mouth sucked once and then took it out, looked it over, and threw it! He's done it every time I've given it to him, he hates them and I've given up. I feel I should mention he was started on these in the NICU and won't take any other type of pacifier. So if you're concerned your kid might not like them, buy from a store where you can easily return them.`	
1. 	Love this safety item - has made my life so much easier.  Plus my granddaughter likes it too.	
- 1	I did not receive what is pictured, although I was a bit prepared for this by the other reviews.  I was hoping that the seller would have corrected the problem, but apparently not. I received a bracelet that is basically a bunch of big rubber balls on an elastic cord.  The balls are large enough to prevent me from wearing it to work, because it interferes with typing.I have also noticed that the rubber balls collect &#34;stuff&#34; like dust and lint.  Because of this, it either needs to be kept in a plastic bag (which means I could have saved myself a lot of money and bought a regular teether) or it needs to be scrubbed down and air-dried before handing it to baby.	
- 1	I've never had a problem cutting my baby's nails with other nail clippers but I thought the magnifying glass would make it easier. I actually cut her finger trying to use the magnifying glass. It's difficult to use and pretty useless. I won't be using it again.	
- 1	We originally bought this for our son, who didn't like it very much, so we only used it once or twice. Our daughter DOES like the swing to sleep in (she is a newborn and likes the motion), but since reassembling it after storing a few months, the motion dial to modulate how fast the speed of swing is no longer works. It also has a noisy grinding noise and the whole unit sways back and forth despite not being able to function at the maximum speed. We may end up buying a different swing, since the baby does like swinging. Also, it has a large footprint and takes up a lot of space.	
- 1	The lid does not create a tight seal thus snack will go stale in just a day. And when dropped, the translucent top half and the white bottom half separates. I'm not sure why they did not make this one piece container with a lid.	
- 1	i was so excited to use this sippy cup because i use dr brown bottles. this cup worked for about three days then decided not to! horrible, the suction of the two inserts causes the sippy to close up completely rendering it useless and ultimately frustrating!! i thought i was going crazy and doing something wrong until i read these reviews! on to the next...	
1. 	I love the Seuss motif, but more than that, the quality of the bib is great.  Resists stains, can be rinsed in between a few feedings (if they're not horrendously messy!) and washes nicely in the machine.  I hang dry mine to ensure they last longer, and they dry very quickly, but I'm sure you can still throw them in the dryer.  The Velcro seems sturdy and doesn't get all mangled and destroyed in the wash like some do.  My son likes to pull his bibs off, so we thought we had to stick with the fabric snap-on ones, but for some reason, he can't easily pull these off.  Nice!	
- 1	This looked great on Amazon and I read the reviews before buying two of these SwaddleMe fleeces. If you have a wriggly baby, or one that has strong limbs - then don't buy this product. My baby at 2 weeks was pushing his way free. I was also given a couple of other velcro type swaddles, none of them worked. Finally I tried the Miracle Blanket. That is the ONLY swaddle that keeps a baby properly contained. We have only just stopped using it (baby is 4 months) because he has managed to work his fist out to suck and pacify himself each morning, which I believe is a sign that he's ready to graduate to just a sleep sack. Just beware that these swaddles are expensive, so go with one that you know will work whether you have a more passive baby or not - the Miracle Blanket. No buttons, no velcro, just well positioned inner flaps for the arms, a pouch for the legs (which is separate from the arm flaps so you can change the diaper without undoing the entire swaddle) and then much longer flaps that wind around him and tuck in on the edge. They also do well in the washer/dryer. Hope this helps a bit!	
- 1	These tubes are junk. They do the job but they don't fit my Medela Advanced pump and style like the original tubes did. These are always falling off or coming unplugged if I move at the slightest. Also they are not as flexible. Next time will def be spending the few extra dollars to get the medele ones.	
- 1	I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better mouse trap.To add insult to injury, the taps on the handle that are supposed to hold the top of the bottle storage compartment just broke off...(picture provided by Amazon is not the current model.  refer to the pictures posted by other shoppers)	
- 1	I bought this for my newborn who was born in August.  After only 2 months of her sleeping on it, there is a dent where she sleeps.  This cannot be safe and I can't imagine how a larger baby or toddler could use this mattress.  There are many other reviews who say the same thing.  I strongly encourage Amazon to remove this faulty product.	
1. 	these little pickers are amazing!! they remove the boogies so well and they dont bother my 2 mo old when im doing it!! I love them every mom should have a pair the asirator is no god with hard boogies these are a must!!	
- 1	Pros:* It is a chair that straps onto a full size chair or sits on the Table.* Middle Leg Divider keeps baby in seat.* Seat bottom has two heights...although not the greatest or safest design for how it snaps in place.* I'm retuning it and getting a Fisher-Price Space Saver.Cons:* 3 Reclining positions, not 4.* No ABC-123 mat as description states, only one 123 mat with English 123 on one side and Spanish on the other...I'm a little tired of Dora and everyone else thinking my kid needs to learn Spanish.  I'd much rather have the ABC Mat as promised. Mat also does not stay in place and slides everywhere, so within 2 min my baby had it out flinging it around.* Tray snaps on and doesn't slide in and lock.  I'm pretty sure with a little more time my baby can kick it off.* Very cheap plastic all around, especially on the buckles where needed. Cheap buttons and poor placement make it very hard to change reclining positions too.* Buckle straps to mount chair are one piece you have to feed through and are very long.  Hard to adjust straps with it sliding around.  Once adjusted there is a big long piece of strap you have to figure out what to do with too.* The cushion has four elastic straps you stretch over hooks on the back.  The top are fine, but the bottom are too close to the holes so they don't hook. Pad seemed a little big too and puffed out at the bend causing the bottom to always come up since nothing hold it but the leg divider.	
- 1	So we bought this crib because it looked easy to maneuver and move around from room to room.  It worked well until the wheels started to all fall off.  So I had to tighten them but after this happening a few times I noticed the bolts were stripped because it was too short.  Stokke will not or does not care about the customers.  For a crib that cost $1000 (including mattress) it was poorly designed.  I had to go to home depot and get new screws that were longer and it hasn't failed yet.  Now I'm dealing with my son teething and eating the paint from the rails.  I bought 2 rail guards but due to the odd shape nothing completely covers this crib.  The Stokke bumper guards are so thin my son just bangs his head when he turns while sleeping.  Because of the unique design we can't get other bumper guards that will cover the whole bed.  Also the Velcro is a pain to attach on the bumper guard.  It's been a nightmare and we never recommend this crib to anyone.  It's as bad as their carrier which leaves marks on my son's leg.  My son is now 10 months and he has already outgrown this bed.  When he spins while sleeping he gets stuck. We have researched and we will now change this crib for something way better called a bumper bed which is very popular in Korea.  It's just been a battle trying to find someone who will ship it here.	
- 1	It worked great and my baby enjoyed it a lot. Then after 6 1/2 weeks, the projector stopped rotating. I was able to exchange it at the store I got it from, but I'm quite disappointed that it didn't last long before it stopped working properly. We'll see how long the new one last for. I'll give it a second chance, but if it breaks on us again, I'll look for another brand.UPDATE: (June 10, 2014) 4 weeks later, and the projector stopped rotating again! What a piece of junk! Won't bother exchanging for a 3rd one. I'll just look for another brand!	
- 1	My son and I hated this tub. He was always sliding down, and he would cry during his bath time. There was really nothing I could do to help. He would slide left or right or down, especially when he was a newborn and couldn't support himself. Also, it wasn't easy to fold-up at all. I'm due in January with another, and I will definitely not be purchasing this. Spend a little more and get something much better!	
1. 	Why this vs. Safety First Bed Rail?Size - it's all about size. This was the perfect length to cover from my son's current bed's side rail to the edge. The Safety first is great if we need 60+inches...but we didn't. They're both essentially the same product- one is just wider. I also didn't like that the safety first sat ON the mattress instead of under. Just seemed like it would be uncomfortable for my son - he likes to roll to the side/edge of the mattress and curl up.Also this was 1/2 the price of Safety First.Instructions - it's literally 8 lines - no photos, and takes some intuitive thinking on getting this thing put together. It took about 10 minutes with trial and error.Toddler bed - this didn't seem like it was made for a toddler bed b/c the anchor straps were really long and the disc went out further than the edge of the bed. With a little fiddling around and tying the strap to the slats of the bed, it works. I wouldn't recommend this product for a twin size bed - would seem like there's too much of a gap on either sides (lengthwise) for a child to fall off. I would recommend this for a toddler bed - there is just the right amount of coverage to keep a child inside (lengthwise).Suggestions - I wish that this was taller (in height). It's enough to keep my child in when he's sleeping - but it doesn't deter him from wanting to climb over it when he's awake. Not that we're trying to keep him in - he thinks it's a toy/climbing wall. So he'll try to climb form the outside into his bed, or vice versa.It's sturdy that I'm not worried about him knocking it over or rolling out (our mattress is a standard size - I would suggest putting in the safety bar - which sits at the same heigh as the mattress. Rather be safe than sorry (our mattress is a few inches shorter than they suggested instructions).You definitely get a good value for the $$ - there's no point paying $40 for another bed rail if you don't need the length. And it's about the same height (from the mattress as Safety First).	
1. 	Let me start by saying my son has had no problem switching between bottle and breast.  From the very beginning he wanted his food and didn't care how he got it. But, I've noticed that even the stage one nipple is too fast for him.  He chokes and gags on this bottle.  But, then again I've yet to invest in a bottle system.  I've bought at least one of every bottle, except Dr. Browns - hoping someone will buy me some for my baby shower!I've not noticed a lot of bubbles in this.  I have the VentAire bottles too and I've not noticed any difference in gas or colic. However, my son thus far seems to prefer the VentAire.  I think because this nipple is just too fast for him.I think all babies are different don't invest in any one system.  Let your baby decide...because ultitmately thats what is going to happen anyway!	
1. 	I like this set. I got everything I needed in one set different colors too. It is a great product very much recommended.	
1. 	I love these bibs. Not only do they look cute (and not cheap like other soft bibs like this) but they work so well. The food catcher is easy to clean because it's a scoop as opposed to an enclosed pocket. The adjustable and easy snap on neck part is nice too as opposed to velcro. It's very durable and probably will last to use for my next baby. But they're not too expensive so might just buy new one anyways.	
- 1	horrible design.  it doesn't work well. my child can stick his little fingers through the crack and they get pinched.  it is not a match for the cabinets we have.	
- 1	After reading all the positive reviews I went out and purchased this item and was disappointed at how difficult it was to use with one hand.  Think about it....in most cases you're going to be holding a squirming infant in one arm and trying to put this thing on a shopping cart or high chair with the other.  It does come bundled up in it's own cute little sack, but it takes two hands and about 30 seconds to actually work the thing out of it's sack.  Once out, it's not super easy to get on the cart with one hand but can be done.  No biggie there...the real trouble comes when you're done shopping and you once again have your squirming infant in one arm and are trying to remove and repackage your floppy seat.  This thing is not small and trying to get it back into it's cute little sack takes some doing. And because it's so big, it's not the kind of thing you want to keep out all the time, loose from it's baggie. Too much work I say, for something that could and should be more convenient.  I exchanged mine for a Buggy Bagg. At first I balked at the price of the Buggy Bagg but later realized it is worth the extra 20 bucks.  Super easy to open, set up, remove and store all with one hand.  Plus it's got a ton of room in the diaper bag compartment so when we go out shopping or dining we don't need a diaper bag anymore.	
- 1	At first it was a really great product. Then I had to start replacing pieces frequently, and having to break-down the whole thing every few days to wash it was irritating. If I left anything together mold appeared. Eventually after only a few months I could no longer get any suction no matter which piece I adjusted or replaced.	
1. 	This is really cute, soft, and most of the noises are pleasant and natural sounding (we like the rain and ocean settings). The volume control is perfect and allows you to set it to exactly what you need. I just wish there was an simple on / off without a timer feature as well. The timer is nice for older kids or adults who just need it to fall asleep initially (can play 23 or 45 minutes) but for babies like mine who go down for naps or night and awaken several times this isn't ideal. They can't turn it back on to help themselves fall back to sleep. If I remember to keep going in the room and turning it back on every 45 minutes, then when little one awakes after an hour of napping or at night he'll fall right back to sleep in less than a minute. If it turned off and I forgot to turn it back on though, baby wakes to the silence, gets scared and is up screaming and nap time is over. So, cute but for young babes I'd recommend the simple sound machines that have continuous play features.	
- 1	This cup leaks terribly.  We used it twice, not using it any more because of how poorly it works.  I will continue my hunt for a sippy cup that my 7 month old will learn to like and grow with.	
- 1	This is too bulky for most kids. My son is grabbing at it all the time. It's also very hot in the summer, we don't use it.	
- 1	I guess I might like this chair when my son is 2 years old and I want something for him to sit in that's more to his scale than a regular dining chair. I hope so for what we paid for it. Because for a 9 month old infant it fails. Without the cushions the baby slides all around and the straps do almost nothing to hold him in. And the clips are cheap and difficult as somebody else said. You could never walk away even for a moment with an infant in this chair. Then when using the cushions the straps are too short; it's just bad design, the straps should go through the cushion not around the sides. I called the company to ask about that, nobody bothered to return my call or email me, they just put some more straps in the mail and why I don't know because they're the same length straps that are on the chair already. Gee thanks. I also agree with Matt's review about the tray. Very flimsy attachment to the chair. I don't know where all these positive reviews come from. I'm wondering if they had all the employees post them. If I could go back in time and do it over I would buy or get free on Craigs List an ugly plastic comfy cushioned Graco high chair perfect for babies, who cares what it looks like, then maybe get this chair later to use for age 2-5. Meanwhile I'm feeling like a fool for having put modern hipster aesthetics over functionality and hello, SAFETY right now.	
1. 	This Light Green hamper has really came in handy for my nephew bedroom...we can just thorw his dirty stuff in the hamper...then take out the mesh bag and thorw the stuff into the washer and take the mesh bag back up to his bedroom the only problem is the bag (hamper part) i wish it would be removeable for cleaning.. like if a little dirt got on the bottom from carrying it up and down the stairs.... over all i love this hamper! makes it much easy on me! i just carrying the whole hamper downstair and fold it up and set it on top of the washer and/or dryer!! i really enjoy this hamper!	
1. 	Bought these by chance to try and ended up loving them.  They don't lay the nicest in your bra, but save some serious dough by not having to use the disposable ones.  Would recommend washing before first use though :)  Highly recommended.	
- 1	I was so excited to find a decorative play mat that would match our home decor.  We put it down and then took it up within a week because it shows dirt and footprints and every little thing too badly for our active family.  They are now sitting in the garage collecting dust.	
1. 	I liked the body rest but not the head reast...Read washing instructions...The body rest is very soft and comfortable...Nice color.	
- 1	I wanted to like this machine but I changed my mind and I thought I would share.  First of all it is small and it is really baby food only machine. You have to cut up the food then turn on the steamer then take out the basket when its done and dump the food into the main container and blend.  You can accomplish the same exact thing in a regular stainless steamer on your stove in the same amount of time.  I tested it and I saved no time it was exactly the same!  The stainless steamer on your stove can also be used as a pot or to steam lager amounts and you will use it forever plus you can use the same steamer on the stove to defrost your baby food.  I freeze my baby food in tiny glass containers and I just stick them directly uncovered into my steamer on the stove.  If you use the silicone containers you just put your baby food in any glass bowl.  I do not use plastic for cooking.  I don't care it is BPA free there are other chemicals in plastic that can leach into the food therefore my stainless steel on the stove method is also safer than Beaba.  Also the Beaba water tank is coated with something.  It smells funny and makes the food smell and I don't trust that either.  It is not stainless.  Others have mentioned this as well so I do not feel safe about steaming in plastic and having the water come from some tank that smells funny.  For blending I just throw the food into a BPA free blender...yes that is plastic but you are not cooking in it and the exposure time is less.  You could use a glass bender or a stainless stick blender even better.  I actually do that as well its just that my BPA free plastic bender is tiny so its almost like the Beaba food maker.  So basically I came to the conclusion I can accomplish the same thing in the same amount of time with my standard kitchen cookware and appliances. I tested it and it took me the same exact time!  Plus my stainless steamer doubles and bottle sanitizer and bottle warmer.  I also have an asparagus cooker which is also great for warming up bottles and sterilizing but I use glass bottles so with plastic bottles you need to add more water so they do not melt sitting agains the metal...same goes for nipples I just boil them instead of cooking them in some plastic that is emitting chemicals into them like ALL THE STERILIZERS AND BOTTLE WARMERS DO!	
- 1	I bought this because I liked the idea of the handles and I thought... well... we have two different shaped toilets in our home... it'll at least fit one.  Other reviewers mentioned that it worked on round toilets but it didn't fit any of our toilets.  Our oval toilets are new, and we also have one round toilet from the 80s that it doesn't fit on, either. Bummer.  We ended up buying the Prince Lionhart weePOD, Basix and it is such a better product!  It fits on both of our toilets, is easy to clean, lightweight, secure, and super cushy/comfortable.  My daughter loves to sit on it.Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey	
1. 	This is a great book for people who want a nice, normal baby book, without tons of cutesy things.  You can add stamps/crafts/stickers/etc to get a similar look, as I did on a few pages.  I also like that each page is removable, so you can reorder things, remove pages you don't need, etc.  We decided to use the many picture pages with lines on the side for a monthly picture and things that happened that month.  Much easier to rearrange as we'd like to do this and not need the firsts pages.  For pages I didn't use, I put craft paper over them to cover the headings and made it something else.I also like how they have a variety of other books, so I bought a similar book but different cover for my 2nd one.	
1. 	MY BABY IS WARM WITH HER HAT AND IT'S CUTE IF I KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE TO SIZE I'LL ORDER 6 MONTH INSTED OF 3 MONTHS OTHERWISE I JUST LOVE IT	
1. 	I almost didn't purchase this item based on the reviews.  I would have been sad!I deliberated a long time over which walker to get for my daughter.  I have other Chicco products and do like them a lot.  So many of the reviews mention things like tipping, etc.  To be honest, I don't think there is a product out there that can save our kids from themselves (a rubber room?!).  Of course a baby will find a way to tip something over or fall and bump their heads...but that's why parental involvement is always necessary.  Who lets their very young baby out of their sight for more than a second or two?Our daughter loves this toy.  She actually laughs and smiles when she sees it and immediately crawls to it to start walking or playing with the front.  The music is silly and cute, but I'm glad it can be turned off and has two volume settings.  The shape sorter on the front and ball chute (which makes noise) are the perfect size for baby (our daughter is 9 months old).While it is lightweight and not perfectly designed (I've rarely found anything that is), your child should only need to use this toy for a few months at the most before they outgrow it or learn how to walk on their own.I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is mostly because it does have such a short lifespan (not that it will wear out, just that baby won't need it for too long).I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has hardwood floors.  When our pediatrician mentioned getting a walker, she asked if we had carpets or hard floors.  She said carpet is better for all of these types of toys.  Not only because the toys function better (don't move as fast), but safer for the babies in general (not as many bumps and bruises when learning how to walk).	
1. 	I love reading Amazon reviews when I go to purchase something, and for this product, the reviews really helped me out.  Like others, this is just what I needed.  I had been using the 24 mm that come with the pump (I have the freestyle) and suddenly, I started experiencing pain and even bleeding.  Upon further investigation, I realized too much of my skin was being sucked into the shield causing a lot of irritation and pain).  I ordered these and I feel SO much better.  No more pain, and my milk is back to the production levels it had been.  If you are experiencing pain while pumping, I suggest going to the Medela website and looking at their diagrams for good/bad fits for pumping.  This smaller size has been a lifesaver for me!	
- 1	My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds.  I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)	
1. 	I like the bottles. Have only had trouble with leaking a few times when I had the cap to tight. You just have to take off the lid and start over. Good system.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and used it as just a bench until she was 21months. Potty training has been a breeze so far! The side compartments are great for storing extra underwear and clothes! Which I do often since I take the potty to the sitters house! It is the perfect height for her to get on and off of by herself and the pull out drawer makes for easy clean up! I couldn't do without it! Thank you Boon for making potty training a little smoother!!	
1. 	Not much to add to this one.  It is a toothbrush as described.  It is the right size and shape for my 2 year old.	
- 1	This straw cup seems like a great idea. A lid that twists closed and makes the cup leak-proof. A huge straw so my very thirsty child can drink as quickly as he wants. And interchangeable lids with other Oxo cups.Except that the cup leaks when the lid is twisted closed. Before we even hand it to our child, we put water in it, screw the cap on, twist the lid closed, and watch the cup drip water unless we hold it perfectly vertical. (If we wanted a cup that needed to be held perfectly vertical, we'd use a cup. A regular cup. The kind without a lid at all.) And the lid has different threads than the other Oxo sippy cup we have, so the lids are not interchangeable as advertised. When we contacted Oxo, they took a week to say that they got our message and would get back to us someday, and we've had no reply since then.	
- 1	I picked this up before our twins were born based on the various must have reviews and really we never used it.We found it too large and awkward and generally just one child breast fed at a time.So really wait until your kids are born and then see if double feeding is something you want to do.  For us this ended up in the closet unused.	
1. 	My son loves this. He stares at the fish for as long as we leave him in it. It has a lot of different sound options as well as lights, moving mobile, etc. so you can mix it up and baby doesn't get bored. Also he seems comfy because he is always sleeping in it.The only thing that worries me is that if you have it on some of the higher speeds, and even the lower ones now that he is bigger the swing has a lot of movement at the legs. It sometimes looks like its going to tip. So I keep a very close watch when he is in it.	
1. 	Absolutely loved this with our first son. He loved to be swaddled and this made him sleep like a baby. He was a wiggle worm and could get out of pretty much every other blanket, but this kept him content at night. Used until he was about 6 months and wanting to roll over in his crib. Definitely a go to gift for me with my future mama friends. We will use it with our second too! I just wish I found it earlier and had taken it with me to the hospital when I delivered.	
- 1	I was really, really looking forward to getting this baby monitoring camera. It has all the features, and then some, that I would want in a baby camera. However, despite all my attempts, I was unable to set it up to connect to my network. THE ONLY way it seems to be able to connect to a network is through an Android or an iOS app. However, those apps are an absolute garbage - very hard to work with and incapable of basic functions. The Android app couldn't find my camera AT ALL, and the iOS app was unable to log in my home network. So right now I have this camera sitting pretty at the side of my desk, unable to function properly due to the utmost crappy software. I really hope they fix this soon. Until they do that, I would stay away from this over-expensive useless gadget.	
1. 	I love this hamper. It is a good deal. I have seen other hampers similar to this one and they cost good deal more; so this is a bargain. It has a mesh bag inside and you can remove to do laundry. It folds up easily and lightweigh. It can hold an obscene amount of clothes. You can was easily without it shrinking. I bought the blue one for my older son and had it for over a year and we haven't had any problems. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.	
1. 	Bought this night light for my nephew who was afraid of the dark.  He loved it and how bedtime is a dream.  Comes in other styles if you don't like turtles.  I like that it automatically turns off after 45 minutes which should be long after they fall asleep.  Highly recommended.	
1. 	Durable, good price,quick delivery, and it even doubled as a &#34;cot&#34; for in the middle of my husband and I between late night feedings.Make sure the covers you buy are big enough, as it is deeper than most. (Circo fleece covers from Target fit perfectly!)	
1. 	Just what I needed. Overall loving this product so far and would recommend. No issues upon arrival. Happy about my purchase!	
1. 	I ordered two (2) set of bottles (two 4oz bottles and two 8oz bottles), each set came with one natural flow cleaning brush in them. So I really didnt need to buy these separately it seems. However, the more the merrier I suppose.... haven't had my baby as yet, so i have not actually used it but it looks okay so far	
1. 	Finally switched my 14-month-old to these (after using the NUK silicone spouts with regular bottles to ease transition) and I LOVE them! Did a lot of research on which sippy cups to get and these do not disappoint. I can throw one in my purse without worrying--NO LEAKS! It does take some determination for my kid to get the liquid out, but she eventually figured it out and now has no trouble. Same goes for grasping. Just took a day or two. Did I mention no leaks?? Highly recommended!!	
1. 	This is very heavy so that it cannot be lifted by any young child. My 8 year old cannot lift it.  But it can slide a little if your child puts their weight on it. It will not topple over as this is impossible. I use it to block my garage so that my 2 year old doesn't run out of the garage and into the street. Once your child is too big to fit in a playpen, you can get this so that they have more room to play, but still have them contained.It is very difficult during the first few times you open and close it. But it does loosen up and becomes easy enough to setup alone. It is actually better that the joints don't move so easily so that your child cannot change the shape of the play yard when they push against it.	
1. 	This is an excellent gift for anyone who's expecting.  A friend of mine registered for this for her shower and was very happy to receive it.  It comes with pretty much everything a new mom needs and these Avent supplies are great quality.  The bottles seal tightly and all that.	
- 1	I received this as a shower gift.  It is nice looking and completely functional.  However it smells terrible.  It has a chemical/musty smell.  I wonder if it got damaged during transport or storage in whatever Target/Walmart it was bought from.  Customer Service was completely unhelpful and treated me like I was just trying to get a newer version from them.I'm assuming the smell issue is an isolated issue... but beware.	
1. 	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!	
1. 	I love using a manual pump better than my electronic - for me, the manual is faster and I get way more because I can control the angle/speed so much better. I haven't tried any others, but I love the Medela Harmony. Its easy to use and very quiet.	
1. 	My baby doesn't sleep in his crib that long for me to know if its really waterproof, but it is very soft and fits snug on our Graco Pack n play in zurich.	
1. 	All this is is an ice cube tray with a lid.  I don't think there is anything special about it but it works for what I needed it to do.  The lid stays on just fine and I just have to store it flat.	
1. 	I exclusively breast fed the first 16 weeks of my son's life and then unfortunately my supply dropped when I went back to work.  He's nearly 5 months and we're now on formula 100% of the time.  I bought this b/c of the reviews and the price and I'd have to say it's one of the best baby purchases I have made.  It's a no brainer get one - I might even get another one so when I'm washing this one I have a back up.	
1. 	I like this but my baby is not to fond of the vibration. Cute chair, lets him lay or sit and it rocks.	
- 1	There is absolutely no way we are going to be able to use this.  While washing it off for first use I accidentally squeaked it and our dogs started going crazy.  For some reason the sound has them thinking there is a dying animal in the house (which is what it sounds like).  While our daughter may have liked it, giving her a toy the dogs are this excited about is just asking for trouble.  We are going to experiment with killing the squeaker, so we'll see if that ends up being our solution.  Even if the dogs were fine with it I am not sure I would want to hear it all day long, and our daughter actually startled when she heard it for the first time, so I think I am justified in the title of this review!	
- 1	I purchased this stroller in May 2011.  At first, I was very pleased.  It seemed sturdy and fit my daughter well.  However, by November 2011 I was having a major problem with the wheel.  While crossing the street with my daughter the wheel turned and stopped the stroller from going forward. This happened on several occassions and was very scary.  The last thing you want is a stroller malfunction in the street with the light turning green.  It was downhill after that.  By January 2012 I couldn't evern turn the stroller without it malfunctioning and me having to drag it to turn. I would definitely NOT recommend this stroller. It looks good at first but will require the purchase of a replacement stroller for sure.	
1. 	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!	
1. 	This is a great product. It is built from very high quality pine, and is extremely sturdy. Assembly was straight-forward and the hardware included is excellent quality as well. Our baby moves around quite a bit during sleep, and this crib does not move one bit! As a result, she sleeps very soundly at night. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	
1. 	I really like these vegetables, and the crate is also great. The vegetables are cute and seem to be well-made (though there are some small irregularities since they are handmade). You don't get the items exactly as they are pictured, though (my carrot had a little peaked cap, not the tendril-y material strips). Also, while the carrot, mushroom and tomato were basically sized correctly (the mushroom is big-- about the size of a portobello), the peas are about the size of a banana. That was a little odd.And as for the crate, there is enough room for a few more veggies in it (we also have the broccoli, asparagus and eggplant, and they &#34;fit,&#34; though now it's overflowing). The crate itself is well-made and sturdy, but also very lightweight. My son loves taking the vegetables out of the crate and putting them back in again.Overall, this is a pretty great toy-- I just wish all the vegetables were relatively life-sized.	
- 1	TERRIBLE.  It BARELY bounces.  Honestly, sometimes you'll even think it's not working.  Our daughter needs a decent amount of bounce and this just did not cut it.  Not even close.  So we returned and got a regular bouncer that we bounce w/ our foot!	
1. 	These are great - I use them for cleaning Dr. Brown's and Born Free nipples, as well as in the smaller areas of my breast pump accessories. Good buy.	
1. 	I like these pads because they are very absorant and do not show through my clothes. They also leave my skin very dry which is very important for keeping healthy nipples.  However, during breastfeeding I have to be careful in folding them in my bra in order to reuse them once I am done, if I don't I have to use new ones because they become all wrinkled and useless.  For that reason I use these only during the day.  At night I use Lansinoh pads, they are bigger and more absorbant than these and I can still reuse them even when I mistreat them during feeding.	
1. 	love these! a wonderful staple once baby starts solid foods. we were able to bring a cup, bowl, and spoon to each grandparent to keep which is much easier then transporting it every time we visit. perfect price too! i highly recommend!!!!	
1. 	This has a little more pieces than I expected and the texture ones sometimes confuse my kids as they try and match the textures to the color pictures, but we sometimes just separate them beforehand so they don't get confused. They love matching them up though and my younger daughter really gets great practice with her colors this way!	
1. 	Of all the baby products out there, this is the one I can't do without. (Well, maybe the carseat is #1.) I use this every time I go out, especially when I go grocery shopping. I honestly don't know how mothers buy groceries without a Bjorn.Why is it so great? Baby is HAPPY in it, and a happy baby makes a happy mama. Baby can look out at the world, see everything, and meet new people. Baby is at eye level with adults and can be a witness to their conversations. My baby was clearly more comfortable in a Bjorn than anywhere else.I was a little sore the first week I wore it, but then I was accustomed to the feel of it and it stopped bothering me. My baby is now 18 pounds and I am just starting to feel that baby is getting too big for me to carry in the Bjorn.I highly recommend buying the bibs that attach to the front:BabyBj&iquest;rn Bib for Baby Carrier. My baby started teething like a mad alligator just about the time she started facing forward in the Bjorn. The bibs are detachable and--most importantly--washable.	
- 1	I bought this for my daughter because it is spill proof, looks nice and has a soft silicon spout. It has a hard cover which protects the silicon spout, which is great because the little one loves to drop her cup. The problem is, it leaks! There are these 3 indents on the silicon part that should align with the three indents on the plastic cover, but for whatever reason, when I screw the top shut the alignment is always off. 100% of the time! I have tried little tricks to make sure it remains aligned after I screw it shut, but the alignment always shifts and then the cup leaks. I never got to use the cup and have simply put it in the category of things that didn't work for me.	
- 1	I was surprised to find how disfunctional this bib is after reading all these reviews and purchasing. Unfortunately my son does not like wearing it, I think it irritates his neck. Also, it doesn't seem to catch any food. The front part of this bib is somewhat molded inward (not sure if it was from the packaging or what) so it doesn't catch anything. On top of that, when he moves forward in his highchair it presses on his tray and is really useless. We're going to try a different kind.	
1. 	This one of the most useful baby products out there.  It keeps all those bath toys together.  Made of sturdy plastic and mesh, with strong suction cups.  It is large enough to hold all of my son's various bath toys and foam letters.  It is open so that my son can get out whatever toys he wants to play with.  The cubby has a mesh front, as well as a mesh bottom so that all toys dry completely without mildewing.  I have had no problems getting the suction cups on it to stick to our tile tub either.  It has stayed since the first day I put it there.  This is just great!  It has a cute little fish theme.  We have the matching ocean wonders bathroom space saver as well.  Highly recommended!!	
- 1	I started using thepump in January and I used it once a day at most( not even every day). After a month one pump stop working, and month later the second bump stop working. The company gives only 90 days limited warranty and since I bought it in advance, the 90 days had already passed. I bought it because it was the cheapest one, but it definitively does not worth the money.Update:I contacted the company and they shipped me a new motor and tubes and extended my warranty until the babies first birthday. So the customer service is good after all. However, would not recommend buying it if you need to pump a lot. Buy a more expensive unit that will work longer.	
- 1	Ordered these by mistake, so I thought I'd give them a try anyway. Bad idea. The tabs that you are supposed to remove have a terrible perforation and need to be cut off. The liner doesn't fit right around the Playtex Drop-In bottle like it is supposed to. 3 out of 4 leaked when feeding. 1 out of 2 gave us milk explosions when squeezing the air out of the bottle -- and it was a very slow low pressure squeeze too. Wasted way too much breast milk that had me nearly in tears. Stick to the Drop-In style!	
- 1	Cheap plastic handle.  Zero pressure generated.  Appears to be a cheap knock off of a similar looking sprayer made by the Flo company.  Spent the extra money for the Flo.  Worth it.	
- 1	The Moby Wrap is good for taking walks. It is comfortable and didn't slip down as much as the Baby Bjorn I had. It does get hot in the summer but is fine if the weather is not too bad. It does allow you to breastfeed discreetly, even with people sitting next to you. Unfortunately, it is a pain to put on when you're out. It is a long piece of cloth that won't fit in your diaper bag. And it drags on the ground as you're putting it on. I usually put it on before I head out the door.On a recent plane trip, airport security did not allow me to walk through with it on. I was so annoyed at the thought of taking the Moby Wrap off and having it dragging on the ground. I had thought it would be easier than carrying a stroller with me in the plane. But when I need to go to the bathroom, the baby almost fell out when I bent over.You cannot do chores while using the Moby Wrap. The baby goes in the front, so you can't do dishes. And if you vacuum, you can't bend over to pick anything up or the baby will fall out (if he/she is more than 4 months). If I had to do it again, I would get a carrier that will allow the baby to be carried in the front and in the back. I've heard good things about the Breeze Wrap and mei tais. I think there are better baby carriers out there.	
- 1	OK, maybe its not for us, I was not thrilled about getting this to my 3mo but my husband insisted based on all the selling pros described at the website but it simply did not work for us. Twice it tilted to the side or around while we tried to bathe baby. I'd had it when my baby tried to stand up while I was washing her hair and the tub bounced to the side. Baby got startled and when water splashed her face she cried badly. I got so scared I wanted to throw that thing across the street. I wonder if its for small babies only or at least for the not so active ones. My baby is very active and tries to stand up at any opportunity she has. On this tub you either wash baby or keep her sitting. Not worth it!!PS: I followed all the instructions for usage of this product, including water level limit.	
- 1	This thing is so huge. I bought it hang on the side of the crib, but it's so ridiculously giant that I ended up nailing it to the wall in the closet. The &#34;shelves&#34; are flimsy and would never stand up under the weight of the products shown in the photo. I'm going to use ti just to store extra diapers and lightweight cloth stuff. Really, I wish I hadn't bought it.	
- 1	The 1st 4 or 5 times we used these bottles they worked perfect then each time we were feeding baby afterwards, breast milk began to leak from the air holes in the top.	
- 1	It looks great, the cup holder is nice, but the crotch strap design ruins it. I am surprised by how many people complain about it but still rate the seat highly. The shortness of the strap (and yes, I have moved it to the most forward position) is ridiculous. I have a 2.5 year old skinny girl, but one who loves to wear dresses and frilly skirts. Try getting a child buckled in wearing a tutu with a super short crotch strap. My husband and I curse every time we put her in the seat. If your child is a pudgy one, or like ours, likes dresses, I strongly advise against this seat. I might call Graco today to see if they have an extension, but I am guessing no since a lot of reviewers have called in and no one has mentioned one.  I'll update if they provide one and give the seat 5 stars.	
1. 	Ordered these last week, spot them quickly w/o expediting shipping. Great product very easy to use, I will not only use them for breast milk storage but also for home made baby food.	
- 1	I really liked these, until one broke after 3 months.  I do not recommend, because they do not stand up to normal use.	
1. 	They do what is intended and it's nice to have spares around the house just in case one is lost.	
1. 	This bib set is really good - waterproof but soft. For the price you get a lot of bibs! The only quibble I have is that you can't put them in the dryer, so I have to take extra time to fish them out of the wash before I transfer clothes to the dryer. I just lay them flat on top of the dryer and they do dry super fast. It's just a little hassle of a step to have to do.	
1. 	I love these snack traps and have been using them since my son was at least 12 months, if not sooner.  I wish they made lids for them, but I use a daisy sour cream lid and it fits well.  Combine it with a paci grip to keep it from landing on the floor when he is in his stroller and it is perfect.	
- 1	The pressure mount at 34 inches felt to insecure. We added 1&#34; wood on either side to make it sturdier. Also used longer screws for the mounting rings. Retraining self to be conscious of the white bar at the bottom, not to stub toe or trip over it. Especially as ours is at the top of a stair.	
- 1	They advertise this on Amazon as a nursery item. I would strongly advise against it.I ordered 4 white baskets, with the hope to store diapers, wipes, creams etc. in my baby's room, in an accessible area for everyone. All of the four baskets had the same issues:- Terrible chemical odor, probably from the paint.-  The paint was peeling off and was chipped throughout. It looked like a dog had spray painted it, blindfolded.- The end of the wicker was not tucked in safely, but rather exposed on the outside and was as sharp as skewers all around it.I regretted this purchase as soon as I received my order, and sent it back immediately. I would not recommend this to anyone..	
1. 	If I could I would give it 6 stars! Boy do I love this chair!We are urban, minimalist, no nonsense people. I always dreaded the ugly plastic baby chairs I used to see at other people's houses. So we registered and got Eddie Bauer wood highchair for our baby shower. One word of advice - don't buy products such as chairs until you meet and get to know your child.We set up the EB chair and realized right away what a mistake it was buying it. It was gorgeous but totally unsafe and difficult to use. It had 1 point harness, the strangest contraption I've ever seen. We could imagine our kid hanging off the chair in a year or two. So we took it back and after much research and testing, we chose Malawi. We are so happy!1) We got both the vinyl and cotton covers, so when the baby is small we can use cotton, than later we'll move on to vinyl.2) Malawi has the wheels so we can move the baby with us when we're cooking, cleaning, or just moving out and about. We can even take the baby to our deck when we dine outside. EB chair was VERY heavy and no wheels so I had to lift or drag - a major pain in the you know what. The wheels can be locked or omitted if you don't want this feature.3) Unlike hard, uncomfortable EB chair, Malawi gives the plush, armchair type dining experience for our 8 month old kid. We put the cotton cover on top of the vinyl so it's extra padded and comfy. I used to have to put rolled up towels on both sides in order to keep our baby upright.4) Malawi reclines, where EB doesn't. Major plus with the tiny ones who don't sit on their own yet. Also the fact that it has different hights is a wonderful feature. We can play real low or dine real high.5) My only issue is with the tray. Tray is not really one-hand release. It's heavy and bulky and it took me some time to get used to it. Unlike Fisher Price Healty care chairs it doesn't really slide into place with one hand. However, the dishwasher tray is large and covers the whole tray which makes cleaning a snap, plus you get an extra one in the box to use when the first one is in the dishwasher being cleaned! How cool is that!Also, the tray is a bit too high for our kid, but we'll just keep it in the closet for now.6) This chair is by far the most comfortable out of all the ones my baby tested. I like that unlike Fisher Price Healthy Care chair it doesn't have reclining lever in the the middle of the head rest. Also the chair cover is longer than on any other chair. I was under the impression that Fisher Price vinyl cover sharp edging would be cutting in my kids legs.7) Malawi is very pretty green and blue color, but if you don't like plad you have a choice of solid blue or solid green covers. The 5 point harness is nice and tight and you can remove it to clean it.Hope this helps and you consider this chair.	
1. 	Whenever we use our Bjorn in the winter I don't have to worry about bundling up our son or having to wear a jacket for me that's big enough to wrap around him: this is perfect!  I love it!  In Tacoma, it rains: A LOT!  And I've gotten a lot of complements on it too!  The Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover is lightweight and super simple to attach, plus, it's so cozy and warm, I never worry about our baby being too hot or cold: it's perfect!  I love it!!!  *Excellent gift idea for baby-showers too!!	
1. 	This really is a great product.  It heats up 4 oz of refrigerated breast milk within a couple of minutes.  It's small enough to stick in a diaper bag if you're going out, too, and since the water vial has a cap, you can pre-fill it.  The only trouble was that the recommended amount of water did not heat the milk beyond a cool temperature -- not even to room temp.  After experimenting, I learned that I had to fill it about a half inch ABOVE the highest number marking (10) in order for the milk to be about as warm as it is from the breast.  And I checked my fridge -- it's the normal temp, about 37 degrees, so it's not because the bottles were colder than normal.  So, I guess I'm a little concerned about what'll happen when we need to give 8 oz instead of 4!*UPDATE* I now use this with the 8-oz size Dr. Brown's bottles (heating with inner parts removed), with 6 oz of milk, and they seem to heat up with less water.  They are also a harder plastic than the bottles we used to use (Medela bottles), so I think perhaps the harder plastic conducts heat better.  Keep this in mind when experimenting with water amounts.  Just a theory.	
1. 	We have several brands of bibs and even though they are a bit more expensive these bibs have lasted a year and still look brand new. More importantly they have fit through a year of growing cycles and still cover the majority of spills and drops at every feeding. Great buy!	
1. 	She said it was easy to install, she had to do it her self because her hunny was in Iraq. She has a very hyper golden retriever.Perfect for protecting your baby from many diffetant things.	
- 1	Neither of my babies liked these.  My toddler never liked a paci at all.  My baby only likes MAM brand.  I was hoping they would use this brand because of the wubbies, but no such luck.	
1. 	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  Both were huge and bulky.  When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!The Sunshine Radian is different!  It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  And a SNUG FIT!  Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!	
1. 	The bottle warmer is a must have for new moms.  It's such a pain to heat a bottle in boiling water - and it takes so long.  This bottle warmer will heat your bottle in 1-2 minutes -- it's quick and easy.  The product has held up nicely and doesn't take up too much counter space.	
- 1	Bought this thinking I could view my son when at stop sign and light. Boy was I wrong, every bump you hit, this thing moves and even though you try to reposition it, it still moves. Not worth the money, wish I had returned it.	
1. 	I didn't realize how much my son (now 5 months) would enjoy this gym! He has loved looking up at the lights and the mirror since about 4-5 weeks old. As he has grown, he's enjoyed playing with all the hanging toys. I've added other toys using links and have also found the gym useful for tummy time.There is a soft and a loud setting for the music (which really isn't too obnoxious), but I especially like that you can set the &#34;nature sounds&#34; to soft, and the lights will still go without having to listen to music if you don't want to. I would definitely recommend this item for new babies!	
1. 	I was so like the overalls. It helped me a favor. Easy to clean, easy to dry. Color is also very nice. I love it.	
- 1	i have my issues with these. the cleaning instructions make these a chore and a half - do not soak, and then wash first in cold, then in hot. seriously, who has time for two washes? i might be a SAHM but i have a lot to do besides washing diapers all day. too, the energy required for washing diapers twice kind of negates the earth-saving, keep non-biodegradable crap out of landfill reasons i wanted to go cloth anyway. so...  i wash the covers by hand when they need it, and i soak the inserts in cold water with a bit of oxyclean overnight prior to a hot wash.also, no one warned me that once you get yer babe all decked out in one of these setups, none of your cute newborn clothes will fit her, especially if you've got a little fatty like i do - she's got really limited time in those adorable newborn clothes everyone gave her anyway, and so...i signed up for Amazon Mom, got myself a subscription for Nature Baby eco-disposables and got 160 of them for $30 - yep, she's a breastfed newborn who goes through about ten a day, and disposables are a money hemorrhage for sure, but other than the elastic and the tabs, they're natural (no gel) and quickly compostable in a landfill. i'm putting the flips aside until she poops a little less constantly and we have some clothes that might actually fit over these things... we're also starting a little bit of Elimination Communication since she's pretty easy to predict - and perhaps that will save me a little effort in dealing with having to wash diapers all the time.	
1. 	This seat has worked well for us.  Its compact and fits in my bag easily. My daughter grabs the little handles in the front instead of touching the toilet which is a big ick factor for me.  She is about 25lbs and it holds her easily and she seems very comfortable with it.  I would have liked a fitted washable carry case to come with it but I use one of my wet/dry cloth diaper bags and it works okay if not a little big.	
1. 	I love the Dr. Seuss designs on these Superbibs. They are gender neutral and very cute. The bibs can be wiped clean in between uses and hung to dry. By the next time you want to use them, they are ready to go! I do throw them in the washing machine from time to time and hang dry, to clean off the food that doesn't completely come off by handwashing. Highly recommended. The are expensive but worth the price and hold up well, and you don't end up scrubbing baby food out of clothes!	
- 1	We bought this twice and it died both times! Each only lasted a couple of months. The problem was that the water seems to leak into the power cord, which corrodes it.  Not to mention it is unsafe to have it by your baby! Buy the munchkin one instead!	
- 1	The high contrast design fascinates her. Beyond that I do not recommend this product. It didn't fit her at three months old. They where not shaped for the feet so they fit awkwardly. They did not rattle loudly either.	
1. 	we bought this almost a year ago- when my daughter was just a couple weeks old. we have used it at every nap and bedtime (if we were home) she LOVES the ocean waves, but the whales make her fussy. anyway- when she was newborn, the sound would immediately put her to sleep, now, when we lay her down and turn on her sheep she just rolls over and listens til she falls asleep. she can and does sleep without her sheep, but with two other kids in the house i needed something to drown out the constant noise, and this did the trick. i still have it attached at the foot of her crib, hanging from the top, facing her, i just push the button through the slats of her crib, no problem at all.batteries last a very long time, volume goes up much higher than i have ever needed, you can have it on for 23 or 45 minutes, usually 10 is plenty for us. definitely would recommend this sheep.	
1. 	I have a portable crib mattress that measures 38 1/2 L x 24 W x 3 D (thick) and I wasn't sure if this was going to fit. I just received it and tried it on my mattress and it fits perfectly. If the mattress were bigger in any way it would be too small. I know some people with 5 inch width/thick mattresses have said that this will fit but I have to say I can't see how it would. I wouldn't order it for a mattress bigger than I have stated above. As for quality, it seems fine. My baby hasn't arrived yet so I cannot attest to its efficiency only its size.	
1. 	Easy to clean. I need just this one, instead of dozen cloth bibs.my 6month old girl knows bib means food :)	
1. 	Definitely keep a spare set of these with your pump...  The membranes are easy to lose or accidentally wash down the drain, but you can't pump without them.  It is well worth the cost to keep some spares on-hand.  I learned that the hard way.	
- 1	After reading reviews, I was so excited about this diaper and bought 2 to try. I wish I hadn't spent my money. While they are super trim, they leak. The leg gussets never fully fit around my sons thighs, they always left a gap. My  son is rather large for his age(3 mo), but he is proportional. He is in the 97th percentile for height, and 96th for weight. He is not chubby, or skinny... and the gussets just never were able to enclose his entire thigh area no matter what setting the diaper is set to.  Gaps in gussets = LEAKS!!! I have never once put this diaper on my son when it didn't leak. I kept trying it thinking that it would fit differently the bigger he got... but it hasn't happened, and I doubt it will, unless he just gains weight in his thighs... On the bright side, the hemp insert seems very absorbent if put in another diaper...	
1. 	I love the Playtex brand, and the VentAire bottles are really very good.  I like that the bottles is angled and that helps with gas.  The only thing is sometimes they do leak, but I make sure that the bottle parts are completely dry before I assemble and mix formula.  These save you so much money compared to the drop in bottles. They are a definite keeper.	
1. 	We have been using this mirror for about a year. It has been great. I could not find many types of mirrors that swiveled to adjust. Many were just flat which doesn't work if your baby isn't right in front of a headrest. We had our infant in the middle rear seat and could put the mirror on the headrest on the side next to him. Both the driver and the front passenger (with the mirror in the viser) have a great view of the little one. The mirror stays in place pretty well. Just have to adjust it when we bump it occasionally.Pros: adjusts so doesn't have to be right in front of baby. stays in position well.Cons: would not work on some kinds of headrests. In my husband's car, the headrests are kind of molded to the back seat and there's nothing to put the strap around securely. so make sure you have regular headrests. this has rarely been a concern for us as we usually all travel in our other car.	
- 1	We got these based on a friend's recommendation, but they just didn't fit on baby well. Our baby was 7 lbs when she was born, so she was well within the 5-10 pound range described on the product. And it was snuggly tight on her when she was newborn. But just a little bit of squirming on her part had the zipper on her side instead of on her front. The zipper would also sometimes bunch up under her neck and get in the way of her mouth during feedings. Plus, she quickly outgrew them by the time she was 9 lbs even though she's very petite. They were just too tight and constricting. She ended up screaming every time we put her in one. So what started off being a soothing thing ended up being restricting and uncomfortable. Even at 3 months and still only 10 lbs (very petite), I couldn't imagine putting her in them now. They were great for the month we got to use them, but after that it just ended up being a waste of money.	
- 1	UPDATE:  After three months, one of the parent units stopped working.  All the lights came on and no sound registered.  When I contacted the customer service, I was told that the unit was defective and to contact the store from which it was purchased for a refund/exchange.  After six months, I am fed up with this monitor.  The blue light is very bright.  We have to hide the parent unit under the bed, and it still lights up the room.  The parent and child unit seem to lose connection quite frequently, resulting in either no sound received from the child's room or a loud beep until you turn the unit off and on again to reset.  A frequent clicking sound also grates.  After nine months, the other parent unit went kaput.  I definitely do NOT recommend this monitor.Initial review:  We've been using the monitor for about a month now, and it seems to work well.  We haven't noticed any interference.  Our old Sony monitor had channels, which this one does not have, but it doesn't seem to need them.  We've even used the parent unit in the same room as the old Sony parent unit without a problem(one monitor in each child's bedroom).  The parent units are nice and slim with a handy clip.  The monitor does have a bright blue light that blinks when the parent unit is not turned on, which seems a little annoying for the child, so the monitor is better placed out of sight in the child's room.  Also, when you turn the child unit off, the parent units beep if they are on.  The feature is intended to help you find the parent unit, but it has the unintended effect of encouraging you to leave the child unit on at all times and waste electricity.  When the battery runs out of charge on the parent units, the only indicator is a light that turns red, so if the battery runs out in the middle of the night, you would never know.  My old Sony monitor made a beeping sound when the battery was running out.  While it was annoying to be awoken by the beeping noise, at least we knew when the monitor was about to stop working. It doesn't seem to pick up sound quite as well as our old unit in which we could hear baby breathing from several feet away.  With first child, I wanted to hear every breath.  With second child, I can appreciate NOT hearing every breath as long as I hear stirring and sounds occasionally, which the monitor definitely picks up.  The two parent units is very nice because I'm not always backtracking to find the unit before bed--I can leave one downstairs and one upstairs.	
1. 	I got this so I could put my son in the Bob stroller without using a car seat.  At 5 weeks it worked great - he was cozy and snuggled and very well supported.  I compared this to the snuzzler in the store and IMO this one was much thicker and more supportive.  In the store the price was about the same between the two so I went with this one.  Love it!	
- 1	To keep your ameda pump running well, you need to replace the valves every so often and if they tear. Ameda sells valves in 2-pk containers; these five came in an unmarked white bag - no Ameda name anywhere. The price was slightly better than the Ameda valve but the valves aren't as sturdy or firm.  They feel like they are made of inferior material as they are &#34;looser&#34; than the 2-pk Ameda. They are fine, I guess, and I cannot really tell if pumping output decreased with these valves, but it certainly hasn't increased and I am irrittaed that these valves are sold as &#34;Ameda&#34; valves while I am pretty sure they are a generic brand.	
- 1	other packs have 12 washcloths which is great!!! this one has 10.  i gave two stars because the material is folding, and it's thin.  i wish it wouldn't fold when dry.	
1. 	The connectors worked really well with my medela symphony. They are easy to clean and work like they are suppose to.	
- 1	As a matter of fact, he's better at getting them off than I am because his tiny fingers make it easy to grasp this product.  They are easier for him to get off than the old standard generic flat plug covers.  Not a good buy.	
1. 	gave as a baby gift. well received. really fun grouping. wish I had gotten one for my baby too! LOL	
1. 	I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.  I couldn't be happier;	
- 1	The cart itself is adorable but it is not sturdy in the slightest and is incredibly difficult to put together. Some of the wood pushes into itself and wont go in all the way without a little hammering which scuffs it up. I would not buy this ever again.	
- 1	Sorry for the negative review but here goes... The Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision is very very basic.  You get a night vision camera, a night light on the camera, lullabies and sound activated screen and that is it.  The resolution is not high res like Philips says, at best it is standard res.  The battery life is said to be seven hours but I have only managed about four.  The range is said to be 30 meters through walls but it is about half that.  The only adjustments you can make are the volume and the screen brightness.We have a V-Tech baby monitor that is about half the price but is has much better resolution, twice the screen size, the ability to remote talk, the ability to add multiple camera, vibration alert option, temperature reading and much better range plus the nigh vision sound activated screen and the lullaby features.  The Phillips has the advantage on camera size though.  Even with the battery back-up the camera is very compact.  Also the sound activated screen works better than the V-Tech but you cannot adjust the sensitivity in anyway.  If this camera was $100 or less it would be an ok buy, but even then there are several cameras near that price point that have more features. If was less that $80 I could recommend it but it's not so I can't.	
1. 	I love this bib!  I am nursing my baby but he's a spitter-upper and this has saved me from many outfit changes.  The best part is the sizing.  All of the other bibs out there are made for toddlers but this one actually fits snugly on a baby ( he's 8 weeks).  The fabric is soft too and doesn't irritate his skin.	
1. 	bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months pregnant.  She loves it and uses it every night to help with her back pain and the pressure of her growing belly. Highly recommend.	
1. 	Easy to clean, velcro stays secure, and big enough to cover my 8 month old.  What's better is you can wipe them with a clean cloth OR wash them in the washer and dry them in the dryer or hang dry.  Either way - they are durable!	
1. 	I purchased this for use while my grand daughter was visiting.  The bed rail was easy to assemble and fairly easy to install, I was putting it on a double bed so I needed help moving the mattress.  As an adult I found it uncomfortable to sleep with because the feet are a higher profile so that the rail itself can slide into them and 'hide away'.  I did not have a comfy nights sleep with it installed.  However, this would be fine on a child's bed but should I ever need to purchase another bed rail, I would not select a 'hide away'.	
1. 	I love this idea and  so does my son. He had his first local gorn apple at 5 months old thanks to this product. He gnawed that thing to death. We keep one at home and oone in the diaper bag for when we got out. It is easy to clean and is one less thing to worry about. Of course supervision is still required but makes you feel safer knowing the baby is eating healthy food and staying safe from choking.	
1. 	If it weren't for this chair i wouldn't have showered for the first several weeks. Even at 2 weeks old she was delighted with the fading lights and bubbles. The vibrations always a win win too. At 11 weeks old she still loves this. I keep the bouncy chair upstairs for when i shower and need computer time and the baby papasan swing downstairs for when i need to clean, do laundry, cook and watch tv(alone). Having the two separate toys mixes it up so her experiences are more diverse.	
1. 	If you have kids and you like to take them outdoors. .. this is a must have.  It's water proof and you can throw in the wash.	
1. 	this is bigger than i thought but thats a great thing cus i can see my baby so much better than those small mirrors n i can attach it anyway i want in any car which is even better.	
- 1	For what these nipples cost they were a total disappointment! They are no different from ordinary nipples that cost 50% less and my LO still hated them! Also after using these nipples my LO would tend to be extra rough and pulled at my boobies	
- 1	After reading all the reveiw on this, I believed I HAD to have this tub. It is bulky and a pain to use. Our daughter never liked it. Buy the sponge - it is a couple of bucks and really all you need, in my opinion.We just sold it in our garage sale - I think we probably used it about 3-4 times before we gave up because of the hassle.	
- 1	After playing around with theLevana Wireless Audio Baby Monitor with Sound Indicator LEDs (LV-TW100)I have it's not going to be a monitor that I keep using and here's why:The Bad1. Analog 400Mhz so it's easy for anyone with a scanner to listen in2. Although it has vox (voice operated switch which means that the transmitter only turns on with sounds of a certain loudness) it's not adjustable. So no listening to baby's breathing etc. Only fairly loud sounds will activate the transmitter. This may be a good thing for some folks but not for me since I want to listen in on whatever is happening.The Good1. Very small and portable2. Comes with AC Adapters for transmitter and receiver but these are 120v only so may not be appropriate for travelling to some countries3. Decent Range. Should be fine in most wood-frame North American housesAt $30 it's not a bargain by any means and you can probably get a better analog monitor like theSafety 1st Glow And Grow Baby Monitor, Whitefor about $5 less.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
- 1	To get to the letters after you place them in the barn you must remove all the animals to open the barn door. My son gets frustrated with having to remove them. The letters seam really cheap on the toy. They are super light weight but also had bits of plastic sticking up. The toy just doesn't hold his interest. He has several other shape sorters that he loves. This one just isn't a hit. He likes animals and barns but this toy just doesn't hold the 'it' factor for him.	
- 1	This is a good idea for a teether since it's basically a bumpy pacifier that's easy to chew. However my son hated it. The actual raspberry part is way too big for a baby's mouth. We tried it a couple of times and he never took to it. Also, like many other reviewers, I wasn't too comfortable with the fact that the berry part seems to be glued on, posing a choking hazard. Overall not worth buying for us.	
1. 	My one year old son and I share a shower/bathtub. The older he gets, the more bath toys he seem to acquire! Well, after finally getting frustrated with lining them up along the edge of the tub, I found this little cubby at Wal-mart one day. I wasn't expecting much, but it was something for the time being, till I could find something I felt would be sturdier. Fortunately, there's no need!I've had this for about 2 months now, and it has never, not once, fallen down. I have your average, fiberglass shower/tub, and this thing is FILLED with bath toys. I guess it depends on what type of tub you have, but this was a great find for me. I absolutely recommend it.	
- 1	I found this to be too silent, not &#34;noisy&#34; enough to be a rattle for my taste (and my daugther's). She uses them to suck but when she moves her arms she can't hear them so they don't motivate her to move more.	
1. 	My son is now 8 months old, and we love it.  We are Americans living in europe and travel a lot, and he travels in it like a champ.  I think that if we got the hand held car seat, it would have been a waste of money.  Those seats only go up to 15 or 22 lbs, so I would need another car seat by now.  Do people know that those pop in & out car seats don't last the first year for most babies, so you end up having to buy a rear & forward facing seat anyways (you can't do forward facing until they are 1 year AND more than 20 lbs).  The question is if you want to pay for one really good car seat or buy two and spend more.  I had no problems getting him in and out of his seat and having a baby carrier (baby bjorn) helps to keep your hands free (better than dragging a awkward car seat around) .  The only problem that I have (and it might not be the car seat but the car) is the car seat is really big.  The front passenger has to eat the dashboard for the car seat to fit rear facing - forward facing is better.  We have a VW Jetta.  More about the seat...I like the granite cover.  We have had messes, and it's really easy to clean.  The fabric is very soft.  Again, my son is really happy in his seat.Bottom line, I would buy it again and would recommend it to my best friend!	
- 1	Pros:Light weightEasy to openCompactsturdylarge basketRolls well on cobblestone and uneven surfacesCons:Baby Trend Carseat I have does not fit on it properly-stroller has these red tabs that the car seat sits on and even if the car seat is perfectly centered the red tabs are not long enough to properly support the carseat. You would think their own brand of carseat would fit the stroller. I bought them both this year and they are supposed to fit according to manual.Hard to fold-On the handle there is a button you squeeze to get the stroller to fold. This is very easy to do. Once squeezed the stroller starts to fold easily, then, thewheels get in the way! If the front wheels are not facing the right direction (they swivel 360 and if they are backwards) they hit the rear wheels and thestroller will not close far enough for the tab on the side to catch and the stroller will not stay closed.  Yes, you can turn the wheels around before you closethe stroller but who wants to touch the dirty wheels. This is a problem when it is raining and you don't want to get drenched trying to fold a stroller thatshould fold and stay closed.  I live in an area where in rains at least twice a week.Not for Newborns-The angle of the carseat in the stroller is to steep for infants. My son's head pitches forward or he slouches and falls to the side. Seems very uncomfortable forhim and dangerous. I have tried adjusting the positioning of the carseat in the stroller and the angle stays too steep.I feel that this stroller has too many defects to be worth the price. It's not expensive to begin with but if it doesn't properly fit their own brand of carseat, it won't hold an infant in a correct position and getting it to close properly is frustrating a person would be better off paying more for a different brand that works as advertised.	
- 1	I really, truly do not understand the 5 star reviews. This bag is a piece of junk. As another reviewer stated, it looks much nicer in the pictures. When I finally saw it in person, it looked cheap. The worst part is that the zippers are very low quality. Not only is it tough to actually zip them up, but the main zipper already broke and I'd only been using the bag for about 2 months! The only plus is the large storage space inside. If you thought this diaper bag was a bargain and too good to be true, you were correct. Spend a little more and get a skip hop or other brand. I am using a hand-me-down skip hop bag now since this one broke, and the quality is so much better. Especially the zippers. Don't waste your money on this bag!!!	
- 1	Can't comment on the quality of the product because I didn't get to the point of assembling it. On the lower right side of the product description page it says Birth to 5 months+, but on the arm of the mobile it specifically says WARNING From birth to 5 months.  I was hoping to get more than 5 months use out of this. This is going back to Amazon.	
1. 	I had been using those common baby bottle type brushes with the foam/sponge on the ends.  I tried one of these and am happily replacing those old spongy ones.  The bristles on the bottom and along the curve make it so it actually cleans the bottom of the bottles and other kid cups.	
1. 	I ordered the unbleached ones and received them in the mail today. They are SO soft! I love the colored rainbow thread around the edges. They are so pretty I almost hate to use them as baby wipes. I love how soft they are and I can't wait to start using them!EDIT:After washing these for the first time prior to their first use, I decided to edit my review. The wipes shrank a LOT and they also are not as soft anymore. They are still soft enough for baby and they seem like they will still be pretty absorbent, but they are not as soft as they were nor nearly as large. I wanted big cloths so that I could use fewer wipes, so I am kind of disappointed.EDIT:After using these for a while I decided to edit my review once again. The diapers have not shrunk any more after the first washing, or at least not that I have noticed. They are VERY absorbent. I use a cloth wipe solution in a spray bottle that I first spray on the wipe and then use. One wipe goes a long way I have noticed. I really like these. I also have some soft terry cloth wipes and some flannel wipes cut from old stained receiving blanket and these are the best by far. The nubs on the terry cloth are better for cleaning super duper messes, but we have very few of those and they still aren't as absorbent as these. I love them. I would order more if it wasn't for the fact that the serging around the edges hasn't stopped some of them from fraying. Also I have a ton of stained receiving blankets now that I think I would rather use for wipes instead of paying for more of these.	
1. 	This power strip easily keeps my breast-pump plug secure. It also covered as well as the other plugs :) Easy to use and sturdy.	
- 1	Unless you put all 5 pieces of this cup together just right, it leaks. Putting it together is a chore, very difficult. The big selling point is how it keeps the drink cool, well all but the milk that sits in the spout, that gets sour quickly.Wouldn't buy them again.	
1. 	Whoever invented these SwaddleMe wraps ought to get some kind of prize. It's one of those products that you keep wondering what you would ever do without it. We have three SwaddleMe wraps for our new baby (now two months old and growing fast). Two are jersey and are now getting  little small for him. It's now getting a little cooler (late Fall), so we got a larger microfleece model. Junior seems to appreciate the extra warmth and room  I'd say the wrap is more effective and harder for him to get out of.A good wrap often quiets our baby down. He doesn't like getting wrapped and often cries loudly, but once he's wrapped he quiets down and even smiles. It's like magic. Somehow, when he can't flail his arms and legs around, he stops crying. Also, he seems to sleep better and for longer spells. Last night was the second of two 6-hour nights. That's worth the price in itself! Our little boy seems to like this fleece model a little better. Maybe he likes the extra warmth. Maybe it's the softness. Mabe it's the larger size. My wife worries a little that the fleece model seems to ride up onto his mouth and might suffocate him. Personally, I think she worries too much, but I'm a little more careful in wrapping him. I'd say, if he could speak, he'd say Swaddle Me in Microfleece.Gary Peterson	
- 1	I had heard so many happy endorsements for this diaper.  The patterns are ADORABLE and I was super excited for these diapers to arrive. I have been trying out a few different brands before I make an investment into our supply. We have tried FuzziBuns, Happy Heinys and now these.  The Happy Heinys were small and leaked up the front.  The Thirsties are not going to make it to 40 pounds.The first time we used them they leaked out the side.  My child is in the 95th percentile @ 7 months old, so these may work just fine for a slimmer child. The leg gussets were way too tight and we are on the very last set of snaps. The diaper was also very tight around his belly.  Our baby is 29 inches tall and 24lbs.  The Fuzzibuns, although larger for a cloth diaper have never leaked and I believe will make it through potty training. The other thing is the inserts that were provided with the Thirsties diaper took forever to dry when I washed them.  They were washed with the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium inserts and it definitely took a lot longer to dry the Thirsties inserts than the others.Unfortunately, these and Happy Heinys will not.  Amazon was very gracious about providing a refund.  I would not recommend these diapers if your child is 'thicker'.  Also, the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium inserts are the best that I have found. They are pricey, but they definitely do the job.  The FuzziBuns inserts are great as well if you are looking for a less expensive alternative to the BabyKicks 3 Pack Joey Bunz Premium.  Also, some good advice that I've found is that if your diapers start to repel after a while of use, use the Blue Dawn dish soap (Dawn Ultra) in with the load and it will strip them down and normal absorbency will take place again.Good Luck!  This whole cloth diapering thing is so confusing, but I think I'm starting to get it down.  Please feel free to post questions or message me through my profile and I will help if I can. I decided to cloth diaper because I was tired of applying A&D; ointment daily to my son's bottom due to redness.  When we use the cloth diapers, it clears up.  And it's really not that bad to wash, etc.  I'm a simple and efficient mama with a lot going on and I don't have a lot of time to invest into much. I figured out how to make this work for us. Also, for storage while we are waiting to build up a whole load, we just throw them into a pillow case to keep them separate.  Run them in a cold soak load.  Then HOT wash load using a Tide Free (White bottle with light blue lid).	
1. 	We purchased this for our 9 month old daughter and she LOVES this chair.  We've been able to use this in almost every restaurant we've been in. This won't work on thin metal tables or tables with a limited ledge.  The top metal piece that sits on top of the table has a cushion on it so it won't damage tabletops.  I keep this in the car all the time and I can easily store this in the basket of our stroller when we're in NYC or D.C. It's very lightweight and has a great harness (not just a seatbelt) to keep my daughter safe. My daughter enjoys that she can sit next to us during meals instead of watching us from her stroller.	
1. 	These are nice and large for when my daughter spits liquid peas everywhere.  The pocket is handy.  Lovely patterns too.	
- 1	What I like about it:- Easy to set up- Very clear image, during day and night- Very clear sound, sometimes magnifies my baby's crying too much even on the lowest volume setting- Love the angels the camera coversWhat I don't like about it:- After several months, the microphone stopped working consistently. We had to blow on it, twist it, or turn the camera angel randomly for the audio to work again. It either had a wiring issue or got dusty. Not too sure. But this is bad, because for a few nights over the past several months, my baby was crying in the nursery and we didn't hear him. Now, I always have to test the audio before I go to bed every night to be sure.- The music that comes with the camera sounds so bad that we never use it.- It drops reception sometimes even in close range.	
- 1	Revising my original rating of 4 stars because in less than 6 months ALL of the snaps have fallen off (we use this bib only a few times a week, too), it STINKS (even after following washing instructions properly) and it's nothing like the older version they used to sell. I bought several of these in 2010 and they held up to daily use for 2 years. Now, these are total garbage. Will not buy again - do not recommend.I have to update this review b/c it has just gotten worse and worse...I have since lost yet ANOTHER snap (down to just one now) and the seam where the catch meets the bib is opening so slushy foods (milk, soup, oatmeal, etc) just dribble right into my kids lap. I was so happy with this brand before, and I would be willing to buy ONE more just to make sure this wasn't just a bad egg. But not happy with this most recent purchase.	
1. 	I've been making my own baby food for a couple of months now and recently purchased these BabySteps freezer trays and love them! I started using a regular ice cube tray (and still do, although I'd like to get another set of these) and find that the BabyStep trays are easier to fill, stack beautifully, and since they have a (nicely fitting) cover, there's no messing with plastic bags and rubber bands to cover for freezing.Several reviews here mention that they are very stiff and it's hard to get the cubes out. The plastic is sturdy (and I like that) but I notice no difference between the ease of popping food cubes out of these vs. regular ice cube trays - frozen food is hard to pop out, that's just a fact. All you have to do is run a little water over the back side for a few seconds, then turn them out with a little tap/twist/shake - I do the same thing with my regular ice cube trays. They also clean up beautifully and quickly (and are dishwasher safe).Another great thing about these trays is that they are BPA/Phthalate free. This is important to me.Note that on the KidCo website (makers of these trays) they state that each section is approximately 1 ounce - not 2 ounces as mentioned in some reviews here and in one of the product descriptions here on amazon.	
1. 	I got this as a gift for a friend and he says that this baby carrier works really well and his baby daughter loves it. He says it feels really secure as opposed to some of the other ones he tried. He also told me that it serves as a great tool for keeping your child distracted at home because you can sit and bounce on a Swiss ball!	
1. 	Seriously. We've been using this thing for a year and cannot imagine the days when monitors were just sound.Pros:*The receiver is chunky so it stands up on its own or the stand on back can be used to prop the screen at an angle.*2 channels let you get the best quality. We live in a 2 story home and haven't had any problem picking up reception through out the house. We had a bunch of interference and was about to get rid of the thing when we realized we could switch it to another channel. It's worked wonders since.*The camera can mount to the wall to allow you to place it where you can best see baby.*The camera can be adjusted up/down/ all around to get the shot you need*Color and B&W; monitor is awesome- though we mainly use the B&W; since it is dark/dim when she's sleeping. It has to be bright (a light on our blinds open) for the color to come through.*Brightness control is great- when you take a peek in a dark room I love to be able to lower the brightness so you aren't blinded by the light and can concentrate on the baby*We plug in the monitor every few days- sometimes up to a week (we don't keep it on through out the night- just turn it on when we need it)*Safety has never been a concern.Cons:*The receiver is rather large and can be bulky if you plan to carry it around. We keep ours on our night stand so it isn't a problem for us.*Newer/other models have an even better feature that lets you move the camera remotely... this was a big desire for us until we got the camera mounted in a spot where we can see the entire crib.*The adhesive strips that come on the brackets don't stick (the ones to mount the cord away from the crib)- these can be replaced but don't count on them.*While the video is awesome and clear the audio has room for improvement (funny since that is the older of the technologies). We don't keep the monitor on at night mainly because of the static/humming noise- we have trouble hearing with it. If the noise is louder (like her crying) it isn't a problem but if you're trying to hear if she is congested/breathing/etc it takes a trained ear to weed out the static.*The light indicator for the audio is unreliable. If I have the video and audio off I cannot rely on the lights. It will flash up to red indicating some noise and I'll switch on the video to see her sound asleep. It will jump all over the place.	
1. 	These bottles are very durable and have lasted a LONG time. Minus a little fading, these bottles look new and the parts still work well.	
1. 	Perfect weight, has held up to daily use and washed at least once a week for the past 5 months +.	
1. 	Sleeping while pregnant is not an easy or comfortable task.  This pillow makes a world of difference.  It is flexible enough to fold into a variety of positions and has turned our bed into a recliner.  I am not sure what I would have done for the last several months without it!	
- 1	I'm really upset about the quality of this bag.  We purchased it to keep our Chicco Keyfit Carseat safe during a flight from Seattle to California.  After the first flight, we found a large rip near the handle (almost 6 inches long).  We've had to repair the bag with duct tape in order for it to be usable.I know this is the cheapest option out there for carseat travel bags, but I would caution others not to get this product.	
- 1	The idea is nice and the design is very cute but the magnet doesn't work that well, especially in bath water. I think this is because the fish/crab/starfish  are too heavy. Our 18 month old boy is not very interested in this toy, and it's hard to teach him to fish because they just don't stick. We have to hold the fish in one hand, and the fishing pole in the other, and force them to stick together, which isn't really fishing	
1. 	A few of these came with the breast pump I bought and I love them, mostly for storage purposes. It's just so easy to line them all up neatly in the freezer.I'm done pumping now, so I kept all of these little containers and my kids play with them. They are great for sand tables and water play. We even took a few to the beach and my daughter used them for collecting tiny seashells.	
1. 	This is just what we needed to get our gate to fit in our large doorway.  It fits fine into the gate and the quality seems to be good, specifically that it feels to be heavy duty.	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
1. 	My baby love this toy! it is colorful and cute and keeps her entertained for hours! this is a great choice for a gift too!	
1. 	I recieved this pump from my hospital when I had my baby. I have to say I have two electric pumps one medela and one playtex and they all take out milk about the same. I use this pump when my baby is sleeping and I need to pump out some milk. The handle is kind of weird but it works really well.I prefer using the pump without the flexishield.I think any standard bottle screws on to this pump I use my medela bottles on this pump too. I recommend this pump for anyone who wants a easy to use and easy to clean product	
1. 	I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.	
1. 	i love this item, i used it till my son could no longer fit in it , i feel asleep listening to him breathe and know he was ok, he now sleeps in his crib in our room but i miss sleeping with him, this best fits a new born to 4 months, but he stayed in it till 6 months we just folded the foot thing under so he could fit	
- 1	This looks super cute but has a terrible user-interface.  Wasted about 1.5 hours trying to set up even the current time, and was even harder to set up the time for kids to wake.  This one went into the garbage.	
1. 	Ive tried so many bottle brushes i just thought i had to live with being unhappy with them. The aponge ones get gross and fall apart very fast and the round brushes are too stiff and i feel like im just scratching my bottles! Till i got these. It had such great reveiws i had to give it a try! It first starts alittle stiff but after only couple uses the bristles became the perfect amount of stiffness and softness!! And i love the plastic nipple cleaners, they work super well. Also since its mostly plastic, i dont have to really worry about yucky mold and mildew!! Highly recommend!!!	
- 1	I had to change the batteries DAILY(we only used it once, maybe twice a night).  It quit working after two weeks.  It's just been sitting in the packaging, because I keep forgetting to return it.	
- 1	There is technically nothing terrible about this product but it sticks as poorly as any other product.  Get a regular $2 bowl at target and call it a day	
1. 	This is a perfect fit for all changing dressers, soft under baby's body, is well made, cleans up easy and last.	
1. 	I ordered these to use with my Harmony manual pump and they fit great.  I realized I needed a smaller flange when my nips bothered me after pumping for only a couple of days with the 24mm flanges that come with the Harmony.  Well since using these 21mm flanges, I've had no problems.If pumping is irritating you, try this size. Chances are you may need to go down, and not up!	
1. 	works well, felt like the baby was fighting with getting enough milk fast enough. Put these on and now she can keep up	
1. 	With my first child I for whatever reason decided I wanted the more expensive bottles becasue they had to be better.  I just had my second child and decided that I would use the basic glass bottles and thought I would give these a try also.  I was a little worried since it has a few different parts, but it turned out to be no big deal.  Compared to the other bottles that have 5ish parts to them, these were very easy to clean.  There is a small rubber piece that goes into the bottom that doesn't need any special tool to clean out.  My son likes the nipple, took to it right away after 8 weeks of no bottles.  I really like the width on them as it makes it easier to hold.  I can imagine when my son is bigger and can hold his own bottle this will be easy for him.  Have not encountered any leaking which is what I get sometimes with the glass bottles.  I really like these bottles more than I thought I would and would recommend them to anyone.	
1. 	so far so good. the hippo we purchased has been effective at preventing the child's head to hit the water spout. it has not come off yet either, which was a key consideration point, as other devices were too flimsy and easily taken off.	
1. 	Holds adult weight.  Terrific value.  We purchased organic mattresses to go along with it.  It matches the DaVinici mini crib.	
1. 	Great price. Great design. Baby is snug inside. Just make sure you attach this to your table securely (we screwed ours in with provided straps). Also buy Carter's brand and Summer Infant to fit this changing pad if you're getting the 32&#34;. Great purchase!	
- 1	I thought this was cute but Its not realistic when it comes to trying to pump with it regularly.  The Nipple openings were really close together and didn't fit me (I wear a 38D)  I didn't like that it clips together....I prefer a zipper because its faster getting it on and off.	
- 1	I bought these for my two-year old daughter who loves Elmo.  However, the Elmo handle is not comfortable to hold for her or for me and the spoon is almost flat so nothing really fits into it.  Since this is the only Elmo set like this I could find I would say you can get it but don't expect much practicality out of it.  my daughter was only interested in the top portion of the spoon and wanted to take it off of the spoon and just play with Elmo until I explained to her that this is the design of the spoon and it won't come off.	
- 1	These are not any good, the lid isn't secure enough. After spilling plenty of medicine we ordered the munchkin brand	
- 1	I just got mine today (ordered elsewhere) and there is no swivel on the clip despite this listing's claim. But at least the plastic parts are opaque black, rather than the more brittle transparent stuff in the pic. Other than the lack of a swivel clip, the harness seems ok. The straps are woven to the needed width, instead of cut from larger webbing and edge-melted to keep from fraying; the material isn't exactly satiny soft, but it's not too bad, and at least it doesn't have scratchy melted edges. But dang it, that swivel clip would save frustration, and the listing SAYS it's there.	
1. 	I registered for this product and received it at my shower. The nurses tried to show me how to swaddle tons of times, but my daughter always seemed to squirm right out of it. When we got home from the hospital I got it out and used it right away.  It worked like a charm, no hassles.  I  could only use it for about 3 weeks and the she learned to kick her way out of it.  She doesn't like to be swaddled anymore, plus she likes her hands free to suck on.  It was great while it lasted and I didn't have to worry about the blanket coming lose and possibly suffocating her.  I recommend this to all new mommy's that can't get the hand of swaddling.	
- 1	I love Playtex and liners but the 4 OZ ones are just too small.  You can't actually get a full four ounces in these once they are wrapped around the bottle neck.	
1. 	We felt like overprotective first time parents when we purchased this monitor, but are so happy that we did.  It is great to be able to see our little guy without having to go into his room and potentially wake him up.  He makes lots of noise while he sleeps, so a quick glance at the monitor lets us know if he needs us or is just being his typically loud-sleeping self.The range is excellent.  Our bedrooms and the baby's nursery are on the 3rd floor of our 5000 sq ft house.  We still get reception when on the 1st floor at the opposite end of the house.  We also get reception in most of our yard.The video quality is great.  It's actually easier to see the baby with the monitor than in person at night.We didn't think we'd have much use for this monitor until our baby was older and able to scoot around in his crib, but we've enjoyed it since moving our baby into his nursery.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	I prewashed these about 6 to 8 times like the internet suggested you do with cloth diaper liners, but when they were dry afterwards, I drizzled some water on them, and it all just beaded up and ran off the edges...How is this going to be helpful for absorbing urine? Answer....it's not. So most likely, I will not be using them at all, and they were a waste of money :-(	
1. 	When my son was younger I was always trying to figure out things for him to look at during tummy time and my dayare teacher recommended this since she has it for the kids there...and I have to say it is awesome....a little hard to fill but that so it won't leak and it never has and he would eventually roll and sit on it and nothing ever leaked.  When he used it for tummy time he could push on it and the items moved...his head would follow them....he enjoyed this toy very much.... I highly recommend as a shower gift or for any mom who wants to give their child something to do during tummy time.	
1. 	I am very pleased with this product. It doesn't change the integrity of the electronic equipment. Little fingers are no longer able to touch the buttons on the cable box. I highly recommend this to those families with happy pointer fingers.	
1. 	I did a lot of research before buying this carseat.  I am very impressed with how easy it is to install.  My husband and I switch cars a lot and thought we would have to buy another car seat, but I can literally install it is less than a minute, so there is no need.  My daughter loves the carseat.  We are about to purchase another carseat from Britax, as we have had our second child in 15 months.  Britax does a great job!	
- 1	I washed this blanket before using.  After washing it was not the soft pretty blanket I bought.  It is a &#34;lint grabber&#34; on the brown hem.I would not buy it again.	
- 1	Amazon has been having trouble recently shipping these scissors. Make sure you get a tiny pair of scissors. Don't try to cut baby's nails with school-sized scissors!Now, assuming you're one of the lucky ones who received the tiny scissors, they're decent for the price. However, over time they get dull and start making ragged cuts. My baby just turned one, and I've now searched for a second replacement pair. Suddenly the cost of these scissors doesn't seem so reasonable when you have to buy a new pair every six months! I finally caved and bought a pair of fancy Rubis scissors instead. They make quicker and cleaner cuts with less work than the Piyo Piyos, which always seem to require lots of &#34;evening up.&#34; When you consider that you'll be cutting baby's nails at least once a week, it makes sense to buy a nicer pair than these.Also the plastic cover on these Piyo Piyos is a choking hazard. You definitely want to keep it away from baby's reach.	
1. 	This is a great baby gate and works perfect for what we need. The only issue we have had with it is that after a while of banging it back and forth going up and down stairs, it has started to twist a little.	
1. 	I got this little sweet sheep as a gift for my son.  From just a few weeks of age, he falls asleep to the soothing sounds. He gets calm from it so easily.  The best part is the batteries last a very long time and the sounds play very long.  The only complaint is that you have to turn the whole thing off to stop the sound, rather than being able to push a start/stop button.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	I've been using this since my baby was a week old. It works very well on cutting his tiny nails. My only complain is it's too expensive!	
- 1	We purchased the lotus and the baby bjorn for an upcoming trip across the country. For us it was a no-brainier, the baby bjorn won out. I found the fold to be slightly more complicated, the mattress to be thiner, and we preferred the solid strip of fabric that runs around the crib like a bumper on the bjorn. I also HATED the quilted sheet that I purchase for the lotus- it made the mattress curl up. Overall I think this is a good quality travel crib, but just not for us.	
1. 	If you need to pump in the car for any reason:Working full-time, during lunch.Long trips (vacation) during the summer.Privacy.Asking someone to drive, while you pump in the back (cord long enough).:)	
1. 	Sturdy, good size, well-made, and (apparently) comfortable for twin babies to sleep in.  This bassinet has come in very, very handy --my life would be a lot harder without it.  This is highly recommended.	
1. 	I prefer Avent breast pads to Gerber and Lansinoh as they are more absorbent, stay in place with adhesive and are really comfortable to wear. I found that Gerber pads leaked straight through and Lansinoh pads were too thin and I hated that wet and burning sensation when wearing them [I leaked a lot and the pads got soaked in minutes and were rubbing my nipples badly :(] Avent pads are realy cushy and soft, and they conform to the natural shape of the breast. They are also perfectly sized: had they been a little bigger, they would hardly fit in the bra. I think they are inexpensive enough for you to try (there're trial 2-packs and packs of 40 pads for less than $5 at Target and Babies'R'Us/Toys'R'us stores). I really like Avent pads better than any other disposable pads I tried. :)	
1. 	Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby.  Had one during her first year.  Now having a second baby and ordered three more!  They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier!  Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby doesn't mind and it still serves it's purpose.	
1. 	For the first few days of my son's birth, we had the wide-neck Avent bottles which leaked, the nipples gave him suction blisters on the lips, he needed extensive burping and he would find it difficult to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in those bottle.  Dr Brown's bottles solved all these issues.I have six bottles and it takes me less than 20 minutes to wash them by hand.  It takes some getting used to washing the small parts, but it's worth the extra effort.  The small brush which comes with the starter kit is essential to clean the small parts.  A regular bottle brush is fine for the bottles themselves.  Save yourself the money and go straight for the 8oz bottles.  The starter kit comes with Level-1 nipples.  You will likely need to graduate your baby to Level-2 niplles at 3-months of age and Level-3 nipples at 6-months of age.  Y-cut nipples are also available for thicker liquids (cereal mixed in milk).If you leave expressed breast-milk in these bottles in the refigerator, the fat tends to stick to the vent (just as a FYI).  Use the travel-discs when transporting milk and there will be no leaks.  My baby hardly needs burping with these bottles, they are that great (he doesn't have reflux by the way).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of.I highly recommend these bottles. I've suggested these bottles to two of my friends whose babies have refulx and they have seen an improvement.  Try some other websites, which have better prices and offer the 9-pack variety.  If you're paying shipping, might as well get some extra small brushes, you'll need them.  One lasts for about 6-8 weeks.	
1. 	This chair was recommended to me by the staff at babies r' us.  I have not been disappointed with it!  It reclines to three positions (like many chairs do), but, unlike other chairs, the footrest reclines with the chair--a very nice feature. It has a height adjustment as well, and folds fairly flat for storage.  It rolls like a dream and the wheels have locks on them for safety.  I did notice, like the above reviewer, that the tray was a little tight initially, but with repeated use has loosened up nicely and I can now slide it easily on and off with one hand.  The tray locks in three positions as well and also comes with 2 additional dishwasher safe removable tray tops.  The seat is very colorful and cute and wipes clean with ease. The chair also comes with an additional reversible seat pad (green one one side, blue on the other side)--I guess this would be used as additional padding for the chair if you were just using it as a chair (if used for eating, it would have to be removed and washed if anything got on it).  My son sits safely in the seat because there is a 5 point adjustable harness built into the chair as well.  I am very happy with this high chair and will be recommending it to all of my new mommy friends!	
- 1	Avent bottles are not as great as all the write ups.  They allow to much air to enter the baby's system.  Spend your money on a better bottle like Dr. Brown's or Platex.  I know several new mother's who bought in the ad hype about these bottles and ended up trashing them and buying something else.	
- 1	In fairness, I did not buy this pump on Amazon. It was covered by my insurance, which originally I thought was a wonderful thing, and I ordered it from one of their authorized medical suppliers. The pump I received has a slightly different appearance from the pump pictured here on Amazon. So...maybe this one is better? But as this one is sold under the exact same name as the one I received in October, 2013, I just have to warn you, don't waste your money! This pump will give you nothing but heartbreak and grief.I got the Ameda Purely Yours just after my second child was born. I had a lot of experience with a manual pump while nursing my first child, which I mention because although I had never used an electric pump before I was not pumping for the first time. For a week or two I got great results with the Ameda but things started to go downhill after that. I just wasn't getting much milk. First I suspected the batteries (since at work I couldn't pump near an outlet), but using the A/C adapter at home made no difference. Little by little it seemed the pump's suction was weakening. It was so gradual that I thought maybe I was getting accustomed to pumping and becoming less sensitive to feeling the suction, so therefore the fact I was getting so little milk made me worry that my supply was going down. After a 52-minute interrogation with customer service, during which they asked me every detail of my pumping routine, washing routine, and anatomy and took me through a lengthy troubleshooting process, they established that nothing was wrong with the pump itself. They referred me to a lactation consultant who wasted my time telling me all about how nursing supply and demand works, and that my lack of milk production was because I didn't pump enough, even though I was pumping every chance I got and trying desperately to keep up my supply. She then decided that my breasts were too large for the standard flanges provided. Believe me, that is the first and probably last time anyone has told me that MY very modestly sized breasts were too large for ANYTHING.So she sent me larger flanges, and smaller ones just for kicks, and new valves and new silicone diaphragms. Tried all that, didn't help. I was getting more and more stressed out as my milk output dwindled. But this whole time, my baby seemed to be getting plenty to eat while I was home nursing her. I just couldn't even come close to replacing what she'd eaten while I was away.One night the pump just wouldn't turn on. I was relieved that I finally had some concrete evidence that something was wrong with the pump. A few minutes later it did turn on, and as usual it took me about 20 minutes to get an ounce total from both breasts. In frustration, I got out my old manual pump and in about 10 more minutes had pumped 5 more ounces from ONE breast! Ok, so the problem was not me. When I called customer service and told them about how much milk I'd been able to get with the manual pump to illustrate that my milk supply was fine, the lady replied, Well, you're always going to get more milk with a manual pump! Really? That much more? Then what's the point?? Anyway, the fact that the pump had not turned on entitled me to a new pump motor. This one worked slightly better than the previous one, but the difference was so slight that after a couple of days of trying, I switched back to using my manual pump exclusively.I don't know what's wrong with the design of the Ameda Purely Yours but it just. doesn't. work. Other than that I hate it, I do have some more specific comments. The white valve (the most delicate part) can't be removed by hand. You have to pry it out with something else. I use the blunt end of silverware when I'm at home and scrounge around for a makeshift tool when I'm not. My Lansinoh manual pump's valve has an extra lip designed to be grabbed and pulled without damaging it. Something I never noticed before experiencing the inconvenience of bad design. As some other users have commented, the fastest setting is the same speed as the baby's normal sucking, so there's no way to make it go as fast as the baby's initial sucking to get a good letdown. That's IF the pump even gives you any suction at all.	
- 1	I couldn't use this pillow to breastfeed. Maybe it is because my daughter is too small (10%) or I am too small (115lbs, 5'5) but it kept moving away from me and my daughter sliding between the pillow and me. It was a total waste on that side. I ended up borrowing a My Best Friend pillow which worked great.I did use the Boppy to support her while playing and sitting up. I recommend it for that.	
- 1	It is really cute but you can't get your hand in and a snack back out.  It didn't improve with time/use.  My toddler couldn't use it at all	
1. 	We love these bibs. We used iplay bibs for drooling and spit up (which are also awesome), however, they weren't cutting it for baby food. These are soft, rinse or wipe right off, and dry quickly. I thrown them in the wash once a week for good measure and they are fine there too. Even forgot and put them in the dryer and they were still fine. And how cute are the pattern choices?! Love.	
1. 	This does the job quite nicely, particularly for the price.  If a little one were really persistent, he/she could probably dig fingers through the opening, so I plug up the openings I don't have anything plugged into with the caps they include.  It isn't easy to unlatch, if you latch it well. My only complaint is that I have to unlatch it to plug something new in, but I can't fault the product-that is just how baby proofing goes sometimes.	
1. 	These outlet covers work great!  They were easy to install and are very easy to use.  We now have them on most of our outlets.  Great buy!	
- 1	I was so disappointed to find out the hard way that this mattress contains polyurethane foam. I purchased it because it was marketed as safe.  The product description states:Quote made from a natural coconut palm fiber and latex-free foam to create a completely organic inner foundationThis is not true.  If the manufacturer had  disclosed that the foam contained polyurethane - a very unnatural substance and toxin known to damage immune systems -I never would have bought it.  I won't buy MDB products anymore.	
1. 	I got these for my 3 year old and 14 month old daughters. I got them to replace my gerber ones that didn't keep anything in them if the child held them wrong. My kids can't get anything out by shaking these or holding them upside down. The only problem I had was my 14 month old sticks her hand in it and then tips it upside down, which keeps the top open and sometimes smaller stuff falls out. But all in all a very good product.	
1. 	My chunky little one enjoyed hers for a while. It is beautiful, soft and looks unbelievably comfortable. (I just wish they made tem in my size.) They work lovely to sooth newborns and even has a soft blanket and toy.	
1. 	These are great - I am so glad I found them. I even own the pumpin' pals large and xtra large and I still will reach for these sheilds instead. I get a great output of milk with these vs pumpin' pals decreased my output (I have read that it takes a week to notice an increase though?). Anyways, these work great - no pain and are easy to use.	
- 1	Only gave it this review because it was much bigger than &#34;demi&#34; would suggest and did not fit our stroller.	
- 1	Here's what I've learned in the last couple months: don't get the obscure brand of baby anything. I can find any stroller this will work with. Or any adapter for any stroller. I wrote to Safety 1st and they were confused by my model number even though the seat is brand new. I wish I'd just gotten the whole travel system or stayed away from this brand.	
1. 	Baby has 4 front teeth in and loved using anything to naw on to help. The back teeth are coming in, baby wakes up in the middle of the night crying from pain and the only that helps, is this toothbrush, which she loves to use for brushing her teeth also. I think the angle of the toothbrush is able to massage the back gums where the tooth is coming in. This works great as a toothbrush and as a back of the mouth teether.	
- 1	Not thrilled with it.  For the same price you can get the Dr brown set where you can stack or use individually with lids.  I thought there was a lid for some reason below the &#34;formula dispenser&#34; but there is not so you have to use that each time.  Maybe when she is older I will use it when we are out to put food in to dispense but right now the entire thing is just sitting unused in the cabinet.	
- 1	I bought this because of the reviews and the name.  I had never seen it in person and if I had I would have never bought it.  I have a boy and the pee shield is very low.  When we first bought it he refused to use it so we just hung onto it. He's had a set back with potty training and I decided to take it out one more try to give it a try.  He used it.  He peed. All. Over. The. Floor.  Luckily I was standing right there to help him, how shall I say-direct-him where he need to go.  But it was too late, he peed down the front of the seat right where I needed to pick it up which mean I either clean it before I empty as well as after I empty it or I get pee on my hand.This seat doesn't have the high seat like the other one does but I think all that will do is cause them to lean back and have a bigger chance of accidents.The non-skid bottom is nice but I don't know of any potty chairs that don't have them.  Not having a lid is a good-bad thing.  We have an extremely small bathroom which means we also need a stool for him to reach the sink, if it had a lid it would take care of having the extra item in the small space.  However, having a lid is just one more step a child has to do when they are bouncing around trying not to go.The potty seat came in an unsealed, plain plastic bag in a the Amazon box only, it did not come in the Babybjorn potty chair box.  I couldn't help but wonder if I received a returned item.	
- 1	We ordered this toy from Drugstore.com, which showed a picture of an older model, not the new upgraded toy. The idea of this toy is intriguing but the actual execution of the idea is less than stellar. The music is tinny and unattractive. Apparently, the older model had better sound quality, which is why I went with this vendor. However, communicating with Drugstore.com and the whole return process is a significant hassle. The also blamed the deceptive picture they used on a glitch with the manufacturer.  I would actually recommend either getting a used model with all purple corners (the older model) or buying  it at a brick and mortar location so you can actually listen to it. If you are going to purchase on Amazon, consider another vendor. Very disappointed. I will not do business with this vendor again.	
- 1	Got one as a gift and now have to return it.  It is not as universal as it states.  The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly.  It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller.	
- 1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.	
1. 	It is a nice product and definitely keeps my baby warm with the colder months coming up. I can also tell that he will be able to use it will he is much older. However, I am currently using it on my City Mini Baby Jogger. I have found that after installing Bundle Me, I am not able to recline the seat. I need to leave it upright as the rubber strap that holds Bundle me to the stroller would not allow it to extend. also, with this installed, trying to get out the strap that folds the stroller into half is a little more cumbersome. Not absolutely perfect, but still defintely useful and more convenient than using a blanket to him him warm .	
- 1	It sounds like a good cup in theory, but in practice, my son had to work too much to drink water and gave up after about a day, he has not touched this bottle ever since.	
- 1	Love the idea but it just doesn't work quite as well as the pictures say.  The thing sags so much in the shelf/pockets that stuff falls off...even with the plastic supports inserted.  The velcro fasteners don't have enough grip to stay attached, so nails are really the only option and I didn't want to nail this stupid thing into the side of my convertible changing table.	
1. 	Bought this for my 2 yr old - she loves it. The stars project in a clear way - no blurriness and they fill her whole room, including ceiling and walls with stars and a moon. The controls are simple and work as they should. I love the automatic turn off feature after 45 minutes. Comes with batteries already and mine has been working with the original batteries for over 2 months (we turn it on every night).	
1. 	Our 9 month old baby boy has many of the little toys, and this is one of his favorites.  He likes to hold it and shake it back and forth.  Haba toys are the best!	
1. 	This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the things with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with things to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.	
1. 	This is nice accessory, I'm happy that I ordered it. It makes the seat more comfortable, and also protects the seat, it's easy to wash. The material could be better quality, it feels a bit cheap... And for the steep price, I would have expected better. Still, it's the only one designed for this seat and it fits perfectly, for me it's an essential with my BOB. Bottom line, I would recommend it.	
- 1	I use the OXO wipe container for Zhaba the Shi Tzu since I use baby wipes daily to clean her face and legs. It's a little larger than I'd expected but looks better in the bathroom than the full container. My only complaint is that this is not at all airtight and despite its being attractive, a Tupperware container works better in the car. I don't mind using two hands to open a container if I know the contents are wet as they should be. The OXO holder can be opened by pushing its single button but the wipes don't remain wet for as long.EDIT: I called OXO because my container continuously popped open. They immediately e-mailed me a return postage label and within a couple of days a replacement was on its way. The new one is absolutely perfect. The first one I had was difficult to close after I inserted the wipes. This one is not. The first one had a pop top that continuously popped open, whereas this one remains firmly closed until the button is depressed. I believe the green on this one is different than the first because the strap does not exactly match but that does not matter to me.EDIT:  We aren't using this dispenser anymore because the wipes just dry out too fast, even when kept inside in a controlled temperature.  This case stays firmly closed and requires a substantial press to pop the lid, but the wipes still dry out completely after three days.  I've resorted to moistening the wipes with warm water at home to use and would not consider doing this if if we were on the go.  We've also used three different types of wipes to see if that had any influence on the dehydration, but they all react similarly.  I can only recommend this product if you need something to hold your wipes for a day or two.	
- 1	I got this chair for my boy when he was only about a month old so I didn't try it right away but it did look cheap and way too much plastic exposed. I started putting my baby in it when he was 3 months old and this chair is horrible the back is completely flat which lets the baby slide from side to side and down, the cover is way too thin not even soft enough to let the baby sit there for more then a few minutes. The sliding and the cheap cover turned out to not even be the worst part when my baby began eating solids this chair is even worse since the straps are hanging in from of the baby and he prefers to eat those instead of the food! I wish we didn't throw the box right away I would've retuned it.	
1. 	The product is smaller than your typical oversized baby nail clippers. Very easy to store. I would buy another one if I needed it.	
1. 	I am a first time mom and went back to work needing to pump to keep my supply up and provide bottles to my daycare provider for my little guy. I was taking my breastshields with me from home to work and then home again to wash and then all over again. Well, of course there were dayw when I would leave them at home and then have to go back home to get them. I ordered these to keep at work in my desk- lifesaver! They are one piece- and very easy to clean. I would definitely recommend these and some sterilizer bags for any working mommy who needs to pump for their little one. LOVE Medela products and their customer service is top-notch!!

- 1	At first, I was so happy with this product.  It's great to have a way to keep milk cold so that you don't have to rush to the fridge all the time.BUT . . . the straw disintegrated under my son's teeth, and Thermos has terrible customer service.  The rep said that they don't warrant the straw and that I should throw it away and buy a new one.  When I asked for her name, she refused to give it but instead transferred me into a voicemail.	
1. 	If you want to avoid having your little one sit on a dirty toilet, this product is great. I haven't had any issues with it so far. My son just starting using the toilet, and this has been great for us. I do worry about his skin getting pinched as I am putting him on the toilet, though. I just try to be careful when placing him on it. He doesn't use the handles either, so they haven't been good or bad for us.	
- 1	We had this rocker upstairs and a bouncer downstairs.  My daughter much preferred the bouncer to the rocker (and the swing).  Now my daughter is 18 months and wants to sit in the rocker, but she also wants to climb on it, making it unsafe.  She has other chairs that she doesn't try this on.  One other thing that I preferred about the bouncer is that you could pull the toys and they played music.	
- 1	I love the lollacup size, BPA free, has handles, etc. But these are not friendly to a kid under 2 years old who wants to hold it upside down because it constantly drips, and there are many parts to clean. I went back to Dr. Browns sippy cups, much easier and 100% zero drip!	
1. 	This bouncer is worthy every penny.  I started putting my son in it when he was around 4-weeks old and he still uses it all the time and he is almost 7-months old now.  This is one baby item which has paid for itself (though I got this as a gift!)  I really don't know how we could have done without it.  It is just the thing to use when you are done with carrying your little one around, done playing with him in your lap, tummy-time is done and laying on the Boppy or the play-mat is done as well.  I mostly use it without the arch because he just likes the reclined position and the bounce.  He became interested in the sounds and the fish around 3-4 months of age.  He always enjoyed the vibrations though.  The volume has two-settings, not too soft and not too loud.  There is a nice variety of sounds/music - not annoying in the least bit.  I have gotten many chores done while my baby has been in this bouncer.It is easy to assemble and is very sturdy.  The grips on the frame are an excellent non-slip feature.  It has a three-point harness which is a nice safety feature.  Excellent battery-life.  Vibrant fabric which is easy to clean.  I don't know what we are going to replace the bouncer with once my baby outgrows it.  Would definitely buy again and highly recommend it.	
- 1	This temperature reading on this camera is about 3 to 4 degrees higher than the temperature actually is in the room.	
1. 	This held up great to two babiesand a lot of guest babiesand has been handed over to another expecting motherWashed wellstill looked goodthe music might drive you bonkers but....well that happens when you have a new baby and no sleep.BUT... if your baby is a rolling little thing they can knock it down if you don't have it standing up right	
1. 	This is a great first toothbrush. Our son likes to chew on it, but doesn't let us help him with it. So while it does get his few teeth clean, soothe his gums, and provide general merriment for him, it isn't preparing him to use a toothbrush. Overall, a good product. I'm glad we have it.	
- 1	This might be the first item i've purchased that I might return from Amazon.  I bought this babybook because the reviews seemed decent and I liked how others said it was modern and not overly cute.  However this book is just plain.  All the pages just have standard large font Ariel print, it could have been printed off a laserjet.  The pages don't seem professional at all.  It includes pages such as first christmas, easter, hanukkah, halloween etc.  It also includes first trip to doctor, a family tree to fill out, a few memory pages etc.  90% of the pages instruct photos to be placed in photo corners (which are also included) and at the end of teh book there are a few pages with plastic photo coverings where you can write a description of the memory.I am disappointed in the book because it is overly plain.  I like modern things and defintely try to avoid anything overly cute but this book doesn't do the trick.  I think kids might get a bit bored looking at the pages.Qualitywise the book is protected by a clear thick plastic covering you can take off or keep.  It also includes an ink pad.  I'd give it two stars but it seems like that would be overly harsh but a three would be too generous.  It's just mediocre.  About 5 of the pages were bent back and creased.	
- 1	When this was first out, you needed it as you didnt have other options, now you do.  Boppy's are small, low which causes mommy upper back/neck issues and its use is very short lived.  Plus if you have any chest at all they are not that practical. We researched them after I had a boppy for a week, because I hated them, I thought they were outdated for nursing moms/bottle moms and moms in general.  We ended up getting the Natural Boost Adjustable Nursing Pillow by Leachco, which was FANTASTIC!  My son is now 2yrs old and we STILL can use it for so many things!  It lets you adjust the height!  Yep, wether you are tall or short, thin or larger it fits because it isnt meant to go around you, its meant to bring baby to a comfy position for mommy AND baby.  It has a bolster pillow that is also velcro'd on and you can flip it to either side, or move it under you or you can take it off.  This was a lifesaver for breast feeding, bottle feeding, reading books or just holding eachother while they are studying mommy (or daddy's) face. I have heard bad comments because it doesnt have a cover-so what, I throw it in with my darks and its been fine. Plus even with a cover babys spit up and you have to wash the covers and I would still wash the pillow-yuck otherwise.  I wash it 1X a week and for 2yrs there is no rips, tears or anything. Because you can put the baby higher leaning, it takes away a bunch of gas in the tummy and spitting up since you shouldnt have a baby flat to begin with.  Yes we used the boppy for things like holding sitting baby up, using it for a tummy time holder, but that was it.  I just wish they came in more colors!Leachco Natural Boost - Adjustable Nursing Pillow - Denim	
- 1	I am not at all happy with this product. They fall off when the weather turns cold (below 30) or gets hot (above 80 outside). A total wate of money. I will be buying a different product.	
1. 	My three month old loves this gym. She isn't very good at entertaining herself yet, but she kicks and plays happily in this gym. The toys are easy to move around and keep her attention so mom can get a thing or two done around the house!The music is much less annoying than many other toys & the nature sounds actually sound pretty nice. It also is great for tummy time. This product could replace a tummy time mat, a bouncer seat & many other toys.I'd recommend spending the extra money to get this over a less expensive gym.	
- 1	I don't know if it fits better on another brand of car seat, but the fit on the chicco keyfit, is all wonky, it doesn't cover all of the top, and it runs quite short.  We were up in Conn. during a snowstorm over Halloween weekend recently, and being from VA, i wanted to make sure she stayed warm, so i got some tight and this to supplement what clothes i had with me to keep her warm.  It did keep her warm, but it doesn't even go to the end of the car seat on either end, and my husband hates to try and buckle her in with it as he has a hard time find where straps have gone, its a good thing i don't think we will be using it long as shes over 6 months now. I posted pictures because i wanted to see how they fit before buying one initially, and nowhere did i find pictures of them on different brand seats.	
- 1	this car seat was very difficult to install as a rear-facing seat. the instructions are not very clear, and we were unable to get the tilt just right. unfortunately, it did not work in our mazda cx-5 (a crossover vehicle). we could not tilt it enough without the front seats getting in the way. for it to work, you'd have to move both driver and passenger seats very forward. we decided to go with an infant carseat instead.	
- 1	I thought this travel tray was great, the two times we used it.  Then one of the webbing straps frayed just about the point of useless.  I can probably repair it, but I would expect this item to stay intact for more than two uses.	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift which was on my registry. I did read all the reviews here and all the negatives were that it didn't fit the crib. Well it fit my crib fine, but the craftsmanship on this mobile is not really up to par. The bird up top is just a cloth covering. I thought it was an actual plush. The birdie perched on the branch is lopsided. The branch itself is lopsided. And the kicker? The mobile plays a different melody than Brahms which is stated on the box itself. The mobile I have plays something that sounds like twinkle twinkle little star, and I actually had to google Brahms lullaby to make sure I was going crazy and hearing the wrong melody.I wanted to return it but was told that since I opened it and assembled it, I won't be able to so I'm stuck with it.	
- 1	The mirror always moves.  We try to secure it, but then it seems to move again.  Not impressed with this product.	
1. 	Was able to secure a 6 foot bookcase without any issues. Screws were not a problem. Always possible for a long screw to break, just drill a pilot hole. Straps seemed sturdy. If you want them flush to the wall, you need to install the wall piece well below the piece attached to the unit (several inches.)	
- 1	I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews about this product before I bought the postpardum girdle with side zipper.  At first, it was great and I loved how my clothes fit.  However, after less than the week, the boning in the girdle had developed permanent dents that dug into my skin.  It left marks and became increasingly uncomfortable to wear.  It isn't made for anyone who sits for any period of time, and as a new mother, I have to sit in order to feed my daughter.  Too much money spent for only a weeks use.  I did notify the company because it is not a good product for new mothers to wear.  Maybe the pull up support is better but there is no way I am spending more money on a new girdle to find out.  I do NOT recommend this product.  I will probably go out and buy a good pair of spanx.  Much cheaper (and more comfortable).	
1. 	I mostly use the Ameda electric, but used this on a weekend trip and was very pleased with the milk volume.  I get most of the milk in just a few minutes and the one hand operation is simple.Drawbacks: it can be tricky to get the suction going, but little pumps at first followed by long slow pumps will eventually get it. Also, I've found that I can still get milk out with my electric even after I'm done with the Isis.  It is a little higher maintenance to clean, but I still recommend it.	
- 1	I thought this looked awesome just based on the shape and all the different textures, but i cannot get my baby into this one.	
- 1	Early Intervention/physical therapist says to limit babies usage to no more than 30 mins a day! Same goes for other Jumpers that hang from the door frame. Its not good for their legs.this is bulky and hard to move. The three posts shake and create lots of noise.Although they are a safe place to put child, while older kids are in room or have to run to the bathroom. I like the exersaucer style better.	
1. 	I was looking for a bouncing ball that's a little bigger than this one for my 1 year old daughter, but this one caught my attention. I had not noticed the size in the description but after reading the reviews, realized that it was much smaller than what I was looking for. I loved the idea of the little head popping in and out with gravity so I got it for her. It is small but I don't think it's too small. It fits perfectly in a little one's hand who just learned to walk. My daughter loves to walk around holding it in her hand. She's only had it for a week (early Christmas present) and it's one of her favorite toys. She's fascinated with the little heads and just loves to hold it. It's very well made, cute and unique. I highly recommend it!	
1. 	This is a great pump. I haven't had any issues with it. I pump constantly as my son is very finicky as to when he wants a bottle or a breast in his mouth.  Easy to use and clean. The carrying case is great for when I go back to work and it can also be used as a carrying bag for keeping milk/formula cold when you go out.  While I love the pump I am not happy with the Avent Bottles. They can leak easily if you over or under tighten the bottle.  Let me tell you at three in the morning you dont' want to worry about that stuff.  You want to get a nipple on and feed.  I recommend the pump but not their bottles.  Sometimes if I put down the pump on the bed and it tips a bit I get spillage from where the pump connects to the bottle.	
1. 	my son has been using this ince 3months old And still uses it to this day for over 3 years.  Battery last quite a bit since I find in the morning still turned on.  The light defaults to green, which is the brightest, when turned on, and you chan change to blue (little dimmer) and yellow (bit more dimmer).Good alternative to night light.  We've taken this to camping with us.  I have given the this one, a sea turtle and lady bug as a gift to friends and family	
- 1	for $10 you get two ink pads, 4 sheets, and 1 baby wipe. let me tell you why it's not worth it:1. the ink pads aren't closable. you won't get all the limbs done at once. so if you think you can save the ink pads for later, you'll be disappointed. our ink pads smeared all over the bag that holds them (it's really just a ziplock. when we took them out again, they had smeared all over each other and were a mess to work with.2. there's only one baby wipe! how are you supposed to use this later if you can't do it all at once?3. there's nothing special about the cardstocksave your money.	
- 1	Please Please PLEASE do not use this aspirator without a back up!  It works great fresh out of the box, but six months after purchasing it I have laid it to rest in the garbage can.  It has multiple design flaws, the largest of which is that it requires fresh batteries every 2-3 days for frequent use.  And if your baby is congested, you need to use it frequently!  Thank heavens I ordered theBabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue)and it's arriving later today...since this one died 7 hours ago, and my poor baby is so congested he can't drink his bottle without throwing up!  :(	
1. 	This is the BEST infant bath seat around!  We live in a small apartment and really needed a bath seat/tub that was compact and easy to store.  We first had the Puj Tub, which seemed like a great solution, but it was actually too SMALL for our sinks.  It came unsnapped as soon as we placed our baby in it because it wasn't fully supported all around.  Then, I was over at a friend's house one night and saw that she was bathing her 6 month old son in this infant bath seat.  I was amazed at how small it was, but how well-supported and comfortable her (hefty) baby boy was in it!  And then, when I found it on-line, I was even more amazed by the inexpensive price tag compared to all of the other tubs on the market.  I immediately bought it and haven't looked back!  It fits perfectly in our single basin kitchen sink (although we have to position it along the diagonal of the sink).  Our son loved the seat from the beginning.  He sits in it without any complaint.  We now have to put it in our bath tub, though, because our son is really long and didn't like having his legs scrunched up inside the sink (this is an issue with bathing him in the SINK, not with the bath seat).  The bath seat has suction cups on the bottom, so the seat doesn't shift around in the bath tub while he kicks away in the water!  Best of all, it stores away neatly in our linen closet and would probably fit in most under-sink cabinets (we have a pedestal sink, so we keep it in the closet).  I would recommend this bath seat to ANYONE and I've already purchased one for my brother's new baby!	
1. 	My daughter has outgrown her crib and therefore also her crib light up toys.  She was used to having something soothing to distract her.  We got the turtle and she loves it.  We make choosing which of the three colors she wants as part of our bedtime routine.  I really like that the light lasts for 45 minutes, not just 5 minutes like many other night time toys/lights.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it also made night sounds.  We ended up getting a separate sound machine also.  Would highly recommend	
1. 	My daughter LOVES this toy. When all of the lights are off, it makes a wonderful light show! It keeps her occupied long enough after we lay her down for her to fall asleep on her own.  It was worth every penny!  She loves to watch the bubbles rise to the surface--her favorite part!	
- 1	I bought this for my 5 month old son because he likes having a paci at night as well as a stuffed animal. First of all, the paci on this is horrible and it is way to small for a 5 month old to hold in his mouth. Would be soo much better if it had a larger pacifier and a MAM type pacifier. Do not wast your money	
1. 	I'm glad I bought these and it would be really helpful if the hubs would actually read the labels so I wouldn't have to reorganize every week...	
- 1	I really didnt like it. I think it is way too thin and the material quality its poor. The graphics are nice, tough. Ok if you plan to change the mat every week or so.	
1. 	We wanted a potty for our daughter to start using once day when she was about 7 months old. This one has been great - it isn't so big that her butt falls through the hole, but it definitely has room to grow. She seems to like sitting on it and using it and it is very easy to clean.	
1. 	LOVE this crib.  It's the perfect size and my little girl is just turning two and still loves it.  We're so glad we purchased it for her crib.	
- 1	We bought this for our UB Cruz stroller (which we like a lot), and it seems like UPPAbaby never actually tested this organizer on their own stroller. With the seat forward facing (the most common direction, and the only one that allows you to fold the stroller), the organizer makes it harder or impossible to change the seat angle between upright and reclining. The only way the seat can move past the organizer is if the organizer is at the very top of the frame and the handle is extended to the longest position.The organizer is held on with velcro, so it needs to be reattached every few days when the velcro loosens. It also tends to slide down the frame.The entire organizer is much larger and heavier than it needs to be for the limited function it gives you -- a cupholder and a couple of small pockets.Another reviewer said that UPPAbaby told her they would pass along negative feedback to their design team. They didn't even bother to do that when I wrote to them.	
- 1	I began to create a video comparison review of this car seat compared to our Chicco keyfit 30 car seatChicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat, Adventure, but there were just too many glaring issues and I could not fit them all into the video (Amazon has limits on the size/duration of video reviews).Perhaps if I did not have a Chicco keyfit 30 to compare with, I might have not think so poorly of this First Years Via car seat, but they are similarly priced (both around $150 at the time of this review) so it is a reasonable comparison.We purchased the Chicco because it has the top safety rating from Consumer Reports. I got the Via (from Amazon Vine) because I thought it would be a good back-up car seat for our second car and I liked that it could handle babies up to 35 pounds.The first thing I do with all baby gear is remove the fabric portions and wash them several times to remove/reduce the chemical fabric treatments (water repellants, flame retardants, dyes, and all other carcinogenic/ endocrine disrupting additions they put on baby stuff these days). The Via fabric cover began to come apart ofter the very first washing. After the second washing, it looked old and tattered. I didn't have these problems with the Chicco Keyfit. Putting the fabric back on the car sear was easier than the Chicco. Next, we attempted to install the base in our second car. It was not intuitive like the Chicco is. The Via was difficult. Despite the car being on a level surface we could not get the base to level even at the highest setting. We thought it might be the car, so we removed the Chicco base from our primary car and installed it in the second car. No problem getting the Chicco Keyfit leveled. The instructions for the Via recommend to put a rolled up towel or a pool noodle (yes, really) under the base to make it level. We opted for the rolled up towel, but even then it wasn't looking good. The second car has leather seats and the towel was sliding around easily stuffed under the end of the plastic Via. I am not sure that a pool noodle would have been much better.Next, we try to latch the Via base to the straps in the car. Uhg. We got it done, but it isn't quick and easy like the Chicco. And at the end of it, the Via was loose compared to the Chicco, even with the towel stuffed under it and making adjustments to the Via is a pain.The carrying handle on the Via is thickly padded and my husband liked the feel of it in his hand more than the Chicco, but the Via is also heavier than the Chicco which made it more uncomfortable for me to carry. The carrying handle is loose on the Via. It has play of about an inch which gives it a shoddy feel and makes it noisy. The Chicco handle locks into a position and doesn't budge.The Via is more difficult to mount into and remove from it's base than the Chicco which slides in and out of the base easily.The level indicator on the Via is a metal ball (about half the size of a marble) housed in a clear plastic tube. It is also noisy as it rolls around banging end to end in its tube. The level indicator on the Chicco base is a liquid bubble and is silent and discreet.All in all, the Chicco Keyfit 30 is in a much higher league than the First Years Via. I am surprised they are in the same price range. I would not select the Via again if I had to do it over.[...]	
1. 	Very soft.  Elastic fits well.  Washes well.  I bought the apple green and it is a bright pop of green color in the room, which i love.	
- 1	Within one year, 3 out of 4 of these were broken. We are able to use the last one still but I am sure it is only a matter of time before the plastic band breaks on it too. Do not waste your money. At first they seem great but they will break!	
1. 	Product seems to be good for now, but already seems to be losing air. Doesn't seem like it will hold up to multiple children, but wouldnt hesitate to buy another one for second child.	
- 1	I wish the tray was easier to put on.  It has to be put on when the baby is already in the chair.  Of course he wants to grab it when I'm trying to slide it in and I get nervous that I am going to pinch his fingers.  Plus you have to remove the pommel on the chair first.  It seems like it's easy to scratch his legs without the pommel.	
1. 	I think that this food processor is a bit small for when you want to do big batch of food but I love it because :1. It gives a really smouth purees2. It's easy to clean (diswasher !!!)3. Usefull even with toddlers who are not always comfortable with meat.	
- 1	I bought this to replace our Planet Wise bag after the zipper broke. Our PW bag had plenty of use, so there's no surprise the zipper failed. Instead of buying another PW bag, I wanted to save $12 and try this wet bag out. I wish I had spent the extra money on a different bag. It's much smaller than I thought considering some of the reviews saying it fit a good amount of diapers. I hang the bag on a closet door next to the changing pad. I never realized how much more efficient a bag with a zipper on top could be. If this bag is very full, it's difficult to open without having a diaper fall out. It gets the job done, but I wish I hadn't been so cheap.	
1. 	The Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet is a very useful product.  It protects the sheet, eliminating the need to change the crib sheet if there is diaper leakage or spitting up.  It goes on and off in seconds - so helpful to a Mom, especially in the middle of the night. It is large enough to cover the whole crib surface.  It seems to be waterproof and yet doesn't make the baby sweaty.My only concern would be that since it attaches to the crib rails, there is an outside chance a baby could loosen/undo a strap.I think it would be handy to have two of these to rotate them out.  I like it and would recommend it.	
1. 	I chose this soft food feeder because it was made in the US and the feeder bags weren't dyed.  Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth.	
1. 	This is such a sweet little lamb that makes soothing sounds to comfort infants. It's every bit as cute and cuddly as the picture.	
1. 	My 18-month-old uses it every day.  She walks around the house during snack time with it and it keeps everything clean and crumb-free.  We also let he use it in the car.  Very useful!	
1. 	We bought this dresser a year ago for our daughter's nursery. I easily assembled it while my husband was at work. It looks great and the color is beautiful!	
1. 	This is definitely the best carrier on the market. It gives the best support for me and my daughter loves it. It is also helpful that the carrier comes in adult colors. Sometimes you want to look like a grownup instead of always wearing pastels or items with cartoon animals on it : ) I have tried other carriers and this is by far the highest quality on the market. It is worth the extra money.	
1. 	if you use avent bottles, this is soooo convenient :) I highly recommend this product, I can pump directly to my PES bottles.	
1. 	We bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. We were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. This fits the table perfectly, and I love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. Many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. They all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. I also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. I also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. The only thing I didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. The pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once I had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. I would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. Overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon.	
- 1	Waited for this color for about 2 months, finally came but..... The peacock color is not as pictured. Color is more of plain blue with a darker hue to it... quite far from the image shown for advertisement, so sad, I thought it would be pretty. Returning it for kiwi. Here's to hoping kiwi color is same as pictured!	
1. 	it's larger than i expected but i will keep it until my son can fit into it. my son is 25 lbs and around 28 inches, which is why i bought the Large based on the weight recommendation, but even the Medium is quite large on him right now. would suggest using the height recommendation as a closer indicator of what size to buy rather than weight.	
1. 	este articulo fue embalado en una caja inmensa y a al hora de pagar el envio hasta Venezuela salio en 800 bsf. imag&iacute;nense hubiera salido mejor comprarlo aqui, aunque si nos ahorramos algo pero no fue mucho... con los pocos dolares que da cadivi es mejor comprar algo que si valga la pena (que el envio no sea tan costoso)... por otro lado es muy bueno ya que el bebe se divierte mucho con los sonidos y articulos que trae...	
- 1	I have a dog and a toddler that love to play through our sliding screen door.  I was hoping that this item would provide some much needed protection from their rough housing.  I was disappointed on several levels:- The packaging. Seriously, if I had sent something like this through the mail, I would have been embarrassed. It was shoved into a giant cardboard box that was still too small (width wise) for the item. The door saver was bent and the box was barely held together with tape.  Luckily, because of the flexible plastic the item wasn't damaged, but now that I am having to send it back, I had to struggle to get it back in the box.  And yes, I will be embarrassed when I drop it off at the UPS store.- The cheap material of this screen door saver won't save anything.  I needed something more rigid that would resist all of the pushing the screen door receives from my daughter and dog. This is so cheap and flexible, it just adds weight against the screen door.  As my husband said, this item would do more damage to the screen door than anything our dog or daughter could dish out.- Attaching it will destroy your screen door.  It requires screws and while I cannot attest to how easy it is to install since we never got that far, it's pretty obvious that it will be ugly as sin with a big plastic screen and screws in the screen door frame.Bottom line - if you are concerned about protecting your screen door, save your money and invest in a new screen door with a built in screen protector.  We're just going to let the dog and baby play with ours until it needs to be replaced and then will invest in a tougher screen.	
1. 	I was looking for something to replace the free cooler given to you at the hospital when you have a baby.  This is the perfect replacement- it holds two cold packs and one bottle, or two bottles with a cold pack.  The liner folds out of the casing for easy cleaning.  Great product at a great price!	
1. 	I heard this product from others, haven't use it for my love because it's a bit of bigger, I may use it later.	
1. 	I searched far and wide for a booster for my two year old.  I thought that this looked like the best one, and the price was not too bad.  I was right!  My favorite thing about this booster is that it is very easy to clean! No nooks or crannys for food to get stuck in. It wipes clean very easily.I also like that it is low profile and not offensive looking.The seat does not slip off the chair and feels pretty sturdy.I think that this chair is the best value to price out there.  I just ordered a second for the grandparents' house!	
1. 	When our daughter started eating finger foods, she tended to get messier than she does when we spoon-feed her.  Even with a regular bib, I found myself spending a substantial amount of time treating her clothes for stains.  These bibs are great - waterproof, wide coverage, and a pocket to catch dropped or dribbled bits.  It doesn't hurt that they are cute, too.  I also like the fact that they are machine-washable, but if the mess isn't too big, you can also just wipe them clean.  I am spending a lot less time/money on stain removal on her clothes!  We'll likely buy more, as we have another baby on the way!	
1. 	These lids are a must have for anyone using Dr Brown's bottles.  I store bottles in the refrigerator with them, they go right in the dishwasher, and I can take bottles in the diaper bag when I'm out running errands.  Very convenient.	
- 1	I Read the reviews and decided to order the extra-base even with the issues people were having to make it work with the Snugride30 carseat. What a mistake, not only is there no level but there are no instructions on how to level it without one. Even using a household level you still need to know the proper incline (they don't just sit flat). We could have lived with being off a few degrees, but when we tested the seat in the base it wobbled... A LOT. Not something that is very comforting to put your little one in. To top it off, it kept getting stuck in the base when we tried to remove it, I can only imagine how frustrating that would have been if there was a baby in it and it wouldn't unlatch.None of these things are an issue when placed in the original base made specifically for the Snugride 30. It levels easily and properly, snaps in securely, and releases smoothly. Graco is out of their minds if they think that the Snugride 35 base is an acceptable option.On the postitive note, Amazon is AMAZING for hassle free returns and Graco was great about letting us order the original base for the Snugride30 as a replacement part. Sure I paid about $10 more ordering from them instead of off Amazon, but for the piece of mind and a properly fitting carseat it was money well spent.	
- 1	ordered  5oz bottles as pictured, received 8oz bottles. i don't need 8 oz. i have a reason for needing 5oz. beyond annoying	
- 1	I found this to be a huge waste of money. The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail. The worst part was the odor. It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it. I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper, better option.	
1. 	First off, don't pay $75 for this -- I found it for about $40 on this site. Bought this for my nine month-old who is now ten months old; she loves it and plays with it every day. I worried after reading a review that a child fell on one and required stitches so I put it away for a bit. My mom (a retired kindergarten teacher of more than 25 years) told me I was being ridiculous and dragged it back out one day for my daughter. She said you would have to jump off something and land on the cube, or really be horsing around and fall hard on this to hurt yourself badly -- and she's right. All the edges are rounded and the top is covered with rubber covered wire that beads are on. A kid can get hurt on anything, and this toy is no worse than any other. The cube is so busy that it holds babies attention without loud annoying sounds or flashing lights. It's a nice quiet toy that is educational and fun, and if you ask me, there are precious few of those around these days. I highly recommend it. It's also built very well -- it looks like a toy from yesteryear, carefully and lovingly crafted with hand-painted images. My mom as an early childhood educator thinks this toy is great. Well worth the money.	
- 1	I have a 15 month old daughter that has started talking in her sleep so my husband and I decided we needed to buy a video monitor to make sure she was awake before we went into her room because we have accidently woken her up going into her room to check on her after we have heard her start stirring. I started researching video monitors and found the Levana brand had 4+ start reviews on Amazon. (Note: I am an Amazon Prime member and a frequent reader of reviews before I decided to buy an item.) I liked the price of this video monitor compared to the prices of the ones made by Motorola and Summer Infant. It seemed very reasonable and the online reviews of this item were very good. The reviews specifically said the day time color picture was very clear and bright and the night vision worked very well. I did not find either of these to be true with my experience.We set this new monitor up on a Friday night so we were not able to test the color picture on the first day of use. The night vision worked, but did not have a great picture (certain items were very bright and others were blurry). On Saturday late morning when we put our daughter down for a nap, we tested the color picture. The colors on the monitor were completely off and the room has to be extremely well lit for the color picture to even work. When we went to bed Saturday night, the night vision was still working, but by Sunday morning, we woke up to a black and blurry screen. It appears that the night vision LEDs had gone out. I called customer service for Levana on Sunday morning, per the instructions in the manual for the monitor, only to find out you could not talk to anyone until business hours Monday-Friday. The customer service line then walks you through a few trouble shooting measures to try and get the monitor to start working again (i.e. turn the monitor on and off, check the light in the room, etc.). I found this to be completely unacceptable. This is a product that sells items for baby safety. How many working parents are able to call about a defective baby monitor from their office? My husband and I returned this monitor to Amazon and ended up buying a much more, expensive but nicer monitor manufacturer by Motorola from another retailer.if I could give this monitor and Levana zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product as well as the lack of service provided by Levana.	
1. 	Love these snack cups! There are less messes for me to clean up after introducing these to my son.  His snacks do not come out at all when it is turned upside down (Maybe some crumbs get through). I've used this with cereal,  cut up fruit, pretzels.  They're great.	
- 1	This was a waste of money.  We couldn't get baby to stay still in it.	
- 1	I bought this through AJ Wholesale on Amazon and when the package arrived it was ripped open like it was a return item.  I sterilized the nipples but thats gross.  Not only that but my newborn collapses the nipple so I have to pull it out of her mouth, re-inflate it and give it back to her multiple times during a feeding.  I paid over $12 for one 2 pack - overpriced.  I hate this purchase.	
1. 	So cute! It's exactly what I had hoped for.  It even has a little spot to store a bottle of body wash and shampoo.  I do wish that it had come with more than 1 set of sticky tape for the wall.	
1. 	My son adores these bath toys, their perfect for little hands and he likes to chew on them when he takes baths as well.	
- 1	My baby never liked to wear this bib.  He is now 10 months old and average size. It was never comfortable for him to wear.	
- 1	First of all, car seat is pretty bad. No adjusting system means I have to use towels to get it right. It also feels kind of cheap. I went out and bought a new car seat two weeks after receiving this one.The stroller is better, it runs smoothly and feels allright. The lower basket is great and overall it is a good product. Downfall is that it almost doesn't fold and takes up all my trunk! Overall, I would not recommend this combo.	
1. 	At first, we wondered why we would ever need 12 bottles, but after pumping, we saw that it was a good packaging choice by Medela. These are easy to carry out and easy to store. They're also easier to wrangle when you're first learning to bottlefeed a baby with your other arm full. These are compatible with the Medela nipple collars for the larger Medela bottles.	
1. 	Our son slept in the papasan for the first 2 months. He just really can relax in it. The incline is perfect; it lays back enough that he sleeps, but not too much that I worry about spit up. I am so glad we bought this! Plus, when I take a shower or fold laundry I just put him in the chair and take him into the bathroom or laundry room with me. He's quite content to just sit there!	
- 1	I really wanted to like this bottle. Customer service was great they emailed me twice or more about how to use the bottle which is why I put an extra star but no matter how many time I follow the instruction the bottle leaked. I love the idea of how they want the bottle to be used but it leak. Leaking my breastmilk is a no no in my book, and the bottom piece I have no idea why it's even there it just falls off.  I think maybe they need a liner like the plastic circle things blenders have at the bottom so they won't leak, or something. My problem with it is that it leaks A lot.	
1. 	I got this for my sons 2 year birthday and I am so happy with the purchase! His room is fairly dark at night and the night light is really great when it is on in his room. It makes starts all over the ceiling and part of the walls. It is really pretty and relaxing to look at, I want one for my room!!I plan on buying this for 2 people that recently had babies.You won't regret this purchase!- note: to get the full effect, the room has to be pretty dark.	
- 1	I think this toy is very cute and colorful and that's about it. As others have said, it's pretty boring and the baby ends up mostly hugging it or mouthing it (but he mouths anything). Each worm segment has something inside, but the worm is so plush you have to press pretty hard.  He much prefers his other toys and i suspect this worm will soon become just a room decoration.  Oh, and the music is very tinny and ANNOYING-it's not loud but it's high pitched, which is the worst combination.	
1. 	I say best out of two because I had the Diaper Genie to begin with, and it was TERRIBLE. Not only was it bad at containing odor, but it broke after about six months, (it wouldn't twist OR cut), and I was going through refills like crazy. I don't know if the Champ I have is the 'new and improved' one, but it works great. I've never had any problems turning the handle, it's always moved fine for me. And as far as the wipes getting stuck, I've always wrapped the wipe inside the diaper before sealing the diaper, so I've never had that problem. Maybe the others who are having problems with that should try that. Also, they say you can use a trash bag, but I don't. I use the Genie refills, for a couple of reasons; for starters, the Genie refills are deodorized, which is great. Also, if you waited until the Champ filled up (using a trash bag) the whole house would stink by the time you emptied it, regardless of what it says about trapping the odors in. With the refills, you have to empty it about every four days, which turns out to be just right, because I can empty it before it starts to smell.  It takes a bit more work to use the refills, but it's worth it. You pull out as much as you think you'll need, then put a knot in the bottom and fit the top opening around the underside of the hole in the lid. It fits perfectly. And because you aren't twisting half the container away, it takes about three times as long to go through one of those than when you use them in the Diaper Genie. It's also sturdier than the Diaper Genie; it doesn't fall over every time my toddler plays with it. He loves to turn the handle - and if he can do it, then anyone can. Also, I'm using it on the size five diapers, which I don't have a problem fitting in.	
- 1	My twins were too big for this once they were able to use it- we returned it. I've seen it work for some infants, just not ours.	
1. 	I give 5 stars to all Avent Products. I have had no problems, whatsoever, with Avent.	
1. 	This product is overall good, the only problem with it is that our baby can get out of it if she wants to, she can kick the part off of her feet and even the part around her sometimes. She is 6 months old. We only use this swaddle for naps away from home, we keep it in her diaper bag because it is more compact than the Halo innovations one (which we use most of the time). It is also probably not as warm as the halo innovations one. This swaddle has really good velcro and is very soft, it also is much more adjustable than many brands. If you are going to get a swaddle with a pocket, this is the one I would get.	
- 1	My son ripped this off within 5 minutes.  It's interesting because obviously the adhesive is not great but at the same time some of the finish on our crib came off with it!  Pretty disappointed.	
- 1	The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!  First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.  And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.  Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.  The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!  This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.  Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.  Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.  If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.  I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.  It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.  Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.  The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.  North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.	
1. 	These are some heavy-duty plug covers, which is a good thing. I have twin boys who see everything as an interesting challenge, yet they can't get these covers out of the outlet. Sure, they take a couple moments for us adults to remove, but the benefit outweighs any silly impatience one might feel while wiggling the cover out. These are so much better than the old style plug covers, which my daughter used to just pluck right out of the outlet and put in her mouth.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and never used it (minus one time). This is something that is not needed. I had it in my baby registry since I read such good reviews here. My bad! I sold it on craigslist right after the first time I used it. Please don't waste your money here, go buy something useful for yourself or your baby. Good luck with nursing!PS: I didnt have the fireworks, I had one with polka dots cover.	
- 1	I bought it thinking: &#34;oh well, it is Baby Einstein, it has to be good&#34;. Wrong.It is a very hard plastic to play with, specially the &#34;worm&#34; in the middle (my baby is 5 months old and smacks pretty much everything she has in hand).Babies won't be able to put it in their mouth and if the &#34;worm&#34; hits their head, oh boy! Crying time!It might be good for an older baby (to push back and forth like a regular ball) but not for babies learning how to grasp.	
1. 	This is becoming one of our son's favorite toys! We got it for his 1st birthday and now (about 14 months) he's really starting to love it. We got the large and he still has a little growing to do to really fit it, but he would have outgrown the small before he would have even appreciated the toy.	
- 1	These cups leak in two places, both from the air flow valve in the cap and all around the top. It's not impossible to get the straw back through the flip top after cleaning, but it's not terribly easy each time either. Within an hour after first washing the cup and helping my son learn how to use the straw top, there were milk spots, puddles and drops all over his high chair, the floor, my pants (he had sat on my lap), and his clothes. I actually would have been far happier if it had leaked from the straw! That I could understand, but how hard should it be to screw it on and go? I've played with how tight I twist it and I'm sure I'll continue to in hopes I can minimize the leakage as much as possible. But all in all, it just shouldn't be this complicated.The straw does take some practice, too. I tried it first myself. It's straw shaped, but you have to bite or press your teeth along the valve in the straw in order to get fluid. Not a bad design at all.My hope is I'll find the sweet spot and be able to get some real use out of the cup. We'll see.	
- 1	I purchased this item after reading so many great reviews, but it just didn't work for me with my son. I tried it on a number of different occasions but it was never very effective so I went back to the bulb syringe and had a lot more success. I'm glad it works so well for some people, I just wasn't one of them!	
- 1	I bought these bibs because I liked that they were 100% cotton & they seemed highly reviewed. The downside to these bibs is that the neck is very small. I feel like they are already VERY tight on my 2 month old & he is not a particularly big baby. I feel a bit uncomfortable even putting them on him because of the small neck size. These bibs are cute and in terms of material and sewing they seem well made...it's just a shame that for the price you pay for them that they aren't going to work for your baby for very long at all.	
- 1	I'm very disappointed in these sheets. They fit nice and snug and are very soft for baby until I washed them in lukewarm water and tumble dried them. Now they won't fit my mini crib mattress AT ALL. useless. Waste of money.  I have a few more I got as gifts so next time I'll wash them in cold and line dry so maybe I can get more than one use.	
1. 	This gate is a pressure-mounted gate designed specifically for light traffic (that's what it says on the box!).  It's not meant for the top of stairs.  It doesn't have a latch or door that you can open and close.  But it's a great gate to block off an area that has a wide opening.  There are no other pressure mounted gates on the market that fit this wide of a space (up to 60 inches).  The next widest pressure mounted gate covers just under 48 inches and that one was difficult to install.  This one I had installed in less than 5 minutes, and it's quite secure.  The gate is low enough that an average height Mom or Dad can step right over it, so the lack of a door doesn't bother me at all.  (I'm 5'4 and have no problems swinging my leg over it).  And to top it off, the price is reasonable.If you have a narrower space and want a pressure-mounted gate with a door/latch, I recommend the Hands-Free Gate for The First Years.  I've had it for over 3 years now and use it mulitple times a day without any problems.  It's maximum width is 34 inches.	
1. 	Great for vintage baby bottle collection; need for old Playtex bottles that are no longer made.  Hard to find these !	
1. 	This sheet is super soft! It washes well & dries quickly.  The color doesn't fade.  I bought a second one because I liked it so much.  It's not quite as deep as I'd like so I have to really stretch it over our 5-inch mattress, but it stays put.	
- 1	I received an Ameda pump from my insurance company.  The flange was too big and suction poor, so I tried these.  They insert into the regular size flange.  This was the right size for me, but did not improve the suction from the pump.  Just didn't work for me.	
1. 	Thank goodness for the other reviewer that recommended using the rubber shelf liner to make this fit better - it is super snug and works great! No adhesive or other such attachments! We had another toilet lock that was much more complicated and used adhesive to attach to the bowl and the lid. When we got a thinner style of lid, the lock no longer fit. Due to this, I was looking for an option that has nothing to do with the lid thickness. This one fit the bill, and I decided to go for it despite the bad reviews. I think the rubber liner makes all the difference! I could see how this wouldn't fit snuggly or function without it, so I agree that it is something the manufacturer should include (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).This is extremely easy to operate once installed, and you can do it one handed. Just lift the two small side tabs up with two fingers and flop the lock part down. Easy!	
1. 	I love how soft this changing pad cover is! It is a perfect fit on contoured changing table pads, and wipes clean easily for small messes.	
- 1	While the magnifying glass does indeed, magnify, you have to be very close to it and also very close to your baby's hand/ foot. I found myself looking from the side of the magnifier instead, thereby rendering the magnifying glass fairly useless.	
- 1	I can't get these to stick in the windows. Oh well.I do, however, put them together and stick them in the top of the rear window, moving it around depending on where the sun will be coming in on baby. They have to be together to be thick enough to stay put, wedged up between the window and the &#34;ceiling&#34; interior.	
- 1	Not worth any money. If you use the angled slots for an umbrella stroller the cup holder will stays up , but since it only has one strap and it is fabric, it is nearly impossible to keep a cup upright. The weight of anything that you put inside will angle the holder. I have a velcro hook on the stroller handles, so I cut a small notch at the top the holder and passed the hook's velcro strap thru it to give it more support. It seems to work better, but it will never be as good as a plastic holder. It will work for sippy cups, but not with a cup of coffee.FYI: the slots only work on the RIGHT side of stroller.	
1. 	I got this for my fifth baby with the intention of really swaddling this time. She was an April baby in Upstate NY. She is also a sweaty baby and likes her space. We used this maybe three times.If you're getting it for summer weight, I found it too warm even for the spring time. Quality wise, it was nice and laundered well. It just didn't really work for us.	
1. 	Purchased this item when I had my second child so that I could monitor them visually as well as audibly.  Also purchased an additional camera, so that I could monitor both of the children's rooms.  Product is great.  Battery lasts forever when off charger.  Able to see well at night too.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it would be nice to have a feature that allows the monitor to switch over to the room where noise is recognized.  As it is now, you have to switch the button back and forth between the two rooms to monitor children sleeping at the same time.  Otherwise, product is great.	
1. 	I'm late getting a double stroller. My girls were 4 and 2 and we use this for traveling. It folds pretty flat. Steers well and looks comfortable. I like that the tray and visor can come off to reduce bulk. The handle is at an odd height for me, 5'2'' but its perfect for my husband, 5'11''. All in all a great stroller for older kids.	
1. 	I took my son to the toy store to pick out a toy, and this is the item he picked.  He loves shaking things (he's 10 months) and it makes a pretty great sound.  The core of the frog is elastic, so when he's older he'll be able to stretch the toy a bit too for additional entertainment.  I like that the HABA toys are made in Germany to EU standards; it makes me feel better about him constantly putting it in his mouth.  I don't know how educational it is, but he certainly seems to enjoy it and it seems as though it will last a long time.	
- 1	These did not hold their shape for longer than one day, although they did provide relief. I prefer Soothies for multiday use.	
1. 	My baby is 6m and he did not know how to grab puffs from the cup. He may learn it later. The design is nice and no food drop out. A good container for babies!	
1. 	My 4 month old loves gnawing on cold apple slices in this feeder to relieve her teething pains.  Other mommy friends of mine use these for milk popsicles too!	
1. 	I purchased this for my daughter's first birthday and she simply LOVED it. The set was adorable and she quickly became obsessed with the teddy bear because when pressed, it plays the classic Happy Birthday tune. All the pieces are perfect for babies, mainly because they each have a different sensory element that most babies enjoy. Squeaker, crinkles, and rattles will keep babies entertained and happy.It must be noted that this toy is smaller than most people expect, but keep in mind, this toy is meant for babies and thus is sized accordingly. At the regular retail price, it's far too expensive and overly priced, but I purchased this for 75% off w/free ship and it was perfect, so if you are interested in this, try and see if it goes down in price if you have the time. Personally I feel that this toy, although super cute, shouldn't be priced anymore than $15 MAX, mainly because of it's small size. Other than that, it's a great purchase and one that would be greatly appreciated by the child and their parents because it can be put away as a cute keepsake.This would make a cute first birthday gift or even a simple keepsake baby shower gift for boy or girl. Gund is known for their quality and it shows here. On sale, it's a great purchase and I highly recommend it!	
- 1	I thought this was going to be comfortable for sleeping but it's almost has hard as the board that comes with the original Graco Pack and Play, so it doesn't seem like much of a comfort improvement.I only give it 2 stars because it fits the pack and play perfectly and the sheets went on very easily.	
1. 	Love this! Protects the seat and it is easy to clean. I'd recommend this. Plus, I like the mesh holder in the front.	
1. 	I first got this for my 6month old son, after reading the Diaper free before 3 book. In India, the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support. In the same aspect, I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well. I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day, as soon as me and my son got up, we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs, surprisingly, he peed in this, on the first day only! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it. He likes to sit on this one, as it has the backrest, and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but, its good enough for him. In a way, its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet, as he doesnt try to stand up :-). He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy. Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side, the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time, I put him on this, any time of day, he pees assuming thats what I want him to do. Pooping, we have not started yet, but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great, remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water, and its even sanitized!Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor. I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest! He wouldnt sit on it even once, and its going back to Amazon today while I order my second potty chair!	
1. 	Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.	
- 1	My toddler and infant both love these sippies, since there isn't much resistance to get the liquid out (some sippies are ridiculously hard to drink out of) but these straws are total junk. They're thin and if your child bites on them at all, they rip. We ordered these replacements, and they ripped within a couple months. Really need to find a new sippy to switch to, but my toddler is pretty resistant to sippy change. The sippies also leak like crazy after a while.	
- 1	It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. :(	
1. 	I got this for my 8 month old son and he loves it!! It just the right size and none of the air ever gets out of it.	
1. 	I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my let down and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009.	
1. 	Love these pads.  Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside.  They ar small, yet absorbant.  I have had them leak but only when they got really wet.  I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets.  Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.	
1. 	I love these outlet plugs. We had the cheaper ones by the same company that you don't press to put in the outlet and my 18 month old daughter was able to pull them right out. So we decided to try these. Let me tell you... these things are HARD to get out of the wall, even for me. But that's a GOOD thing in my opinion. I would rather have something that is so difficult to get out that I even have to take a few moments to do it than something my daughter is going to just pull out and possibly end up hurting herself.PROs:+Hard to pull from the wall+Easy to install+Works on any standard outletCONs:-Hard to pull from the wall even as an adult-A bit pricey if you need to do a lot of outlets	
1. 	My only big gripe is that they are stingy on the adhesive you can just get all your edge guard on with the adhesive. Just dont waste any part of the adhesive it is precious. But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)	
1. 	This product is fantastic!I live in Texas which has cool winters, but not frigid ones. I put the sleepsack on my newborn over a footed cotton sleeper, and she's very cozy and content. I would recommend it over the fleece sack for folks who live in warmer climates. That would be too much. I imagine the thickness of the cotton sleeper will work well during warmer months as well coupled with a lighter sleeper or onesie underneath.In addition to doing a great job keeping my baby warm, this product is wonderfully soft and well-designed. It's roomy and should fit my baby for a while (unlike most things you buy for baby!). And, best of all, it unzips from the bottom to the top. So, you don't have to completely undress baby for those late-night diaper changes.I highly recommend buying two or three to use every night. I only wish I had discovered the sleepsack with my first child.	
- 1	This holds up to about 8 ounces topsBut I've spilled with this thing a few time so prepare a mopAnd if you're holding the baby and trying to do itThen all I gotta say is &#34;forget about it!&#34;Because you have to shake the thing to get all of the formula outand it's a little wide and stoutSo we've been using this thing for a while (for our first kid and now our second).  And though it gets bad reviews, if you want cheap and functional, this will do it.  Though it is far from perfect (I see people mentioning the Munchkin thing and that looks pretty good).  This one holds up to about 8 oz and will last you about one kid's cycle.  Tried using it for my 2nd kid and it started to develop cracks.  So not the best of construction, but again, it's cheap.  But the munchkin one is only like $2 bucks, more, I would try that other one first.	
- 1	M child only chews on the ring and stem of this product. The nuk/pacifier part is too big to chew on and she doesn't like to suck on it like a normal nuk.	
- 1	I bought this item hoping to have a gentle light and soft music or ambient noise, what I got looked like I brought a 60&#34; TV into my son's crib. The light is extremely bright and the music is far too loud. This item did not soothe my baby, it stimulated him. Instead of having something soft to listen to and relax, but instead the bright lights and loud sound stimulated my baby into waking up, standing up in his crib, and just playing with the soother. It clearly is too stimulating for a soother product. This is the first amazon item I've purchased that I'm returning.	
- 1	This product contains almond oil.  So if you or anyone in your family has a history of severe nut allergies, you may want to skip it and go with Lansinoh instead.A reaction is probably unlikely, but why take chances with your baby?  (I wish that the product ingredients were listed somewhere on the Amazon page... that would be helpful.)However, if you really want a plant-based alternative to Lansinoh, you might consider the nipple cream by Motherlove. It contains olive oil and beeswax instead.Motherlove Herbal Nipple Cream (1 oz)	
1. 	My baby has reflux and extra gas just makes him completely miserable.  We got these bottles when he was 3-weeks old and they really do make a difference!  I'm a pediatrician, so I was a skeptic when I read that the bottle claimed to reduce gas/colic.  But I think I'm convinced!  At the very least, it makes it easier for him to eat since there is no negative pressure created from suction... the food just flows!  Thus, the baby swallows less air from the having work so hard to get food.  If your baby has reflux or is very gassy, this bottle is definitely worth a try!	
1. 	My baby use this product everyday! I very liked this product. It very good for baby! So I will tell my friends to use this product. Thank you very much!	
1. 	A lot of reviews say that the stickiness of the tape isn't that great, and it isn't- but so far it's not a problem. The guards are great because we have a fake stone fireplace so the edge is much more uneven than brick, but the guard works great. A definite for anyone with a fireplace and a squishy little handful of a baby :)	
1. 	This bib is absolutely adorable and covers my daughter's entire top half, which is nice when you want to protect clothing from messy, cloth staining foods!I like the velcro closing in the back and the pocket in the front really does end up catching dropped food. Great buy!	
- 1	My favorite wipes were out of stock, so I took a gamble and purchased these. They are awful and I wish I hadn't purchased so many of them. They are very small and also have a terrible scent. Fragrance free does not equal unscented! The texture of them reminds me of pampers wipes except they aren't as wet feeling, so if you like pampers wipes you may like these.	
1. 	I take bottles with us all the time and found that these caps are great.  The little disks provided with the bottle leak and are too much of a hassle.  These caps are much easier to deal with -- just bring the bottle parts with me and put them in when the baby is ready to eat.  We also find that it is easier to warm up the bottles with these caps instead of the bottle fully assembled.  Worth the little extra cost for the convenience.	
- 1	I really don't see the big deal about this toy, and neither does my 10 month old.  He's not the least bit interested in it, and I've shown him that the legs make sounds.  He doesn't care.  I think it was a waste of money.  Oh well.	
1. 	We purchased this for our three year old.  We plan to keep it as a travel bed for her when we spend the night away from home.  To get her used to it, we set it up in the living room and she loved it instantly.  It's low enough to the ground that we don't worry about her falling out and is long enough for her to stretch out with plenty of room to spare.  It breaks down in seconds and it incredibly easy to put into the travel bag.  So glad we purchased this item.	
- 1	Very disappointing - these looked really good when they arrived so I promptly threw them in the wash....they came out looking like they were 5 year old rags.Go with the Gerber cotton or flannel burp cloths; these are awful.	
1. 	Seems to fit just fine except that the corner snaps could be longer.  We have a Sorelle Rosa crib with hidden hardware so the snaps must go around the outside of two bars for each corner.  The straps are just not long enough to effectively go around all 4 corners.  No big deal though as we just do two corners and then go around the first set of bars on the far side.  So the sheet is offset by a couple inches but doesn't appear to have enough slack to become a safety issue.  If our baby does start to try to get under the sheet it doesn't seem like a difficult task to just add our our strap extensions.  We'll probably be buying a few more to allow for more time between laundry runs.	
1. 	My nips were sooo sore and cracked the first weeks after having my baby. These shields saved my life because I was able to put them on and walk around the house without rubbing against my clothes. You can't go outside in public with these, they poke out too much. But they are a good alternative to walking around topless. It's also great that they catch the milk. I was able to freeze and store a lot of the milk that collected in one side while nursing on the other.	
- 1	I am using gates for the first time and I find this one extremely difficult to uninstall. The release buttons are hidden from view and I can't make them work...therefore this is not going to be portable/travel friendly for me.  Maybe my husband will have better luck, but I am somewhat disappointed in this product.It does look nice for what it is and does fit wider openings, but it is very awkward for me to use.	
- 1	I'm confused. Why would one even need this product? What's wrong with just shaking the formula in the bottle? That has always worked for us.	
- 1	Maybe this works better on smaller cars where you don't have to stretch it as much (at least that's what I'm guessing because a lot of the favorable reviews state they have cars), but it definitely doesn't work on larger SUV windows. I followed all the instructions, cleaned both the window and suction cups more than once, and it just doesn't seem to work. I LOVED the idea of the stretching to fit the larger windows in our vehicle, but this doesn't even come close.	
1. 	I am very happy with this purchase. I am a SAHM and only pump once a day, if that, so this is all I really need. It is comfortable and easy to use and I am glad I went against friends opinions that I had to have an electric pump.	
- 1	This fan is just ok.  I like how the blades are foam, because they are safe, just in case my baby wants to grab at it, but you pretty much have to get in the blades to feel ANY breeze at all.  She likes to look at it....that's about it.  Plus, it drains batteries quickly.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	It's The Perfect Size. It Doesn't Take Up The Entire Counter But Has Plenty Of Room For Bottles And Pumping Parts. It Is Very Reasonably Priced And Made Of Quality Materials. I Love That It Is Made with Antimicrobial Plastic.	
1. 	I bought this for my 5 month old baby, since she outgrew her Fisher Price snug-a-bear bouncy seat. I actually wish I had just bought this seat in the first place since it can be used for years instead of just a few months. I didnt buy this initially because I had read negative reviews about people's babies tipping the seat over or falling out. In the instructions for this seat, the rocking position is only recommended when supervising a baby (such as rocking the baby to take a nap) or when the child is old enough to control the seat on their own. I could see a baby falling out of this seat if left in the rocking positions or if not strapped in. As with any seat, there is always that possibility of a child falling out or tipping the seat if not supervised. In my month of using this seat I have never feared for my child's safety and my very mobile 5 month old likes napping and playing with her toys in the chair and it seems very sturdy with the kick stand up. She is not very interested in the toy bar (this is why I gave it 4 stars), a more exciting toy bar would get this product 4 stars.	
1. 	Love this mirror. It was easy to install, hasn't shifted at all, allows me to clearly and easily see my baby in the rear view mirror while driving, and looks cute too! I can't believe I didn't have one of these from the start! A necessity.	
1. 	Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal BlueWhat a great little invention! Perfect for sleepovers at grandma and grandpas house!	
1. 	I was determined to not by a giant plastic baby tub because I lived in a 3 story townhome. Well, I finally gave in and guess what, I purchased what I think is the largest tub they sell. This thing is big. It is one molded piece of plastic -- no removal pieces to have mold grow under.I used a large sponge to bathe my child in the sink until she was about 3-4 months old and got so squirmy I was afraid she would wriggle out of my hands and bang her head against the sink. I did a LOT of research on the best tub before buying this one. For a few weeks, we had to pad the set with a towel so it wasn't so hard and so that my child fit better. But she loved this tub so much more than the sink -- she learned how to splash so much that she now soaks all four walls and the ceiling.She's 10 months now and still using this tub -- she'll fit in it for a long time. It's nice that we can still use this one on the counter and not have to lean over a regular tub. My child has a cousin born at the same time -- his mom had a different tub and ending up buying the Eurotub a few weeks after we did because her child almost flipped their smaller tub.I purchased this from Babies R Us -- it was significantly cheaper than the Amazon price at the time.	
- 1	My 7 month old absolutely loved the purple elephant tug toy. It was her favorite toy. Until today when she had one of the little dangling feet in her mouth and somehow inhaled it. The string to the foot is long enough that the ball of the foot was way in the back of her throat. SCARY. Thank God my husband was there. I almost threw the whole thing away but I know how much she loves it so I just cut off all the legs.	
1. 	Works well and installation was easy.  My only beef is that the directions say it works best when places at the angles of 8 o'clock or 4 o'clock on the seat, but the child can easily push it to any other position while the seat is closed.  Even while doing that though, he's still not able to get it open, which is all I care about.Update: About 9 months after purchasing this product, it finally broke.  My son definitely abused it.  He snapped it off a few times and it landed in the toilet, after which I ran it through the dishwasher because it grossed me out to touch. So after 9 months it broke. For the price, I'd say I got my money's worth. I would be purchasing another, but hopefully my son will be potty training within the next few months (crossing my fingers!)	
1. 	This is a really cute diaper bag. My husband loves it and there's plenty of compartments for storage. My only complaint is that it's a little small for the price.	
1. 	These are great snack traps.  My 1 year old has no trouble with them at all.  She hates to sit still to eat so it's nice for her to be able to carry her cheerios around with her!  It included one solid lid which was a pleasant surprise!	
1. 	This has been the only one of her toys that she has loved pretty much from the get go... by the time she was about 4 weeks she would last about a half hour on it, looking at the lights and listening to the music. She went from accidentally batting the animals to now, at 5 months, playing with them and laughing until she eventually falls asleep all tuckered out :) I am going to buy a second one for her to have at her babysitter's house. Absolutely LOVE this!!	
1. 	My wife and I bought both this BabyBjorn and a Moby Wrap when our son was born. The Moby wrap works, but requires acrobatics and a PhD in baby wrapping to really work. The BabyBjorn works a lot easier for both of us.	
- 1	its made out of cheap rough towel fabric.its better to put a soft towel on top instead of this thing.thing. i was very disappointed when i opened the package, because of how thin and rough it was. i used once and that was it..i dont like how hard is on babys face.I wish i wouldnt paid 15bucks for that.	
- 1	We haven't actually USED these yet but after one wash they look like they were bought from a garage sale rather than having been brand new.  They still feel like they'll be quite absorbent in the middle although they did shrink a bit.  I was really disappointed in how the brown polka-dotted one especially pilled and just looked ANCIENT.  The swirl one held up the best but I don't think it's worth getting the pack just for one that stands up to the wash.  I'll update when we actually have our baby and get a chance to use them. :)	
- 1	I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all	
- 1	It is a good drying rack, but you have to take it apart because it gets dirty fast. The white bottom tray often feels with dirty water residue and bacteria can grow in the white tray easily. It you buy this product, make sure you wash it often, at least once a week.	
1. 	I put my 22 month old's toy balls in here. It holds all of them and my 5 year old's basketball (don't ask lol) easily. It was easy to install - with a drill of course, not included (haha!). I know the competing brand (name?) has much worse reviews. I don't know about that brand but Prince Lionheart's toy hammock works great!	
1. 	I was uncertain if getting a red sleep sack was a good idea after having read some of the reviews saying that everything that came in contact with it had red fuzz on it. But I am glad I did. We have used it pretty much every night for the past 1-2 months, and no red fuzz on anything. It washes great, it is roomy enough, and yet my son can walk in it when he wakes up. The color is vibrant, and NO fuzz coming off of it.	
1. 	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.	
- 1	Did not fit table right, my son was obsessed with pulling it off was a total pain to get back on, gave it away to my best friend hoping it would work on her table have never noticed it being put use there. Was an expensive waste of money....oh well you can't win them all!	
1. 	Fantastic gate extremely easy to install.  There are no little places where kids can get their fingers pinched so I feel safe closing it even when my extremely curious and active 8 month old is crawling and climbing on it.  it's a tall gate so i don't worry about her going over it at all and it takes force to push the step down but easy to do.  Buy it for the entrance to hallways or in doorways where you want the door open sometimes but don't want babies in and out of that room.	
1. 	This boppy is a must have for breastfeeding and tummy time! Highly recommend it!	
- 1	The product works well, in theory.  Locked the food in place with no problem.  Easy to grip.  But the mesh is super thick and large.  My little girl, who loves food and puts everything in her mouth, didn't want to put this in her mouth.  She tried it, made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again. I introduced at 6 months, and then every few weeks after that.  I've since given up.I don't blame her.  I tried to eat an apple slice through it.  I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross.  Very unappetizing.Maybe if they had a thinner mesh??	
- 1	Every child is going to be different in terms of enjoying/liking a product, our son somewhat enjoyed the walker at first until he fell out of it. There are no side support straps to prevent a left or right fall. Having a son with a body too small for his head, the head tends to go and then the body follows. While in the walker he leaned his head to the left and fell almost completely out of the walker except for a leg/foot that was caught up in the streps like a pirate in ship rigging. Not being a seamstress I have no idea how to fix this on my own or know a good solution, sorry. You may want to try some shoulder straps possibly.	
1. 	I bought this bag to transport 4 glass bottles with silicone wraps (Evenflo).  It's got enough space for the four bottles and an ice pack to sit next to them.  The price is great and I like the upper compartment for food containers.  A great, no frills bottle bag.**Update 8.5 months later** This is a tough little bag! No rips & has gone through almost daily use w/ all sorts of thing being crammed in there from daycare. This bag lasted months longer than a Dr. Brown's bag. This will most likely be retired as a lunch bag for my daughter.	
- 1	All children are different, and for me this was a complete waste of money.  My son didn't play with them when he was 1, and we brought them out later.  He still didn't.  Several times more...he's still completely disinterested.  I think it might be because he had soft squishy squirters first and these hard toys didn't interest him.  They also turn upside down all the time, which is annoying.You never know what your child will like!	
1. 	I am still hoping my son will &#34;catch on&#34; with this toy.  It is a bit &#34;big&#34; for a little one - probably best for a 6+ month old baby.	
1. 	it comes with straps to secure the pad to dresser and to secure the baby.  the surface is easy to clean. we use it everyday.	
1. 	I bought a giant diaper bag to use, (Skip Hop Duo) then found it to be too big and cumbersome to use on a daily basis, so I switched to using my husband's grey Diaper Dude diaper bag and found it to be much more manageable.  I carry a LOT of stuff in it, so it's always jam packed full and I wish it was just a little bit bigger.  The hubby doesn't mind carrying it since it is in boyish colors and because he can wear it like a messenger bag.  I usually end up carrying it over my shoulder like a purse so the strap is a little too long.  Overall, I like it, hubby likes it, and it holds everything you need for a day outing.	
1. 	Like many other reviewers, we used this on our Pack N Play as part of a secondary changing station.  It needed a little force fitting but worked okay.  The unit has helped us keep everything we need for changes organized and ready.  We've had no trouble with diapers falling out as some have reported.  Yes, the side compartments are on the small side, but they manage to hold a tub of vaseline, a container of Purell, a tube of baby lotion and a brush.	
1. 	This is a great cheat for people who don't have a great swaddle technique. It's fast and easy to swaddle when babies are asleep so you don't wake them and the velcro seems to be good over a lot of washes.	
- 1	I thought this was going to work well, but it did not.  It is much like a play dough consistancy, difficult to get out of the packaging, and it did not hold my toddler's handprint very well.  I tried it three times and ended up tossing it.  The &#34;rolling pin&#34; stick can be used as a great drum stick, that is about all we got out of it.	
1. 	These are awesome. Machine washable, the pouches sit out from the bib so they actually catch stuff, and the velcro holds up well. I will never buy a different kind of bib again, and these will become shower presents. As opposed to others, they do not have a backing that comes off in the wash. They are still good as new after lots of washes. I can't say it enough - love these bibs.	
1. 	I love, love, love this play pen, its money will spent, it roomy and colourful, would defin. recommend. it makes noises as well.	
1. 	The product came very quickly with this vendor.  The actual product does the job well. They were easy for my husband to install and my toddler is no longer interested in the cabinets! The quality I can see will hold up for awhile.	
- 1	These are really cute looking but I don't know that they serve too much of a purpose. Everything I out on it falls off except if I put nipples on the white middle pieces. But that means I'm drying 3 nipples only... I guess therefore they do serve a purpose (cute and somewhat saving space) but just a small one.
