1. 	If I had known I would've just used this instead of a high chair because this is all plastic and it's easy to clean. I used it since he could sit up and he's 28 months now and he's still using it.	
1. 	My son got this for his first Christmas. It's got a hard back shell which illuminates the walls and ceiling and plush turtle body parts. He learned how to change the colors a month after he got it, when he was 1 year old. It's a great way to have a night light while you're putting the little one to sleep and the colors are quite soothing. The light is very bright if you look straight into the shell so try to keep your baby from doing that.If you'd like other reviews on the best gifts for a one year old or on what to put on a baby registry, visit the website, AllMomsAerPerfect.com.

1. 	What would you pay for a toy that entertains your child, makes them smile and giggle with delight and plays some of the best toy music youve ever heard? Well Id pay a lot more than theprice for this toy!I never thought Id buy a musical toy, they all annoyed me! ButI saw this toy online and checked out the sound at TRU and I bought it. I bought it for my now 6 month old when she turned 3 months and she has loved it from the day we brought it home!I love that this is a toy that will grow with your baby from laying on the floor, sitting to standing. And at each phase the toy performs differently teaching your baby new things.There is absolutly nothing about this toy that we dont like. She plays with it for 20-40 minutes at a time since we gave it to her! Which allowed me to take a shower, eat something, etc.This is a fantastic toy and one that your baby will love and grow into for a long time.	
- 1	My daughter was born 3 wks early, so on the small side.  These swaddlers still didn't fit her even though she was only 6.5 lbs at birth and 20&#34;.  The product info gives a much larger size range, but i guess they don't account for torso length.  The arms fit fine but I couldn't velcro the bottom strap without tipping her hips up quite a bit. Wish i could return them but I tossed the packaging.	
- 1	the arch comes out to easy and flops over.  When the arch comes out its really really hard to put back.  This thing is pretty much useless	
- 1	The hing was really strong but it did not work for my oven and the sticky side was a joke.  I cleaned the oven door surface and still could not get it to stick well enough to work.	
1. 	i love this seat!  i wish that it had a reclining mode, but i think that theres no way it would travel in such a handy little package if it did that!  i love how the straps wind up, the seat completely folds up, and the lid snaps on!  how cool is that!  it travels so nicely!  i definitely recommend this product!	
- 1	I ordered this as a gift for a pregnant friend and was more than a little annoyed when I opened up the Amazon box to find the packaging that contained Sophie was crushed.  It had obviously been opened.  When I opened the box to examine the teether, I noticed that there were multiple scuff marks on it.  That same night, I drove to Babies R Us to buy a Sophie to compare.  The differences were VERY obvious.  The black paint used for the eyes were different, the way the giraffe was packaged was different, even the pink cheeks were different.  And obviously the one from BRU had NO SCUFF MARKS on it!  I am so disappointed that I purchased a fake from Amazon.  I left a review for the seller and heard nothing back.  I will definitely think twice before ordering any super popular, &#34;trendy&#34; items from Amazon.	
- 1	My 5 month old is still swaddled, and oddly enough, she seems too small for it (we even own a size small). The sides that are to be wrapped around the belly/arms are too long, so the velcro barely even works. The left side (that wraps around first) pretty much tucks all the way underneath her back, and the right side (that wraps around second) wraps all the way around to her back, only leaving maybe an inch of velcro contact. Needless to say, it isn't secure enough to keep my little one from working her way out of the swaddle. She also gets her hands up and out of the bottom of the swaddle wrap, causing it to bunch up around her face, neck, which she then ends up chewing on and waking herself up.I bought mine from Target, on clearance in June/July 2011. Maybe that is why? It is a small, cotton, pink swaddle. She is 25 inches long and she fits ok length wise, but to wrap her tightly at all, it's waaaay to big for her. Seems strange to make a swaddle so loose since the purpose of a swaddle is to be tight.Also, mine does not have any velcro fasteners on the bottom like the other commentators. Not sure why but ours are apparently different.	
1. 	Easy to install and use throughout the day when plugging in stuff. I liked it so much, I purchased this one for another outlet.	
- 1	We bought this thinking wood was 'healthier' or 'safer' for baby. It comes with a plastic tray cover which we figured we didn't have to use, but unfortunately the paint is chipping and peeling and gets all over babies hands. So we started using the plastic cover, but the thing is so hard to get on and off it has almost ripped our nails off. Baby has been using this about 2 months now (she's 8 months) and already it is loose and the screws are coming out. The fabric is very nice but not very practical, there is no way to clean it without putting it in the wash. I can get over that in order to avoid plastic, but the other issues with the chair have made this a bad purchase for our family and we will be looking for something else.	
1. 	My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.	
- 1	I have owned this diaper pail for more than a year now, and I am less than happy with the product.CONS:- Top heavy - It's very hard to change the trash bag in the pail.  You must first lift the lid, then remove a blue rig that holds the trash bag in place, then lift the entire lid off in order to remove the trash bag.  The problem is that the entire pail is top-heavy when the lid is lifted, so the pail tends to fall over as I'm trying to get the trash bag out of the pail.- Arms stick - The concept of this diaper pail is good.  When a dirty diaper is placed in the top compartment and the lid is closed, two arms open up to let the diaper slide into the containment compartment at the bottom.  The arms should then close back up to contain odor.  The problem is that the arms sometimes stick open causing two problems:  first, the smell in the container leaches out, second, the built in fan continues to run to try to eliminate the smell, wearing down the numerous D batteries this thing requires in no time flat.- Odor - After a year of use, this thing smells even when there are no diapers in it!  I had the same problem with my first diaper pail, the Diaper Genie, so perhaps this is an issue with all plastic, porous diaper pails.PROS- Takes regular trash can bags - I do enjoy that this diaper pail accepts regular 13-gallon kitchen trash bags.  No running to the baby store for Diaper Genie refills.Overall, I'm not happy with the diaper pail and will be getting rid of it in favor of using a small regular trash can and grocery bags that will need to be emptied nightly.	
1. 	i have had this bath through all three kids and it has held up.  We put the sling in the wash with no problems.  for baby # 3 i used it without the sling since it got lost sometime after baby # 2.  great bath!	
1. 	Its the perfect size to get into all of the bottles- I have Playtex, Avent, and Medela and it works well for all of them.  I also use it to clean all my Medela parts (except for the flanges).	
1. 	Great bib, catches almost everything... however my son learned to take it off at 10 months old! Now at 11 months old he's taking it off within three minutes of us putting it on him- definitely defeats the purpose. :(	
1. 	Of all things related to babies and toddlers etc, this one by far is THE absolute best invention by Fisher Price! With so many 4+ star reviews already, you know you got yourself a winner with this product.The durability, convenience, portability and overall use of this booster seat will end up being your best purchase ever. There's many imitators out there but the one by Fisher Price is the one you want in the end. Because the item breaks down into a neat little package, it saves space (especially if you live in a place where storage is limited) and makes it extremely easy to take with you to restaurants, events where eating is involved and even as a high chair rather than wasting twice (if not more) moo-la for a high chair that is bulky and can't go anywhere beyond your dinner table. It's dishwasher safe so you can easily break it down into the parts shown and add it with the rest of your dish load. The plastic is made of super durable and strong material so you don't have to worry about it cracking, breaking or warping. It comes with adjustable straps so it allows you to control the fit for your child when it's used, providing security from any tipping or accidental slide outs.And as always, Amazon offered the best price than anyone else (believe me, I checked!!!). Great functionality, great price, great use - what more can you ask for? &lt;(^.^)>	
- 1	This thing is cheap and flimsy.  The picture looked better, but I was disappointed when I put it together.  It held up moderately for a couple of months.  Now the top part won't stay in place.  Despite it falling apart on us, I just haven't found it very easy to use.  all the small parts wind up in the middle where it is harder to get to them.  Of course, we use glass bottles so there is more weight on the parts than if we used plastic, but the top part is where we put the bottle tops, nipples, etc.  That shouldn't break it.  Oh well, I am online shopping for a replacement now.  This one just didn't hold up for us.	
- 1	This cream is pretty sensitive stuff, good for a baby that has no serious diaper rash, and good for a mama with an aversion  to chemicals. It reminds me a bit of burt's bees lip gloss. We have switched full time to A&D. Its cheaper, I don't have to order it online, and it actually works better. We use the kind without Zinc Oxide. It still is not as pure & natural as this stuff, but this really is protective & preventative, not healing. Our baby has really sensitive skin and it did not irritate her. She has eczema and everything. A&D didn't irritate her either. I have not noticed a difference with A&D on my cloth diapers. If it gets gooky though, (has not over several months) I will just do a vinegar rinse and -voila-. I bought this because I was worried about waxy things on the diaper.	
- 1	I got this as a Christmas present for my then 2 month old. He is now almost a year and we have played with this thing maybe twice. Literally. It's kinda annoying. We bought a leap frog dog that's awesome and we play with that more. I was looking for extra Christmas presents to buy and thought this would do. It's much smaller than expected. Maybe it would work great for some people, but if I had the choice to do it again, I wouldn't buy it.	
- 1	These toys are extremely hard and do not allow comfort for my teething baby. There's no give when you squeeze the toy. The plastic material is just really tough.	
- 1	This mattress looks like a good deal, but it's not. 4 months in and it is sunken in where my son sleeps. If he's on his stomach (which he can do since he rolls over) then his face can easily fall into one of the indentations in the mattress and I worry about him not getting fresh air. It also smelled really strongly of plastic for a week and we had to let it air out. We are going to try and return the mattress for a better one.	
- 1	Nicely constructed, thick fabric that maintains privacy, but &#34;natural&#34; is not remotely close... Let's try &#34;yellow&#34; on for size. Also way too large for petite frame. Picture looks sophisticated, but sets expectation that just isn't close to being met.	
1. 	My seven month old loves chewing on this. it's great for teething. I've even put it in the fridge and he loves it cold. I didn't realize I had purchased the pink one though. Oh well, great product.	
1. 	I absolutely adore this bib!!!! It is contoured perfectly to fit the baby, it is not too bulky, not too small, and I love the fact that it is stiff so that way my little one cannot bend it and play with it which often times gets in the way of feeding.  It catches everything that drops...be it water or food!  Very easy to clean...most of the time with a quick wipe up its ready for next use.  The only thing that kind of bugged me at first is that the opening is a bit narrow and stiff, so you really have to pull it apart to put it around baby's neck...otherwise you can poke her face.  But once you get used to putting the bib on, it's not that big of an issue.  Our baby loved the bib the minute we put it on.  Hubby loved the fact that it is not made out of sticky rubber that everything glued to it, like the tommy tippee bibs.  I also love the beaded neck part which gives many adjustments to tighten it just how you want it...and is versatile with various ages/sizes of babies.  We got the pink color, which is beautiful!  Awesome purchase!!!!!	
1. 	Thanks to Amazon's 90 day return policy, we bought 4 different potties for our boy to try. No, he didn't use them, just sat on them to test durability, comfort, and function.Durability - solid plastic. I'm not going to sit on it, but it handles a 32lb kid no problemComfort - No problem sitting on this potty. the raised back is very nice additionFunction - The most important aspect. The raised lip on the front is a MUST for boys. Other potties we tried the lip was not high enough (or not there), which could be a disaster. Raised back is also helpful for holding and guiding your kid down.Highly recommend this for potty training at home. We have the other brand/styles that have wipe holders, etc but don't use it. Avoid the talking potties and create your own reward system (M&M;'s work great or there are a ton of potty training apps for phones and tablets). You can also get one of the more basic, smaller potties to keep in your car for trips.	
- 1	I returned these the second I got them because they were so much cheaper looking and feeling than the Organic version. I'm so glad I did because I can imagine that after a few washes they'd be all torn up. Plus the organic cotton was super soft while these felt a bit abrasive. Worth paying the extra money.	
1. 	This stool has really good grips. It never budges. We use it for the potty and sink, and haven't had any slipping accidents. I would purchase this again for sure.	
- 1	The whole thing was heavy, so it would still manage to move around after securing it. I've tried to secure it to the graco snugride 30, graco pack n play corners, playzone play yard, anything! The wheel is not easy to spin, as the string catches whenever you pull it. I should have known better than to order the pink one, as the colors are not as attractive for a baby. I love pink, but baby prefers the bright and contrasting colors such as blues and reds with yellows and greens. I usually give any toy a few months of chances as I've noticed that if my daughter doesn't like a toy at 3 months, she may at 4 months, or even 6 months. Since we bought this when she was 3 months old, she still does not like it at 12 months old. Too bad as it's adorable!	
1. 	This is by far the best waterproof bibs I have bought for my son (tried several different types/brands but this overall is the best one hands down).  No more stains on clothes!  Whenever I know he's going to eat something messy (ex: spaghetti, etc) this bib goes on him.  It is very cute and washes well. I throw it in the washer every so often to clean it really well (use the gentle cycle) and the bib still has not warped.  Highly recommend!!!Here are some of the brands of bibs I've tried already:~Circo Easy Wipe Bibs from Target (awful, by far the worst bibs...they warp/wrinkle very easily when washed; everyone of them got thrown away within a short time; waste of money).~Bumkins super bib (very great bib..same material as the sleeved bib and just as easy to clean.  We use these bibs anytime our child is not going to have as big of mess when eating or when traveling)~Baby Treasures Easy Wipe Bibs from Kohls (pretty good, the material of them is more similar to the Circo bibs from Target but for some reason these didn't warp yet.  They are pretty easy to clean.)	
- 1	Ok, I admit, I bought these because they are pretty. And yes, they are pretty. BUT, not very useful. So, though they are tempting, I don't recommend the purchase.The spoon is too big and even a bit too deep for a small baby's mouth. We tried these at 4, 6 and 7 months, and don't really like them. They also stain. So they are no longer pretty, the reason I bought them.PROS:- prettyCONS:- too big for small baby- too deep for small baby- stainBottom line: Just enjoy looking at the pictures online and instead go for the munchkins spoons for beginning eaters.	
1. 	This turtle has been a lifesaver! I was trying to break my 18-month-old of her pacifier, and nights were not going well at all. After a couple of rough nights I showed her this thing, and she has been attached ever since. She was immediately entranced by the stars, and she snuggled with it right up against her nose so she could get a close look. She was in the middle of learning her colors so she likes to switch the colors and tell me what they are. She ends up putting the turtle in the corner of her crib and looking up at the stars until she falls asleep. No more crying for Pa-Pa (her pacifier). Now all she cares about it Kur-kle (turtle). So glad I got this thing!	
1. 	We were lucky enough to have friends who were able to lend us a high chair for the first few months my son began eating solid food. I learned a lot from having a real high chair. First, I learned what a PITA it is to fit a real high chair (of the stand alone, reclinable, padded variety) into a small space and try to maneuver around it. Second, I learned how incredibly annoying it is to clean crusted and dried carrot puree from the grooves in said high chair's seat, legs, and tray.Enter the Fisher Price Booster Seat. I'm docking a star because you might as well forget about the dishwasher safe tray. I was never able to use it without having it end up on the floor - it simply doesn't snap in firmly enough. However, for a simple to use, easy to clean, no fuss seat, this is a winner. After a meal, I take a couple baby wipes and clean off the little guy's hands and mouth. Then I snap off the tray, pop him on the floor, take another wipe and wipe off the seat. Brush/wipe off the tray, and you're done! No more lugging your huge, folding high chair outside to hose it down. No more digging around the grooves of collapsing legs for crumbs.The booster seat is also convenient enough for us to take with us to restaurants that don't have their own high chairs. Set up in seconds. And since the back and tray are both removable, I'll be using it for years to come! Truly a great product.	
1. 	We have a the NoJo Jungle Babies 6-piece crib set as well as the wall stickers and these hangings.  The hangings are great for the nursery with interesting characters, great colors, and a mixture of fabrics for depth and texture.  They are made from the same materials as the comforter so match perfectly.  They can be thrown in the washing machine when they get too dusty and hold up well.	
- 1	My problem with this item is not that it doesn't swaddle well.  As a graduate I expected as much.  However, what I was not expecting was my son's getting out of the swaddle involving him pulling the fabric taught around his nose and mouth.  I was keeping on eye on him so I was able to get it off of him, and even if I wasn't my baby is strong and would have probably been fine, but still!  Seeing your baby's mouth and nose covered is scary!  I may end up using this as a sleep sack, as the fabric is nice.  I also may use it to swaddle him with one arm out to try and train him.  That way there will be a gap for air if he pulls the other arm out.  But, as a swaddler, I say this product is not very safe.	
1. 	This product is perfect size for up to maybe 3/4 wet/dirty diapers. I bought a SMALL garbage bin based on the size of the plastic bags. I keep the bin right by where I change the baby. The scent is perfect for masking the scent of dirty diapers so it is a bit strong... however, I think that's the purpose.	
1. 	this is much easier and safer to keep nasty shopping cart germs away from your child.  my only problem is keeping my child in the front of the cart, she has to be part of the action.  its a little bulky to carry around, and not very easy to put back in the bag, but would purchase again because the others ive seen still have places the baby could touch and get germs.	
1. 	So worth the additional money .  I don't think that I have ever been out where someone hasn't commented or requested where I purchased this cover.  Fits great and helps keep baby upright.  You can also lay the baby across the top longways (monitored of course) to allow baby to feed or nap	
- 1	At first I thought it was great. Cheap, easy to use, holds a decent amount of stuff. But one of the straps broke after a few months and now it's useless.	
1. 	I have to say right of the bat, this is the comfiest pillow ever! It is nice and firm and stays put. It has really helped with side sleeping which is insanely painful for me. Actually its so comfy 3 year old son (who fits exactly inside the pillow) keep trying to steal it from me. As does my husband! Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this pillow!!! I am actually able to sleep almost entirely free of pain because of this! And even with me cuddled up with this, it still only takes up half the queen size bed. My husband complains about how little space he has, but he does that even when it's not on the bed so I ignore him. The only thing I hate about this thing (yes hate!) is that the pillowcase is a complete pain in the butt to put back on once you have washed it! If they made it with a zipper instead of a regular style case this would be perfect. Oh,the seam along the curve of the U is kinda painful on your neck and shoulders when you use it next to your head instead of at you feet but bunching a sheet or regular pillowcase along it completely solves that problem.  For me as I have at least a dozen pillowcases this is no big deal. But it might be for others.  It's still so amazing that even these flaws don't deserve to knock down the rating. I am so glad I bit the bullet on this and got it. We almost didn't due to it being $40 for a pillow but it is way worth the cost even if your on a tight budget. As an extra note, I was previously sleeping on my side bundled up in about 6-8 crappy Walmart pillows that went everywhere, never held their shape and that are NOT much help. My main problems were due to pain in my knees, hips, and shoulders and now it's almost 100% pain free! Normally I sleep on either my stomach or my back, so this is also invaluable at keeping me on my side.	
- 1	I ordered and currently use the original version of the Adiri Nurser bottle, as that was the only bottle at the time my exclusively breastfed baby would take. Thank goodness he has grown past that phase and now will take the Born Free bottles I had purchased and received as baby shower gifts. This NexGen bottle is too much trouble. All the different pieces and steps to fill and heat it are so cumbersome and time consuming. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for all of that. They really need to rethink the design on this thing. It's also hard to read the amounts. I thought I would love it, as I like the look and feel of it but boy am I glad I didn't have to actually use it too long.	
1. 	I spent a LOT of time debating all of the different types of strollers, and eventually settled on TWO - this one and a Bugaboo. THIS one I use ALL the time. It is ridiculously easy to open and close, and is great for anyone who will be using it primarily for indoor use (although I haven't tested it extensively outdoors, it rides fine over the smooth pavement but doesn't maneuver over significant bumps, i.e. uneven sidewalks, very well). BUT ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING THAT I NOTICED ANOTHER REVIEWER MENTIONED - SHE SAID THAT THE CARSEAT POPPED OFF THE STROLLER WHEN SHE WENT OVER A CURB (CAUSING SIGNIFICANT INJURIES TO HER BABY), BUT THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED HAD SHE ROTATED THE TWO RED SAFETY TABS ON THE UPRIGHT BARS SO THAT THEY WENT OVER THE FRONT OF THE CAR SEAT (LOCKING IT IN PLACE). So, it is NOT a dangerous stroller - just make sure you read the instructions.Oh, and the reason I got the Bugaboo is because, while it is quite expensive, it is high quality, comes with very nice accessories, and is convertible in so many ways (from bassinet with several different positions to upright stroller with riding board for your older child). If you want a stroller for very frequent use on pavement (whether just for walks around the block or if you live in or near a city) that can hit almost any bump (other than a crater!) and handle it well, get a Bugaboo! It will last for YEARS, and retains its value (in case you want to sell it).	
1. 	Perfect for newborn to toddler! It smells great and is a gentle enough cleanser to wash newborn skin, but cleans my toddler son's skin really well after a day at the park! Highly recommend.	
1. 	When I had my son in 2010, I had the previous boy Fisher-Price rocker on my registry and was so pleased with it. He used it up until about 14 months old. So, naturally, when I was expecting my daughter this year, I wanted a girl version. The form has been changed a bit but she, now 4 months old, loves it. My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I find the musical bar just a bit too high up on the chair. My son's was a bit lower, not so close to his face. But they only use the bar for a little while so I imagine it won't matter in a few months. She loves it anyway and pull the butterfly chord constantly.Great chair. Fisher-Price scores again.	
- 1	This thing rattled from the moment I moved the car, even if leaving the driveway at 2 mph.  Drove me crazy.  Found this is a common problem when I searched the reviews for 'shakes' and synonyms like 'vibrate', 'rattle', 'wobble', etc.  Also heard that the mirror can pop out of the ball-bearing joint in a crash.  I returned mine.  Same issue with the similar Britax model.	
- 1	The item you get is NOT what is pictured.  The two sides are actually sewn togethere so you really can't stand the mirror up on its own...you have to prop it on something.  It is made out of cheap material, like ugly nylon.  The mirror is hideous and not worth the $10.	
1. 	This is a nice fitted sheet and the fabric seems to be durable.  I've washed it a few times and it washes really nicely.	
1. 	I have two in different parts of the house.  After my C-section these really helped me to feed my son.	
- 1	I read all the reviews that said this seat is heavy, but when attempting to take it out of the box it really hit me how heavy this thing is!  The reason I didn't like it was that when RF it took up so much room that my front passenger seat was almost all the way forward.  No way an adult could sit there comfortably.  Additionally, when my son was in the seat I didn't feel there was enough side support/protection.  I had him in a Chicco KeyFit 30 when he was smaller and I liked the fact that the RXT could convert all the way to a booster seat.  But, in addition to the above mentioned problems was the fact that it was awful to install.  Straps everywhere, trying to figure out what was what.  The instruction booklet was awful and I had to resort to videos on the web to figure it out.  Needless to say I returned it.	
- 1	We struggled with this thing for nearly a month before giving up. It absolutely can not be positioned in our car in any way that will allow either the driver or the passenger to see the baby. It also  has a distressing tendency to fall down.	
- 1	When they say plush, I was thinking as plush as the velour on a Zutano changing pad cover.This is NOT PLUSH! This is very thin and the color isn't as vibrant,it's more of a faded green.I bought theZutano Owls Velour Changing Pad Coverfrom Amazon as well and this is nowhere near the plushness of the latter.Daughter's amused by the monkey print and readily lies down on the changing pad so I take it she likes it and that's about the only redeeming quality of this item	
- 1	I guess when they say &#34;colors may vary&#34; they don't consider the boy/girl factor. I have a boy, and would have been happy with any other color than pink, but that's what I got. Sending them back, probably not going to order another.	
- 1	Not good quality and didn't fit my toilet. I suppose its ok as a travel one if you need that.	
- 1	We have an original Bjorn, but my boys are getting big and heavy and it was getting very uncomfortable for me to try to carry them for long stretches in it, so I thought I would try this model.  First let me say that if you are a petite woman, this will not work for you.  I am 5'4 and 112 lbs, and I could not adjust it small enough to fit.  My husband is 6'2 and 210 lbs, and it did fit him okay.  However, we elected to return it because it is just too bulky.  There is so much padding everywhere that it cannot even be rolled up to fit in a diaper bag, and it just seemed like if it were even a little bit warm outside a baby could get overheated in it (not to mention the wearer).  Also, it is nowhere near as easy to put on as the original Bjorn, which is one of the reasons we liked the Bjorn so much to begin with.  I ended up ordering a Becco Gemini and I am very happy with it, while my husband is just going to keep using the original Bjorn (and make more visits to the chiropractor).	
- 1	This product is poorly designed. There's a rubber insert on the flat side which you're supposed to press against your child's head to make a seal so the water only flows back from that point. Two problems: first, the rubber is so rigid you can't get a good seal without pressing REALLY hard. The second, and biggest, problem is that the rubber insert doesn't go all the way to the edges of the cup. There is a space of about 3mm at each side where the water just gushes out. Because of where you'd have the cup positioned on your child's head, this means the water goes in their ears, down both sides of their face and even some into the eyes. Since it's water in the eyes which really freaks my kid out, it's useless to us.She does enjoy stuffing her other bath toys in it though so we have got some use out of it.	
- 1	I got this for around $19.99 or maybe a little less, can't remember now. Let me tell you, the velcro stopped working after one wash. I wouldn't recommend this. Unless your a die hard Winnie the Pooh fan, I wouldn't get this.	
1. 	This seat fits in my kitchen sink, but just barely. Fortunately, it also fits perfectly in the Ikea Lattsam baby bathtub, if you don't have a sink that it will work with. The seat makes bath time much easier because you don't have to hold the baby up in the water. I put a washcloth down so that the baby's back isn't directly against the cold plastic, then put another washcloth over the baby's stomach to keep him warm. He will outgrow it pretty quickly, but it is inexpensive and works really well.	
- 1	I'm thinking this pail should be used for babies with diapers under #4.  Anything bigger/heavier and you can't fill it half way without the lid putting up a fight to close which causes the gears to strip past themselves which are what are to close the bag at the top.  We'd love to replace it, but it looks like NO ONE makes anything better.  We gave up on the backing soda dispenser on the top, and bought some A&H; pucks and stuck them under the bag.  This actually seems to have helped with the smell somewhat.  I've gone as far as cleaning the thing with bleach.I wish someone would make one out of metal.  If this design was made with some solid metal gearing it would cost considerably more, but it'd last for years.Good design idea, BAD execution.EDIT: OK someone emailed me about one made by Ubbi that's METAL!!!  OMG it rocks!  So far (2 weeks) and the room is relatively poop smell free.  Our son is 20 months old and MAN do his diapers smell.  Not cheap, but WORTH IT!  Check them out peeps!	
1. 	I got this as a gift at my shower.. Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one. I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it.  Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast.	
- 1	Ehhhhh.. This cup is verrated. Not much better than any other cup that says spill proof. I have as if yet to find one that actually is 100% spill proof. Hey I was skeptical of the reviews that said it wasn't spill proof because of the ones that said it was , but Ive leaned it wasnt and it also can be chewed thru. The strae is rubber and my 2 year old son bit it off. So it's not for  toddlers say 2 and above. lol...... He as something with cup straws..	
- 1	After solely breastfeeding my baby for 3 months, my husband and I wanted to be able to go out and have him babysat. In order to do so we had to get him to take a bottle, after many tries and fails, we finally found a nipple he would take, and unfortunately this one wasn't it. He just kept spitting it out and wanted nothing to do with it!	
1. 	This lid-lock works great.  I am giving it 4 stars because ours is very squeaky and seems loose, but it does the trick.  Easy to open and close.  Now that my baby is a toddler, he is more interested in yanking at it and figuring out how it works.  It has withstood the assault so far.	
1. 	Our  son enjoyed this  bouncer from day 1. It' s  his  comfort  zone: the place where he  sits to observe, to play with  his rattles and  teethers or talk with his  teddy, to  soothe  himself or  have his  mid-morning  nap. He also has many  of his meals while sitting in the bouncer. During  his days of  colics it was a saving accessory since its  vibrations seemed to be the only  true immediate  comfort.	
1. 	Got these hoping they'd be more comfortable than regular shields, and they definitely are.  However, the more you wash/sterilize them, the more they start to yellow and will eventually need to be replaced sooner than the regular kind.	
1. 	...and yet my lavender scented candles are all I smell. This is a simple, fast and effective way to dispose of the smelly's in your little one's pants. As long as you dispose of the sausage regularly, there shouldn't be a problem. (Especially afer you take them off the breast and start solids)	
- 1	Velcro sucks! and it is such a nuisance to open and close. Don't buy this unless you want an extra hassle	
1. 	We have these on two of our outlets that are used quite often and I wish we had purchased these for most of our outlets instead of those plastic outlet covers that are nearly impossible to remove. We don't have any issues with ours closing and it is easy to slide when I need to plug something in.	
1. 	Combined with your Graco Snugride, this frame makes the perfect stroller for traveling or for running quick errands with an infant:--lightweight--easily folds/unfolds--stands when folded; very compact--easy to attach and detach carseat--large basket underneath--height-adjustable handle--relatively smooth rideIt is not, however, a good walking stroller, primarily because of the fixed seat position -- baby is stuck in the same semi-upright position the entire time, which is fine for a short jaunt but less comfortable on longer strolls. Also, the ride is smooth on paved surfaces but a bit bumpy over cracks in the sidewalk, etc. And finally, the cup holders are a joke; way too shallow to hold anything other than maybe a small paper coffee cup (but you can't put hot drinks near a baby, anyway, so what's the point?).This would not be good as your one and only stroller unless you don't plan to use a stroller very often. But for the price, it's definitely worth having on hand for those times you just want to go from car to an errand quickly or for  travel.	
- 1	Ended up not using this at all.  My husband and I both attempted to use this and it basically pulls your clothes off of you (up your back and waist).  Big waste of money.  Ended up getting an ErgoBaby and LOVE IT!  I renamed the ErgoBaby, magicbaby b/c my son is calm w/in 5 mins of being put in it.	
1. 	wow what an awesome product!!  really helped since my son would not go on a public potty while potty training, he was so scared.  this made potty training so easy while out shopping!  and it fits in my purse/ diaper bag!  so glad to have it for my next child!	
1. 	I had to write a review because it has been so hard for me to find a rack that will take my glass bottles.  I use the 7oz. Dr. Brown's system and this rack is just perfect.I was so tired of laying a towel out on my counter and searched reviews forever to find a rack that would hold my bottles without falling over.  No one really said there was a good rack for glass bottles so I took a stab in the dark with this one.  It is wonderful!I wanted to reduce the clutter on my counter and this one is nice b/c it has several different compartments for various parts (I dry my bottles, air vents, tubes, breast pump storage bottles, breast pump shields/accessories, nipples, glass baby jars, sippy cup and all kinds of lids).  I don't dry all these items at the same time, but I do generally dry two 7oz. glass bottles and all the parts that go with them, about 3-4 plastic breast pump storage bottles and lids, two pump shields and filament holders and few plastic spoons and a small plastic bowl at one and it does well.  It is full at this point, but holds up just fine.It does not tip over, which was my main concern.  On top of that, it takes up a small amount of counter space and also organizes things so that even though they are on the counter, it doesn't look like a gigantic mess!I really do like this product and was skeptical about it's quality.It's not fancy.  It's very basic and really works well for the price.  Heck, it would be worth it to me even if it cost more too!GREAT product if you are a user of glass bottles!	
- 1	At first I used this to wash all my parts every day!  But then I started to notice a film on the bottles and pumping parts.  Lately I have just started filling up the sink using regular dish soap and hot water (we have lots of parts and bottles after day care) and I feel like that works better.	
- 1	I ordered this to go with the extra tall Dreambaby Gate. There was nothing indicating that these would not fit it.  Now I'm having to send both back as I have no need for an extra tall gate that can't fit the way my stairs are arranged.	
1. 	My daughter immediately took to this toy.  It is adorable with many aspects that she will eventually explore over the months to come.  It is relatively large and seems to be made very well.  I wish I dad gotten it for my first two kiddos...	
1. 	I used this with my first child until he could sit up without wobbling.  However, with my second child, I only used it for about the first month.  The sling is the best part, it cradles the baby so that you can easily wash the child by yourself.  I stopped using it with my second child because I was already filling the tub for one child, so I just figured it was easier to bathe them together.  Now I am using a seat that a friend gave me a that supports the baby in the tub, so once again, I am pretty much hands-free.	
1. 	It's great not to have the extra piece of furniture around the dining table. Chair is comfy and easy to clean.I didn't even try to use the white tray because of the other reviews on how easy it is for the kids to throw it on the floor.Bought an extra one to keep at grandmas.	
- 1	Inconsistent readings and not very user friendly.  Impossible to get an accurate reading, especially on a small, squirming forehead.  Purchased something else instead.	
- 1	While I think this item is a nice thing to give someone as a shower gift I'm not sure too many parents will wish they had one.The idea is great - pop your dropped on the floor pacifier into the item and in minutes you have a clean, germ free bink ready to pop into the little guys mouth.My biggest issue with it is - how do I know that it's really at least as clean as holding it under the hot water for a minute - I don't have a microscope to take a look so I guess I need to be the trusting sort of person that just takes the manufacturers word for it - If that's you than order away!	
1. 	We experimented with a variety of bottles and brands, and these have EASILY been my favorite.  Easy to clean, easy to use, very minimal on the air bubbles, I love them all around.  I buy these for my friends having babies (even if you breastfeed, it's great to be able to pump and let dad feed on occasion so you can have a break!) and they love them also.  This set makes a great gift, and for every baby and baby shower in my future, I will be including the Playtex VentAire systems!	
- 1	I really wanted to like this but it just isn't going to work for me.  The concept is awesome and I wish there were alternatives but this one misses the mark.  The biggest issue, like others have previously pointed out, is that the lid is difficult to screw on.  The three cups easily disconnect and reconnect with each other but the lid takes effort if you want the threads to line up the right way (side note, the cups do unscrew pretty smoothly so now that I think about it maybe they would become less secure over time).  I don't have the time to worry about making sure the lid is screwed on properly every time I use it.  Not only does it increase the likelihood of spilled snacks but it also leads me to believe they would go stale quickly due to a poor seal.  I will continue to look for something similar that holds the same larger amount of snacks.	
1. 	My 9 month old son loves it for the car rides because of the tags and the chime sound it makes when you shake it.  Definitely worth the price, especially as it helps soothes the little one to sleep for car rides.  Another good Taggie product.	
- 1	Before buying this check to see if it will work with your oven.  We ordered it and it won't work with ours because our oven handle is very close to the top of the door and the oven lock flap gets caught on the handle when closing it.  We have a kitchen aid oven with a thick rounded handle spanning the width of the door.  Looks like it would have been a good product if it worked for us, though.  This seems to be happening with much of this baby-proofing stuff we've ordered online.  Be careful to consider how each item will fit for your application before buying.	
- 1	So.. My wife and i had tried out the Summer Extra Tall gate and were underwhelmed by the limitations and i was disappointed by the narrowness of the walkthru part of the gate.With that said, we opted to try the Kidco Extra Tall (extra tall so cats cant jump over)..Numerous great reviews prompted us to give it a try.Value: Well, $90 + $25 for an extension makes this by FAR the most expensive baby gate option for us.Installation: It lacked REAL detailed pictures for step by step walkthru.. (i figured it out on my own, but there is no way my wife would have understood this)Use: After it was installed, we began testing and QUICKLY learned after about 15 minutes this was not the gate for us.The part you walk thru was the nicest feature about it. It was 22'' wide. More than enough for my 225lb and 6'1 frame to fit thru - but that is where the positives end...The latch to unlock it feels cheap and flimsy. It feels almost like the plastic youd buy a gallon of milk in. It doesnt flow smoothly to pull up and over.At the bottom, there is a 'bracket' that extends down about 1 inch. This bracket ensures the door is aligned to the frame. When pulling up on the latch, you have to lift the gate up over that inch (doesnt sound like much but the others we have tried you only lift up a little bit and its unlocked.This bottom bracket also causes trouble when it shuts, which i might add does not automatically shut.I was shutting the gate door, and noticed that i several times had to stop for an extra amount of time to ensure the bottom bracket was aligned correctly to the frame. It was a cumbersome process and wasnt what i wanted if i was in a hurry.Other gates just have a metal pin that hangs down, that when it meets the bottom of the frame it simply slides in and shuts very easily.Another feature i just could stand at ALL, was the fact that if you have the gate door open half way and it isnt in the lift up position, you have to lift it up again. Its kind of odd to describe in this review.oh yea - the supposed stainless steel extension connecting bars were RUSTED when they came! i pulled the first two out, and they were fine. the other two were totally rusted.Its just nothing at all what we want and i am surprised how many good reviews this has.	
- 1	I loved this audio monitor for 9 months. It was easy to set up, easy to use, worked great and the 2 parent units were awesome. Why don't more baby monitors come with 2 parent units?Well, today, I accidentally kicked the power strip while sorting stuff in the baby's room and powered off the baby unit. When I powered it back on, the parent units wouldn't connect with the baby units. I tried everything in the manual and on their trouble shooting website, and then I came here to see if anyone else had had this problem. And what do you know... LOTS of people have had this problem.So it's a known issue and the manufacturer's solution is to send you a replacement. So let me see if I understand this situation: every time I power off the baby unit, the audio monitor will cease to function I have to then call in and get a replacement? That's ridiculous. We're about to move and I don't have time to deal with getting the audio monitor replaced knowing that in a month when we move and have to unplug it, I have to call again to get it replaced. I will be returning this unit and shopping for another product.I should probably note that we did unplug it 2-3 times before this happened, so it doesn't happen right away. Looking at other reviews, it seems to happen if you unplug it after about 6 months of use.	
1. 	these bibs are a little big & bulky & a little pricey, but they work great at catching almost all meeses and clean up great.	
- 1	I ordered a couple of these clips but this one, for some reason, had a HORRIBLE clip part. It was almost impossible to open and when I was trying to pry it open one day, it snapped shut on my finger and actually injured me. I ended up throwing it out because I didn't want it near the baby. The other color [blue/green stripes] that we got didn't have the same issue, but this one was horrible and I would never have wanted it near the baby. Perhaps it was a faulty one, but I thought it was worth pointing out. The other one was useful and we used it for as long as the baby had a pacifier.	
1. 	I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.	
- 1	So, I purchased this after reading the reviews and when it arrived the gel pads were hugely inflated with air and hardly any gel.  Not sure if in transit the pads became inflated pillows with elevation change, but it rendered the product completely useless.  I returned the product and bought another breast pad:I bought Gerber Breast Therapy Warm or Cool Relief 2 Reusable Packs by Nuk and they have been such a better purchase.  They are covered in a light fabric, and not plastic like other pads.  You can also keep them cool or microwave them to get them hot.  :)	
- 1	These are ok, but not really needed. There are so many products out there- as a new mom it is hard to know which are helpful and which are not. I'd say you can pretty much do without these -- save your money for the things you really will use!!	
1. 	The first one I bought was not working properly.  It always complained I've added too much water.  I replaced it and the second one worked fine.Compared with microwave sterilizers or electric sterilizer from other brands, this sterilizer is rather pricey, but I'm glad I've picked this one.  I set the sterilizer to 24 hours mode so the bottles are ready to use all the time (you still need to replace water inside every day).  When I was holding my hungry and crying baby in one arm, I was really glad that the bottle is already sterilized and ready to use right away.	
1. 	I use these on baby multiple times a day.  They have small rounded bulbs at the tip to prevent hurting the inside of baby's nasal passage . Easy to use and convenient. I'll probably buy multiple, one to keep at home and one for the diaper bag on the go.	
- 1	I bought this for my 2nd baby, thinking it'd be easier than warming a cup of water to warm the bottle.  Nope.  I could never get the amount of water and time right.  I just went back to a cup of water and this thing is sitting in a box.	
1. 	This wedge really helps me get comfortable at night.  It adds just the right amout of support where you need it.	
1. 	I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).	
- 1	These are CRAP... great concept but the tape doesn't stay put. I just pushed the door (pretty lightly) and it popped right off- after giving it 24hrs to dry- lol. So it popped off and took some paint with it... my friends 2yr old could have opened the door no issue with this thing installed (she's a great trial in knowing what we need to baby proof!). I knew it was a risk- as it seemed too good to be true- but figured it was worth a shot for something so cheap. Have to find another product now... oh well. Live and learn ;)There is not other way to install- we could drill a hole, but don't really want a hole in my closet door- besides, it's a hallow door so it wouldn't work anyway. And you could maybe super glue it... but how long would that last?	
1. 	I was a little apprehensive when I saw reviews saying these bags didn't work properly.  They work perfectly with my Medela electric pump.  They'll come in so handy when I'm traveling so I can pump and store right away without having to transfer the milk afterwards.  These are awesome.	
1. 	I just got this for my 5 month old baby girl.  She liked it, but did not go crazy for it as she has for some other toys.  It is very cute, and small enought for a baby to hold, its about 6inch long which I think is a great size for babies since they do not need a large toy to play with. My only concern and perhapes it should not be is that it has little beads inside and beany baby toys. I am sure its safe but the beads worry me if the toy rips they could come out. I am also thrilled that this is not made in china, hence my main reason for buying this.	
- 1	This fan is just ok.  I like how the blades are foam, because they are safe, just in case my baby wants to grab at it, but you pretty much have to get in the blades to feel ANY breeze at all.  She likes to look at it....that's about it.  Plus, it drains batteries quickly.  I probably wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	These bottles are great.  My son is 2 1/2 month old and hasn't had any gas bubble that much.  He drinks very good with these bottle.  Just have to remember to put the plastic part down and around on the bottom part of it will leak!	
- 1	This thermometer is a complete waste of money...it says it reads in 5 seconds but i haven't had one 5 second reading yet. Horrible product, especially if you have a squirmy baby....please don't waste your money!!	
- 1	They advertise this on Amazon as a nursery item. I would strongly advise against it.I ordered 4 white baskets, with the hope to store diapers, wipes, creams etc. in my baby's room, in an accessible area for everyone. All of the four baskets had the same issues:- Terrible chemical odor, probably from the paint.-  The paint was peeling off and was chipped throughout. It looked like a dog had spray painted it, blindfolded.- The end of the wicker was not tucked in safely, but rather exposed on the outside and was as sharp as skewers all around it.I regretted this purchase as soon as I received my order, and sent it back immediately. I would not recommend this to anyone..	
1. 	Great item, you should not hesitate to get a few of these. Babies love being swaddled and this takes the fuss out of trying to do it correctly. This item definitely makes your baby more content and it's easy to change their diaper without unwrapping them completely.	
- 1	Too small. It is harder/denser that the Boppy, but this also makes it more rigid, making it a little more difficult to position the baby	
1. 	We got the Healthy Care Booster Seat after both of my sisters-in-law told us how much they liked and used theirs. When my baby started eating solid foods (about 5 months ago) we got this, thinking it would tide us over until we chose a full-size high chair. We are still using it because it is so easy to use, easy to clean and we see no reason to buy another high chair that will just take up space. When we travel, we fold it up and bring it along. So convenient, so versatile and so cheap compared to a full-size high chair!	
1. 	This is the perfect transport option while a baby is in the larger carriage type car seats. A large basket to carry diaper bag and any extras. Instead of breaking your back and carrying the baby and carseat everywhere use this lightweight transport option. It's my favorite stroller for the first year.	
1. 	Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.	
- 1	I have several other munchkin products that I like, so was happy to find these sippy cups.  I liked the design, the colors, the no spill cup/spout, and the two handles were perfect for little one's hands.  This is where anything decent about these ends.  My daughter figured out that it was something to drink from, but has been completely unable to figure out how to get liquids out.  At first I thought it must be because she is new at this.  Then I tried it.  Are you kidding me? The liquids will only come out if you are able to simultaneously bite down on the spout and then suck.  Once you can figure that out and get a flow going, the spout and silicone top starts to collapse from the suction.To be fair, I thought maybe it's just me.  I handed one to my husband and asked him to use it.  It took him several minutes to figure out how to get any liquid out to drink it, and even then he had a hard time maintaining the coordination needed to drink.  If two adults experienced in drinking liquids for 35+ years from various drinking objects, how do you expect an infant just transitioning from bottle to cup?Save your money and get something else!	
- 1	Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.	
1. 	A new baby reaching toddler size presents a lot of difficulties around the house. What will he get into? How will he injure himself? What do we need to do to protect him? Hmmmmmm. It's a tough question and no matter what you do, he'll probably find something you didn't think of. Our toddler has already found a tube of diaper rash creme and spread it all over himself (primarily the face) and over the wood floor and a carpet.Well, we've tried to do some common sense things. For example, our living room has a large fireplace with a raised brick hearth. The edge, and particularly the corners, are sharp and harsh and could cause a good wound if the baby were to fall against them. So we bought this Prince Lionheart Cushiony Fireplace Guard. I installed it in about an hour. It's a one-size-fits-all solution and I was afraid our fireplace was too big. No problem. It took a bit of cutting, but we ended up with about 6 inches of edge left over.We don't like the looks of it, but the baby's safety is of greater importance. The guard is stuck on with some tape from 3M and there are warnings in 10 different languages that they do not guarantee that the glue will do no damage. Hmmmmm. I expect there will be damage when the guard is removed. It's an imperfect solution, but better than nothing.Gary Peterson	
- 1	I bought this for my daughters crib right after she was born thinking it would make my life easier. However all that happened was that it made my daughter sweat A LOT so I took it off and never used it again.	
- 1	I tried this on my Britax car seat. Here are the issues:- Its hard to put on while holding an infant- We live in the South and it does not deflect the heat, in fact I feel like it makes the seat hotter than without-It feels cheaply made	
1. 	great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.	
- 1	I had the Nuby 5 ounce sippy and my son took to that but I wanted a sippy with a lid to keep the spout clean during travel. I saw this in a 2-pack at Meijer and thought that it was perfect since it held more liquid and had a lid too. But this leaked from the spout from the get go!I ended up buying a new one, such a waste of money this was!	
1. 	Our little girl is now 9 weeks and she's been sleeping in this since we brought her home at 48 hours.	
- 1	The elephant sent to me had obviously been returned by another customer and then sent to me!  The plastic band holding the elephant in the package was already broken and the elephant had a large hole where it was stitched to the face!  What a disappointment as we purchased this for our soon to arrive baby!  We have the giraffe for our other daughter and thought this would have been adorable for our new child!  What's even more frustrating, we cannot get a replacement for it but only return it for a refund?  I don't understand why we are not able to get a replacement (as I won't buy this from amazon again fearing I would receive another damaged product!)  Incredibly disappointed!	
- 1	We have a tile shower.  I cannot get these suction cups to stick.  Two seem okay but the other keeps falling off.  I finally just gave up.  Good size net, though.	
- 1	Some suggest that the bigger the better, so I got this size.  I am a D cup with nursing and a C before.  The one that came with my pump seemed way to small, so I got the biggest size based on reviews.  It works better, but I'll have to get a smaller size.  Using this size seems to drasticly reduce the amount of suction I get with my manual hand pump.  Too bad you can't just buy one to try it!	
- 1	Have tried 3 different brands now and I liek these the least. My breast leakinsane amounts throughout the day so no matter what pad I wear I have to change it every hour or so. I have to wear 2-3 pads on each breast regardless! Totally crazy I know!These pads though when not soaked yet are like putting paper between my bra and breast so they're not comfortable at all and they crumple up a bit in places. The tape is pointless as they don't move around at all as did none of the others brands I tried. If you have a bra that fits a bra pad will stay in place. One other issue is and at the same time it's a positive I guess is that because these pads are kind of like a diaper in the sense of being absorbent and having that extra layer, you don't always know until you happen to touch one of the pads that it's completely soaked through for who knows how long! It's very obvious when one is soaked as it weight a whole lot more and feels like a dead jellyfish, but you only know this when you check it. I would not buy these again.	
- 1	For those of you that don't know, there was a version of this in the nineteenth century that KILLED babies. The milk couldn't be cleaned out of the tubes completely and it would rot and cause severe diarrhea which sometimes ended up being fatal. I'm not sure if this tube would have the same problem or if they have since developed some way of cleaning out the ENTIRE tube since then, but I'm not risking my child's life for convenience! [...]	
- 1	We've had this over a year and it has been annoying the entire time. Poor reception if you get more than about 20 yards away, and muddled sound. The charge lasts about 20 minutes on a good day, you have to keep it charged constantly. The base runs out of charge after about 5 minutes, so we must always keep it plugged in and can't use it in other rooms. The base also often loses it's signal, so the monitor will start beeping and sometimes the only way to get it back on track is to get up, unplug it, and then turn it on again. Also ours will NOT turn off sometimes even when we press the button. Really annoying monitor, would not recommend.	
1. 	My 18 month old son loves this chair he'll watch his movie I've even found him taking his nap in it the fabric is nice and soft easy to make it not a rocket and easy to take along	
- 1	I'd give it zero stars-but not an option and I'd return it, but I guess the return window is really small.  This thing is a random number generator.  It gives a different reading every time and there's a big difference every time.  Does not match any other readings with any other type of thermometer.  I loved the idea, not the product.	
1. 	Great cups, last a while and last through many dishwasher runs.  However, it's so strange that the tops come in colors that are different from the cups.  When you have a picky toddler who simply MUST have the green cup with the green top, that makes life tough as you try to explain there simply is no green top.	
- 1	The problem with this monitor is that it doesn't hold a charge. I go to bed with a full charge at 100% and in the middle of the night I am awakened by the annoying beeping sound alerting me the battery is dying. I have a baby, I am awakened every night by him, why would i want to be woken up by this monitor TOO????  Why not keep the monitor in the charging unit? Because the manual says that if you consistently keep it on the charging unit, it will ware out the battery and limit battery life!!! Then I will have to buy a new battery. I have returned this item 3 times in case it was just defective and they were all like this. I finally had to buy a new monitor from another company who's monitor last 36 hours while in the sleep mode without being charged. Much happier!Other than that, I like the monitor but the charging issue was just a terrible.	
1. 	my baby is mesmerized every time he sees his mobile. I like that you can change out the designs frequently. be patient with the way you have to change out the cards, or else you could damage them.	
1. 	We use these bowls all the time! They stack great in a refrigerator or cooler. They don't have the worlds best seal (so don't put anything liquid) but they are perfect for baby food or finger foods.	
1. 	I snipped the end off the net so the balls would fall thru and it became extra fun! Suction cups hold great. Only downfall is the balls have a tiny hole in them so water gets in and becomes moldy. But other balls I had fit and work good too.	
- 1	My sons loved to play with this in school, so I bought one.  The triangle shape doesn't make a sound, and the square barely makes a sound.  awful.  I am returning it immediately.	
- 1	This doesn't stay where it's supposed to stay no matter how tight I pull the adjustment straps. She just kicks it off and pulls it up over her head.	
1. 	Completely worth the money! Not only is it adorable but the mirror is very large and I can keep a close eye on my little girl.	
- 1	Half of the safety items for children are cheaply made and don't do what they say, so this gets 5 stars. This keeps our 2 yr. old out of the refrigerator every single time. These Munchkin latches have strong adhesives on both sides and are connected by nice heavier plastic strap. To open you push both tabs on the side of the latches and it releases, simple. To put back on, they do need to be lined back up to snap on, but that's really not much. Takes adults a little while to remember that the door isn't coming open until its unlatched. Finally a child's safety item that works, but it will take wallpaper and varnish off when they are removed.	
1. 	I've had these with all 3 of my kids and love them. Also have given them as baby shower gifts!	
1. 	Within a couple of weeks of breastfeeding, my back was shot. This stool provided so much relief. It also helps my husband, who has a bad back and chronic pain, sit more comfortably.	
1. 	We have been huge fans of Halo products from the start. We used the swaddled all the time for our daughter for the first few months. We even had an issue with one of the swaddles and my husband emailed the Halo company about it and received a response from the FOUNDER of the company who seemed genuinely appreciative of our feedback.For that reason, we have stuck with this brand and have been using the wearable blankets as she has grown. She currently wears a fleece one to bed every night and will wear these cotton ones during the spring.  These are wonderful products made by a great company who stands behind them.	
1. 	I love this system because it's so easy. Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple. I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular bag liner colapses easier.I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless. My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out. We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.	
1. 	I bought this as a baby shower present, but I also own one. I love it!!! It is so fashionable that people usually think it's a shawl and I'm just cold when I'm really pumping.	
1. 	We've used this tub since our son's umbilical cord fell off. He really likes it.  It provides cushioned support.  He is 2 months old, so we still use the sling/hammock.  The toys are nice for scooping water over him.  It's easy to drain and comfortable for us to use.	
- 1	I purchased several of these bottles/nipples after we started daycare and my daughter was getting nipple confusion from the Gerbers that fit onto my pump.  At first, I was very impressed that they improved her latch and she didn't appear to have much gas from taking the bottle.  After about a week of use, I found that the nipples retained the left sitting out breastmilk smell and I couldn't get it out.  I washed the bottles and nipples in hot soapy water and sterilized from time to time to make sure all the bacteria was destroyed.  Unfortunately, after another month of use, my to my horror, I discovered that the inner, darker blue nipples had deteriorated at the opening and either expanded on their own (because I certainly didn't shove anything in there to clean the very opening surface) or split down the side of the nipple (about !) or both!  I immediately looked at the other nipples we have been using and found that every single nipple had that problem.  The outer, clear nipple was still in perfect shape but the inner, blue nipple was deteriorating.  Now, either I have toxic milk - which I highly doubt - or the material is not of the best quality.I called the company the very next morning and told them about this problem that I was having with the nipples.  The customer service lady took an accusatory tone and said that I must be cleaning them wrong because she'd never heard of that.  I told her that I was using a nipple brush to clean the inside of the nipples but that there was no other way to get to the very tip of the inside.  She said that I only needed to use a soft cloth.  Really?  Then she offered to send me a replacement nipple pack just this once.  Ok, um, thanks.I received the replacement pack and immediately put them to use.  After a week of use, I inspected them again.  Guess what I found?!  The tips were starting to split - about 1/8-1/6 down the side of the blue inner nipple.I called the company again to tell them about this.  Got a different customer service rep and she apologized, asked how I was caring for the nipples and then offered to send me 4 replacement nipples but asked if I would please send them the defective nipples because they are very concerned.  I said sure.  I got the replacement packaged, opened it up, and found not 4 replacement Stage 1 nipples but two bottles of the stage 2, 9 oz size.I'm not going to bother with sending them the defective nipples.  I am not the only person that's having this issue as other reviewers online have reported the same occurrences.Save your money and try something else.  These don't appear to have a very long lifespan.  I like the idea, but it just doesn't last.  We're switching to another bottle.	
- 1	The only good thing I can say about this unit is that it does allow me to hear and see my baby.  Most of the time.  Unless it is broken.  Or out of battery power (in which case there is no alarm to let you know that the battery has worn down, a point I will get to later).  So I am now on my third unit.  Thank goodness I bought this at a reputable retail store that exchanged the broken one for a new unit. (Unfortunately they wouldn't allow me to get a different monitor.  I had to get the same one.)  Both times, the handheld unit stopped charging. I would plug it into the wall to charge (or use the base) and it just wouldn't charge.  So I don't think I just got a lemon.  I think it's a problem with the product.  The major design flaw is that when the battery runs out and the handheld turns off, there is no alarm. Nothing to let you know that the monitor has turned off. This is also an issue when the unit loses its signal (which happens frequently, and we don't have a large house).  The monitor is no longer monitoring but there is nothing to let you know that.  In my view, this is a MAJOR PROBLEM!!!!  The second time my unit broke, it stopped charging in the middle of the night and eventually the battery power went all the way down.  When I woke up, it was just off.  What is the point of a monitor that can shut off without letting you know???  I don't understand how this has gotten so many positive reviews.  Please DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR!!	
- 1	Ultimate question. Does it do its job? Yes i suppose it does do its job. However, i believe others would do it better!I bought this to go on the stairs (going down) so i had ONE safe large space for my twins to go crazy without me loosing my mind.My stairway is pretty wide so i had to use the extensions (which of course i know buying it). Once installed correctly (as a mom i was able to do this myself without waiting for my husband to do). It rattles when the babies grab it. And doesnt seem that secure. It does seem fine for my two 10 month old babies at this age but im not sure about it when they get older.MY BIGGEST complaint is the WALK THROUGH! WHAT THE HECK WERE THEY THINKING!! Im skinny (ok not rail thin) but im 5'7 132 pound woman with normal hips width. I hate walking through this. Its way too small! My seven year old walks through fine but my husband has to walk through sideways to get through it.  Carrying two 23 pound babies through the walk through makes for interesting maneuvering to get through it. I would not buy this thing again.  Too bad because the CONCEPT is great.	
- 1	I think the chair would serve it's purpose for a little while but the way the arms go together and fold for storage/travel seemed way too cheap for me.  The paint on the metal was scratching off when I twisted the arms to fold it.  I only tried it on a counter so I can't say how it works on a table with a skirt but I returned it and spent more money for a better made chair by Phil & Ted called MeToo.  The Phil & Ted chair folds flatter than this one and is lighter but doesn't come with a travel bag where this one does.  I can live without the bag for a chair that seems safer to me.  And the MeToo chair does go on my table with a skirt.	
1. 	This gate is sturdy and easy to install and our ferrets aren't able to find a way through/under/over it! Highly recommend!	
- 1	It never stays closed, and doesn't contain very many bags.  The bags themselves are surprisingly large and thick, and much bigger than I need for one dirty diaper or a dirty outfit.  I just don't understand why they weren't able to put a decent clasp on the dispenser to keep it shut.  We had to tape it closed, which doesn't look great.  When it's time for refills, we'll probably just get a different dispenser from another company.	
1. 	I bought this after meeting up with a mommy friend in a moist, goose-poop covered park and realizing her JJ Cole blanket was far superior to my 'waterproof' stadium blanket I'd purchased at Target years earlier. This blanket is thick and plastic-y, and seems genuinely waterproof. It is also really attractive, and folds up easily into a small, handbag-sized compartment. It's just a snazzy treat that makes it easy to hang out in any park. The price varies depending on which pattern you want, so make sure to check them all out and get the combination of style and price that will make you feel most satisfied with your purchase!	
1. 	We love this gate for our house.  Our daycare provider recommended it to us and we've been very please with it.  It works well mounted or unmounted and it's so nice that it swings on it's hinge when mounted.  We also like that it doesn't have bars for our son to use to pull up on.	
1. 	This seat has worked very well for our 25-month-old boy.  Very easy to use and clean, and also easy to remove and replace to allow adults to use the toilet.  One caution: the splash guard in front will not always catch everything, especially if our son is not sitting centered and aligned with it, or if he moves around.  You'll need to watch out for this, and you'll likely have a little spillage from time to time.  Perhaps the next version can offer an expanded splashguard.  I still think this seat is very much worth buying.	
1. 	now i can use my medela pump to express milk and easily store in avent bottles.no more transfer here and there.	
1. 	I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.	
1. 	No more kicking off socks, covers or blankets. I love that i know he is sleeping warm and cozy bundled up in his wearable blanket.	
- 1	I'm sure that some people like reusable bags, depends on how green you want to go but I just don't feel like I can get this clean enough to feel comfortable about using over and over again. The instructions say that you can put in the dishwasher or machine washable. I wouldn't want to put this in the clothes washer and it's hard to place in the dishwasher and keep it open and in place without it getting blown around the dishwasher by the water spray.To me these are like reusing a straw or plastic sandwich bag. Just get a new one. There are other places to save money on and other things make more of an impact in the landfill than how many times that I might use a plastic sandwich bag.	
- 1	I gave these to my 2 year old for Easter, which was 2 weeks ago.  They have already broken, as the screw fell out of one side.  Plus, the &#34;Babiators&#34; logo on the sides is already coming off.  (They will send you a new pair if you registered them and then you pay for the shipping.)  I'm going to fix them myself with an eyeglass kit, as it will be cheaper than the shipping on a new pair.  I won't be buying these again, though.  Carters sells similar glasses for just $5.  My daughter got a pair of those in her Easter basket as well - and they are still in one piece.  I'm going to stick with the cheaper brand.  Bottom line:  unless the brand name means something to you, buy something cheaper versus being disappointed, like I was, that I spent $20 on something that broke in 2 weeks.	
1. 	I like these bibs a lot for my son, who is 18 months old.  He is a messy eater, especially as he learns to use utensils.  These bibs provide shoulder-to-shoulder coverage.  The pocket catches lots of dropped food.  They are waterproof and easy to clean by wiping or putting in the washing machine.  I typically wash in the washing machine after every use because it gets them cleaner than wiping, and I hang them to try (which doesn't take long at all).  They have held up very well for many, many washings.  I like that they come in a lot of styles and colors.  These were a great find!	
- 1	At first I thought I had found something to get my son off of his bottle. This really was a good fit for getting him to drink his milk and give up his baby bottle. Unfortunately the nipple started to leak after only a few months of washing it in the top rack of the dishwasher. I'm super bummed!	
- 1	WAY too thin to be useful. These were see through, shrunk in the wash and don't absorb anything. My intention was to use them for burp cloths, not a chance.	
1. 	We were using a full-sized highchair for our 6 month old, but it was huge and took way too much space up in our kitchen. Also, the tray was too high for her. So, we purchased this booster and we all love it. She is able to reach her tray easily and can pick food up from it. I debated between getting this one and one of the space saver highchairs and I'm very glad we got this one. So easy!	
1. 	I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.  I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.	
- 1	I got Philips Avent bottles for my newborn, so what is better than using the Philips Avent bottle brush to clean them? Right? Wrong!This brush is so inconvenient, and not practical.Save your money and just buy the good old fashioned bottle brush.	
- 1	They are cute and make lots of noise with the crunchy stuff, however they lean and fall over when all stacked up.  Kinda defeats the purpose.	
- 1	The seat fit quite well on our elongated toilet, seemed relatively easy to clean (compared to others) and I loved the idea of the tank hook to keep it out the way when not needed. HOWEVER, when my 2yo son peed, I ended up with pee on top of my adult seat, something that does not happen when i sit him strait on it, without the ring. Ended up returning it	
1. 	These bibs are awesome. They're super-easy to clean and put on a child. They serve their purpose well when you get to the stage that a toddler is trying to feed themselves, this keeps all their food from falling on their lap or floor like it typically does. A pack of two is perfect because I can have one in the diswasher from the prior meal and have the spare one ready for the next meal. The only complaint I would have on these is how long they hang down because if you're feeding a child in a booster seat with a tray on it, the poketed part at the bottom hangs low enough that it touches the tray and gets in the way a little....still, it is manageable and better than any other bibs I've tried. I began using these around 8 months and my daughter is now 18 months and still leaves them on to eat each meal without it bothering her.	
1. 	If you do your pumping outside of an office, like I do, you'll find that pumping in the car can be quite enjoyable. You have climate control, your favorite kind of music, and you can even park under a tree or somewhere else if you have time. This car adapter makes it possible!	
- 1	Please be careful.  I ordered this item, my Grandson just arrived and I got them out.  I never thought that they would give me duplicates of animals.  It shows the animals you get and I got two of the hippo and no cow.  Of course, at home his cow is his favorite and well as the Penquin as they are black and white.  He identied with them early and the black and white contrast for infants is really important.  Good lesson - don't just make sure you got it or it works, look for duplicates and same colors.  A real disappointment.	
- 1	We bought this for our 3-month-old son and ended up returning it. It is very comfy and quite large but useless if you have a play mat. Of course, all kids are different, so while it did not work for us, I can see many other babies really liking it.	
1. 	This is a beautiful cover.  I purchased mine in sage green and am in love with the color as well as the softness of the fabric.  This washes well and slips over my changing pad with no problems.	
- 1	I purchased these in size two to use on both my 14.5 pound 3 month old daughter and my 30 pound 2.5 year old daughter. First, the good: they seem like they are constructed well. The cotton is soft and fluffs up nicely after being washed and dried several times. The bad: these are waaaaaay too long for both of my girls... Even the 2.5 year old at the top of the weight limit, and she's long and lean. They are also far too narrow, even on my 14 pound 3 month old... Forget about trying to snappi/pin these on according to the instructions on the package, or using any method for that matter. They're too narrow to pin, and too long to work well just trifolded with a cover. They do work trifolded... But only if you are okay with folding 6-8 inches down and having a really bulky and lumpy diaper.	
1. 	While trying to decide what kind of portable bed to get my almost 3 year old daughter, I was looking at a few different things.  The toddler air mattresses with raised sides, the pea pod plus, and cots like this one.  I was concerned about the weight of the air mattress when deflated.  Wasn't sure if she'd like the tent feature of the pea pod plus.  And then I found this cot.  At 1/4 of the price of the others and how quick and easy it is to set up (2 seconds, not joking), I gave it a try and I'm SO glad I did!Like I said, it's super easy to set up.  Slip it out of its carry bag (also a plus) and just pull it open.  Ready for sleep!It comes with a sheet which is nice, but I only used it once.  My daughter does tend to get colder while sleeping on this.  I put on a crib mattress pad and a flanel crib sheet and this seems to have taken are of that problem.  Bonus - even with the crib mattress pad and crib sheet, it will fold up and fit in its carry bag no problem!!The support strap in the middle underneath hasn't given my daughter any problems yet and even if it does later, then I guess it will be time for a different type of travel bed.  It will still have been well worth the $20!!My daughter calls it her blue bed and constantly asks to sleep on it even while at home.My nieces have all loved sitting on it to watch tv or play and their ages are 2, 4, and 7.  The 7 year old was much too big for it to lay down on but still liked to sit on it.Very pleased.  As someone who frequently travels with my daughter by myself, it is so much easier with this cot!!!  The pack n play was just too heavy and took up too much room.  This will actually fit in a large suitcase!Also, on the box, the weight says up to 75 pounds.	
1. 	I am so glad I registered for the Baby Bjorn carrier.  It is so simple to use and my baby always falls asleep in it (she's 6 weeks old).  When I first put her in it at about 2 weeks old, she didn't like it.  But I tried it again with her at about 3 weeks and she loves it.  (So if you have a baby who fusses at it, avoid it for a few days and try it again for brief periods to get the baby used to it.)  I like to go shopping with her in it so that my hands are free.  You won't be disappointed.	
1. 	THE BEST! Not only did he get  less gas, I hand wash and these bottles are easy to clean. Yes it requires taking them apart and putting them back together again, but I know every speck of the bottle gets very clean. I have never had a single leak. I love that you can use eth same bottles with different flow rates. Easy for my son to hold on his own. I recommend these and will use these next time as well.	
- 1	This doesn't actually fit a mini crib. I use a Dalani Emily Crib and the bumper ties in awkward places and crumples if touched the slightest bit.	
- 1	Great idea but our baby has had no trouble ripping these off of every surface we've put them on.	
- 1	these do not work. they arent snug enough to keep anything in. they are completely pointless. don't waste your money.	
1. 	I own the Original full sized Arms Reach Co Sleeper, and this mattress pad works perfectly with it. I've never had a leak with this, works great. Its not like sleeping on a pillow, but it really isn't too firm either. I feel the baby is quite comfortable between this and the sheet.	
- 1	I had to return this item because it didn't work right from the start.  It made very loud static and if someone talked or cried, it would only change the sound of the static slightly.  I really wanted it to work too- it had all the features that I needed and I loved the price.  I didn't try a second one since I really needed a monitor and didn't have the time to mess around with something that might not work.	
- 1	If your child likes open and close the door this product is not going to last for very long. It cracks so be careful and watch it so your child does not hurt themselves.	
1. 	This tub is wonderful the newborn phase of the tub is very secure and put me at ease during that first nerve-wracking baby bath.  My son is a natural water baby and loves to kick and splash, we have removed the newborn net and he's almost sitting up on his own...  I do not worry about him kicking around and sliding his head under the water due to the bump in the center of the tub which prevents him from sliding down too far.  This is a wonderful tub!  Even my husband feels confident enough to use it when i am not home!	
1. 	The one down-side to this is that it doesn't stick well on some table surfaces.  It works great on some, and on others the suctions don't want to stick for anything (even wetting them as some suggested).  Besides that, this is a great &#34;plate&#34; for our 18-mo. old while out and about at friends' or restaurants.  It rolls up nicely and cleans off easily.	
1. 	I absolutely love this product! My daughter is a very restless sleeper (9 weeks old) and tends to smack herself in the face, which of course wakes her up, unless her hands are swaddled down. I've tried blankets of all kinds, but she's always managed to get herself out of them. This product is great in that the microfleece is strong enough to keep her from unswaddling herself, while also being breathable. She sleeps so great in it that ever since I've used it (at about 6 weeks of age) she's slept through the night anywhere from 5 - 7 hours without waking me up for milk. I highly recommend this product!	
- 1	In fairness, I did not buy this pump on Amazon. It was covered by my insurance, which originally I thought was a wonderful thing, and I ordered it from one of their authorized medical suppliers. The pump I received has a slightly different appearance from the pump pictured here on Amazon. So...maybe this one is better? But as this one is sold under the exact same name as the one I received in October, 2013, I just have to warn you, don't waste your money! This pump will give you nothing but heartbreak and grief.I got the Ameda Purely Yours just after my second child was born. I had a lot of experience with a manual pump while nursing my first child, which I mention because although I had never used an electric pump before I was not pumping for the first time. For a week or two I got great results with the Ameda but things started to go downhill after that. I just wasn't getting much milk. First I suspected the batteries (since at work I couldn't pump near an outlet), but using the A/C adapter at home made no difference. Little by little it seemed the pump's suction was weakening. It was so gradual that I thought maybe I was getting accustomed to pumping and becoming less sensitive to feeling the suction, so therefore the fact I was getting so little milk made me worry that my supply was going down. After a 52-minute interrogation with customer service, during which they asked me every detail of my pumping routine, washing routine, and anatomy and took me through a lengthy troubleshooting process, they established that nothing was wrong with the pump itself. They referred me to a lactation consultant who wasted my time telling me all about how nursing supply and demand works, and that my lack of milk production was because I didn't pump enough, even though I was pumping every chance I got and trying desperately to keep up my supply. She then decided that my breasts were too large for the standard flanges provided. Believe me, that is the first and probably last time anyone has told me that MY very modestly sized breasts were too large for ANYTHING.So she sent me larger flanges, and smaller ones just for kicks, and new valves and new silicone diaphragms. Tried all that, didn't help. I was getting more and more stressed out as my milk output dwindled. But this whole time, my baby seemed to be getting plenty to eat while I was home nursing her. I just couldn't even come close to replacing what she'd eaten while I was away.One night the pump just wouldn't turn on. I was relieved that I finally had some concrete evidence that something was wrong with the pump. A few minutes later it did turn on, and as usual it took me about 20 minutes to get an ounce total from both breasts. In frustration, I got out my old manual pump and in about 10 more minutes had pumped 5 more ounces from ONE breast! Ok, so the problem was not me. When I called customer service and told them about how much milk I'd been able to get with the manual pump to illustrate that my milk supply was fine, the lady replied, Well, you're always going to get more milk with a manual pump! Really? That much more? Then what's the point?? Anyway, the fact that the pump had not turned on entitled me to a new pump motor. This one worked slightly better than the previous one, but the difference was so slight that after a couple of days of trying, I switched back to using my manual pump exclusively.I don't know what's wrong with the design of the Ameda Purely Yours but it just. doesn't. work. Other than that I hate it, I do have some more specific comments. The white valve (the most delicate part) can't be removed by hand. You have to pry it out with something else. I use the blunt end of silverware when I'm at home and scrounge around for a makeshift tool when I'm not. My Lansinoh manual pump's valve has an extra lip designed to be grabbed and pulled without damaging it. Something I never noticed before experiencing the inconvenience of bad design. As some other users have commented, the fastest setting is the same speed as the baby's normal sucking, so there's no way to make it go as fast as the baby's initial sucking to get a good letdown. That's IF the pump even gives you any suction at all.	
- 1	I had another support belt with my first pregnancy and this one fails to support much at all.  It makes little to no difference therefore I will be returning it.  Going to look for one that is mostly elastic like my first one. I was able to make it real tight and feel very supported.	
1. 	As all us parents know, sippy cups are a very personal purchase.  Each kid seems to have his or her favorite brand / style.  My guy always liked Nuby, but he does fine with these as well, for the most part.Pros:-Easy to clean (machine washable)-Spills kept to a minimum-Lightweight-$5 for 4 - nice price!-My just-turned-3 year old likes these cups a lot-Withstands gnawing pretty well (much better than soft spout sippies)-Fits well in standard cup holders-Cute designsCons:-Top does not screw on, just presses on - so my guy can get the top off and then the liquid spills everywhere-Top can also pop off if thrown in a bag, so just be careful	
- 1	I'm beyond sad.  I love these bibs.  They are the only ones I've found that don't leak drool onto my LO's clothes, but I just discovered the red one bled all over one of my LO's best white outfits.  (I did prewash the bibs and he wore it one other time over a black shirt so it's been washed at least twice before bleeding) I'm hoping it will wash out, but I'm not holding my breath.  I haven't noticed a problem with the other colors and I have the boy and girl color set.  (I haven't used the pink girl ones though.) I'll still continue to use these bibs, but I might look harder for another waterproof absorbent bib if I were to buy more.  (Though, I'm not sure if there is anything else out there.)My other complaint about these is that the velcro closes in the middle.  I much prefer bibs that move the velcro over to the side so it is not right behind the baby's head and it's easier to get on and off.	
1. 	very colorful, arrived brand new, adorable for baby boys or girls. Will look great in my baby shower gift baskets i make.	
- 1	There was a lot I didn't like about this product. The main problem was that upon opening the package, I attempted to unsnap the waist snaps on it, at which point two of them immediately flew off into oblivion, rendering the product completely useless and depositing a few tiny pink choking hazards on my floor.Even so, I attempted to put an insert in the pocket, out of curiosity. I had read many reviews on the product, and a frequent complaint was that the pocket was too narrow to put anything in it. This is true. Literally. I can't even fit my hand in there to deposit the insert, let alone my hand AND an insert.If you're looking for a worthwhile product, Sunbaby makes some great pocket trainers.	
1. 	We installed a mobile and the paint scratched off almost immediately. The mobile hardly got any use, In fact, the crib was in our nursery and our baby slept in our room in a pack and play so I was surprised the mobile scratched the paint. Other than that it's a great crib.	
- 1	It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)	
1. 	These are a must have for potty training mommies.  Keep them in your purse, glove box, change of clothes bag, desk drawer, etc.  They put your mind at ease when creating a germ-proof barrier between body and filthy toilet seats.  The four star rating is due to the difficulty in QUICKLY removing the adhesive strips. This takes some time which sometimes lead to accidents with an urgent toddler.P.S. Great for adults too...in case, one day you really need to sit! (smile)	
- 1	Great bottles when used with nipples, terrible design with the sippy cup attachment.  Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning,  and they always are being cleaned.  I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple, valve free! sippy cups. They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store.  They have them in 3 sizes , with handles and they don't leak!  EVER!  When making the purchase do it right the first time.  Not like me 4 sets later :o(	
- 1	This shade will not stick to a car window that is even slightly cold, which pretty much renders it useless. After carefully trying to make it stick dozens of times, I realized it was a lost cause. Not to mention, if we do finally get it to stick, our 11 month old daughter can reach up and yank it right off.	
1. 	My son is getting around pretty good now and I wanted to be able to contain him a little.  I put this with the extension kit around his Laugh and Learning Home by Fisher Price and he is able to play while I get a few chores done.  It is open enough that he does not feel too confined and seems quite content to play in it for a while.  A good purchase that can be used in multiple ways.	
1. 	Got this for my daughter (shes 2).  I like it real well.  She is a smaller child and it fits pretty good.  She can sit on it and on feel like she's going to fall in.  I would recommend this to others.  I also got the step stool. She likes to run over to the sink and wash her hands when she's done....The step is nice too.BabyBjorn Safe Step - White(I got the pink one to match her seat)It stays put and is sturdy.	
1. 	Ultimately, nothing works better than the disposables, but these are the best reuseables I've purchased. I do still leak through them from time to time so I only use them in the house. They are also great for comfort.	
1. 	This sling is the best! I have 2 of them and I use both all the time. I have been using it since my son was 3 months old. He is now 6 months old. I can put him in it in multiple positions and breast feed him in it when walking around. I get lots of compliments and people askng me where I got it. If its raining out I put him in the sling and the umbrella keeps us both dry and baby warm. I can't say enough good things about this sling.	
- 1	Despite the negative reviews, I figured I would try these for our 6 month old during our road trip. If your baby can feed from stiff, plastic nipples, then these might work for you. We were lucky we brought two of our regular bottles with us, just in case. Our 6 month old could not feed from these, not from lack of trying, either.	
1. 	simple and works well. It can be hard for adults to pull out when you want to use your plug, but I guess that also makes it hard for babies which is the point	
- 1	I ordered this item and returned it. I couldn't figure out why my 18 month old wouldn't drink from this...until I tried to drink from it myself and realized that it's VERY difficult to get anything through the straw. I would recommend the Munchkin straw cups instead. Much easier.	
1. 	Was a gift and they love it.  Easy to use. All wipe brands fit nicely inside.  Temperature remains constant. Good value and makes a welcome gift.	
- 1	Looking for a quality liner. These aren't the best. Wish they were thicker and held more. Would not buy again.	
- 1	This is getting good reviews and I don't see why? First of all it has the snack tray underneath the regular tray and it is too close to the child. It leaves no leg room. My son actually, scratched his leg on it and he hates when I put him in it. We have had it for about 6 months and the bigger he gets the less leg room he has. It is also easy to pinch their fingers when putting the big tray on. When I had the seat in a lower position he could bump his head on the side bar thing that is used for adjusting the height. It is a very dangerous chair. And I should return it since I am so unhappy with it. I hate everything about it except the seat is a nice large size. But, the legs are wobbly when the seat is extended to the top position. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HIGH CHAIR!! IT ALSO NEEDS MORE TOYS TO APPLY IF NEEDED. THE LITTLE POT IS OVER TO THE SIDE AND DOESN'T SERVE MUCH OF A PURPOSE FOR ENTERTAINMENT. MAYBE GOOD FOR CEREAL BUT THAT IS ALL!! AT THIS PRICE THEIR SHOULD BE SOME BELLS AND WHISTLES....	
1. 	This chair is great as my 4 month old loves it. Baby was born preemie so we are still working on holding head up constantly and he loves to sit up. We put the Boppy pillow on back of chair for extra support and it works well. Once he fully has head control, this chair will be even better. The seat is deep, leg openings are good (though may be an issue when he gets chunkier...he is 12lbs now). The seat back is high which I prefer. Easy to clean. All in all, a great investment for our little one.  Please watch your baby in the chair and leave on the ground....my little one squirms and can rock chair a little bit...I'm betting stronger/older babies can tip this w no problems.	
- 1	I have been cloth diapering my fifth daughter since she was three weeks old.  She is now seven months old.  Thus far, i have only used grovia aio's, gerber flats and these osocozy flats.  My favorite of the three is the gerber flats.  These osocozy flats are absorbent but they are a difficult size for me to fold.  I can't do the origami fold b/c of their very nonsquare shape.  Kite fold is out too b/c of their shape.  I prefer to fold them into a prefold style.  My biggest issue with these flats is the big honkin' hem on two edges.  Okay, so it isn't such a big honkin' hem...but it is big enough to be uncomfortable, i think.  PLUS, the edges that are not hemmed wrinkle up after laundering.  I line dry and THEY STILL WRINKLE.  Grrr!  Gerber flats are serged on the edges.  Gerber flats are easier to fold.  Yeah, they're smaller.  But, i just stuff 'em with the doublers that came with my grovia aio's and, voila...a perfect diaper!	
1. 	I think my title explains this product perfectly. My 2 month old has slept 8 hours during the night for the past 3 nights and he's been consistently at 6-7 hours before that. I had a size smaller first and then upgraded to the larger size. He easily sleeps in it in his crib with no issues. Occasionally, he'll pop an arm out, but it's usually b/c I didn't secure the flaps tight enough. GREAT!!!	
- 1	This looked great on Amazon and I read the reviews before buying two of these SwaddleMe fleeces. If you have a wriggly baby, or one that has strong limbs - then don't buy this product. My baby at 2 weeks was pushing his way free. I was also given a couple of other velcro type swaddles, none of them worked. Finally I tried the Miracle Blanket. That is the ONLY swaddle that keeps a baby properly contained. We have only just stopped using it (baby is 4 months) because he has managed to work his fist out to suck and pacify himself each morning, which I believe is a sign that he's ready to graduate to just a sleep sack. Just beware that these swaddles are expensive, so go with one that you know will work whether you have a more passive baby or not - the Miracle Blanket. No buttons, no velcro, just well positioned inner flaps for the arms, a pouch for the legs (which is separate from the arm flaps so you can change the diaper without undoing the entire swaddle) and then much longer flaps that wind around him and tuck in on the edge. They also do well in the washer/dryer. Hope this helps a bit!	
1. 	I used to be one of those people who would cringe when I saw somebody with their child on a leash like a pet, I swore I would never be one of 'those' parents.Well...needless to say my mind was changed by a very active toddler who loves to run and doesn't like to listen.  I got one of these to take with us on our road-trip so that at every rest stop when we got out to stretch our legs I could actually let my daughter run and get some exercise and burn off some energy without having to hold onto her or carry her.  The harness allowed her some freedom but within limits and she learned very quickly how to walk with me while it was attached to her.It was super-easy to use and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has to take an active toddler someplace where you know they're going to want to run but can't have total freedom.	
- 1	What I like:- There is a detachable hood. I wish all non-wrap/sling carriers and covers came with hoods! Hoods provide privacy and quiet in addition to warmth & weather protection.- It is easy to snap the cover on over the carrier straps.- The foot pocket is not large, but it is slightly adjustable and is better than no pocket.What I don't like:- The snaps that attach the cover to your carrier's straps are not secure! Mine may be defective, but one of the cover's snaps won't stay closed with a light tug, and the other is better but still somewhat easy to detach.- The material is incredibly flimsy. Hoodie makes it sound like a nice cozy sweatshirt- it isn't. This is very thin material... You get what you pay for.The faulty snaps make this impossible to use. In the event that mine is defective, I would only recommend this for very mild weather where you either need a hood or a little extra leg protection. The idea is excellent- it's execution that is flawed.	
1. 	I own 8 of these trays and love them.  I make 100% of my baby's food and couldn't do it without these trays.  They're awesome and have stood up to countless washings.  I recommend them to all my baby food making friends.  They're also good for freezing breast milk cubes - which I use in a mesh feeder for my son when he's teething.	
1. 	I bought these to go with a baby food maker so that I could make my own baby food for my son. These trays work perfectly!! Just like an ice cube tray, I let them sit out for about 5 mins, the twist and the cubes pop out. I haven't had any problems with the lids like others had either. Mine have fit every time. I make a good amount of food at a time, so I don't leave food in these for the long term-for that I use freezer of vacuum seal bags. I have only hand washed them, so wonder if some of the other issues have come from the heat in the dishwasher....Would HIGHLY recommend!! Just wish I had more!!	
- 1	I'm kinda lazy. These looked like they would be easy to install (they were) and the other prettier type looked more worky. These looked ugly in the picture, but since I'm willing to admit I'm lazy, I decided I shouldn't be judgmental.They look even worse in real life, though.I have had no problem with the adhesive coming off, an issue that other reviews raised. I did let them cure for a full 24 hours before using as well as applied as much pressure as I could when first installing and again whenever I thought of it or walked by. They are stuck for certain.Our problems with them are they are not really intuitive and take practice when activating one handed, a common need when trying to access cabinets. Once you get the hang of it it's not overly complex and like anything else, it becomes easier when muscle memory kicks in. Visiting relatives are very annoyed by them though, and while their mild irritation always amuses me, you may not consider guests being frustrated a plus. Especially if they are helping you put away dishes or throwing out trash.Bigger than these minor issues are that 2 of the 8 installed have broken latches for a whopping 25% failure rate--not accounting for several of them almost never being used. One of the failed is the all-important under the sink cabinet that gets both the most use and has the messiest treasure for the baby to get into.I reluctantly ordered what I imagined would be the tiny-screw-that-just-won't-cooperate-and-ends-up-bouncing-accross-the-floor-and-rolling-under-the-dishwasher-causing-me-to-scream-in-fury-toward-the-clouds-type here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ADY35GO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_5To my lazy delight they were super easy to install, use and they don't look like a hot mess. I wish I got those ones first and skipped these straps entirely.	
- 1	Pros:- Excellent picture quality- Great color and night vision- Both units operate on battery, with some power saving options built in.Cons:- Super janky design.  Camera unit is white, monitor unit is a pale, hospital yellow.  Yuck.- Camera unit has a 2-3 inch &#34;tale&#34; sticking out (which I think is the microphone), which is only shown in 1 of the many marketing photos.- Battery covers were VERY hard to remove.- Monitor settings are VERY confusing and not well explained, even in the detailed operating manual (which was not included in the box, I had to go the website to get the PDF.)	
1. 	Great bib for drooling baby! My little guy soaks the bib but because of the middle part his clothes stay dry and I only need to change for another bib, not the whole outfit. I let them air dry instead of in the dryer since a friend said hers got ruined after drying in the dryer.	
1. 	These are not fancy, but they do the job.  They're clear and are very easy to install.  They fit snugly so little ones can't remove them but we (the adults) haven't had any problems taking them off as needed.  One pack covered our whole house.	
1. 	I used this the entire time I was pregnant. It worked really well and gave me a lot of support on my back. One bad thing I didn't realize is that it doesn't come with a cover. So there was no way to wash it if it got dirty since it's too big for the washing machine. Also, it ripped at the end within the first month. I didn't bother to repair it and it didn't rip more.	
1. 	I sit on the floor with my baby while she sits in the bumbo.  It has all the new safety straps, but if you are sitting on the floor and attending to your baby while she is in it, there is no reason to worry or use them.  If you are looking for a chair to keep your baby busy while you do chores around the house this is NOT the chair.  Great chair just follow the safety instructions.	
1. 	A friend bought this for me when my daughter was a month old.  At first I was nervous about putting her in it.  She seemed to look lost in it.  Then I realized it had snaps on it to make it different sizes.  Once I adjusted it properly, my daughter loved it.  I love it too.  She is now 2 months old and I can put her in it while I am cleaning the house, washing dishes, doing laundry.  Anytime I have work to do and she wants to be held, I reach for the carrier.  I have used it in the mall too.  When she fusses in her carriage, I throw the carrier on and she faces me and usually falls asleep.  It does have a lot of hooks.  It took me a couple of times around the house to get used to how to use it.  But once I got the hang of it, I can now put it on and get her in more quickly.  My daughter weighs 11 pounds now and I am only 5'2, it doesn't hurt my shoulders or back at all.	
- 1	UPDATE:Almost 2 years in and the monitor is broken. First the picture faded, but motorola replaced the unit, but The new unit's battery basically died after 6 months, so we had to keep it plugged in. Not a huge deal, but one would think that it would last longer than a year. But now the on/off button is broken and the product is out of warranty. It was good while it lasted, but it just didn't last.We live in a small apartment, so I can't comment on the range, but this monitor works perfectly. The picture is very clear-- yes I can see my baby breathing if I stare at her long enough (and yes, I do stare at her long enough!). And there's no static. Pricey, but worth it, I think.Update: we had this monitor for less than a year before the picture started to degrade. To motorola's credit, they sent us a replacement right away. We now turn the screen  off before we go to  bed because I'm sure keeping it on for so many hours is what killed it.  But now the battery on our new unit lasts only about 30 minutes.	
- 1	We have this sponge for our baby and thought it would be good for sponge baths in the first few weeks but he hated it.  It was itchy and very thin.  I wouldn't want to lay on it with no clothes on either.  I ended up ditching the cushion and folding up a big beach towel, it seemed more comfortable for him.  The cushion also wasn't very long, our son was 20 inches when he was born and was already a bit to big for it.	
1. 	I got this tub party because I thought I would use for my newborn and when he got older. It didn't exactly work out that way, but I am still glad I bought this tub. The best feature about it is the NEWBORN HAMMOCK. It clips on both ends of the tub and helps newborns to feel secure and helps parents to wash the baby easier. Since you know they are secure in the hammock, you don't have to worry about them slipping under water or slipping out of the tub. Now that my son is older (7 months) we have upgraded to a bath ring. Once he started sitting up, the tub seemed too confining. But if you have a child that is scared to be in the 'big tub' this tub would be a good transition tool. The BEST tub for newborns and that to me makes it worth buying. Also the hammock can be put in the washing machine and the foam pads on the tub are mold resistant.	
- 1	We currently own two Lorex WL2002W purchased in 2009. They are a bit outdated, and we've had issues with one set, but we still love their monitors.~~>What's to like about the new Lorex BB2411:- Good quality picture during the day.- Zoom feature is a nice touch.- Music options are soothing.- Speaker feature is useful.- Camera is solidly designed on a steady base with lots of position options.- Monitor is small and easy to carry around.- Can pair with multiple cameras.- Room temperature displayed on monitor (off by a few degrees, but works well).- Battery life is absolutely amazing!!~~>What's not to like about the Lorex BB2411:First, I have to say that I really wanted to like this camera. I was ready to use it exclusively and discontinue using our Lorex WL2002W set. I have two little boys sharing a room, so I need two cameras pointed at each bed, which also ends up giving us coverage of 80% of their room. Since I am currently using both cameras, I can tell you about several limitations that have changed my mind:- Murky-grainy picture quality at night. The image is *very* poor compared to the Lorex WL2002W.- Zoom feature is nice, but I never use it. I prefer a panning option.- Speaker is useful, but it has a bit of a delay. When you depress the button to talk and then release, you might clip something you said. You need to speak slowly into the monitor. It also sounds a bit strange. One morning I used this feature to ask my oldest son to come downstairs. My son was thrilled thinking his less than 2 year old brother, who was sitting in his crib beside him, was talking to him!! :) I wish the audio was crisper, like a real speaker system.- Monitor is small, but without a kickstand or cradle. The base of the monitor works as a stand but it's easy to tip over with a loud crash. The monitor is also one that has to be seen at just the right angle. So sitting up and looking at it on a nightstand doesn't work. You have to pick the monitor up, or bend down. The Lorex LW2002W is crystal clear and can be seen from any angle!- Picking up sound the quality is horrible. The kids sleep with a white noise machine, if I turn up the sound I get a static sound that cuts in and out like there's interference, and I can hardly hear if my son is talking or moving around and awake. BUT, the sound quality on my Lorex LW2002W is fantastic! I hear the constant hum of the white noise machine but I can still hear all of the little noises my sons make when they are awake. Again, this is with both cameras in the kids room, and both monitors side by side in our room. The quality is significantly different.- One of the biggest downsides of the Lorex BB2411 is its range. The range is said to be 450 feet, but even with the antenna up I can barely step out the backdoor of a small townhouse without loosing range. The best reception I get is in our room, or downstairs right below the kids room. Still, the monitor beeps to tell me it's OUT OF RANGE. The constant beeping is the most annoying thing about this monitor. I was happy the new monitor didn't beep at every button pressed like the Lorex LW2002W, but it now constantly beeps even at night in our bedroom. I don't mind that it cuts in and out on occasion, I figure interference is messing with it - but please, don't keep beeping at me! With no option to change this I have to leave the camera off and turn it on when I want to see something. I'm thinking of contacting Lorex about this, they have really good customer service that I've used a couple time on warranty for a camera that stopped working properly, (I had to pay shipping to get it to them, but they covered everything else).Not impressed with this camera. I thought the new features, updates, and innovations would automatically make it better than our 4 year old monitor. Sadly, I'm better off using the older monitors. I used the new monitor for a solid month before writing this review.UPDATE: I'm starting to feel that I have a defective camera. If my son wakes and starts talking the sound cuts in and out so much I can't understand him. Still not getting good reception. Ugh. Such a disapointment.	
- 1	Great idea, it is a must have for newborns and especialy  for new moms who are nerveous with the first baths- as I was. I had this sponge and the frog shaped green sponge ( don't remember who's the manufator). Although this one is bigger - and that's an advantage, it got black disoloration (nothing spilled on it and it is not mold) after only a few times we used it. It didn't come off  in the wash and although it didn't smell or anything I didn't want to use something that looked dirty for my daughter's baths. It did not happen to the green sponge, which I would reccomend.	
1. 	This blanket makes swaddling easy and my baby sleeps great in it!  We bought a second one so we will always have a clean one on hand.  It is a nice, soft, sturdy fabric with just the right amount of give and the pink is a nice baby pink.  The only negative is that we have a very tall baby and at 2 1/2 months she is already too long for her legs to fit in the leg pocket.  But we are still using the miracle blanket without swaddling her legs and she is sleeping just as well.  Highly recommend this blanket!	
1. 	My experience with these bottles was overall great. The newborn starter set is a great way to get the bottle feeding chore done without all the drama of buying all individual pieces in separate packaging! You will of course need several more bottles in addition to this set, the more the merrier. The nipples are changeable for when your baby gets bigger and needs more flow to eat. I like that the bottoms come off as well as the tops, this makes for easier cleaning. In my opinion, when it comes to bottles, many moms have their own idea of which type is best, i feel that this is a bottle worth consideration by the first time mom, as well as the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time mom.However, I recommend buying ONE to begin with, then buying this set if you liked the one. i know this is hard to do, but it could save you some money. There were several different bottles i had received as gifts, that just didn't work for me, and they went wasted with no use from me. =/	
1. 	My wife and I got this as a gift for our second child. We really like this a lot, especially if you believe in white noise helping a baby sleep.  We live in a noisy environment (daytime hours), so this is helpful in putting the baby down for a nap.Besides the softness and cute design of a sheep, it is designed well because it is easy to 'install' on a crib or play-yard.  The noise selections are great as is the timer option.  Our newborn is sleeping in our room right now, and we even appreciated the noise.We like this so much, we would give it as a gift in a heartbeat.	
1. 	We got this gate plus two extensions, one for either side, almost a month ago for our triplets who just turned a year old. We were concerned at first if the extra extensions would be able to support the three babies sufficiently. It does! The only downfall, which I've seen mentioned a few times before, is that the available width space doesn't match up with what the gate says it can support. So if you get this and are running to the border of width, add that extra extension for sure so it's not wobbling. And after measuring and you think using the gate with both extentions will just barely fit, try it, but more than likely it will be wobbly a bit. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, this is a great gate! We have the added baseboards along the bottom of our walls plus the tiny toe boards and because this is all pressure mounted it adjusts great. Just take your time and get things even and straight. It doesn't take long to set up, 15-20 minutes tops. It works great for us since we live in military base housing and want to avoid putting holes in the walls to fill in later. It's odd at first to get used to the foot petal but once you get used to it, it's a lifesaver! We have the Clear View Gate on the playroom which we love but for the kitchen doorway we needed something wider and more convenient with the smaller swing door since we use the kitchen more. The bar on the bottom took only a couple days to get used to and with the ramps on either side it helps with not tripping. The gate swings either way which helps too! Sooo worth the money since these things can be used for years!	
1. 	I put this by the bassinet when I put my baby down for naps or for the night and it's awesome.  It has 4 great settings: flowing water, ocean waves, mom's heartbeat, and whale songs.  I love the mom's heasrtbeat for my son.  It really soothes him and keeps him relaxed when I put him down.  I woudl recommend this to anyone with an infant.  It's a real lifesaver.  I may have to by the travel size as well for when we visit family.  It's a must have.	
- 1	After reading the glowing reviews for this mobile, we were really excited to put it on our baby's crib.  When we received it, we found out that the music box portion which needs to be mounted on the side railing of the crib, doesn't fit!  We don't have a fancy crib or anything, but like many of the other cribs we've seen in the store, ours has a thicker (er.. taller) top railing all the way around, but it is by no means elaborate or huge or anything like that.  The music box can't be mounted on any top railing that is taller than approximately 2.5 inches.  REALLY wish that Amazon's description had stated this information so people can know that it won't fit before they have to buy it and go to the trouble of returning it etc.... but to be fair to Amazon, I even went to Tiny Love's website and did not find the same info.  You basically have to buy it and see if it will fit your crib.	
- 1	I have owned this set for about 6 months when today my 11 month old son was chewing on the coolin droolin teether in the set and it was leaking the fliud in his mouth! This is supposed to be made to be chewed on! I'm not sure how toxic the water in it is, but its still shouldn't leak. No matter what is in there I don't want my son drinking it! I have contacted Sassy so hopefully they will do something about it! Very dissappointed!*Update: I contacted Sassy, and after apologizing, they assured me that it was only distilled water inside and that they don't use anything harmful in their products. They replaced it free of charge. I am happy with the way they handled it, but I wish it would've never happend. It wasn't worth the worry, and trouble. Unfortunately I cannnot change my star rating but it would only go up to 2 stars.	
1. 	This bag is okay. It is a little bigger than I planned, but it will do the trick.  It fits all that one would need for a day.  It is perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.	
- 1	This didnt last two weeks and it scratched my bottles which I was so upset I threw it out! Very poorly made and poor quality	
- 1	I got this for my  3m old son. Although it seem to fit his body fine, he wasn't able to sit up by himself without assistance. I thought by the 5th month when he should be, it probably won't fit his body so it's not very practical. Also because he is long in height, he seem like he will tip over easily even with the straps on. I didn't feel comfortable him using this without any supervises so I would not recommend this	
1. 	I used these bottles with my first son and would have given them about 3.5 stars. I would be the first to tell you if they were not fixed just right they would leak. After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn't leak a bit. The new nipples have the words Extra Soft on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.	
- 1	When I registered, I was told that this was an essential item. To be blunt, it's not. Once we transitioned my son into the crib, he was increasingly mobile (approx. 3 months), so the whole idea of using a sheet saver kind of went out the window.In terms of quality, it looks pretty...For us, using a sheet saver ended up not making any sense logistically.	
1. 	I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet! Nonetheless, a few things I noted. First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured. They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it. That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow. Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides! The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head! The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at! Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat. I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review. On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!	
- 1	After playing around with theLevana Wireless Audio Baby Monitor with Sound Indicator LEDs (LV-TW100)I have it's not going to be a monitor that I keep using and here's why:The Bad1. Analog 400Mhz so it's easy for anyone with a scanner to listen in2. Although it has vox (voice operated switch which means that the transmitter only turns on with sounds of a certain loudness) it's not adjustable. So no listening to baby's breathing etc. Only fairly loud sounds will activate the transmitter. This may be a good thing for some folks but not for me since I want to listen in on whatever is happening.The Good1. Very small and portable2. Comes with AC Adapters for transmitter and receiver but these are 120v only so may not be appropriate for travelling to some countries3. Decent Range. Should be fine in most wood-frame North American housesAt $30 it's not a bargain by any means and you can probably get a better analog monitor like theSafety 1st Glow And Grow Baby Monitor, Whitefor about $5 less.	
- 1	I have some Ameda bottles from the pump but I couldn't find Ameda brand nipples. I bought nipples from different brands to see which one works best for my baby. This nipple creates too many bubbles and they dont go away. I stick with my wide neck bottles for feeding	
1. 	I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...	
1. 	Made in the USA! I love this bath!!! We were using a bath chair/sling type thing and I always felt that my daughter was going to slip out of it and into the tub so I was constantly readjusting her. And forget my husband trying to bath her...that was just not going to happen. I love this tub and so does my daughter. She loves that she can sit up and not slip and slide around. Her toys all stay within her reach and in front of her. I love that it is filled with beads instead of an air filled tub. I have never had problems with mildew or any strange smells. We rinse it off with the shower nozzle after her bath and hang it from the shower curtain rod to dry. It is always dry by the next day. It was definitely worth the price!	
1. 	These are great puzzles for helping kids learn their shapes and learn how to put puzzles together.  There are several 2 and 3 piece puzzles in the bucket and each shows pictures of things that are the same shape as the puzzles.  The bucket is great for storage and transportation.	
1. 	Easy to use. I like being able to pump right into the bags. Just make very, very, very sure the seal is closed. It's sometimes hard to tell. I wish they were more ecofriendly but otherwise they do the job well.	
- 1	I wanted a better mattress in the pack and play.  This is not a snug fit for it. If thats what you want don't buy this.  Otherwise it seems ok.Editing to add that this is def. not a good mattress to put in your pack and play especially once your children start moving.  I am having to take it out because there is a gap down the side as it is not quite large enough.  My boy got his arm trapped down there when he rolled on his belly and got himeself stuck.  This should NOT be used in a pack and play.It is now going to be a bed for my cocker spaniels.	
1. 	These are a great price (2 pack!) and cling fine to the window. They go on and off easily, and can even stick back on the window decently after a toddler grabs hold and crumples it into a sticky ball (tip - don't let a 2 year old watch you install it at first... he thinks it is a sticker). HOWEVER, I cannot see out of the rear driver side window of our small SUV with this on the window when trying to merge into traffic looking over my shoulder; we are just using it on the other side.	
- 1	I originally owned the my little lamb swing with batteries, which worked well. With my second child I wanted to upgrade to the model that plugs into an outlet because I was sick of changing the batteries. The platinum edition cradle n' swing is very noisy and turns into almost a game with my husband and I of who can position it just right so that it makes the least amount of noise. It becomes quite frustrating when the thing you are using to get your baby to sleep makes so much noise that it wakes the baby up.  It seems like this thing is cheaply made and the swinging motion causes it to creak.  Adjusting the legs around, pushing down on the motor part and other random tricks seem to make it quiet temporarily.  For the price, I would expect it to work better.	
- 1	I do not own this tub, but used it for a week when I was visiting my girlfriend who has it.I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a shower like this one. And, although it's a great idea, when I tried out this tub at girlfriend's, I didn't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well as others (which I've found to be SO much more important then a shower)My daughter was 4 months at the time, and was too big for the net (her legs had no where to fit) but without it, there is no recline option, just plain basin tub, which was difficult because she could not yet sit. It ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash. I was also dissapointed with the shower as it was diffucult to get or keep running, and was not more then a few trickles. My girlfriend said she and her husband have taken it apart and tried everything to improve upon the shower, but they have had little success with it too.Perhaps if they improve upon the actual tub design, or make a better shower we could have the best of both worlds. Until then, hands down, Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub (or a similarly shaped tub) has my vote!	
1. 	We use summer infant swaddle me for our baby girl, but her twin brother wasn't so fond of them for some reason.  So we got htis miracle blanket.  He likes this one quite a lot.  When we sit him on it, he'll hold still with his little arms down by his side ready for us to tuck the little flaps in and wrap him up.  He CAN squirm an arm or even both arms up out of it, but rarely does (and maybe he likes it more because of that possibility?).  He's 12 weeks now and we've stopped swaddling, but used this wrap from 3 weeks-10 weeks old.  It washed up great and was definitely worth the buy.	
1. 	My daughter loves to do everything she can to make her sippy cups leak and make a huge mess.  After I opened these to test them out, the first thing she did was turn it over and start shaking it....and NO LEAKS.  Hallelujah!	
- 1	If ur like me you think oh, so a couple people just got bum models. Mine wont be. Well, maybe you will be one of the lucky ones but if you do open ur box and find the pump to be so weak after 5 minutes of pumping u get a couple drops, this item is NOT returnable! The sticker on the box when you open it says so. I still plan however on calling the manufacturer to raise hell. i will update this if anything changes. But for me, i was looking for a pump to use for making my own baby food when a recipe just calls for a tablespoon here or there or for pumping at night now that my infant is sleeping thru so i would not have to drag out electric pump. Maybe if your engorged it will work... so disappointed...	
1. 	Purchased for my nephew in 2009.  The booster seat was easy to carry along with to restaurants during family outings.  Used at home, you could change the tray easily by adding the different covers to the main tray.  No longer used since my nephew grew out of it, but useful when originally purchased.	
1. 	Love it, I have this additionally to my MEDELA FREESTYLE which I now can keep at my office and still pump occasionally at home with the manual pump.Sometime I think I'm even quicker with this manual pump but then if zou have to pump both breasts anyway, it's still quicker with teh double electric pump.Love the stand that comes with it. I also think it's very easy to clean.	
1. 	We tried every tub for newborns out there, then I decided to use this to give my newborn a bath.  You can't fill it with water, but it does hold water as you clean the baby, and it's very light and water repellent (so you just lift it and pour the water out when you're done), and small enough to fit on the counter next to the sink.  I was able to lay him down on the soft surface and clean him all over without any tears!  (I cleaned and dried it immediately, and never had any problems.) But because he wouldn't be covered with water, I turned the bathroom heater on 5 mins before bathtime so he wouldn't get cold.  It may not work for everyone, but for the first few months, it was a lifesaver for us, AND NO TEARS!!!	
- 1	According to 7th gen these are supposed to be the original wipes and not the new ones with all the chemicals but Amazon is sending the new wipes for this so it's the wrong wipes! When I ordered this I got the new thick rough ones with sodium benzoate and other junk!  Amazon has the the new wipes as anther item you can get but this specific item is supposed to be the old ones seventh generation brought back so don't order these until amazon fixes the problem!	
- 1	I hated this pillow. Like most pregnant people it's extremely difficult to get comfortable for sleep and I was so excited when I read the reviews. I really really wanted to love this pillow but it just did not work for me. It made me feel claustrophobic and even more uncomfortable. I've discussed this with other moms and they either love it or hate it. There's no in between. I think this is way overpriced and I'm so glad I waited to buy the cover for it because I would have wasted even more money. And the cover costs almost as much as the pillow.	
- 1	This monitor is pretty terrible. I bought it because it had good reviews but 3 friends who own this have all shared my experience. The main problem is it beeps all the time. I bought one with two hand sets and one we cannot even use because it beeps 100% of the time non stop even when plugged in. The other behaves most of the time while plugged in but when it is using battery power it also beeps all the time even when in the same room as the base (so not a distance problem). It is new so the battery is not old or anything, The other thing is at night even while plugged it it suddenly decides to beep from time to time waking me up even when my son is asleep. It has totally contributed to my lack of sleep with a newborn. I no longer use it and instead keep all the doors open so I can hear my son. I am now researching an alternative monitor to buy instead of this one. This was a huge waste of money.	
- 1	its cloth with NO support. It just hangs there and gravity takes over. slopes forward and down. Nothing like the picture. This product needs a solid plastic backing to hold form and on the sleeve parts. Its cardboard slips that do nothing to hold shape. Velcro strips dont stick even with super glue.	
- 1	Thanks to a certain airline which shall remain nameless, the canopy of our Kolcraft Tour Sport umbrella stroller (or lightweight stroller) was lost during an East coast trip.  A big floppy hat was the solution until I spotted this replacement, which has turned out to be a bit of a bust.Although it's nice and big, and does create a Conestoga-wagon-like tunnel of shade when attached to our stroller, it's really meant to extend an existing canopy, more than substitute for one, because of its size and shape.  It has an array of Velcro and tie straps that we sort out every time, and have to deal with when we fold the stroller, and the only way to really make a shade for our boy is to tie it through the side bars of the stroller, encroaching on his already pretty limited space.  These ties and the rather floppy (albeit framed) construction of the canopy itself are magnets for those curious little fingers, so the boy is constantly pulling at something or bending it or ducking under it, sitting on it, rolling over it, etc.  It makes keeping him shaded rather a challenge.This thing is, basically, a good concept but not quite adequately executed, if what you're looking for is a replacement canopy and not an extension.	
- 1	OK...I can see this be a fun and interesting to get kids to go on it and potty/toilet training but beside that nothing else is ok. The material is super cheap and its poorly made. The instruction say to put it on the actual toilet bowl not on the seat and I did just that and 3 minutes later my boy was in the toilet with the seat together screaming to get out. I have twin boys 2 years old and whenever they used it leaked 100%. I am sure girls will not have the same problem. I would not recommend this product.	
1. 	We picked up these flip locks for our front and rear door to prevent our toddlers from sneaking outside without supervision.  It's good way to install without permanently marring your door or trim.  The lock is easy to engage and disengage, and is strong enough to prevent 2 yr old egresses.On the down side, a forgetful adult may be able to break the lock, since it is not as beefy as a dead bolt.  This is strictly a preventer for children and not a security lock to prevent intruders.  For a child lock, it works well.4 stars only due to the finish - the painting coating will scratch/rub from the door running against it, and may require touchup.	
1. 	This gate was a replacement for the crappy Swing 'N Lock.  This gate is so easy to install.  The only problem was we have baseboards and couldn't use the template.  SO I simply measure 3 inches off the floor and then marked the holes to drill and folded the template to get the upper holes marked.  We did however have a lot of wall damage due to the fact that this was installed on the metal corner protectors under the drywall and a lot of the joint compound fell off due to disturbing it.  I will not fix it now since I'm sure I'll have more to fix later.  I like this gate because it has two point of contact in the locked and closed position.  Both rails the upper and lower fit about 1 1/2 inch into a metal seat.  This makes it so secure.  I don't agree w/ the other reviewers that said the lower rail pops out, I'm sure if it was installed WRONG.  Just make sure to measure properly and make sure things are even, level and line up and there is NO way the rail is going to pop out!  I did pinch myself a few times opening this the first few times.  You have to slide the rail in a bit to swing it and there's a metal piece on the top rail that supports the two gates, ouch.  Will remember not to do that!	
1. 	I loved these bottles. Never had one problem. No leaks, nada one. I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump. I only use these for baby water now, since I use larger bottles. 5 stars	
- 1	I thought this was going to be a great tool to keep my sanity. It's actually more hassle than it is worth. I only really used the feeding button but finding the device every time was annoying and I probably only used it for a total of 4 days before it became a decoration. Oh, the clip on the back broke also.	
- 1	Only just received this blanket so I can't comment on how it holds up but I think it's safe to assume it won't last too long. The seams were already falling apart upon receiving it in its package. I gave it 2 stars because it was after all only 9.99 and it is really soft but I am really unhappy with the silky material color. It's yellow I was expecting it to be more ivory or tan. The yellow doesn't match too well with the tan and cream fluffy side. But it was cheap and it will at least work for a little while. I just don't think I will be ordering anything from the same company again. Lesson learned.	
1. 	I don't know what everyone is writing about the music being too loud. I don't find it loud at all! There are two settings and the lowest one is perfect. My baby ADORES this mobile. The minute I hooked it up and put him in the crib to look at it, he couldn't contain himself. I wish I had gotten this much earlier than I did. Once I got it, I could suddenly take long showers and know he was being entertained, not crying, and totally happy for a while in his crib.He's 5 months old now, and just starting to get a little bit bored with it because he can't touch it.I *highly* recommend this mobile. The best baby toy I own, hands down.	
- 1	The purpose of this chair is to save the space a conventional chair would take up, but in my opinion, all it does it take away one of your regular chairs from your table & eat up space where the normal high chair would've gone. . .Once attached to a chair (& I've seen/used it on different types of chairs) it won't slide under the table, defeating the purpose of it NOT being a high chair.The reclining option is well, stupid.  Babies shouldn't learn to eat in a reclined position unless they have a physical delvelopmental delay that requires a little extra aid.  The bucket-seat style is more like a carseat & restricts arm movement in older babies.  Also, the idea of a cloth cover on a childs chair just means more to clean, you have to clean the cover & underneath.  Then there are tons of cracks & crevices for food to get stuck in.The Tray is HUGE, I have yet to find a dishwasher that it fits in.So if you're looking for an actual space-saver, try one of theFisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blueoptions.  I bought that one for my own after the trial-and-errors of using this one as a nanny.  The tray fits nicely in the sink for a quick hand-wash OR the dishwasher, The seat is simple, compact, & fits under the table.  It cleans nicely & it folds up if you need to take it with you.  A MUCH better option!	
1. 	My son and I both love this carrier. We tried quite a few different kinds and ended up sticking with the Baby Bjorn in Black/Pinstripe. The black with pinstripe inside is a very classic pattern and will pretty much match anything that you're wearing. It's also good for daddy since it's not a feminine color. It's also very easy to use! I put it on by sliding the shoulder straps on, then clipping the bottom of the straps to the body of the carrier. I then take my son and place him on my belly and then lift the carrier up in between his legs and hold it against his back. I then clip in the sides and then the top. Technically you're supposed to slide your child in once it's all clipped in but I find it easier to do it my way. I like the fact that you can wear your child either facing you or away from you. I use this carrier when I need to get things done around the house (or am cooking) and my son needs some cuddle time. It works great and I feel very confidant that he's secure in the carrier. I've also ditched the stroller and now go on daily walks with him in his Bjorn instead. Not only is it easy to go on walks, but he's much happier since he's cuddling with mommy (and eventually falls asleep) and I get a better work out since I'm carrying his extra weight. I highly recommend this carrier; it's a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it!	
1. 	This sheet is soft.  Fits our Graco pack-n-play.  I haven't tried other brands, so I can't compare the quality, but this one seems to be good.	
1. 	We have a white crib and the last set of these I bought (years ago) were discolored. These are clear, and look and fit great on our crib. You should definitely measure the width and thickness of the area you want to protect though. I know some people did not, and wrote poor reviews about it when it was clearly buyer error. Our son figured out how to remove the other ones we had, but not these. So far, our nice crib is saved, hopefully for baby #2.	
- 1	My little guy loves drinking out of cups.  I thought these would be perfect for him while learning.  They make just as much mess as an open cup though.  I was pretty disappointed because I love Avent products.  I still have them in the cupboard though just in case.	
1. 	I've seen these before, but never really gave them much thought. When I took my 15 month old son to the doctor for his latest check-up, they had a similar version of this in the office...he was absolutely enthralled with it. Since we had to go to Wal-mart afterwards, I figured I'd check to see if they sold something similar...that's where I found this (much cheaper I might add).For such a simple toy, my son just loves it. He's sitting in the middle of the living room playing with it as I type this. His favorite is the bead coaster on top, but he also really likes the abacus on the side. I absolutely recommend this toy (or even something similar if this particular one doesn't interest you). Even when he gets tired of it and moves on to something else, he always comes back to this cube. I'm VERY happy with this purchase.	
- 1	What a weird shape. The edges don't lay flat so wearing them in my bra is not my favorite look...they look like hockey pucks. I also have pretty small breasts, even for a nursing mom, so you would think the pads would always be in place but no. Often I have to rearrange the pad to cover my nipple during letdown and if I forget the milk soaks one side of the pad so thoroughly it leaks through. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.	
1. 	this is the second chicco capri stroller we bought. we bought the tangerine one for my son and this topazio one for my daughter (i don't like the pink one). its great, has decent storage for an umbrella stroller and paired with a sunshine kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, is great for drinks and snacks.the only complaint is that its kinda hard to use the latch to lock the stroller, you really have to press down hard on it.the  cover is a great idea, but honestly, in the year that we have had the stroller, we've never used it, as when we travel, we use it in the airport and check it in at the gate.i wish they came in more colors - like purple!	
1. 	This has been a fantastic purchase for us. We've been using it for several months now and it's been great. We use it all the time when we're out. Our son is currently 11 months, and we choose to use this over the booster seat since it's much more sanitary and he wiggles around a lot less. We also use it to feed him outside by just placing it on the ground. It's cheap, durable and easy to clean. I can't see a need to use any other booster seat.	
1. 	We registered for the Ocean Swing and the Link a doo swing. We received both for shower gifts. The boys immediately loved the mobile.  We now have a baby girl and we have passed it on to her.  It has held up through a set of triplets and is still going strong for our new baby.Whenever one of my boys were cranky or refused to go to sleep I would place them in the swing. Within 15 minutes, sound asleep. No baby can resist the side to side rocking action. This swing saved me many times when I was reaching the breaking point. This swing gives you those If I only had 20 minutes. I could actually get 45 minutes worth of stuff done.This swing gives you the option of swinging like a cradle or a regular swing. Since we had the other swing we left this one in cradle position.We have triplet boys and one of our boys would only nap in this swing. He refused to sleep anywhere else. He would cry and fuss till he was placed in this swing. We started weaning him off the swing when the weight limit started to draw near. It was a tough challenge but we did it.Not only was the weight limit an issue but as the boys got older, they would drop items over the side and lean over to try to pick them up. This is when we knew it was time to say good bye to our lifesaver.They seem to enjoy the mobile and light show. When they reached about 9 months they would grab for the items above. One of my sons was fascinated with the star and would follow it around and around and would cry when it went behind his head.The tray was a nice size and had a wavy bar with a few beads on it. We would clip link a doo toys on to the bar for more amusement.The swing takes D batteries. Go to BJ's and buy a case. We were going through 4 batteries a week. It may be because this poor little swing only rested at night. Since we had three infants the swing was working all the time. I wish there was an option to plug it in.As the batteries becomes weaker the light show goes first, then the mobile and then the swinging. There is no warning that the batteries are going but you can pick up on if the mobile is not working.The controls are on the top. You can choose various speeds for the swing. You can also choose, Mobile only, Light show only or mobile and lights. Then you can add music too. There is a couple of different sounds and music to choose from.There is a piece of material that holds the legs together and has pockets in the back. The pockets are great for putting burp cloths in. They are not that big for putting toys. They may fit some bottles.The legs do need to be spread apart and placed on a flat surface to get the full cradle swing. It does take up some floor space but can be pulled together and flatten when not in use.For the money this swing is worth it. I would highly recommend any of Fischer Prices dual Swings and Cradles.	
1. 	I have a portable crib mattress that measures 38 1/2 L x 24 W x 3 D (thick) and I wasn't sure if this was going to fit. I just received it and tried it on my mattress and it fits perfectly. If the mattress were bigger in any way it would be too small. I know some people with 5 inch width/thick mattresses have said that this will fit but I have to say I can't see how it would. I wouldn't order it for a mattress bigger than I have stated above. As for quality, it seems fine. My baby hasn't arrived yet so I cannot attest to its efficiency only its size.	
- 1	I thought this was going to work well, but it did not.  It is much like a play dough consistancy, difficult to get out of the packaging, and it did not hold my toddler's handprint very well.  I tried it three times and ended up tossing it.  The &#34;rolling pin&#34; stick can be used as a great drum stick, that is about all we got out of it.	
1. 	This product works but I'm not sure why it is so expensive for each individual lock. I'm looking forward to see what happens when we remove them.	
- 1	Being an engineer myself I was so excited to teach my daughter lessons in thermodynamics with this toy. In fact, you can imagine how thrilled i was when she figured out (by herself) that the little turbine cup not only runs with hydro power, but can also run with wind power (she started blowing into the cup to move the propeller). I would have rated it a 10-star educational toy. And then in less than a week the motor gave up just like so many other reviews said. I was so disappointed since both of us love this toy but it just to pricey to buy for such unpredictable quality.	
- 1	This is a good product for those free spirits who are organized enough to use it.  Maybe I  am too prudish, but I felt so stupid walking around with these things on that I cringed every time my husband walked into the room.  I have a friend that found this a Godsend, especially when she returned to work and had to pump.  Just not for me.	
- 1	I read the reviews on this item before I bought it so I knew it would be a 50/50 chance I would either like it or hate it.  I can't get it to stick on our tub walls.  Have tried a few things to help them stick with no luck.  It was inexpensive so glad I didn't spend any more than what I did on it.	
1. 	You can't really beat the value of these bibs. I could not find a decent (plain solid color) stack for this price anywhere in stores.We've used them with our 5 month old for couple of months now and I have no complaints.I wash them (pretreated with spray 'n wash for stains) along with my baby's clothing in cold water on gentle cycle in high efficiency washer and dry them on extra low heat setting dryer. Since we go through about all of them per day, these get washed at least every other day. None of them had fallen apart or started to show signs of wear. The only thing I wish this bibs had are a bit bigger neck opening. But it hasn't been a problem so far.Some reviewers say they are not very absorbent when it comes to large quantities of milk and other thick substances. These bibs are great for serious drools, catching clear liquids etc. but I believe no fabric will withstand projectile vomit because it's thicker in consistency. But as I stated, we use them for feedings and drooling and so far these have not let us down.	
- 1	I have tommy tippee pacifiers for my child & this pacifier keeper does not work with those pacifiers because they do not have a ring coming out of them to attach the keeper to. It may work well with others, but is useless for my pacifiers. The MAM clip & Cover pacifer keepr & nipple cover works MUCH better.	
- 1	My son has bathed with these toys since he was an infant. I wish someone had told me that exposure to latex (which is natural rubber) can make people develop a latex allergy. He now has a latex allergy at the age of two. I would not recommend these toys to my worst enemy.	
1. 	The corner pockets were perfect for nursing pads or pacifiers. The print looked just like the picture and I got a ton of use out of this product.A little overpriced and does not wash well around the boning.	
- 1	Elastic already came appart from the sheet. Have been using it for less than 2 months. I liked this sheet at first, now not so much. I thought it would last longer.	
- 1	I bought this thinking I would use it when coming home from the hospital with my newborn. I have a Graco Snugride 30 carseat and it wasn't compatable. The carseat was too narrow and deep. When I put the head support in the carseat it was so squished there was no room for baby's head! In the end, I didn't use it and just propped up my baby's head with a blanket or diaper cloth on one side. I'm sure it's great for some carseats, just not mine!	
1. 	I LOVE this product. I use it all day and all night to sterilize my bottles, nipples and breast pump accessories. I have never had one issue with it and I could not live without it. I'm a hard person to please but this product is amazing. Boiling everything took too much time and I hate the way the dishwasher makes everything smell. This little machine answered my sterilizing prayers.	
1. 	We love our Zanzibar set and have received many compliments on it. We washed the bumper, curtains, drapes and sheets and all came out great. There are some 'extra' accessories to this set, not all are carried by in the store at Babies R Us or are on Amazon..items such as the switchplate, hamper, photo frame.. Check on line for these items. We are pleased overall with this set and recommend it!!	
- 1	This is a bad, bad, bad design:1. It takes up a lot of floor space (21 x 29) when in use. Not ideal for small rooms.2. The tray does not slide on smoothly and often goes off-track when you are trying to side it in.3. The tray is poorly designed. There is an attached hard plastic piece that is designed to be straddled by baby's legs when it is in place. However, when the tray is slid in, it is easy to push the tray too far in and smoosh baby's crotch. Unpleasant. The same plastic piece prevents the tray from being set aside and laying flat somewhere for storage or just to set aside for a moment while putting baby in or out of the high chair.4. The chair is excessively HUGE. My 6 month old son is still too small to be buckled in snugly in this chair.I've seen a much better designed chair by Safety 1st. It is much easier to get baby in and out of the chair because of a much better tray and restraint design.	
- 1	We purchased these bottles for our primarily breastfed baby based on the wide based nipple and good reviews. His latch on the nipple mimics breastfeeding well, and he has been going back and forth between the bottle and the breast successfully since 1 week old.However, both my husband and I have found that because of the way milk pools between the inner and outer nipple, it is essentially impossible to feed the last 1/2 oz or so. Even when we let it drip back down into the bottle and then quickly invert it again--you just can't get that last bit of milk to stay in the inner nipple long enough for him to drink it.I'm not willing to sacrifice 1/2 oz of milk everytime we use a bottle. We have retired these bottles and are now much happier with Tommee Tippee.	
- 1	I bought this to hold my daughters spare 209340392843209423948 blankets (baby blanket - the ultimate baby gift?), and stuffed animals. Within -one day- the pockets holding the sticks that shape this thing ripped, and the sticks came out. Now, because they are ripped, the sticks just slide right out, and my daughter gets a hold of them, and the basket falls apart.. every single day. It ended up making more work for me, not less. It isn't worth the money. it isn't worth it if it was free. The only thing that is good about this is that it does have a very cute monkey on it.Also, it comes without a warning, so when I opened the package, it immediately expanded and whapped me in the nose.	
- 1	This was a bit of a pain to fill, but the real issue was that it broke after a few days.  There was a hole somewhere in the outer lining, so it didn't hold the air.  Too bad, becaue it's a cool concept.	
1. 	Our infant liked being swaddled until she was older and longer. She was about 4 months old before we were able to stop swaddling her (but she was a long baby). This swaddle fit her perfectly. She liked it and slept well in it.Now I use it by rolling it up tightly and tucking it into my diaper bag, it works for trips to the park when she had tummy time and now I can use it as a light blanket for her if we are out and it gets chilly. So it has been one of the most versatile blankets and well used blankets we have had.This is a great baby gift for yourself or a friend, because those initial receiving blankets only work for about the first 4 weeks of life, and then it seems the baby outgrows them, so those seem like a waste to me now.	
- 1	I have a toddler who just loves to sit in the refrigerator. After redirecting him from the refrigerator and many tantrums later I decided to get this refrigerator lock. I can't believe it has as many good reviews as it does. I wonder if people would update their reviews if they would feel the same way about it. We installed this Tuesday afternoon. By Thursday morning my son came up to me with the latch in his hand. The adhesive is poor. When I tried to reaatach it I could see why it so easily came off. My toddler does not have super human strength... it's a flimsy product. Don't bother. :-(	
1. 	Puts my baby girl to sleep everytime.  It's amazing, wrap her up in this thing and she goes right to sleep and will sleep ALL NIGHT!!!!!!  Very soft too and very warm	
1. 	I purchased this so my grandaughter could spend the night with me in my bed. My daughter helped me set it up. It was a little confusing at times but we set it up within 20 minutes and it is sturdy and safe. Very pleased!	
1. 	I own an Avent Manual breastpump and got it with a set of bpa free breastmilk containers, the ones with the blue cap. After almost 4 months using it, I got a Medela Pump in Style breastpump, and of course got a set of accessories and a set of this 80 ml containers. They are much better than the ones from avent, they don't leak at all and the material is a lot stronger. Besides, I love the fact that I have 150 ml and 80 ml, so if my baby is hungry after 150 ml, I don't have to use another 150 and waste most of it.I would definitely recomend it to any breastfeeding mom that likes to have a little backup of breastmilk just in case...	
1. 	THIS THERMOMETER IS QUICK AND ACCURATE.  IT IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE MONEY.	
1. 	We love this. Although it is a bit slow (about 15 minutes), it is very valuable when traveling.We bought this when on a roadtrip and have had no regrets.	
1. 	This is my travel bottle brush. As far as bottle brushes go, the brush part is fairly compact and the nipple brush is just a hard part of plastic--part of the end of the handle. This brush is simple and does the trick.	
- 1	Far to many holes in the cups to hold water!!!  Actually it's a pretty lousy bath toy overall since the cups don't stay linked together like shown in the picture (in fact, there are so many holes in the cups, the cups don't float well either).Find other water cups, promise you'll be happier than with this product.We have the cups I linked below and they are far better bath toy cupshttp://www.amazon.com/Stack-Count-Cups-8-pack/dp/B00005C5H4/ref=sr_1_10?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1325233510&sr;=1-10Stack & Count Cups - 8 pack	
1. 	Does its duty -- my 10-month old has been grasping at this and sucking his thumb since infancy.  I like the smaller, single-textured blankies, too, but it's kind of cool that this one has two tactile surfaces.  I like its neutral colors.  Very easy to wash, too.	
1. 	My husband and I just wanted a little backgroud noise for the times when one of us has to get ready while the other stills sleeps.  This product has been perfect for those occassions.  I do wish there were a specific white noise selection, but for the cost, this item is just right.  Some reviews indicated that it wasn't loud enough, but it is plenty loud for us.	
- 1	I have been using this crib for my daughter for about 5 months now. She is 10 months old but used the Monte bassinet for the first 5 months in my bedroom. After about two months of using this crib the paint started chipping off! I don't understand how a crib that has barely been used is already chipping. Invest in the Oeuf.	
- 1	I got this one as an extra for work so I didn't have to bring it back and forth; it was too firm and rigid for my taste, made the flanges pinch me no matter how much I loosened the thing, and was awkward to size and put on and off. I went back to the simple Medela one in less than a week.	
- 1	I purchased this Boppy Shopping Cart Cover to replace a lostFloppy Seat Ez Carry Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Blue ABC. I didn't want to spend another forty-something dollars to get another Floppy Cover, so I opted for the Boppy brand, which was substantially cheaper.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be another case of you get what you pay for.  The back side of this shopping cart cover is made of a smooth, nylon rip-stop fabric that's extremely slippery; plus, there's no snug-fitting elastic or fabric ties to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  As a result, it's extremely easy for my 2 year-old to pull the cover off the shopping cart handle and sides, exposing the germy surfaces I don't want her to touch.  The only thing attaching the cover to the shopping cart seat is the child safety belt, but that only takes care of 1 of the 4 sides of the cover.  The other 3 sides of the cover easily slide off the shopping cart seat on their own, or with the help of the curious hands of a toddler/preschooler.  Since the purpose of a shopping cart cover is to serve as a barrier between your child and the dirty surfaces of a shopping cart seat, this product is virtually useless.  I'm going to return this Boppy cart cover and pony up the extra $$ for another Floppy cover.Grade: D-	
- 1	I only used the MP3 player like twice.  After that it doesn't work.  It will randomly switch to MP3 mode sometimes if it's plugged in but does not switch on. It's very annoying because that's the whole reason I bought this and now it's too late to return!  I see others have had this same issue.  There are only a few songs and they aren't very good.  I would not recommend this product.	
1. 	My mother bought me this to help me sleep during my pregnancy. This is my first pregnancy so very quickly I found it hard to sleep on my sides 100% of the night... I usually flop between each side or end up on my back.I am not that far along right now so its hard to sleep with the pillow. I know it will be a lot better when I can rest my belly on it once I am bigger. but for now since I am still able to roll on my back i find myself in akward positions on the pillow and waking up with a sore shoulder.the cover is very itchy and you are going to want to take it off and wash it in some hot water with fabric softener to get that scratchy feeling out of it. And be patient when trying to shove the pillow back into the cover.The other plus is my cats totally love it! It is big though, so if you are sharing a small bed with someone it will be an adjustment. Luckilly we have a nice king size bed so there's room for the pillow and everyone else.	
- 1	It doesn't get anything out. It's completely useless to us. We prefer the Nose Frida for when outside of the house and the Baby Vac for when at home.	
- 1	I was 24 weeks pregnant and traveling, therefore my Leachco Snoogle Loop could not travel with me (much too large to fit in a carry-on). So when I arrived in my destination city, I knew I needed some kind of pregnancy pillow to help me sleep while I was gone for 5 days. I headed to the store and got this Boppy pregnancy pillow as it was all that was available. Though much smaller than my Snoogle Loop at home, it seemed similar enough in shape to suffice for 5 days -- I was wrong.This pillow immediately felt much flatter than my Snoogle Loop. It's nowhere near as supportive in any of the key areas (head, tummy, or legs). It especially left much to be desired for stomach support at 24 weeks. I'd been suffering from mid-back pain when sleeping on my side and desperately needed support. This gave barely anything at all.Additionally, I really hated the velcro attachment design of this pillow. I think it would have been a much less flimsy pillow had it all been one piece. I didn't really see the value of detachable parts. Aside from it being flimsy, the velcro would crackle and pull apart if you moved at all overnight. It not only jarred me awake, but bothered my husband, as well. It was incredibly noisy for A PILLOW.All in all it barely worked in a pinch while traveling, but I would never recommend this to any pregnant woman at all for a long-term solution for a pregnancy pillow. I left it behind with my mother to use in any way she could figure out. I would have rather paid the money that I spent on this pillow on checking my Snoogle Loop on my flight to/from home. The Snoogle Loop is about $30 or so more than this, but it is BEYOND worth the extra money over the Boppy Custom Fit pillow.	
1. 	When I first got this for my now 15 month old daughter she was 6-7 months old and just learning to eat cereal pieces, I thought this would be a great way to bring her snack on the go but at that age she was not able to figure out how to use it. She didn't know to push her hand thru the top to get the snack so I would remove the top and she would inevitably spill out all the cereal! Now that she knows how to use it's great, she can hold it in one hand and eat with the other, and when she throws it across the room it doesn't pop open or spill! The only other minor problem I have with it is that it does let crumbs spill out into my purse or diaper bag.  The other snack holder I would reccomend is the OXO tot, also easy to hold and use, snaps closed so no crumbs in my purse, but does pop open when thrown.	
- 1	Not sure how these are used as inserts. I was NOT impressed and my petite baby leaked each time. They are now floating around my house as burp cloths or just to clean up mess. I was not thrilled with the diapers either.	
1. 	As a working mom, every moment counts.  These wipes have saved me a lot of time from having to wash and rinse pump parts after every use.  The wipes clean the pump parts very well, and my child has never had a bad reaction from milk pumped after using these wipes to clean the parts.  Highly recommended (just wish they were cheaper)!	
- 1	This holder is cute and worked great for about 2 and a half weeks before the clip stopped holding and then broke entirely. This product is not worth the money.	
1. 	My 5-month old son started using this toy about a month ago. It took him a few days to figure it out, but now he really enjoys it. He loves the toys on it and gets so excited spinning around in the seat and kicking his legs! My only complaint is that it took a while to assemble. Also, I haven't be able to get one of the toys on (the one with the bar).	
1. 	I love these bottles. They are not my favorite kind, but I am very pleased with them. I only gave it 4 stars because the nipples it came with were no good and had to be replaced, but other than that I am satisfied.	
1. 	Needed something that tied in the back instead of velcro closures as my daughter always pulls those off. Love the long sleeves as well. Truly keeps her clothes mess free during meals.	
1. 	I have had this high chair for 18 months now and I love it!  It has such great features that grow with your child.  The 3 positions of recline let you put your infant in the chair before they can actually sit up.  My son was not the best napper, but he very often fell asleep in this chair in the reclined position.  When he was a little older and started eating solid food, I really appreciated the removable tray cover.  When your toddler is covered in avocado slime or smearing butter in his hair, sometimes you need to just remove the food from reach.  The tray cover snaps off easily but leaves the tray in place until you can wipe off those little hands and let them down.  The tray also slides out a few inches to make room to lift baby out without catching his feet.  Another feature I like is the double sided cloth cover.  When it gets dirty, just flip it to the other side.  It washes beautifully... dries quickly and keeps it's color.  A friend of mine has the Peg Perego with the plastic wipable seat cover, but her son sweats too much when sitting on the plastic and there is always some sort of dried food caked in the corners.  You can't throw plastic in the washing machine.  I'm so glad I didn't spend twice as much for the Peg Perego!!	
- 1	I actually (stupidly) bought a second one of these, thinking that perhaps I had mis-treated the first one (by twisting the knobs, which in fact are not 'knobs' despite how they look, but rather buttons. apparently twisting them can cause the suction cups to malfunction. Well, I very carefully only PUSHED the knob/buttons on this one and guess what? It STILL falls down ALL THE TIME. It is soooo aggravating. Returning it. And wishing I had learned my lesson after the first one!	
- 1	I do not recommend this. I normally love all things oxo, but this is a huge fail. When we first got this, the soft plastic top that opens up was so hard that my 14 month old son could not get his hand through on his own to grab his o's. now almost a year later, the plastic is permanently open and o's fall out everywhere when this tips over. Super annoying. The munchkin snack trap seems like a much better product for this.	
- 1	Shield did absolutely nothing from protecting my device.  It easily came off and my 13 month old son actually snapped it in half.	
1. 	I love boon products and this is no exception, a great bath organizer and holds a lot of stuff.  The frog is huge but it looks great in the bath and holds a lot of toys plus soaps and washcloths.	
- 1	Sounds like my dog's toy so he flipped out and wanted to eat it! Identical squeaking pitch so I had to return it or it would have become his new toy!	
1. 	I needed these for my pump bottles. They fit both the ameda and medela pump bottles. No issues with spillage	
- 1	We were using Tommy Tippee bottles when my daughter was first born and almost immediately she was throwing up entire bottles. My doctor actually suggested us moving over to the Dr. Brown's bottles and wouldn't ya know it! The throwing up stopped instantly.Washing them are a problem because there are 2 other mechanicals besides the bottles that you have to wash and in order to get them adequately clean, you should really do this by hand. No big deal, but I spend 20 extra minutes a day washing all the components of these bottles by hand (even though they are dish washer safe).Now for the Biggest problem of all with these bottles - they leak and sometimes for no reason at all.  This morning I put the bottle on the nightstand and it was about half full, had not been tipped over and not bothered at all, the next time I picked it up to give it to my 11 month old she got doused with milk. This happens on an almost daily basis and every day it infuriates me and I yell I HATE THESE BOTTLES!!!.I really have tried different bottles with her like Avent to keep the colic and throwing up down, but for some reason these leaky, messy, pain in the ^@(#&)@)# bottles seem to be the only ones that keep her from throwing up. So with that, I am willing to put up with this long enough that her little tummy doesn't hurt and move into sippy cups as soon as she gets the hang of them.I HATE THESE BOTTLES!! ARRRRGGGGGG!	
1. 	Our daughter cannot stop chewing these! They are bright, colorful, light, soft but sturdy... very nice product! Would buy again as a gift...	
- 1	It worked fairly well, starting out, then the bristles began to fall out this morning. I've only had it a couple of days, but the bottles have at least 6 pieces to wash and maintain. I was hoping it would stand up to the constant use. Perhaps I just managed to get a bad brush, but it didn't last; at least not for me.	
- 1	We received this swing as a gift.  The sounds worked beautifully, but the swing would not swing.  Kinda defeats the purpose!  I have to give it one star for that, but it has to get a second star because the customer service was great.  I contacted the manufacturer and they sent a replacement.  They no longer have this same swing, but they sent an equivalent one (that actually has a couple more features) and the whole transaction was hassle free.	
- 1	our baby likes the soft part but not the handle so I remove the soft part and transplant it into glow in the dark handles from walmart	
- 1	There is an small hole in this spout ..  it's almost impossible suck water o any light beverage from it .. our boy wasn't doing anything more than playing with it and we wonder why.  then we try and was hard for us to extract something.  I contact NUK to get more info about this issue with no answer yet.	
- 1	I didn't even try to install this item because of how big and bulky it is.  It really looks funny on a door.  You can only use it from one side of the door.  I didn't like it at all.	
- 1	They were cute in the package, though some were patterned differently than the picture and with a more predominant green than I expected.  What was really disappointing was that the pattern fabric shrinks disproportionately to the fabric on the back of the bib.  It causes the bib to roll up and they don't hold their color and texture very well after even one wash.	
1. 	I loved, loved, loved these bibs for my older son - he drooled constantly for months and these were our go-to bib b/c of the plastic on the inside kept drool off his shirts.However, I tried to use them for the next baby in our family, and the velcro was already shot.  They won't stay on the baby any more.So, for the price, these are excellent bibs.  If you're looking for a bib that will last more than a few months, though, you'll need to look elsewhere.	
1. 	I love this jumper! Both of my kids got a lot of use out of it, enjoyed it immensely, but also got there fingers slammed on more than one occassion between the large, hard tray and the door jam.	
- 1	To be honest, by the time your kid is big enough to fit into this, they are so strong they will be able to claw their way out of it.  I bought this for my daughter because I was addicted to swaddling and couldn't let go, even though my sisters kept telling me to get over it.  She was getting too big for the standard swaddles.  I tried it once and she wasn't very happy in it.  I finally realized she's a big girl and we broke her of the swaddle in one night, where she started sleeping 11-12 hrs through the night.  If you have a big baby who loves a swaddle, go for it.  If you have an unhappy big baby and you're obsessed with swaddling, I recommend just going cold turkey no swaddle, and in a few days they will figure out how to roll onto their belly and will sleep like angels.	
- 1	We love the lifefactory bottles!  Our daughter loves them so much it is hard to wean her away from them so we bought the super expensive caps to convert them to sippy cups.  She is used to other types of sippy cups so the transition should not be a problem but these caps are almost useless.  Both caps came with the hard plastic caps and a silicon insert.  The instructions say to loosen the cap on the bottle to adjust the flow.  The issue that we have is that when the caps are on as tight as possible, the flow is zero.  We tried as hard as we could to suck water out of this bottle with the caps fully tightened and could not get a drop and neither could our daughter.  We then loosened it up a bit and we could all get water out of the bottle but it leaks all over the place beneath edges of the collar on the cap when just tilted slightly.  When you take the gasket out, the flow is so good that it isn't much of a sippy cup.On the positive side, the caps that come with the bottles fit perfectly on them.  We haven't had an issue with them breaking but then again we haven't had much use of them either.On the whole we are really disappointed with these caps.  We continue to be very impressed with the bottles and wouldn't trade them for anything.  So we really assumed that Lifefactory would come through with a good product for their caps and they didn't at least not for our purposes.	
1. 	These are great! I love the way they attach to each other. This way you don't have to be perfectly lined up (a bonus since my bookcases are over 10 feet tall), they are strong, come off if you ever need to move them and were very easy to install. I feel 100% better know my super tall bookcases are attached to the wall and wont tip over (and believe me I tried!!). I recommend these to anyone, especially with young children who love to climb!	
1. 	great drying station for your baby's bottles and nipples and pacifiers and stuff like that, be sure to cover with a clean kitchen towel to prevent flies from touching them though, would definitely recommend to anyone!	
1. 	I want to give it a higher rating, but my kiddo wasn't impressed. It didn't have the desired effect to help her get to sleep.The sounds are high quality (whales, heart beat, rain, water). Having volume control and timer settings are great.It can be strapped easily to a crib with the velcro behind it's head.Soft, fluffy fur.	
- 1	This was shown in black and came in rainbow. Disappointing, for sure. I suppose next time I should read the fine print.	
- 1	Well I wish I could say how my daughter liked it or how it fit in our playard, but the thing ripped on a gentle cycle in the laundry (instructions followed), literally shredded...Complete piece of junk. Graco should be offering a better product than this to use in their playards. No excuse for this...	
- 1	This is a great product when it's actually working! It worked for a couple of weeks until I thought the batteries were already dead. I replaced the batteries and it started right back up. When I went to use it on my son I got nothing. I found that I had to take the batteries out and then put them back in every time I wanted to turn it on. Sadly I am sending this back and sticking with the gross and smelly bulb because it works every time.	
1. 	These bibs are wonderful. Not only are they pretty but they do absorb well and you can embroider on them to personalize them. I got these for my granddaughter. They do have boy colors too in blues and greens. Well worth the price.	
- 1	Other people might '5 star' these, but our little one couldnt stand them.  I wanted to love them because they wash up quite easily  and the idea is great, but all they did was act as a distraction during feeding time.  Plus, our little one could pull it off quite easily ( realize its supposed to break away if theyre choaking), but this would come undone when it even bumped against the high chair tray.	
1. 	Child refuses to keep a blanket on. They are great on my now 16 month old who has figured how to take her pants (and occasionally diaper) off, but has not figure out the upside down zipper!	
- 1	I really do not care for these bottles.  When pushing the air out of the bag, you must do it straight for the liner can come off the bottle, spilling milk everywhere.  In my case, it was prune juice and the baby's medicine.  I have been much happier with Dr. Browns.	
1. 	This is the BEST baby gate I have ever used.  I have three kids and let me tell you, I have been through some baby gates and tried many models!  I wish I had invested the money in this one sooner!  My family uses the pressure-mount method with our gates.  This one is so easy to use and stays put.  It's easy enough that my 7-year old can operate it and still keeps my fiesty 2-year old in check.  My 2-year old has figured out how to knock down every baby gate we have ever owned (about 5 different models).  He can't knock this one down and he has tried and failed!  I have never been so happy to see my kid fail at something!  Thank you, The First Years!  I also love that I can operate it one-handed while juggling a newborn and shooing the 2-year old out of the kitchen.  Great investment!	
- 1	Too small for my dream on me mini crib mattress the fabric is a bit cheap looking overall would not recc	
1. 	I love the Playtex brand, and the VentAire bottles are really very good.  I like that the bottles is angled and that helps with gas.  The only thing is sometimes they do leak, but I make sure that the bottle parts are completely dry before I assemble and mix formula.  These save you so much money compared to the drop in bottles. They are a definite keeper.	
1. 	My daughter is almost 2 years and still uses these cups on occasion, it was a great sippy cup to transition from the bottle. However, the only downside was the flow was almost too much from the bottle to sippy.	
1. 	First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.	
- 1	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor.  He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work.  The lowest setting is still slightly too high.  Not impressed.  Kinda boring.  Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.	
1. 	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.  I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.  It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!  Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!	
- 1	I expected this to be a bracelet or necklace for me to wear not for a baby to wear.	
- 1	This cover is an oversized piece of thick plastic that you have to wrap like a present around your mattress with two ends of weak tape. It is hard to get tight and doesn't overlap for a firm fit. It makes me more nervous than it's claims to prevent SIDS and has been very frustrating. It makes it difficult to change the sheets, etc. I would not recommend this cover nor would i purchase one again.	
1. 	I love this mobile. The contrast in colors are fantastic and is just what babies are interested in looking at. My son loves looking at the characters and would often stop him from crying when I turn it on.The song plays long enough, although I sometimes have to crank it a 2nd time before my son falls asleep. And there is also a mechanism to stop the mobile if needed for those nights when the baby falls asleep fast.	
1. 	I purchased these tubby toys for my grandson, he loves to play in the tub.  And the fact that they squirt is wonderful.  I can't wait until his next bath!! Amazon keep up the great work with wonderful selections!!	
1. 	My wife and I were deciding between a Fisher Price two-way swing or this two-way glider as our tool to help put our newborn to sleep when she's less than cooperative.  In the end, we decided on this glider because of the ability to pick it up and move it around. Here are my thoughts: (1) at first, I thought it was more like a solid infant car seat with a motor attached beneath.  It is not.  It's just a hammock draped over a tubular metal frame--quite flimsy.  But it gets the job done.  (2) The arch from which the toys dangle is NOT a handle that you can use to move it; it's just a non-weight-bearing tube from which the toys dangle.  To move it, you grab two handles at the ends of the seat. (3)  The motor is much quieter than what I expected after reading some of the reviews here.  Maybe in a very quiet room, the motor noise may be noticeable.  But the noise is never annoying or intrusive, and it doesn't disturb baby.  (4) The faster of the two movement speeds is probably about right; any much faster and baby's head would get jolted back and forth.  The slow setting is very slow.  (5)  The seat is rotatable 360 degrees, so the back-and-forth movement is not just limited to 2 positions.  (6) The music tends to be on slightly louder side even on the softer setting, but it's not a big deal.  (7) As with all such seats, baby's back is slightly arched, and I'm not sure it's healthy for baby to sleep long term day in and day out in this posture.  But for calming baby to put her to sleep, it's fine.	
- 1	The idea of this is really good. It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib. Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it.	
- 1	We have used this thermometer less than 10 times. Last night, as my daughter was screaming inconsolably, I grabbed the thermometer to check a rectal temp, and it wouldn't even turn on. Really? Dead battery after a handful of uses? The idea is good, with the interchangeable tips, but spend your money on a better setup that will work when you need it. I bought this at Target, so didn't read reviews first, but wish I had. After reading the other reviews, I'm not even going to bother with replacement batteries, I'll just get a better thermometer.	
- 1	I wanted to like these so bad but they're useless.  First of all, they leak right through (for me).  I don't mind but they are also quite bulky and thick.	
- 1	This may sound pathetic, but after buying this product I find myself too lazy to use it. You have to take time to stretch the elastic edges around the seat. It's quicker to just throw a blanket over the seat. I've actually decided to spend a few hundred bucks and just get the windows tinted. It's so hot where I live that we're all sweating by the time the AC cools off the car.	
1. 	Seriously, this is a fantastic play yard fence. I loved the first 8 panel set we got so much, I bought a second 8 panel (and a two panel extension!), so I could have one on each floor of the house. This makes a spacious, stable area for my son to play safely in, even if I'm running off to check on laundry or something.	
1. 	This is great for the price. I took off a star for 2 reasons:1) This won't work on thicker tables2) It's a bit of a pain to assemble and disassemble (this is annoying because we use it at restaurants when we go out and have to put it together and take it apart often, but it may not be an issue if you're using it at home)To elaborate on point 2, there is a 'back bar' that links to the two 'arm' pieces. The three pieces can be cumbersome to work with and sometimes the back bar slips out of it's seat 'pocket' and creates more work.There are others that are 3 or 4 times the price that are great and you wouldn't have the above problems, so it's up to you to decide if that price premium is worth it or not. However, for us, the low price on this made us overlook its flaws.	
1. 	My baby loves this teether.  In fact, this teether -- and the green 4 month Combi teether - are the only ones she's ever actually used.  The quiet rattle and shape keep her attention and make her reach for it when I hold it up.  Plus, the ring shape makes it very easy for her to grip and crawl around with.  A good girlfriend recommended this product to me when I told her I couldn't find a pacifier or teether my daughter would use(and believe me, we'd tried a lot--MAM, Green Sprouts, Nuby, and on and on). I'm so glad she did!	
- 1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.	
- 1	Time is precious.  I don't want to spend it cleaning all of these little parts.  I wish I'd gotten Tommee Tippee bottles, which are similarly priced and have a vent to prevent colic, without all of the pieces.  Adding extra steps into my jam packed day is stupid.  I have the bottle warmer too, and the tommee tippees don't fit so I guess I'll just stick with this.  I think they work well - I don't really know because we didn't start much bottle feeding until after the typical colic phase.	
- 1	I do not like this product.  I had similar product by a different manufacture and was running out so I bought this.  Bad bad bad.  First, it's so hard to remove the plastic that is attached to adhesive, second, it won't stick to toilet seat( because adhesive is not good and because adhesive part comes off when removing the plastic).  And because of the lack of and the poor quality of the adhesive, This toiler seat does no good because it just falls into the toilet before you even use it.  Because you can't flush it down the toilet, you would have to pick up the seat that has fallen into the toilet BEFORE it's even used, so not only it works but also you would be picking this up from the toilet bowl.  No use.  I do not recommend this product.  I would give zero star if I could.	
- 1	There are better bath toys out there. They look cute but that's about it. Kids sort of like them but by far not their favorites.	
1. 	I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers!  If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great!  The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models.  This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense!  I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future.  Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light.When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones.  I am glad to have this luxury for my baby. I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM.  It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort.I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway?  I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions.  I just add water whenever I add wipes; it's a no-brainer!  If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions.  I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth!	
- 1	These bags leave a lot to be desired.  They don't stand up on their own so you have to set them in a cup when they have milk in them.  They don't lie down flat, so you can't freeze them in a nice flat layer to stack in the freezer.  The twist-tie top causes the bags to freeze with a lot of folds and ridges at the neck - this made it impossible for me to open a frozen bag to add more milk later on.  And I've never been able to tear open the little tab at the bottom to get the milk out - I have to snip the edge with a scissors, which I'm sure defeats the purpose of having a nice, sterile inside.  All in all, I'm really disappointed in these bags, and the only positive side to them is I haven't had any burst in the freezer...yet.	
1. 	love it, the color is nice and the fabric is really soft, easy to wash. Blue color is very nice.	
- 1	I gave this a two because the strap broke. It ripped at the seems. I read reviews saying this but didn't think it would happen to.me. it did. I breastfeed so no formula or bottles and still broke. I really like the front pocket has a wallet compartment so I moved my important cards I use regularly to avoid carrying  diaper bag AND purse. The changing pad it comes with is a joke. its good for quick trips with its compact size. I LOVE the wallet compartment and worth 10$ to use for a month before it broke. If I can't find another diaper bag with built in wallet I may buy again for 10$ just to use til it breaks bc that part I love. Not very trendy either but oh well it works.	
- 1	This product would be great except for one vital flaw - you cannot clean the inside of the straw!  What a major design flaw to overlook since the weighted straw (which keeps the straw under the liquid no matter how the child holds the cup) is very smart. After the first uses, with milk, I realized the straw only opens when you are squeezing the tip and sucking on it.  This does not happen in a dishwasher, and who wants to suck out rotten milk from a straw as the only way to hand wash it?  I checked the website for cleaning instructions and they said to fill the cup with hot water, put on the lid, and the water will push up through the straw.  I tried this, and it did push some water through, but not enough to clean it.  You need to do more than rinse a straw used with milk to get it clean!  The second time I tried with hot water it didn't do anything.  You cannot clean this straw making the product useless.	
1. 	Needless to say, I bought this as a gag pacie! My daughter and son-in-law just moved to his home town in Mississippi before having first baby. I saw this and got a big kick out of it!! It is a great pacie and looks crazy cute in baby's mouth. I am ordering another for my other daughter in Tennessee!!	
- 1	This item was bought for my grandson but you can't hear the sounds it makes but it was already given to my grandson so it can't very well be taken away from him to be sent back.	
- 1	Leans too far back for babies not sitting on their own. The corner pieces on bottom of the frame needed foe balance on the floor would not stay screwed in. Used this twice and it went in the trash.	
1. 	The Diaper Dekor is the best. The refills last forever, it is totally simple to use and it really does not smell. We dump the diapers about once a week, and there is literally no smell within that time. After using other diaper pails with my older kids, I highly recommend this one.	
1. 	I've been using this since my baby was a week old. It works very well on cutting his tiny nails. My only complain is it's too expensive!	
- 1	baby likes it, however when my son was 3 months old, he didn't have good control over his arms, so he hit his head really hard and it left a mark there. i would recommend it for a baby with better motor skills.	
- 1	Arm's Reach really knows how to rob people.  These sheets are ridiculously expensive - especially considering how low the thread count feels on them.  I appreciate that they have velcro in all the right spots and are designed with the cosleeper specifically in mind.  But considering that this is an item that you'll need more than one of due to the occasional night-time diaper leak or spit-up, it pains me to pay full price for them.  The washing label requests that these sheets be air-dryed (possibly b/c of all the velcro?).  I've accidentally put mine in the dryer a few times with out shrinkage.  But, if you're the type of person who does everything by the book, the air drying can be inconvenient if you don't have another clean sheet on hand.	
1. 	Getting babies teeth brushed as soon as they start to have teeth is very important. In order for them to brush their teeth regularly, one should start a routine at early stages of their life. This gum cleanser is doing a good job, and it's pretty easy to use. If you make this as a game with the baby, s/he won't refuse it as well. After the use his/her mouth smells great.	
1. 	Fits perfectly in a pack n play. I use a king sized pillow case to cover it and that works well for us.	
1. 	Durable and easy to clean, this is just what i was looking for. If your babe is a climber, be careful because it doesnt' secure to the chair	
- 1	My LO couldn't figure out how to use this and other traditional, spill-proof sippy cups (we tried at least 3 different brands). We used an occasional bottle from 0-6 months (not sure if that had anything to do with it), but now that we are ready to introduce water to her diet she was using the bottles and traditional sippy cups for teethers instead of drinking from them (Yes, I even tried taking out the valve...). I found the Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 9 Ounces and the First Years Take and Toss cups work much better for us. I'm sure this is a great cup as we love our other Gerber products (especially the spoons!), but unfortunately didn't work for us.	
- 1	I really liked the idea of this. It does create pretty stars on the walls, NOT on the ceiling. It does  have to be pretty close to the ceiling to get a reasonable effect.I purchased two, and both have a radius of about 3 feet.I place it on my son's night stand, which is pretty tall, and it barely reaches the ceiling.Too pricey for what it does... which is not much.Very disappointed!	
1. 	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.	
1. 	I bought this because I already known the brand. But also I was curious about the &#34;Hot&#34; safety button, which is really helpful when having 2 kids. They understand if they can or not touch the window in order for them not to burn then selves.The price is quite right for a product like this!	
1. 	I like them for both the look and color.  I just didn't use them for my few months old baby yet.	
- 1	My daughter was born 3 wks early, so on the small side.  These swaddlers still didn't fit her even though she was only 6.5 lbs at birth and 20&#34;.  The product info gives a much larger size range, but i guess they don't account for torso length.  The arms fit fine but I couldn't velcro the bottom strap without tipping her hips up quite a bit. Wish i could return them but I tossed the packaging.	
- 1	Not sure what I was expecting, but this is literally like a dog leash.  No stretch or elastic.  Just a nylon cord with a loop for your wrist at one end.  My main complaint is the other end--it takes some work to make a workable loop with the fastener.  Just slipping it over my child's wrist won't work, so I wanted to use it around a belt loop, but it was just too tricky to make it happen.  Very, very basic.	
- 1	I purchased these labels to label my daughter's bottles for daycare.  However, the labels were difficult to put on due to the curves of the bottle and did not stay on once I had them on there.  I decided to just go with the regular old writing with marker directly on the bottle instead.	
- 1	The idea is great and I have been happy with most Oxo tot things.  This is too tight for little fingers to get in, the plastic is too stiff.	
1. 	Genius.  This is great if you use several bottles a day and need to dry more than just the bottles.  Once you figure out where everything goes, this is a space saver and keeps bottle parts organized.	
1. 	My daughter used this blanket until she was 3-months and started to fight the swaddle so much that she could no longer sleep in it.  Up until 3-months it worked great.  I didn't start using it until she was at least a month old and it made a huge difference in her sleep right away.  I would definitely recommend this to new parents and suggest that they swaddle from day 1.	
- 1	The Levana Ona+ clip-on seemed to be something I could use with my grandson (who has been ill and had heart surgery.)  Unfortunately, my unit arrived non-functional.  It may be something as simple as replacing the expensive battery or it may be worse.  At the price, I would expect that the product would work on arrival and that I would not be forced to immediately purchase an expensive battery.  I will check with the product customer service and will update this review based on the outcome of that conversation.I gave it two stars rather than one because the product seems sturdy and well-made.  It simply does not work at all.	
1. 	Jul 7 2014: Still great! Look as good as the day I bought them! The velcro can get a little hair and threads in it but it's easy to clean!Feb 22: We still have these awesome bibs! They get washed once every other day and we hang them to dry. They look just as good as new.I was looking for a bib that was machine washable with a pocket and waterproof. I ran across the single Bumkins bibs on amazon.com. After looking some more I noticed these 3 packs which are a much better value!We have been using these bibs around 2 months and they have been amazing! I have washed them many many times and they still look like they did the day we got them. The are super waterproof and protect my daughter's clothing from getting wet or dirty.I usually hang them to dry them but occasionally one will sneak into the dryer and they have come out fine.The patterns on the girl set are so cute!	
- 1	This cup was kind of a pain to assemble--you have to fold the nipple in half to squeeze it into place, and then run your thumb around the bottom of the lid to make sure it's sealed, and it still leaks.  Maybe ours was just defective, but it seemed to leak out the valve hole.  I ended up tossing it after just a couple of weeks of cleaning up the floor after every use (we never had this problem to this extent with Nuby cups, or even Take & Toss cheap cups).	
- 1	I ordered this thinking I was going to love it. It ended up just being ok. I usually love all of OXO tots products but this was a flop. It is a great idea and would have been so much better than ziploc or the eco-fabric baggies. Everything in them always got smashed in my bag. But the lid fips open barely trying. I liked that my daughter could open it by herself, but if it was closed and she tripped it would pop open and the snack would go all over the floor, which defeats the whole purpose of putting the snack in something at all. If they could just redesign the lid just a bit I am sure I would give this another try.	
1. 	My daughter went through the slam the door phase and I was afraid she was going to take off one of her fingers. These are much cuter than other solutions I've seen and they are very effective at keeping the doors from shutting.  Plus when I take them off my daughter thinks they are fun to play with.  They are made of some sort of foam so they can break apart so if your kiddo plays with them (or bites into them!), keep an eye on them!	
- 1	After one use, I was unable to close both the clasps and the product was completely useless. I would not recommend this purchase.	
1. 	We bought this when our son started crawling.  We do not use it to keep him in but rather to keep him out.  Our kitchen, foyer and living room come together in an unusual way so a traditional baby gate would not work for us.  We have it &#34;open&#34; in a sorta backwards &#34;C&#34; shape.  I usually just step over it but I can actually fold the second to last panel inward to create a walkway when needed.  Before purchasing it, I read some of the other reviews and I think a lot of people are really expecting a lot from this item.  In the description, it says it is &#34;lightweight and portable&#34; and it is just that.  It will move on a smooth surface (but ours came with anti-skid pads) and if you don't have enough of an angle at each bend, it may fall over.  But, it is made of very sturdy plastic so if you set it up correctly, it will serve it's purpose.	
1. 	I purchased several different types of anti tip furniture straps, this was the most expensive, but seemed very sturdy.  I used both straps for a very large piece of furniture.	
1. 	This item is basically a tougher version of those sip tie holders with the sticky backs. instead of sticky backs, you get two screws to screw the item into a wall. These work GREAT! For optimum safety, be sure to screw these into studs. Where studs aren't available, make sure to get yourself some good anchors. This has helped keep a shelving unit and a light fixture in place. My niece has tested these and she can tell you they hold items well. Just a note, be sure that the item you want to secure can either have screws screwed into it or has some kind of bar the zip ties can hold onto. Otherwise, this may not be the product for you. Quakehold makes a couple of Velcro based items that may help in situations described above.	
- 1	The paws rattle, the ears crinkle and the nose barks and pants when you push it.... the barking is hardly recognizable the sound quality is so bad.  I bought it because of all the stars it has on amazon but if I saw it in a store first I would have just put it back on the shelf.	
- 1	I thought I would be receiving the iQ24, but I received a large size plastic container type thing that goes in the microwave. It is pretty much like a big tupperware container that you put bottles in and then put in the microwave to sterilize.  The directions say to wash the bottles with soapy water before using this contraption...so really I'm not sure why I'd need it.  I don't have a dish washer so I guess it makes sure your bottles are sterlized properly, but if you use really hot water and give it a good wash then you wouldn't really need to go this extra step.  But if you don't have the time or really need the bottles to be extra safe/clean, then I suppose giving them a quick wash and popping them in this container for the microwave could be helpful.	
- 1	This was one baby gift I wish we would've returned before using - a recieving blanket works much better. I recommend waiting to see if your little one wiggles out of the blanket and needs this before buying.	
1. 	This pillow was a lifesaver.  I got a lot of hip pain during pregnancy.  The trick is to use the curvier end of this pillow between the thighs while sleeping as it helps straighten the hips out.  One night without this and I would be miserable.  I kept the long side toward the inside of the bed, so I could get out and pee easily during the night.  Husband not a fan of this in our queen sized bed, but I was desperate and we made do.  The only disadvantages were that the cover is difficult to put back on after laundering.  Also, the instructions that came with it showed the pillow coiled up to be used as a back pillow but this never worked as it tended to spring open unexpectedly and send bedside items crashing to the floor.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat though.  I got pretty practiced at switching sides and rewrapping my legs around it and was so much better than retrieving a regular pillow from the floor all night.  I am 5' 7&#34; and 200lbs + during pregnancy and this held up great.	
1. 	Kid gets to have a tumbler like mom and dad.  Great playtex quality and design.  Love this.  Will grow with my child and will be using for a long time since the design is not babyish.	
- 1	The idea is good, put your sleeping baby from the car to the house without the baby waking. My daughter is rarely sleeping when we come home so there goes that good idea and when she is, unfortunately she still wakes and wants out. So, I rarely use it and even though I rarely use it, the motor all of a sudden started making a loud disturbing noise that wakes my baby anyways. Its not worth the money spent, in my opinion. Save your money and buy something else.	
1. 	Never feel left out of the kangaroo cosplay crowd again!  You have no idea how embarrassing it is to walk into a room of kangaroos with a baby in your arms. Problem solved.	
1. 	I like to keep lots of these on hand.  Make sure you pick the colors you want if you are picky.	
1. 	I ordered these for our nursery to put on the changing table shelves.  I plan to dye the liner & paint the basket to go with the decor of the room.  When they arrived, they were in great condition (a worry of mine since they are wicker which tends to break easily).  I love the size of all 3 baskets.  The largest will hold diapers, the medium size will probably hold wipes & the smallest will probably hold any lotions, powders, creams or anything else we need for diaper changes.	
1. 	The BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover is everything advertised and more!  It's absolutely true that you can easily place it into the cart, unzip it and set it up with just one hand.Not only was set up a breeze, but the amount of padding on this cover is amazing.  My 8-month-old sits up but is still wobbly sometimes.  When she launched herself backward in the seat she didn't even notice because of both the regular padding in the cover and the great pillow (that comes attached with velcro) which padded her back.  She was also snugly and securely belted into the seat cover.  I love the padding and velcro that attach to the center pole of the shopping cart as well (where you put the child's legs through).Everything was obviously carefully and insightfully planned and implemented in this product.  The added features of zippered pockets, tabs for toys, and fabric covered elastic holders for juice and bottles inside the cart area is fantastic.  Plus the bright fun print is very cute and interesting to look at for the babies.  I couldn't recommend this product more highly.  If you're looking for a really good cart cover this is it.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, I found these pads leaked easily after only one feeding. Maybe I leak more than others as I have had an OALD and oversupply with my first, but now with my second I took pains to avoid it and have not had problems, so I tend to think its the pads, not me.I am editing this to add: I believe these are not absorbant enough due to the material. After researching and experimenting with several cloth diapers, I have discovered that hemp and bamboo are MUCH more absorbant than jersey, cotton or microfiber. If you are looking for nursing pads (or cloth diapers for that matter) that are highly absorbant, look for something made with those fabrics.	
- 1	I am still using this mainly for the timer feature. [update: I decided to return this a month after I wrote the review]I don't like the water reservoir since it is difficult to clean due to the very small opening.  Even after trying to clean it every few days I see some black spots inside... mold/mildew/gunk??  See the pictures I uploaded.I now operate this without the reservoir.  I just pour a little water into the bottle warmer when I need to use it.This could have been so much better if they simply made the water reservoir easy to clean.	
1. 	My baby loved these the first time I put them out!  Sometimes it takes a few times before she likes something, but these stackers were fun right away!  They are bright and colorful and fun!	
1. 	These sippy cups are very good spill proof cups. My 11 month old son drink well out of them. We have used them since 5 months to start practicing but i had to remove the valve to make it easier for him to drink from. This of course eliminated the spill proof factor but now that he is older and has a stronger suck we put the valve back in and use them to their full potential! They say they are 7 ounce but i can put a full 8 ounces in them no problem.	
- 1	We ony got this nipple and bottle because it's compatible with the professional grade Ameda breast pump machines. All of the other nipples we are aware of are medium to fast flow. We mistakenly thought that this was a slow flow nipple.[Good]The sturdiness of the nipple itself: Which competing products, the nipple bends and our baby just ends up playing with it leading to bad breast feeding and twisting while feeding. With this nipple, it's so sturdy that it keeps our baby still instead of constantly twisting and moving his head and body.Cool Looking: Pretty high tech in terms of initial impressions.No drip: The nipple requires suction before liquid starts flowing.[Bad]Fast flow: Yes the initial flow is slow. The baby needs to build suction. However once flow starts, it ends up flowing way too fast. It's so fast that our baby ends up choking multiple times during a feeding. This is anything but natural. About 30 minutes later, our baby has thrown up his milk. This hasn't happened with the cheaper nipples.Air Intake Prevention: This is no different from a cheaper nipple.Bottle Doesn't Dry: I'm not sure why, but this bottle takes a lot longer to dry than a normal bottle. I'm guessing it's probably due to the upper lip. I don't know why purpose that serves other than for aesthetics. Someone didn't test this product very well.Price: Given its big flaws, it doesn't deserve the price premium. It is way too expensive.[Verdict]This is not a breast milk feeding bottle. Real breasts do not drown babies in milk. Do not buy this garbage.	
- 1	The product works as described but you're going to need at least 2 for each toy because they are very short. For example, I attached a toy to the high chair and with just one strap the toy couldn't even reach across the tray.	
1. 	It's not cheap . But the quality is very great .	
- 1	This digital monitor is a great idea, but unfortunately the execution of the idea needs improvement.Like many others who gave the monitor a low starred reviewed, I too had problems with reception. Sometimes it was so poor that I had no idea what was going on with the baby in the other room. The receiving end (my monitor) often had a lot of static and blank moments in the reception. There were times when I could hear the baby crying through the doorway of the room I had the receiver located, but the receiver barely seemed to pick up the cries when the baby's monitor was located right next to the crib. Totally unacceptable. I do like the design and don't mind the bright light of the LED, but the fact that the unit was an unreliable monitor makes it a one star. If the baby had started to choke I would have been unable to hear any warning signs if the receiver was in its static mode or was blanking in and out.	
1. 	This is the perfect mat for my Car.  Has compartments for every toy.  Great quality and very heavy duty.  Provides good protection for my seats.	
- 1	Too small for the car seat and I have a jj cole car seat it wasn't what I was expecting I thought the front would open up easily but it's not like that the material was cheaply made it ripped at the seams	
1. 	This swing is perfect even if you dont live in a small space...we have a big house and decided not to invest in a standard swing for many reasons...1) we could take this swing from room to room while baby was in it, took from family room to office to kitchen, even up and down stairs! 2) did not create clutter, we could stow it anywhere, folded nicely in the closet, basement, laudry room, even bathroom while company came over! With a new baby trust me the house will get cluttered!!!3) its portability was nice, we took it along with us to ppl's houses who did not have kids, our son loved sitting in it...we did not have to constantly worry about who is going to hold him, where to lay him to sleep, where to feed him, etc..4) serves as a swing, bassinet, lounge chair, and highchair for at least 5 months. Our son lived in this thing when he would be in the family room and we couldnt tend to him.this swing was a lifesaver, the durability is bette rthan i expected for a product labeled as portable i loved it! the battery issue needs to be addressed. We have only inserted batteries once into this thing in 6 months! there is no need to constantly have the lights on as well as the music...those are extra perks if your kid really wont seem to settle down. We mostly used the swing controls and it has lasted us. There is an option for lights and sound only when u pull on the fish, and thats what our swing is always set at. i think battery use is good on this.	
- 1	This high chair has nice features like the swinging tray, adjustable height, and recline. It's easily moved with the wheels. You can also fold up and put away. We purchased last August and most of the time I just wipe clean however I have thrown it in the washer in cold water. I've done this only 3 times and each time the chair paid material cracks. I even allow it to air dry so not sure why the material does this. It looks awful now, peeling off. Amazon still says it is eligible for return and refund so it's going back.	
- 1	My son ripped this off within 5 minutes.  It's interesting because obviously the adhesive is not great but at the same time some of the finish on our crib came off with it!  Pretty disappointed.	
- 1	We loved this at first, but after being in my car is some below freezing temps it stopped working.... both the music and the light.	
1. 	I really like this tub. I first bought the Summer Infant bath with the spray,and while I still really miss the spray, this tub is MUCH MUCH better and makes bath time less stressful. I bought it after my son was a newborn, so I didn't get to use the sling feaure. Right now he is using the sling as a back rest and sits up in the seat. WOW that makes all the difference! He can sit upright and I can bathe him much better than before. I can use both hands, too. The toys that come with it are a great little addition, it helps with washing hair and getting baby clean.(but the toy that attaches to the side is kinda useless!) The drawbacks are that it doesn't look like it will truly hold a toddler but we will see. It's hard to wash the back of it b/c of it's shape, but that is minor. Also, the plug doesn't drain the water at all, you have to hold it up to get it out. Other than that,it's a great tub that doesn't take up much space. And it really does look cute. I would reccommend this over what I used to have b/c you can sit the baby up. that makes so much of a difference! It's a little too expensive but pretty well worth it.	
1. 	This sun shade is awesome.  Most strollers have useless sunshades.  I should know, I have 5 strollers and only the Quinny Buzz has a relatively decent sunshade.  But even the Buzz isn't great for a sun phobe like me.  I used to drape a blanket on the shade to provide ample protection, but as Baby got older, he didn't really like not being able to see out the stroller so would pull the blanket down.Enter Protect A Bub.  Ties onto the Buzz easily and forms a super sunshade.  I have no concerns taking my kid out with this thing.  Gives great protection (even down to his toes!) and it still lets him see out and feel like part of the action.I got the black one and it took 2 months to receive, so that was a bummer.  But hopefully Amazon got the supply figured out and you will not have to wait so long.	
1. 	easy to carry and care. make highchairs look clumsy. space saver. goes well with my dinning room theme. not adjustablele.	
1. 	Handy tub. Fits well in the kitchen sink for my newborn. The sling is soft and comfy. The only issue we have is space for it to dry, but if you have a large tub or live in a warm area you wouldn't have a problem with it.	
1. 	So far, my 9 month old hasn't tried to pull this off.  It seems pretty stuck with the tape they gave you.  It has stuck really well onto our fireplace (which is small, square, not totally even tile) for 2 weeks now.  This brand is MUCH better than the Cosmos brand, also sold here on Amazon.  The corners fit better, and the tape works a lot better.	
1. 	Love pumping and storing in these bags they're so convenient!  I just wish they were a little bigger and had a zip seal.	
1. 	We bought this tub to replace the tub to seat universal system, which was just a nightmare.  By the time we bought it, however, my daughter was too big to use the sling, but I fold it up and use it as a pillow for her head.  She had her first tearless bath recently, and I couldnt be happier! She stays in place even while kicking her feet, and I don't have to scoot her up constantly. The plug fits easily without leaking. Would definitely recommend.	
1. 	I really like this changing table. The changing table that was supposed to come with my furniture set from BRU was part of a big long dresser thing (not an upright, a long one) and was going to cost $600. For a dresser that wouldn't fit in her room. No. So I decided to find a cheaper one that matched her room, and landed upon this one. It has been absolutely great for 8 months now. I have 0 complaints.	
- 1	I got this for my eight-month-old since we were working on baby-led weaning (seeBaby-Led Weaningfor more information) and I didn't love putting food directly on the table, especially when we were eating out.  As soon as I put it in front of him, he made it his job to dislodge it from the table.  The suction cups were not match for his curiosity and fearsome pull.Not wanting to fight that battle, I rolled it up and put it away for later, a time in which he'd be more interested in eating for sustenance than exploring his food and surroundings.  That time never came.  At almost two and a half years old, he'd much better about not dropping food, so the little pouch would just be an invitation to store food in.Quality-wise, it's fine.  It does roll up and tuck in the pouch, which is cute, but then it doesn't lay flat on the table even with the suction cups engaged.  And since it doesn't work as a placemat, it really doesn't matter how easy it is to store and transport.  I didn't return it, but I'm also not going to use it with his younger brother (now eight months old).  I guess I'll eventually donate it to Goodwill.Bottom line:  It's more fun for babies to play with than eat off of.  The suction cups can't withstand the single-minded focus of a determined infant/toddler.  Skip it.	
1. 	These locks are fantastic, but wow, what a pain to install.  The directions are all but useless, so it was kind of trial and error.  My husband had to drill and redrill a couple of times to get the lock in the right place so that it would work.I would recommend these locks only for cabinets/drawers where there are dangerous/harmful goods inside.  It's worth it for those.	
- 1	I purchased this product knowing I will be making my own baby food, and this should be of some assistance in the process. I loved it... it mashes fruits very well, is easy to serve from and clean with a brush. I was going to purchase another one and stumbled upon  the negative reviews. I was horrified when I found out this was made with #7 plastic, and the health risks it poses to my baby. I used it for over two months but have since stopped and WILL NOT be using this to crush my baby's food. I hope in that period of using it my baby wasn't exposed too much to the chemicals contained within to cause any permanent harm. I will rather be safe and use a fork or spoon to crush foods. It's really cute and eye-catching though... Don't be fooled.	
- 1	I bought this in hopes of finding a gate that would be easy to use and well made. This gate is neither. The gate itself is sturdy and the metal is good, however the sides of the gates that have the little pins on them with the cushions - the ones that hold against the wall are very poorly made. The cushions on the pins slip off at every chance they get - so in the end you get the sharp pins going against your wall - resulting in scratches all over the wall. Apart from this, the locking mechanism is not easy to use. If you put this gate somewhere where you need to walk at some point - meaning you need to take the gate off and put it back on again, then there is an issue of the lock. In order to lock the gate in the position you want, you need to put the little plastic part on top of the lock in the correct spot, and for some reason, to get the plastic part in that spot is a nightmare. It won't go in and when it does go in, the turning part which works in tandem with the plastic part and makes the pressure on the gate is most times too far, meaning you have to readjust the plastic part again. I am not the only one who has problems with this locking mechanism, my husband, my mother, his mother, my father and my sister all have problems with this. I would look elsewhere if you need an easy to use gate which you will unlock and lock many times a day. If you are looking for a gate that you put in once and don't have to unlock it for long periods of time, then this isn't a bad gate since you wouldn't have to deal with all these problems daily.	
1. 	It works, it survives one accident if it's not &#34;big&#34; one. It's cute and my daughter does not mind wearing it because it has cute prints and it does not have diaper feel to it.	
1. 	I like the dreambaby gate. it is sturdy and the bars are too small for my (not so slim) cat to fit through. It is also thin enough so that she cant jump onto of the gate to get into the baby room.unfortunately, the main gate does not come with a gate hook to leave the gate open when needed. Also, the gate and extensions were a bit difficult to fit together as one of the gates was not properly quality checked and the screw holes were too small and the wrong height. We had a lot of difficulty trying to force the gate to fit together. But once the gate was set up, its good.	
1. 	Great step stool for my two year old to use to wash his hand all by himself.  The non slip service works great!	
1. 	I've had this things for like 7 months now and it STILL hasn't leaked despite very rough treatment (my kid stood on it, jumped on it, etc), so ones that leaked are faulty.Who would need instructions on how it fill it?! It has a hole and a plug. Run water into the hole. I never thought twice about it. That's like needing instructions on how to blow up balloons. Put it in your sink and run water into the hole... I'm not trying to be rude, I'm really not, I just don't get how that isn't obvious and easy.Is it an amazing, spectacular toy? No. It is a neat toy that is fun to smack and jiggle and squish? Yep. And it was totally worth the $10.	
- 1	My daughter loves this toy but.....it broke within a few months!  I wrote the company and with in a few minutes I receive a reply that the toy is no longer in production!  If I mail the toy to them (spend more of my money) they will replace the toy with a similarly priced toy.  They provided no information as to what that toy would be.  Don't buy this obviously defective product!	
1. 	This is an awesome product!  Once you get used to using this product, it is a huge timesaver.  It took us three tries to get the amount of water right so the bottle would be the right temperature (not too hot, not too cold).  Before going to bed every night, we put two bottles and the ice pack in the cooler section.  When the baby woke up, we transferred one bottle to the warmer.  It was usually done warming before we finished changing a diaper!  You may want to order an additional ice pack so you'll always have one ready in the freezer.  This bottle cooler/warmer makes it easier at night when you want to get back to sleep as soon as possible!	
1. 	I wanted to try a Boppy but was tired of paying full price for name-brand items that might or might not work for my (first) son. My husband likes this thing even more than I do. He was helping with midnight feedings of expressed milk but the baby was hurting his back in the middle of the night. Now he uses the Cuddle-U to help secure the son for feedings.There are definite downsides, though: The cover does not come off, which makes cleanings tricky. Some would surely consider it worth it to pay more for a removable cover. Also, I don't see this growing with my little guy much. It's not secure enough to support him in a sitting position, so I imagine he'll be done with this by 3-4 months. For the price, it will have lasted long enough.	
- 1	I purchased this necklace based on positive reviews, its washable, and the thin cord. As soon as it arrived I gave it to baby to play with and get used to it. Her thumb got stuck in the small (small!) pendant hole. I was able to snap the necklace once and since then it hasn't worked. I can never use this as intended; a way to keep her occupied during nursing instead of looking around at every noise.I had read other reviews that babies liked the cord over other similar necklaces with smaller beads and I knew my baby would too. Once she started sucking on the cord I realized that it could easily become a choking hazard if she sucked too much into her mouth, which I hadn't thought of at the time of purchase but in hindsight it seems so obvious!I believe I'm going to try and return this despite her liking to chew on it.	
1. 	I loved these bottles. Never had one problem. No leaks, nada one. I also was able to attach these to the ISIS breast pump. I only use these for baby water now, since I use larger bottles. 5 stars	
1. 	Very soft.  Elastic fits well.  Washes well.  I bought the apple green and it is a bright pop of green color in the room, which i love.	
1. 	I LOVE that these are made from organic cotton.  They're soft, very simple designs, apparently quite chewable for a baby, and I like the idea that they're veggies.  I do wish that they were a bit better priced, but you get what you paid for.  I can also kind of see some of the negative reviews out there about the designs not being as cute, but I kind of like the fact that they were simple and natural looking.  Most toys are already loud enough, so it was nice to have something different.	
- 1	Before I had my baby I was nervous about pretty much everything and imagined the worst. I never had any issues with very sore boobs from nursing and I nursed for a year. No problems showering or otherwise. Didn't need this. If you are considering purchasing this before your baby is born, wait and see if you are going to need it first. This as well as other similar products were a complete waste of money for me.	
- 1	I got this for my evenflo sureride 65. The base of the seat has a slanted part so none of the bottom rested on the car seat transporter's base. The make also didn't seem very strong. There is no way on the manufacturer's website to find out if it would actually fit your car seat, short of buying and trying. We ended up with the magna [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVVSDU/]] personal cart (cheaper at costco) with a much deeper base that fit our seat nicely! It's also good because I can use it for a myriad of other uses, not just transporting the carseat.	
- 1	i bought this for my son's diaper bag. i found it was just another thing to have around. i keep his pacifier in a pocket by itself so it can't get dirty. its good quality and fits a natursutten pacifier just fine.	
- 1	We bought this and never used it.  It works well and there is no problem with functionality; it just wasn't very practical for us.  We used a notepad when we needed to track these things (we found that sometimes you need to document more than times, you may need notes on poopy color, consistency, etc.) I know... TMI.	
- 1	We aren't really sure that this is working or not.  I think this is more for the concept of brushing teeth more than anything. I have been disappointed.	
1. 	Lovely colorful squirting toys ,my daughter loves to play with them while she takes bath .She loves squirting the water from these toys on me and laughs on my reaction :--)	
1. 	I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn't absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don't need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it's rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren't detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don't think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it's assembled it's not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don't move them much either.)-It's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I'm still very happy--it's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA toy for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I'm still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.	
- 1	I ordered this gate because I already own one that is very similar to it and it has worked pretty good. I do not want to wall mount it as it doesn't need to be up all the time and would just be in the way then. So, I bought this with the intended purpose of pressure mounting it. Bottom line, it does not pressure mount AT ALL! There are 3 slots to adjust the pressure and in order for it to be tight enough not to fall. Unfortunately it needs to be latched beyond the last slot! I read the instructions and it gives no trouble shooting help if the gate won't pressure mount tight enough. All in all, I do not recommend this gate unless you enjoy wasting money on a complete piece of junk. I am extremely disappointed.Fast forward two weeks later and this piece of junk gate completely broke! The latch snapped off and now instead of being useless, it is completely useless! This is by far the worst item I have ever purchased on Amazon. It is going out with the trash tomorrow. What a waste of $25.00!!!	
- 1	I got this infant toothbrush because my son started teething really early. I thought it would be easy for him to handle but the shape fits awkward in his little hand. But that's not my biggest concern with this product, after all, he can always grow into it. My biggest problem is that it picks up lint like crazy. I have to wash it before every use and in a matter of seconds (that's not an exaggeration) it's already full of lint and stuff. It's gross. It seems like the product is made from a sticky kind of silicone. Bummer, I had really high hopes for this product. For the price I paid I expected much better quality.	
- 1	I specifically requested a pink and green cup for my daughter, however, got blue and green.  Unfortunately, my schedule doesn't allow me to go through all of the returns/etc, so I'll be keeping a boyish cup for my little girl.. thanks.	
- 1	The idea behhind this mat is great - give your baby a different texture and visually interesting things to explore during tummy time.  However, the actual product was a bit underwhelming. First, without the assistance of the reviewer who explained how to fill the water portion, I'd likely have assumed it was just broken, as there's no instructions and no clear way to fill the inner portion of the mat. Once explained, filling the water pocket was very easy. The mat is pretty small - my 9 week old could not fully fit on it, but he did seem to enjoy the different sensation. After 48 hours the air had leaked out of the outside ring and the fish in the inner ring were being hunted by the cat. We move it to higher ground but an additional 48 hours later and it had spring a leak.	
1. 	I love the Seuss motif, but more than that, the quality of the bib is great.  Resists stains, can be rinsed in between a few feedings (if they're not horrendously messy!) and washes nicely in the machine.  I hang dry mine to ensure they last longer, and they dry very quickly, but I'm sure you can still throw them in the dryer.  The Velcro seems sturdy and doesn't get all mangled and destroyed in the wash like some do.  My son likes to pull his bibs off, so we thought we had to stick with the fabric snap-on ones, but for some reason, he can't easily pull these off.  Nice!	
1. 	I've tried a couple different safety brackets for furniture, and these are my favorite.  They are very easy to install (although they do require that you screw them into your furniture).  I would definitely recommend them!	
1. 	This bottle does have a lot of parts to clean but if you weigh the options of spending about an extra 10 minutes per day cleaning bottle and your baby having less gas, it is worth it. This bottle has 5 parts to clean and others usually have about 3. So if you clean 8 bottles per day and the Dr. Brown's bottles have 2 extra parts, that is like cleaning 16 extra parts per day. Really, it takes maybe 10 seconds per extra part. So, what is an extra 2-3 minutes. Nothing!! Everyone says, yes they are great bottles but there are so many parts to clean. Really, think about it. It doesn't take that much longer to clean! I will stand by these bottles all the way...less gas, less smacking when he eats and a happier baby in the end. And, I have tried every bottle including, Avent, Playtex vent air, MAM and others. Also, get the 8 oz bottles right away. If you spend the money on the smaller bottles because you baby only eats 4 oz now, he/she will be eating more in a few weeks/months and then you will have to buy more bottles. 3oz fits into an 8 oz bottle so why not just get the larger bottles right away.	
- 1	The brackets do not work, the air fresheners are wonderful.  The problem is that the fresheners fall out of the brackets.  I put them on the inside lid of my kitchen trash and my diaper pail and they both fell out from the movement of the lid.  They fall into the trash/diapers and that is not a place to be reaching your hands into.  Bummer since it is a good idea but it needs to be a tighter fit.  Again the review applies only to the bracket function, 5 stars for the fresheners.	
1. 	They do their job of cleaning out all the holes and crevasses of those darned Dr. Browns bottles.  These bottles really are great for keeping gas and reflux to a minimum, but boy are the a pain to clean.  You can't clean them without these things (and shouldn't, because if you don't get every crevasse, ick will build up on the tan colored plug thing especially - talk about nasty germies!) so buy a pack or two today!	
1. 	We had no idea whether this was a good mattress when we bought it - the baby store recommended it and we went along. I guess they knew what they were talking about because this mattress is great. It has held up like new through multiples kiddos, remained firm and in great condition.  Kids sleep well on it, even as toddlers. It is a little heavy and can be hard to get out of the crib especially on the lower setting. Good quality product.	
1. 	I bought these ice cube trays to freeze breastmilk.  I wanted trays that were BPA free and safe for my baby.  I like that they are biodegradable and made in the USA. I do not dishwasher wash them, just a bit of dapple and warm water does the trick. the lids do warp a but when you use very hot water but not enough to affect use.	
- 1	I got this one because of the price.  Yes, it is cheap.  But I find that at our house (in the city and near other houses) there is just constant interference.  It pops, hisses and goes snowy.  And the interference is loud enough to wake you up...repeatedly...all night.  We tried the other channel, removing electronics from near it and nothing makes it better.After about 6 months we have turned it off for the most part and use our audio monitor for sound. if we need to look we turn it on, but otherwise we don't use it that much due to the interference.We can see the baby though the way we mounted the camera we can't see the whole crib from about 3-4 feet above the crib.I would not recommend this to a friend.  For the money you spend you could just spend a bit more and get a better one.	
1. 	we love this gate so much that we have seven! 3 at our house, and 4 others at grandparents' houses. They weren't too hard to install (in our older house it was more difficult than my inlaws because our walls aren't completely straight and we had to make some wall corrections) They are easy to open and nice and tall. The clear window is a plus visually, allowing light through and an open view of the baby and pets on the other side. The greatest feature is that the gates work both as wall mount and suspension gates. we have them mounted to the stairs and pet area, but in the occasional instance that i need a gate elsewhere (like to contain my son in one room while i mop the floor in another) i can just take it off and move it, it's so easy! .	
- 1	If you buy these, you may want to buy locally in case you need to return them.  I have seen raving reviews, but I just don't see why.These plugs just slip in to the socket and there is nothing to keep them in there like the dual release plugs (which we have and work).  Another option is to get the plate covers.These plugs are marketed for adults.  Even on the front of the box it notes push to pop out - save your nails and clip to vacuum cord when cleaning - never lose it again.  You won't break your nails on these plugs because they come out fairly easily - you don't even need to push their little button.  My 10 month old twins can wiggle these out - and they didn't even see me install/remove them.  So, you still have the electrical hazard as well as a choking hazard.I do not recommend this product based on my personal experience.I will add that I shared my sentiments with Safety 1st and they did contact me to try to resolve my dissatisfaction.	
- 1	Went through 2 packages of these... they don't seem to hold up well after being used a lot because the plastic is a bit flimsy.  After several uses, the plastic part of the round part of the spoon frays making some parts potentially sharp to sensitive baby's mouth.  Tried the Nuby spoons and these are a lot thicker and hold up a lot longer.  I've still been using them from the first package as they have not warped at all.Nuby Hot Safe Spoons 4 Pack BPA FREEThese aren't the exact ones I got but they seem similar.	
- 1	Sigh, wish I had turned to trusty Amazon and read all the horrible reviews before buying these on a whim from Target.  They worked great at first, but then we started experiencing the dreadful leaking problem.  Milk coming up out of the straw and leaking all over the place.  The only way to stop it is to unscrew the lid a bit to relieve the pressure build up, but then it is no longer leak proof.  Annoying.  Don't waste your money on these cups.  T I've switched all the straw lids to the Playtex Coolster Tumbler lids and have had much better luck:Playtex Coolster Tumblers, Insulated And Spill-Proof, BPA Free, Stage 4, Ages 2+, 9 Oz, (GREEN).	
1. 	When we first had our baby we were living in an apartment that did not have a dishwasher.  It was a PAIN to have to sterilize in boiling water, so we bought this.  WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!!  I was able to sterilize a few bottles, nipples, pacifiers etc at a time, right in the microwave.  I don't know how I lived without it!  Now that we own a home and have a dishwasher I no longer use it, but it is GREAT if you do not have a dishwasher!	
- 1	Do NOT buy this cup holder. I read the reviews and bought it anyway because I figured uppababy made this specifically for their strollers and thought how bad could it be? It's awful. It only attaches on the outside of the stroller so it hits/bumps into everything and the slightest bump will knock the whole thing off. When I fold up my stroller it falls off often. For the price they charge you would think they would make a better quality cup holder. Buy the Britax stroller organizer instead. You will not regret it.	
- 1	We bought this hoping to carry our 7 month old son.  Everyone had raved about Ergo carriers, so we decided to give it a try.  Upon receiving it, I noted that the instruction manual recommends that you only use it as a front carrier up to 6 months old.  Turns out that's for a really good reason.  Our 19 pound baby was WAY to heavy for me to front carry in this carrier.  We were both uncomfortable.So, I tried adjusting for a hip carry.  It's a horrible hip carrier.  The straps aren't straight, they're angled.  They dug into my neck, and put all the weight there.I wasn't interested in carrying a baby so young on my back, so I had to return it.As a side note - I had picked the Performance carrier because I wanted to carry him during the summer, and it's quite hot here.  Well, when I opened it up, I realized that wasn't going to happen.  The material is really thick, and the lining is black.  There's also no lining between you and the baby, so I knew we'd be sweating all over each other (just like with another carrier we'd tried).	
- 1	The picture is correct - there are no stems in these diaphragms.  Now I'm at a loss as to where to find the replacement parts.	
1. 	I bought this sleep swaddle because we needed to transition our baby from the cradle in our room to her crib.  We also live in a colder climate, so I wanted something that will keep her warm and toasty.She is almost 14 pounds and very long.  Halo says size small is for 13-18 pounds.  The first night, she worked her arms out several times.  The last time scared the garbage out of me because as she worked her arms out, she brought it up over her mouth.We normally wear the miracle blanket, which she can't get out of and doesn't cause me to have heart palpitations. I think we'll go back to that one.Update:  We had this same sleeper in a newborn size that she never wore because I thought she was too big for it.  So, I tried it on and it seems to fit her better.  We will try the smaller size tonight.  Maybe it's just sized incorrectly.Update #2: once we put her in the newborn size for a while longer, it worked much better. After about three more weeks in the smaller size, we moved up to this size and it fit and works much better.  I actually dread the day I need to de-swaddle her.	
- 1	Originally I loved the idea of being able to see at a glance whether the room was the correct temperature, and overall the look is very pleasing. But these are my issues with it:- Like other reviewers have mentioned, I do not think it is accurate. We also have a baby monitor that shows the temperature on the parent handsets, and they are rarely the same. I think the baby monitor shows the true temperature as it matches the aircon unit display.- I only have one shelf surface suitable for this thermometer, so it is placed about 1 ft from a lamp. If the lamp is on, this affects the thermometer. Not very useful.- Because of its basic design, you cannot program the temperature boundaries, which would be a nice feature. Personally I like the nursery to be around 69/70 degrees but according to this thermometer, that is too hot.- The thermometer doesn't seem to register some numbers. Like 68 degrees, for example. So it flips between 67 and 69, which happens to be over a color change point. So the egg has a mini disco light display for a while, fighting an internal battle to show 68. To be honest I'm not sure that it bothers my baby (who is 3m) but I find it VERY irritating when I am doing night feeds.So its a shame really. I haven't returned it only because the baby monitor I have doesn't show the temperature on the nursery unit, only on the handsets. So this is better than nothing. For now.	
- 1	This sippy cup has an air hole on the opposite side of the spout baby drinks out of and it leaks if baby turns it around and tips it - also, baby likes sticking his finger in that hole which makes it worse.	
- 1	I bought these cups based on the reviews here. My daughter was just weaned and I wanted to try a bunch of cups to figure out which were best. I had to teach her with a different brand straw cup, but she can now use these cups fine. She still leaks a bit from it, so if you want something leak proof, this is not cup for you.Edit: I am changing my review after getting tired of having my daughter pull the straw out and spill stuff on the floor. Buy a nuby or munchkin.	
1. 	My son loves these little colorful boats. Not only does he like chasing them around in the bathtub, he also likes playing with them outside of the tub. They are soft enough for him to use to chew on.	
1. 	We installed a mobile and the paint scratched off almost immediately. The mobile hardly got any use, In fact, the crib was in our nursery and our baby slept in our room in a pack and play so I was surprised the mobile scratched the paint. Other than that it's a great crib.	
- 1	The patterns are cute, but the bibs are really too thin.  My baby's shirt underneath gets wet too quickly with just a normal amount of drool.	
1. 	We are very happy with this tub.  It worked well for a few months.  It was great for transition from infant tub to the big tub.  Its nice quality and when you squeeze the duck bill it quacks!  Our baby girl loves it! : )	
- 1	These are a nice size, but unfortunately the fabric is not very soft. I'm going to look for something else to use on my baby.	
1. 	I got these latex nipples to have 'spare parts' for my vintage baby bottle collection.  It was a decent price, and saved me a trip to go look for them :)	
- 1	Not sure if it is the brest pillow itself but this is tough to put on the pillow.  It works but it's a hassle	
1. 	I am sure it works fine but just think about buying it before you do. If you are like me, as soon as you were pregnant you ordered absolutely everything you would possibly need. I do pump and exclusively breastfeed but I now realize I really don't think there is ever a time where I would need to pump in the car!	
1. 	I have tried almost every nipple for my twins. These work very well with my daughter who has acid reflux. She is spiriting up less since I started unsung these nipples. I am going to order more	
- 1	As a lactation educator, I was excited to see this product offered on Amazon Vine.  However, while it certainly has a use, the seemingly clever design is not at helpful as one would imagine.  Firstly, for a small breasted woman, the product is HUGE.  If you are large breasted this is probably appreciated, but this is definitely designed for more of a D cup than a B or C.  While it would seem this shouldn't matter, the product doesn't mold to the breast well for a smaller woman.Also, the hole in the center to shield the nipple from the temperature (can be used hot or cold) is clever, I suppose, but if you have a sore nipple, that is sometimes where you want relief!  Also, if you have a sore or damaged nipple the terry cloth cover is going to stick to the skin, since there is not hold there.The weakest part of this product though is that you can't heat it in the microwave.  You are meant to put it in hot water to heat it up.  When I have a hot/cold pack (I usually use flax seeds), I keep it in the freezer, so it is ready to use cold, and if I want it warm, pop it in the microwave.  If this were kept in the freezer, I can only imagine how many cycles of hot water it would have to go through before it could be useful.  And if not kept in the freezer, there would be a quite a wait time before it would ready as well.  I would not recommend just planning to use it in the microwave against instructions because the plastic is clearly not appropriate for this purpose.In general, I would see the only practical use for this product being for engorgement when cold is helpful.  However, the best remedy for engorgement is to NURSE OFTEN!!This was a nice idea...but I think a sock full of flax or rice is just as useful.	
- 1	I've read the reviews and everyone who has used this says that it worked for atleast 2 weeks for them. all mine is doing is vibrating my nipple (i know it sounds funny haha). it doesnt suck. i dont know what is wrong with it. I used it for the first time right now and all it is doing is making loud vibrating noises and i can see that my nipple is just vibrating in the suction cone thingy. im really sad because im going back to school and ONLY breastfeed and wanted to use this because it is sooo convenient in size to carry around. i do have a madela double pump but it is 4 times bigger to carry around and spent 60 bucks hoping this would help me carry on breastfeeding when i go back. =( guess ill be lugging around my madela. haha	
- 1	Very cool idea, but we can't use it because it doesn't fit our chairs correctly. The backs of our chairs are too high for it, because there's not enough material for the seat part to reach the seat on the chair-- it keeps my baby pulled up so there's a gap between her bottom and the chair. I've only used it once so far because of this. May try using it again when we go out and see if it fits chairs at restaurants or relatives houses better. It's been pretty useless so far...	
- 1	The brush is &#34;ok.&#34;  Only suitable for babies with very fine hair.  The bristles are so soft you can't really brush much.  Would be good for helping brush away cradle cap.  The comb is dreadful.  The fibers of the wood catch on my daughter's hair.  Horrible.  I don't recommend this at all unless by some chance I got the flawed one.	
1. 	Very pretty nursing cover, nice quality cloth, I do think it's not a necessary item but I haven't really started using it yet since still pregnant with first child.	
1. 	We love our Superyard!  The Superyard was the solution to our split level woes.  Our laundry area is on the lower level, which is not as baby-proofed/kid-friendly as the main floor.  With this yard, I have a safe place to put my toddler while I do laundry.  We have since added a second set to the Superyard to make a large play area in an otherwise not-so-baby-friendly space.The Superyard also collapses and travels well. we took it on a vacation to visit my grandparents in their very much not-kid-friendly home.  The gate came in handy for blocking off steep stairwells and rooms with breakable things. It measured the size of one panel and about 6&#34; deep and fit easily in the trunk of my sedan with room to spare.	
- 1	Okay, It is a really nice toy, BUT... my son has NEVER played with it. He is now 9 months old and I got this in December. Its just collecting dust. I know this has many great reviews but if your baby is like mine... gets bored of toys easily dont get this. The bead maze should be great lol	
- 1	The plastic is a little flimsy and few of the lids broke a little not allowing them to seal properly.  I liked the idea...but unless you are making baby food every few days you would need like 5 of these...and then would have no space in your freezer.  I make baby food and freeze in ice cube trays...then transfer them into ziploc bags.  I only use these if I run out of ice cube trays.  For their purpose they are okay, but are really an unnecessary product.	
1. 	*UPDATE* I still really like these bottles. However, we ended up switching to the Standard bottles versus the Wide. She prefers the standard nipples, and it has helped to keep more milk in her mouth instead of on her clothes. Just FYI. I think it just depends on your baby. Some like wider, some like smaller. I've also noticed that the standard bottles NEVER leak! Sometimes the wide bottles would leak for no reason, and I'd have to reassemble them multiple times to get it to stop.After trying Tommee Tippee, Playtex Drop-Ins, & Dr. Brown's bottles, we finally found a bottle that works for our baby girl. While we loved the Drop-Ins, it started to become tedious to squeeze all the extra air out of the bag each time we made a bottle. With the Dr. Browns, I got sick of scrubbing all the various parts. Too much trouble! I decided to give the Ventaire's a try, and I'm so glad I did! Even though there are several parts to the bottle, I just throw them all in the sink with hot, soapy water, let them soak, and then rinse them. Voila! Putting the bottles together is a breeze, and the only time I've had issues with leaking is when the cap isn't tight enough, which is my fault. I've definitely noticed a decrease in her air intake, and she burps much more easily after eating. Cosmetically, they are super cute, and I like that the colors are gender neutral. Overall, I love these bottles, and you certainly can't beat the price. Give them a try! :)	
1. 	What did our parents do besides clean up our messes? I mean really. I spent so much time cleaning up my Zachy's Cheerios and snackies before I got this cup. Just the other week, my mom spilled all of his snackies on the floor when opening one of his snack containers! I went the next day, Monday and bought one of these Snack Trap cups. Granted, it costs a good bit more than those little cups at a local Dollar Tree, but hey, isn't it worth it not to have to clean up after your little one AND the grandparents? ;-) Anyway, spend the extra dollars and get one!!! It is well worth the money. My little man got the hang of it after one showing.  He loves to shake it and listen to the snackies inside, then he just reaches in that cute little hand and grabs a snack and just grins. He can take it all over the house and I don't have to go behind him with the vacuum. Now keep in mind, those Cheerios are small and sometimes they do come out, but only one to two at a time. Can't be 100% perfect, right? I highly recommend this cup for any mom or grandmom that is on the go or even just relaxing at home. 5 stars!	
1. 	I bought one of these a while back when my daughter was teething (she is 15 months now, and almost all of her teeth now!) and they worked great with ice cubes. When she started eating more solid foods, we put bananas in there, and even some apple slices. I like how the mesh only allows a small amount of food to come through. The only downside to these, are how messy they are. But kids are already messy, and it's better than straight handing them a banana. She loved sucking on the ice cubes, and at times, it would be the only thing that would help her teeth. On a side note, make sure you put them in water RIGHT AFTER you are done using it. It will become way too hard to wash them otherwise, and I had to buy a whole new one after I made the mistake of leaving food in it .	
- 1	My husband went to pick up some more Gerber waterproof multi-use pads for the changing table since he keeps throwing them away when they get poop on them... I wish he would stop since they clean up great in the wash.Anyway, he picked these up instead thinking they were better since they were a little more.  Wrong.  They are small first of all, they are pretty much the same size as the baby but since when does anything that comes out of baby contain itself to one small area?  We dried them on low but the plastic is still a little melted.  We use these in the kitchen now for drying pots & pans & they work great!  We use the Gerber pads for the changing table, they are great, you can dry them on high & no piles or anything.  After 5 months they have a little fraying on the edges, I can live with that.BTW... I gave it 2 stars only because I use them for drying dishes now & like them for that.	
1. 	I've used it once and thought it was great except it made me hot and sweaty.  Plus it could be uncomfortable if you are breastfeeding.  My husband used it a handful of times and said it was comfy also.  Wouldn't recommend using this in the summer.	
- 1	Some people rave about fuzzy bnz but I did not like them.  They ran small.  They have the snaps but they are much smaller than other brands.  Once my baby was around 9 months the diapers seemed small even with the adjustments let out.  They also leaked.  They worked well when she was newborn and not urinating much but around 6 months a fuzzy bunz could not be left on for half an hour.  They leaked around the legs every time.  If she poo'd it too would leak out the legs.	
1. 	I love having the option and convenience of this handheld pump in situations where I need to pump a small amount or just one side and don't want to go through the whole set-up of my electronic pump. It's nice to keep this pump ready to go during night-time feedings so that if baby only feeds from one side, I can easily pump the other side. Took a few tries to get used to holding it and to become efficient, but now I'm very fast with it. Good pump strength mimics electric pump if you have a good seal with the breast shield. Easy to clean and easy to use - definitely recommend for breastfeeding moms!	
- 1	Don't bother with these.  I used to like these a lot but then they discontinued them and then came out with these ones that like exactly the same but the quality is crap now!!  The large sponge tore after 3 uses.  (FYI, I have the Medela bottles.)  And the little nipple sponge is not as resilient any more; it's a cheap sponge. If you want something similar, I llike this one:  http://www.amazon.com/Rotary-Spinning-Sponge-Bottle-Cleaner/dp/B00JQSO1L6/ref=sr_1_28?ie=UTF8&qid=1405008036&sr=8-28&keywords=bottle+nipple+sponge	
- 1	For those of you that don't know, there was a version of this in the nineteenth century that KILLED babies. The milk couldn't be cleaned out of the tubes completely and it would rot and cause severe diarrhea which sometimes ended up being fatal. I'm not sure if this tube would have the same problem or if they have since developed some way of cleaning out the ENTIRE tube since then, but I'm not risking my child's life for convenience! [...]	
- 1	leaks, was a pain to wash since the straw was always dirty. i have the playtex ones that work much better and doesn't leak.	
- 1	Well, the organizer itself is way cute. It's sturdy, has a decent amount of room to pack stuff into, and the giraffe is adorable. However, the organizer I received is missing one very essential element required to actually hang this so called &#34;wall organizer.&#34; Mine is missing the holes with which to hang it. So, I must either return and exchange it (*hassle*) and hope that I get one which didn't have someone asleep on the assembly line or, somehow make my own holes. I am afraid if I make my own holes the organizer won't hold up and damage the material. Harumph.	
1. 	We love this thing.  I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to &quot;unravel&quot; but it wasn't bad at all.  I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.  We bought a second one for upstairs and we're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions.	
1. 	We bought this 3 months after the baby was born. I absolutely wish we would have gotten him used to sleeping in this from the time he was born.  I feel confident that he is safe while sleeping in the co sleeper. The directions were simple. You just need a bit of patience. I actually recommend this to all of my friends, especially if they are breast feeding.  The 'mattress' is very firm, but not too firm.  We will definitely be using this again if we have another baby!	
- 1	these medela nipples (regardless of which size) always collapse when then baby eats from them. granted, it's handy that they fit right onto the bottles. but that's it.	
1. 	This is a great simple toy. My son loves the veggies and the crate and I love that the materials are natural and organic. He is learning about vegetables and about putting things in and out of the crate--which is also a great teething toy. The wood/fabrics are not treated with any chemicals so I have peace of mind that he is not exposed to anything harmful.	
- 1	Stopped after 4 seconds--straight out of the package.  I could not get it to go any longer without touching/tapping/pressing on it to nudge it more.  Then my 4 yr old tried to fix it and it went maybe 20 seconds, when perfectly balanced flat on counter top.  The arrow doesn't even line up with the &#34;0&#34; &#34;1&#34; and &#34;2&#34; marks.  Looks cute and simple, but SO disappointed, especially for the price!!!  I knew I was taking a risk based on prior reviews, but geez...next time I take a risk on such an inconsequential item, I'll make sure it doesn't cost so much.  Now, if this mom of 3 can find time, I'll see if there's a return policy.	
- 1	Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)	
- 1	I bought this for my daughter because it is spill proof, looks nice and has a soft silicon spout. It has a hard cover which protects the silicon spout, which is great because the little one loves to drop her cup. The problem is, it leaks! There are these 3 indents on the silicon part that should align with the three indents on the plastic cover, but for whatever reason, when I screw the top shut the alignment is always off. 100% of the time! I have tried little tricks to make sure it remains aligned after I screw it shut, but the alignment always shifts and then the cup leaks. I never got to use the cup and have simply put it in the category of things that didn't work for me.	
- 1	This product is laughable at best. It definitely falls into the category of &#34;Stuff to Convince First Time Parents to Buy.&#34; It really doesn't even do it's intentional job well - to shield baby from sun, as it has openings on both sides where sun easily seeps into and can burn baby. Don't waist your money on a product that is really useless. Go buy a Coolibar UVA/UVB blanket instead and cover your stroller/baby seat with that. ALSO don't DON'T put this on your carseat in the car. You'll burn the baby up, and carseats are hot enough as it is!	
- 1	I gifted this to a friend. It worked well for all of 1 day, and completely stopped working after that. They have since bought a simple one (unknown brand) which is working just fine. Amazon was amazing and gave me the refund even though my friends had thrown away all the packaging. I returned it in a sandwich / freezer bag.	
1. 	I never wanted one of these little bucket holders with my first child.  I thought it would break.  When my second child came along, we got the double strollers, also Baby Trend, one duo front-to-back with the jump seat rider and one double-ride jogger.  Both are good for different purposes.  I decided to get this Snap N' Go stroller because it was available for a low price, and I thought it might work 2-3 times while my son still fit in the carrier, because my daughter has been wanting to walk instead of ride.  Wow, was I wrong about it! It is well-made, and SO convenient.  It is extremely light and sturdy.  I can fold and lift it into the trunk with one hand. The carrier snaps on and off easily, and feels very secure.  There is also an extra strap for security, too.  The basket is very spacious and holds my diaper bags and purse (neither of which are small, with two kids) easily! I have to take the carrier off to get to the bags, but it's not been any big deal for us. I love the cup holders and the little compartment holds my keys and cell phone perfectly.  I have taken it to the L.A. County Fair, and malls, and museums, and it gets used daily--which I never thought would happen.  My other two strollers are collecting dust, for now.  At least until my baby is out of the carrier, because I just don't have a need for them now.  I never would have guessed this little thing would work so well for us.  Who knew? I highly recommend this Snap N' Go stroller.	
1. 	I LOVE miracle blankets. The colors are great, and the fabric is soft, thin, stretchy, and durable. Most of all, they allow ANYONE to swaddle--even someone like me who never got the hang of using square blankets. If you use it twice a day with a fussy, fed, clean baby (ie, a baby who is probably overstimulated and doesn't have another more obvious complaint), you can literally change the quality of your life and that of your baby. Would use it in combination with the Happiest Baby on the Block video. Don't just buy 1. Buy at least 2 or 3. Along with a fun bottle drying rack, they're probably my favorite, not-entirely-necessary baby product.	
- 1	These curled up around the edges. I'd look around. There are better ones out there. Also they are pretty rough feeling.	
- 1	We absolutely NEVER used this once. I would seriously recommend just getting an app on your phone that does all this and more. This may be great for folks who don't have smart phones, or whose spouses take equal amount of watch time with little one, but I am more with our daughter than my husband, so I just use the app on my phone which will track everything over time and show trends, etc.	
1. 	Love this dispenser.  I had a hand-me-down one that was absolutely horrible but this one is very easy to use.  Easy to open and close to add formula, I like that it converts to a snack container later, it turns easily between compartments, and the handle to the top for dispensing formula is made so that it will stay standing up or flip all the way back when open.  Not sure why having to shake the container when dispensing the formula is a problem, this isn't a big deal for me.	
- 1	I guess it is supposed to work fine, but I live in Florida and my baby would just sweat so much with this!  I am not even sure I could use it in winter... overall I do not like it, too big, too hot if a material	
- 1	I tried another style lock  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TGFK1Q/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 on our Frigidaire oven door and it wasn't the right design.When I saw the picture of this particular lock I knew right away it was a Frigidaire oven. The 3 star rating almost swayed me not to order but based on the photo I knew it would position properly on our oven. I was right. Easy to install, fits correctly, and works as it should. Hoping it will last but for now very satisfied.** Update Sept 27 - the hinge of this ended up breaking after a couple months, we had to take off and buy a different style. I wouldn't buy again given that this broke only after a couple months of use.	
1. 	I purchased this product for my 16 month son to use for an upcoming plane trip. We purchased the dog model of this. The product we received was very true to the picture and seems to be very high quality. The fabric is very soft and feels as though it would hold up well to a few cycles in the washer.  Initially, my son wasn't a fan of having it around his neck, but we demonstrated how it was used on ourselves and he seemed to warm up to the idea. Then we used in the car a few times when he was about to zonk out.  Overall, it is a little big for him, but not enough for it to be completely useless. He is a toddler, so I'm hoping he can grow into and get a few years of good use out of it.  I will say while it's been helpful in the car, it doesn't completely eliminate that 'head forward hang' that sometimes happens when he falls asleep and slumps over.  This seems to help a bit so that it doesn't seem quite as uncomfortable, but doesn't solve the issue completely. That said, I don't blame this as that is more an issue of the car seat dimensions.Overall, we've been very happy with this and my son has enjoyed carrying it around with him. I think this will be a great purchase for upcoming trips!	
- 1	I was super excited to get these for my 15 month old.  I adore cloth diapering and heard good things about these flats.  I was unimpressed with them when they shrunk after washing and drying them the first time out of the package!  I would not recommend them at all.  My flower sack towels from Target work better.  They didn't shrink.	
1. 	My son loves this swing now at 7 weeks old. He actually took his first two naps in it yesterday. I normally hold him almost all the time, but yesterday was in the upper 90s and I just needed to set him down for a while to cool off. He fell asleep.He loves how the swing goes from side to side, and about 2 weeks ago, he started noticing the mirror and mobile up above.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the swing is just a little too fast. We still have it on the lowest setting at 7 weeks old. He hated it at first, and I didn't like him being in it anyway since it was so fast.It's perfect now.	
- 1	The name of the company is really misleading. These products are made in China. Just sayin'. So, if you're looking to buy American made sheets, this is not it.	
1. 	We have this over our children's bedroom door.  Their stuffed toys are visible, but they are out of the way and not taking up any floor space, cupboard space, or toy box space.  It's a wonderful, sturdy net that keeps our lovable furry friends right there!	
1. 	I bought this as a transition between crib and bed for our grandsonWe still have not used it yet, but the time is coming soon. My grandsonDid try it and felt it was great.	
- 1	I totally agree with the previous reviewer.  Our daughter LOVES NUK nipples & pacifiers, but these are a pain in the rear to try to find in the middle of the night.  Heck, they're a pain to try to find any time - even if she drops it in the middle of the day, if the pacifier falls with the red NUK face down, it literally blends in with whatever it's on.  Very frustrating. Go with the ones with color.	
- 1	I contacted Dr. Brown's the first time the cap snapped off my formula dispenser. (I sent the broken one back to &#34;quality control&#34;). They sent me a new one and after a few months of daily use, it snapped off again. I'm going to try another brand dispenser. I don't like the short munchkin type dispensers, the tops are hard to get off to refill and I like the tall, skinny design of Dr. Brown's. Not sure what to try next. :-(	
1. 	I love having this for road trips because I don't have to haul a whole diaper bag into the rest areas. It is great for toddlers when they don't need as much stuff except for diapers and wipes. I don't use the wipes case, I just throw in a small pack of wipes and it works fine. I have been able to fit in 5 diapers, a small bottle of hand sanitizer, and a light change of clothes (onsie and leggings).	
1. 	When me and my husband started looking around for which bottles we wanted to get for our twins there was just so many to pick from. Between brands and liners or no liners. What were we to do. We had a lot of friends who just had had babies and many of them got the Avent bottles as gifts. I did some compare and reg for both avent bottles, ventair and one set of the platex nursery bottles the ones without the liners. These bottles by far our both my son and daughers fav. I always thought these bottles had a werid bulky look to them. I thought they would be harder to store in a diaper bag rather than the traditional shaped bottle. Looks meant nothing! My babie took to these bottles right away. We ended up taking all the other bottles back and getting all Avent bottles. We do have a few Gerber bottles that we are starting to use now that the babies are getting older (6 months). But ever since day one both of the children took wonderfuly to the bottle. I dont know if its the shape of the nipple or the design of the bottle that does it. But it works! They are SO easy to clean. Unlike the smaller bottles where it hard to get in and clean them! My children both take the avent took very well. The avent brand is actualy the one brand my daughter will take. SHe will not take any other nuk. My son on the other hand it doesnt matter which brand. But mainly we have avent nuks. All around this is a great buy for a new mommy and daddy!	
- 1	I really wanted to like this bag. I read a lot of reviews before selecting this one but it definitely didn't live up to the hype. The material or craftsmanship is lacking because from the very beginning I was contending with fraying strings at every pocket. Here at 6 months I have only used this bag a hand full of times and it seems like it will not make it to a year. I prefer skip hops other products to this one-which doesn't seem to be made of quality materials on the inside.	
1. 	This toilet seat works great.  Nice design, fits easily on toilet.  When our son was 3 he was able to attach and remove it on his own with no issues.  Easy to clean.  I recommend this item (and the matching step stool too!).	
1. 	These things are the greatest thing ever invented! They are a momma's best friend for a toddler. And my daughter loves them too...can't go wrong!	
1. 	My son adores these bath toys, their perfect for little hands and he likes to chew on them when he takes baths as well.	
- 1	Been shedding no matter how many times I wash it. Now the one side is completely covered in lint balls.	
- 1	I bought this for my grandson, but it wasn't what I expected.  I tried to use it, but he would not even try it-he did not like it at all. I can not recommend it, but it may be great for someone elses baby.	
- 1	After reading other peoples reviews on this crib I decided to go ahead and buy it anyways. In my mind there were way more good reviews then bad, so i figured most bad reviews were people being picky about things. I told myself I could live with a scratch or 2 no problem. So we received the crib and opened the box. First piece had 3 scratches and 2 dents in the wood. OK I can deal. Then the second piece we checked was just as bad. Then the 3rd and so on. So back to Amazon it went! BTW they have great customer service and there were no problems on sending it back. They even paid for the return shipping. Rather than return this crib and get a replacement sent, we decided to go to buy buy baby and buy one there. Who knows how many try's it would have taken before we got a crib that was ok enough. I hope Graco realizes this keeps occurring and decides to do something about it. In the end don't waist your time and energy on this crib. Buy something else!	
- 1	Cheap Cheap Cheap Only thing good is the finger nail clippers. We got a better pair free from hospital. Everything just screams cheap!	
1. 	I searched high and low for a shopping cart cover for my daughter. She is just under 6 months old and isn't quite sitting up on her own. I asked a lot of friends and family about their covers and what they liked and didn't like. I read numerous reviews on here and I was hesitant to order this cover because the of the negative reviews regarding its size. I took this to Wal-mart and got a big size cart (in my area they are all large).  I put it in the seating area and my oh my it fit perfectly! It covered everything! I just can't say enough good things about this cover! I have no idea what those negative reviews are talking about. It is very cute, soft and feels like it will easy to clean. I love the toy hooks too. Just so many great things, possibly one of my favorite baby products I've bought so far.	
1. 	i use this cuz my baby is too short but already active and wants to bounce/etc. so i use this under his feet. later it can be used for potty training, and it is also a step stool in the kitchen area for the shelves that a just a little too high for me. love this, use it all the time for everything. does slide on my bamboo hardwood floors tho, the antislip doesnt work perfectly with smaller weights like a baby.	
1. 	I have had no problems at all with this pump and would recommend it to anyone who needs one for occasional use.  It is quick, comfortable, and convenient.  I prefer this one to the expensive double electric pump we rented for the first month.	
1. 	Great color! I have a Bob stroller as our main walking stroller, but wanted a lighter weight stroller for my vehicle. This was the lightest stroller I found, 11lbs. I know there are A LOT cheaper umbrella strollers out there, but none that had the shoulder straps and was light weight at the same time. The only minor problem is having to remember to retract the canopy before compacting the stroller up, I tend to forget! It has not damaged it though by forgetting, but it may be bad if you do it too many times.	
- 1	I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had. The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side..but the third one was a charm! My daughter loves this swing! The seat is very soft and padded well. The headrest is a must! At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile! The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing. I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound. The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great! I would recommend this swing to anyone!!! I would also recommend getting through (...) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item. Hope this helps you decide!!!	
- 1	The voice is too low that baby can only hear it when the surrounding is exactly in silence, which is very rare.	
1. 	I absolutely hate Diaper Genies.  I think they're completely useless and having to keep purchasing rings for them etc...It gets so expensive!  I am so happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It's compact and the foot pedal is easy to use. We've put some real bombs in there and as soon as the lid closes down you'd never know they were there! We did purchase the scent rounds to put in the compartment in the top and it makes changing the bags easier on the nose.  But if you go through diapers as much as we do; you're changing this thing every couple of days and the stink never really gets time to just sit around.  Love it!	
- 1	The mobile doesn't stick out far enough, so the little deer get stuck on the pole as it tries to spin. It defeats the purpose of a mobile.	
- 1	The bib stained after the first use. My son was able to take it off and I found it for for half the price at a different store.	
1. 	SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but  when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib). By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds*  I WISH IT COULD BE  MORE  SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!	
- 1	The sound quality is terrible and the battery life is tragic. If I don't bring the plug in everywhere, I lose battery. It picks up alot of static and any cell phone within 10 feet causes feedback. I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.	
- 1	This pillow must be designed for women with very short torsos.  I find that if I try to curl it around me, it feels like it is attacking me.  The pregnant woman shown in the photo fits neatly into the inner curve but I wonder if she is holding the top in place, because when I tried to use it that manner it would curl under my neck.The cover is scratchy,  you really cannot put your face on it.  So you will need to add the cost of a cover to this if you are going to use it for sleeping.I breastfed two kids, and used a U shaped pillow at times. I can see that this might be better for breastfeeding, since you can get a double &#8220;height&#8221; by wrapping it around yourself.  However, it is a fight to get it into that position, and you cannot just get up easily with it wrapped around you.It is much harder than a regular pillow and also thinner than it looks in the photo.  I also washed the slip cover to see if that would soften it up, but it did not. And getting the slipcover back on was a monumental struggle, like wrestling a reluctant snake into a tight jacket.  It actually reminded me of a topology problem and took almost 20 minutes to accomplish.  This means if you use it to prop up your baby and he/she spits up on it you will have to face trying to get the clean cover back on.Back to my full length body pillow, this one is just physically too hard, too scratchy and fights me too much.	
1. 	This booster is light and well built.  The unit is easy to clean, and my only real wish is that the center strap was adjustable in height. Other than that, my kid's happy, I'm happy.  I recommend it.	
- 1	I would not purchase this again. I don't know if it's just the one we got, or if it's a design flaw, but the cup part falls off CONSTANTLY on our Britax B Agile. It falls off when we collapse the stroller, if we brush up against it, if we brush up against another object (I'm not talking a big bump, it falls off it it brushes up against clothing hanging on a rack at a store, and probably would fall off if we even looked at it wrong. lol. Drinks also shake back and forth like crazy when you're rolling the stroller on even a smooth surface and spill all over the stroller. Our water bottles generally don't sit in it level for some reason.Would not recommend.	
- 1	At first this worked great.....then after about one month of use, it leaked when I turned it on.  However, I didn't notice it and completely forgot to turn the valve off after I used it.  A few hours later, I had a small flood on my hands.  We had to rip up the floor and baseboard and completely replace them in the entire bathroom.  My fault for forgetting to leave it on, however it definitely shouldn't leak like that!  And what a horrible design that you have to turn the stupid switch on and off anyway.....busy, sleep deprived moms aren't going to remember to turn the stupid thing off.  Faulty product, DO NOT BUY!!!!!	
- 1	I always thought wipe warmers were kind of silly and frivolous. But my husband wanted to get this item because our newborn boy screams whenever a cold wipe touches his bottom. It had good reviews so thought we would give it a try. When we got it we were excited to see if it would help and got it all plugged in and set up. Based on what another reviewer said we only put a few wipes in instead of a whole package. Well we've only had this warmer a few days and we hate it!!! We change baby on the floor and the warmer is on a stand right next to where we change him. By the time you get a couple wipes out and go to use them, they are cold. Literally 2 seconds later. I suppose if you have this warmer sitting like 6 inches from where you change the baby and can grab them instantly before you wipe their bottom, it MIGHT work. But we also noticed even when you take the wipes out, they aren't all that warm to begin with. I expected a lot more, and pretty much this item is useless. :( Really disappointing.	
- 1	I have done a thorough internet search and cannot find out where these diapers were manufactured.  I see no backup for GOTS or organic certification.  They smell of some chemical coming out of the package.  I was excited to use these but I'm not going to even prep these.  They are going back.	
- 1	I should have listened to other reviewers and avoided these sippy cups. They come in a two-pack, which is nice, but they leak. If the cup is laying on its side, liquid leaks between the threads of cup (where the cap screws onto the cup). The cap was screwed on tightly, and it still leaked. After 5 minutes of the cup laying on its side, I had a coaster-sized puddle on my carpet. One of the cups leaks more than the other, so I think there might be quality control problems and that is why some people don't have issues with these cups.	
- 1	I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it.  However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers.  I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job.  This is not what you want.  Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)	
1. 	I got these bibs for my drooling baby girl.  I perfer solid colored drool bibs so they don't distract from all her cute outfits.  I love the colors also, they work with most all her clothes.  They are very soft on both sides with the waterproof liner in the inside.  They don't make that crinkle sound when she wears them and they lay nice and flat on her chest.  They are for babies 3 to 12 months with the neck.  My baby is 6 1/2 months and they fit her nice.  I only use these for drool so they stay nice.  I've not had them very long, but long enough to run them through the washer AND the dryer several times and they still come out nicely.For 10 of them and the price it's worth it because I have just had the hardest time finding anything like them in local stores.  Drool bibs are hard to come by with the waterproof lining as all the stores only seem to sell the cotton ones; which we all know a little drooler will just soak right through anything else.  Love and recommend these bibs.	
- 1	This product works and helps my baby get off to sleep.  BUT!!! As soon as the 45 minutes is up the sound shuts off and my baby wakes up.  If anyone knows how to make it go continuously, please let me know!	
1. 	We love the Summer Infant 3 piece Oral Care Set. The finger gum and tooth clean/massager was great from 10mos. to 12mos. While my little ones teeth were coming in, she didn't mind us cleansing her gums/teeth. At about 11mos. when she was really teething, she started using the gum massager the one with the bluehead. After turning 12mos. she loves to brush her own teeth. We have her start and then help her finish. All in all a great product. Easy for little hands to hold. Helps with teaching little ones to enjoy brushing. Product has held up well under normal intended use. 5 stars!	
1. 	I am not a full-time co-sleeper, but I did find this to be very useful when I did co-sleep. It is very portable (light weight and foldable). I mostly used it to nap with my little one or occasionally to sleep when he was first born. I would imagine they can grow out of pretty quickly as it would become too short. I definitely think you could use it for a good 3-4 months, but not sure you could use it much longer than that.	
- 1	it held onto the wall pretty good with pressure mounting however trying to lengthen and shorten it is a Pain! I hate doing it, it wobbles and you gotta do each side little by little rotating until its the right length...	
1. 	Best way to cube home made baby food. Here's what u do: get two sets of these, cuisinart baby food maker, baby food cook book cooking for baby & ur ready. I love to make up new flavors for son & all I do is steam in maker & then pur&eacute;e in same machine & pour into these trays. Then one day after freezing them, I just let tray sit on counter for couple minutes & then turn over onto lid & pop out cubes & wrap 2 together on press & seal wrap & put in freezer bag. Then, when need them pull out of freezer & microwave couple for minute, add some rice cereal & done!! Super easy & healthy for my son & he loves my food way more than store junk. Also these trays have taken beating at my house w/ how much used & washed in dishwasher (top rack) & still look great & no cracks yet!!	
- 1	Product should clearly state can't be used on a platform bed, or any bed that does not need a box spring.  Rail must clear box spring or lip by a significant amount in order to work. Had to return the item and had to pay a restocking fee. Really Annoying.	
- 1	It doesn't fit any of our doorways.  Wish it did, because it otherwise looked like a very nice product.Amazon made the return process very easy.	
1. 	and I have still come back to them in the end as they have kept me from the dreaded nipple confusion. I rate them 2nd only to the Dr.Brown wide neck, and that is only because of the gas issue. They are super easy to break down and clean. And yes, I had the same problem with the nipple leaking at first. However, after a couple runs through the dishwasher and sometime just opening and reclosing the bottle, I haven't had the problems since.	
- 1	I recently purchased the White Door Guardian Patio Door Lock and while it does it's job there are a few issue I have with it.1)  It's not white.  Its an off white and no where near the normal disigner white that a patio door is.2)  The Product Description states, There is no drilling required , just run 2 screws into a keeper plate provided and then into the upper track.  I can tell you right now you will be doing soem drilling.  In fact it comes with a cutout to help with the drill locations.I figuired based off the decsiption that the keeper plate would need to be mounted in the upper track using screws but you also have to screw the lock system into the door itself.  It comes with 4 screws that need to be predrilled to mount itself to the door.3)  Shipping cost was too much for such a small product.  Only reason I went with it dispite the cost was the fact that I was mislead to believe there was no drilling required.In the end if you want a sliding door lock this will work but in my shoes I feel a little cheated.	
- 1	Before my 8lb son was born I bought Thirsties duo snap wraps size 1 and Osocozy infant prefolds. Upon bringing him home even though thirsties claims to fit 6lbs-18lbs diapers were too bulky and got in the way of his cord so I went online and purchased some extra small diaper covers from various brands. When this bummis cover came in I loved the looks of it, it appears well made but as far as sizing goes it is WAY off! It says it fits up to 10 lbs and I cant imagine a baby over 7lbs fitting in the newborn size. I tried to return it but could not because I had opened the package, super disappointing : ( I also purchased xtra-small thirsties wraps and those worked out great for a newborn- I highly recommend	
- 1	I am so surprised that during the first and second wash, it piles badly, there are loose 'cotton balls' on the swaddle, and they fly all over the place in my laundry yard. I used a lint roller to manually remove the lint to wash a 3rd time and it is still piling, though not so bad anymore. I'snt it supposed to be pre-washed? I also noticed a chemical smell when it came in a box, it is also not as soft as I would expect it to be.This is an expensive item, for this price point, i expect much better quality.	
1. 	I bought this when we had our first child instead of buying a bath bathtub.  This is much cheaper, and much more efficient.  Also, this stores much more easily.	
1. 	I love these feeders for bananas!  Are they messy and a pain to clean...Yes!!  But, it can occupy your child as he/she feeds herself.  My favorite use of this is when we are flying with our daughter.  It keeps her hands and mouth busy during take off.  To clean the mesh, just let it soak for a bit and then use your fingers to get the food out of the crevices.  It takes a little time, but I definitely think this has been a great product to use with my daughter.	
- 1	I received these as a gift.  The material is very soft and I love the pattern but it started pilling after one wash.  also it comes undone easily as a swaddle. i like it better as a stroller blanket.	
- 1	I really want to try these since the Dino Dudes print (no longer an option) is the same as my twins' nursery so I bought 2. At 11 and 12.5 pounds the covers are still too big. I am pairing them with a Best Bottom insert and maybe they are just too trim. I'll keep trying them..	
1. 	Awesome hand pump. Very easy to use and clean. Great for pumping On a regular basis or for expressing milk when engorged. Medelas high quality as usual for a great price! Love it!	
1. 	Bought this for my girls (turtle for my son).  it is adorable even off.  The lights are great (although after 3 months of nightly use the green doesn't seem to work as well) and project onto the ceiling & walls.This does say not suitable for children under 3, but we put it in the middle of the room while the children are in cribs at night so age isn't an issue for us.The turtle by cloud b is also fantastic, my son loves it.i only wish they could stay on longer (after 45 minutes my son is still awake and we have to go and turn the turtle back on).This is a great gift and I look forward to buying more cloud b products for my family.	
1. 	My son has been playing with these since 8 months old and its his favorite toy. He will cry if his stacking cups are not around!Colorful, easy to stack from big to small or small to big order, he loves to knock them over.Durable, I've washed these in a bleach solution several times and they hold up great. Also can be cleaned in the dishwasher!	
- 1	Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!	
1. 	I am happy with this product, although it is smaller than expected, it is a good quality and small enough for little hands to hold.	
- 1	I bought these for my teething toddler twins in the hopes that they would give them more relief than a regular pacifier. Saying they didn't like them would be an understatement. They literally screech and chuck these at the walls with the force of a major league pitcher. Even if there is no other pacifier in a five mile vicinity, they hate these on sight and refuse to even touch them. My two love pacifiers, if you can't already tell. These are not pacifiers. Ah well. Hey, I tried.	
- 1	I ordered the flannel sheets and was shipped these instead. My husband didnt know so he washed them and I couldnt return them. They are very scratchy and not good material. There are better ones out there.	
1. 	This is a great little stool.  We also purchased the matching toilet seat trainer for our three year old.  This stool works great in the bathroom for brushing teeth or climbing onto potty.  It has an attractive design and a non-slip grip on the bottom so there's no risk for falls.  I recommend this item.	
1. 	My son really likes these nipples.  I needed extra because the playtex bottle set didnt come with enough slow flow nipples.  The wide are great for breastfeeding moms.  At 6 months old, my son was 20lbs so there are no nipple confusion issues!	
- 1	There are no words to describe the frustration level you experience trying to get the lid on or off these cups. You have to have the (very bendy) top perfectly aligned to get it to screw on properly, and it will almost always take several tries. If you screw it on too tight, you can not get it off (again, owning to the bendiness). The straws are flimsy and if your child removes them and plays with them at all, they bend and crack, becoming useless.The regular Take & Toss were no longer useful to us when my child figured out how to take the top off. I got him some of the Munchkin straw cups because of the twist on lid, but could not find more than one set at the time. I got these thinking that they would be similar. They were recycled a short time later.	
1. 	I bought one used from a coworker.  My first daughter loved the swing so I figured this would be a good investment.  I love that the seat is more upright than laid back.  It's easy to fold, lightweight and works wonderfully. The only thing I would change is the swing seems to move very slowly (I have new batteries). Of course, I did get mine used so this could be due to that??	
1. 	As I said in a previous review of the Starter product in this line, thePlaytex VentAire Advanced BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, the VentAire system is a vast improvement over the old standard every Mom, Nanny, Babysitter, Grandma or other caregiver is familiar with - the Playtex Nurser sytem with those plastic bag inserts that were supposed to create a vacuum as baby fed, cutting down on gas and discomfort.  While those WERE once a massive improvement, VentAire is the newest texhnology for allowing better pressure equalization, and a more cormftable feeding experience for both mother an baby that more closely mimics the natural position of Breastfeeding.  This is done by using specially angled bottles and the exlcusive VentAire disk system.  I started out with the Newborn set so I'm now a little more adept at inserting the disks into place and using the bottle itself.  I'm pleased that they are making it clear that their bottles are BPA-free since that's an issue that now concerns most new parents or experienced parents with a new baby after a long time off Bottle Duty.I have read the complaints about the slow flow nipple and I have found that I did not encounter anywhere near the frustration others have reported.  However, that was for a Newborn sized bottle.  It did take a little getting used to but before swithing to the Fast Flow and perhaps creating waterfalls of milk or formula all over your infants face and your chest, check out the Medium Flow Nipples available here on Amazon:Playtex BPA Free VentAire Advanced Silicone Nipples, 2 Pack, Medium FlowThe set  pictured here is a 9 ounce set of 3 bottles all with the FAST FLOW nipples.  If you are already needing a 9 Ounce Bottle, you probably will not need the Slow flow Nipple anyway but if you do, you should know that you can by the Slow Flow, Medium Flow and Fast Flow Nipples separately in 2-packs here at Amazon.  I picked up some Medium Flow Nipples locally and had some better success with them earlier on.  I had a difficult time finding them but I'm pleased to see that AMAZON carries all three Nipple stages.  It's best to stock up on those since you'll go through the Nipples faster than the bottles themselves, which are petty sturdy and easy to clean.I don't use a bottle warmer since I pump.  I warm the milk up from the refrigorator in the Pumps packaging.  I cannot see how a traditional Bottle-Warmer would accomodate this new system.  Personally, I've never had the need myself but I Imagine this may be a deal breaker for some Moms.  Still, this and the Newborn set would make nice gifts for either a New Mom or one who has been struggling with the old Playtex Nurser.  It takes a little practice - a couple of days or so, to get the hang of this but I am quite pleased with the results.	
1. 	The fabric is thicker material than some other bibs we have and can handle more of the baby's messes. Assorted colors are nice and goes well with outfits. The thicker fabric does have a heavier feel to it and will be even more so when wet. Velcro attachment area on back holds well yet not so much where it's difficult to remove with one hand.	
- 1	I guess it's more my fault for not reading the dimensions before buying, but this was much smaller than it looks in the pictures.	
1. 	Finally something that has helped giving my son medicine! Before it was a NIGHTMARE. Now it is tolerable. As many people have said you do have to force the plunger down, but I have still been able to control it so that he isn't getting all the medicine at once. I wish I had bought this months ago!	
1. 	I bought this stroller to be a lightweight travel stroller. I love it and it is perfect for my needs. It is VERY lightweight and folds up nicely. The height is great and I have no complaints with it whatsoever! I'm very glad I bought it.	
1. 	We have a 1 year old and a 4 year old, and neither one of them can open this gate because they are not heavy enough.  We have 4 of them throughout the house.  I can open it easily carrying the baby or groceries.  It fits securely and doesn't loosen.  It is great quality.  We have had two of these for three years now and they are still in perfect condition!	
1. 	I could not have nursed without this shield. My son was born 3 weeks early and had trouble with his sucking and latch. This helped him be able to latch and helped me nurse him.	
1. 	Great high chair for travel!! We started using this when our daughter was old enough to sit up, it came in handy when travel because restaurants high chairs are huge for a 5 months old and filthy.  Our daughter is now 16 months, 22 lbs and we still use it. You just wipe off the tray with a diaper wipe and throw it back in the trunk until you need it again. It's nice to go anywhere and always have a seat.	
- 1	Material is very rough and  cheap .after seeing it I didn't even use it on my baby's skin coz it felt so harsh and rough just touching it so I was worried it would cause him rash .I wasn't expecting a lot considering the price but just a softer cloth but this was a huge disappointment.I have kept these for cleaning his toys now	
1. 	The nursery set I bought came with a tip resistant strap for the dresser but it didn't seem very secure. It was basically a nylon strap with a washer and a screw and it ripped out when we tested it before we had our first child.I bought these instead and they installed easy and work well. My kid is now a rambunctious almost-three-year-old and I have caught him opening all his drawers to use as steps to get on the top and this strap has held the dresser from tipping. If there's better proof than that, I don't know what it is.	
1. 	My 6 month old son was getting too big for his infant tub.  He wanted to be in deeper water. This tub is great.  It is the perfect size for him and yet has plenty of room for him to grow into.  We have only had it for 2 weeks but it has made a big difference in bath time.  He is having fun in the bath again.  The suction cup is a nice feature.  We use it to hang the tub on the side of the shower to drain and dry. Great tub for the price.  Highly recommend.	
1. 	seems simple, but both my 6 month old and 3 year old enjoy playing with this toy. the sounds are also pleasant and not as annoying as most musical kids toys.	
1. 	I had already written a review on the Isis, saying how great it was. And then I bought a Medela Harmony in an emergency the other day and was blown away by it! The main differences between the two are the ease of use and the easy clean-up (less parts to disassemble) on the part of the Medela.The handle on the Medela swivels, allowing for comfortable pumping with either hand and any position. There was no squeaking whatsoever with the Medela like there is with the Avent, and the handle doesn't fall off too easily.The Medela was a snap to clean, since you only have to wash the flange, the body and the valve, and they are smooth and easy to wipe down with a Medela cleaning cloth in a pinch. The Avent has quite a few pieces that you have to take apart to clean, which can be a pain when you're pumping in a bathroom or in the car.I pumped a record amount in very little time using the Medela Harmony, and now I plan on carrying it with me at all times in case of any future emergencies with my electric pump.***I also wanted to note that I use the Playtex One-Step collection kits for my milk, and they come with an adapter allowing me to pump directly into the Playtex Drop-Ins using a Medela Pump. I also have an adapter from Playtex that allows me to pump directly from the AVENT pump into the Drop-Ins as well, and you can receive one for FREE if you call Playtex.	
- 1	This product was a total bust for us.  It does not stay put in either of our cars (Equinox & Prius).  If it could be installed properly, it would be perfect.	
- 1	I'm sure it would be fine if all you want is to let your child sit in the carseat with a damp bathing suit... however, if accident protection is what you're after, this is useless. I have a Britax, and my daughter's first accident in her car seat leaked right through, wetting the cover underneath and the middle seatbelt material. I ended up having to remove the cover to wash it, which is exactly the hassle I was trying to avoid in the first place. Very irritating. I just ordered the Kiddopotamus Deluxe instead. Wish me luck. ;)	
1. 	My two-year-old daughter loves this potty chair and prefers it over her Prince Lionheart potty chair. The chair itself is very sturdy and extremely easy to clean. I love that it is ergonomic and that there is a high back. There aren't many potty chairs out there that are comparable to this one -- trust me, I've looked!	
1. 	Love it!! 4 stars because it seemed a little smaller than I expected. It's really cute though! :) I'd buy it again.	
1. 	Easy to use!	
1. 	i was looking for something that can let me use my medela pump and pump right into my avent bottles, and found this adaptor to use.  i usually pump and feed right away so this saves me using the medela pump bottles and then pouring into another avent bottle.  the only thing is, you must remember to put the adaptor ring on the avent bottle before you put this adaptor on, if not, it will leak if you don't stay upright.  this package comes with the adaptors for the avent nurser kit too, but i've never use it, and i wish they just sell them separately.	
- 1	These changing pad covers are of poor quality and have not held up very well to washings.  In addition, the covers do not fit the changing pad very well and pull up at the sides.  Unfortunatly there does not seem to be any other choices so I still use the covers, but I also lay a waterproof multi-use pad over the top.  This way I just change the multi-use pad and I don't have to wash the changing pad cover very often.	
- 1	I have used decals many times, from many different companies and have been really lucky I guess. I love skip hop products, but their decals just don't stay on the wall :( overall it still looks adorable, and you do get two whole trees (or really 4 half trees and leaves and stuff to do with what you please), but I was saddened by the immediate peeling, especially since I'm practiced and pretty careful. It's definitely just not as tacky as the other brands. luckily my daughter sees me smoothing it all out constantly so instead of wanting to rip them all down, she just mimics me and smooths it out again. I doubt that will last long though! :)	
- 1	I found this to be a huge waste of money. The bags were difficult to put in and the larger the diapers the harder to twist them in the pail. The worst part was the odor. It smelled disgusting no matter what I did to eliminate it. I finally threw it away and for my newest baby I bought a Diaper Champ which I love and find to be a cheaper, better option.	
- 1	This is supposed to keep your kids safe.  My 18mth old figured out how to open this in a matter of days.	
1. 	Since it's all bristles, it actually dries out between wash sessions which is an advantage over the sponge types I tried from the stores. Long enough to get to the bottom of the tall, skinny baby bottles easily and does a good job of scrubbing.The only thing you have to watch out for is that it does flick water/soap foam when you pull it out of a narrow necked bottle.  Non-issue if you're using the wide-necked bottles (which we preferred), but kind of messy when I would wash out all my medela bottles used for pumping milk.My son's moved on from bottles, but I'm still using this to clean out water bottles, tumblers with dried on smoothie that somebody forgot to rinse out, etc.	
- 1	Top pops open in the freezer (even half full). Unlike freezer trays, it is difficult to get the content out to put inside freezer bags. I tend to cook in batches in the evening or at the weekend and Beaba Multiportion freezer trays are by far the best product for my purpose.	
- 1	I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!	
- 1	I typically love Summer Infant products, but this was a dud.  I have a wooden kitchen table and could not get the suction cups to stick, thus, the mat moved all over the place-- defeating the purpose.  I even moistened the suction cups as stated by the manufacturer, but it still would not stay in place.  I threw this away and got a refund.	
1. 	I bought this shopping cart cover because it was cheaper than the other name brands out there that was $45!  It works just as well.  The only little complaint is that the sides are not elastic or secure onto the shopping cart so sometimes it flips up.  Often times it's just fine and works very well!  There's two little side pockets, but don't expect to put too much in it.  It will only fit a small bottle.	
- 1	After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be great but it didn't work with my little one.  The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality (hence the 2 stars) but it's not easy to put on and once it is on, my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar.  It's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use.  They are soft and easy to work with. If you prefer plastic, the softer ones are better.	
- 1	I don't hate it, which is why I didn't give it 1 star. It looks good and is cheerful. It stayed up briefly, but never for long. We've tried it in two different houses with different tile, and nope, it usually falls down (empty, I might add) in the middle of the night, startling everyone with the noise. Yes, I've left it up empty, always giving it another chance, hoping against hope that I'd be able to use it as designed. I finally gave up and placed it in my donation box, but now I'm going to try the 3M hooks, as someone else mentioned. One last chance. Lame, that I'm going through this much effort. I know.	
1. 	Wonderful bottles, as our daughter won't use anything else.  Wish they were more narrow so she could hold them herself.  Occasional leaking when shaking milk around or mixing a bottle of formula.	
- 1	I got this bedding a few weeks ago from my registry. I just got the crib all assembled so I put the bedding in the wash on gentle (as directed) with mild baby soap .Well, the blanket tore in 4 places.... I'm 34 weeks pregnant, so I haven't even used the set and it's falling apart. Plus the skirt is not wide enough to cover the whole rail below so there are big gaps on both sides. I'd return it, but I already washed it. Very disappointed.	
- 1	this tub says for up to ywo years, we got it for our 8 month old and he is already to big for it, I am not inpressed.  I can only see it being usefull if you travel allot and maybe only have access to a shower.	
- 1	I was very eager to give Happy Heinys a try after receiving recommendations from friends. However, I was disappointed after washing them a few times because EVERY time I washed them, the laundry tabs came undone and they stuck to my other inserts, leaving nasty velcro marks on them. I could care less at this point whether or not they actually leak or not because if they are going to RUIN all of the rest of my diapers I don't want anything to do with them. Too bad, they are very cute.	
1. 	I recently purchased this for my 2 year old son. So far we love it. I didn't want to get one with characters all over it as it would probably distract my son from using it correctly. He's still in the training process but he's headed in the right direction. It's the perfect height and easiness for him to use. I also like how it can be used as a step stool and you can put the seat on a regular toilet. Perfect!	
- 1	i tried it until she could support her head.. it didn't work as intended, her head fell down anyway the bumper didn't stay put... great idea but maybe my girl was just too small.	
- 1	Doesn't fit on all water bottles.  It's easier to just teach your toddler to drink from a water bottle.  I would not recommend.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this, but was sorely disappointed.  Setting up the clock/alarm was confusing and time consuming.  The lights changing from day to night were barely discernible.  When it was on night, the day was still lit slightly and vice versa.  Also, the plastic screen/cover that has the daytime/nighttime bunnies was flimsy and didn't stay on well at all.  For an alarm clock marketed towards toddlers this should have been much more durable.Since pieces were broken within the first day we just trashed it after trying for a week to get it to work correctly.  I would recommend looking into another alarm clock as we are.  This one was pretty useless.	
- 1	This item is definitely cute, but the angle of the pacifier makes it impossible to use. When it sits on baby's chest, it points down the wrong way, so it's really difficult for her to keep it in, which is really frustrating for her. I would have given it one star for being a complete waste of money, but I removed the pacifier and at least have a cute plush.	
- 1	My problem with the insert is how thick it is-down comforter thick.  It's just too hot for San Diego weather.  I strip him down to his onesie but we both get sweaty when I wear it.  I can't wait until he's big enough to go without it.	
1. 	This is a great mattress cover for our mini crib.  It can fit a mattress depth of up to about 5 inches easily.	
- 1	My boy love this octopus immediately when i introduced to him. But sad to say that the music part get spoilt after a few pull. Thus he is playing it now without the music.	
1. 	When I was pregnant I couldn't understand why these were so popular especially at the cost of $20 each.  I could get cheaper ones at target and Carter's Baby and to me that was good enough.  Anyhow the cheaper ones never really took off, the sleeves on the Carter's ones never fit him properly and were too warm, the bags were also not that big and constricted him so using them was always a battle.  I quickly gave them up.  Anyway my now nearly 6 month old loves grabbing things and after a night episode where he wrapped the blanket around his face twice the next day I was at babiesrus to check the Halo sleepsacks out.  I bought two in size medium and love them.  The zip is inverted which allows for quick diaper changes without unzipping the whole bag.  The bag is also large enough for him to kick, lift his legs and move freely.  The armholes also fit nicely without being too wide.  I am sold!!! I see you can get up to XL so I guess I will be using these for a while! I am going today to buy two more for him to use at daycare.	
1. 	I got these after trying out one and falling absolutely in love with it.  First, it is really lightweight and the design is adorable.  Keith Haring being one of my favorite artists with those whimsical designs?  LOVE at first bite:) My little one loves the designs and the fact that it has an easy on easy off velcro is not a problem because when he's done eating, bib comes off quickly.  The pocket is so helpful in catching those little bits that toddlers toss down or drop en route to the mouth.  As well, it wipes clean easily and dries very quickly.  And even despite washing, those fabric bibs will retain some traces of odor or staining from food no matter how many times you wash them.  I love these.  I highly recommend the product for it's design, ease of use, and ease to clean!	
1. 	We were given this co-sleeper by a friend and absolutely love it.  The baby is close by and it makes night time feedings go much smoother.	
1. 	I had the same debate many others had with which size to get!?! I opted for the large because I wanted more use out of it. Glad I did because my daughter is 2 1/2 and can still ride it even though shes on the taller side 37 inches. The toy it's self is well made and study, we haven't had any tip overs. It does fly on wood floors FYI lol we have carpet but at Grammy's house it's all wood so my daughter loves to whip around....make sure you don't get in the way..ouch for toes getting run over. On the carpet it does ok, not as fun as the wood/pavement. We have the mouse one which is super cute, I had my son a few months ago and he's at that teething age so he likes to eat the ears :/  but they have held up great. I do think the price could be better but overall it's a good toy	
1. 	Prior to purchasing, I saw that the reviews for this rail cover were mixed, and I decided to take my chances. Happily, it has worked just perfectly for us. It really was very easy to apply to the crib. I just followed directions, and now, almost a year later, it is sticking as firmly as day one. It looks great in that you can barely see it, and my son must love it too, because he gnaws on it all the time. I only wish that the length they gave you was more, or that I had purchased two boxes. They give you enough for the two sides of the crib, but I would have like it on the front as well. My son doesn't chew there, but it would have been perfect to prevent the scratches and wear that my husband and I have caused with our clothing when leaning over the crib.Update 2/12: We are now expecting our 2nd little one. The gummi rail covers that we installed over 2 years ago worked great and are sticking on today just as well as day one. I am going to be purchasing a 2nd box of this product to cover up the (previously mentioned) scratches that my husband and I caused with our pant buttons and zippers on the front rail of the crib. I just wish I had done this in the 1st place because then the crib would be in pristine condition.Regarding the other reviewers who said the product does not stick: it sticks GREAT...just follow the directions. I have not tried/do not plan to to remove the protectors from the crib, so I don't know how doing so would affect the finish, but the product seems like it could be removed easily enough with enough care in doing so. My only 'complaint' about this product is that I wish they gave you enough to cover 3 sides of the crib.	
1. 	if your baby is able to break the typical velcro swaddle, this is a good product.  It's impossible for your baby to break the swaddle of this blanket!	
- 1	leaded after a few months. ugh.  just use 3 swim noodles made into a triangle for each side. ut this is good fro traveling.	
- 1	Our child would not let us put it on him. So in the end, the product did not serve its intended purpose	
1. 	I was excited to get this.  I love this and so do the children. It washes up nicely on the top rack of my dishwasher. This is played with everyday.	
- 1	We needed a back up sleep sac since our baby has taken to puking at night.  We have a sleep nest which we love, but for some unkown reason i decided to try this as something different. The main thing that dissapointed me about this item is the thinness of it. You can literally see through the fabric it is so thin. I thought it would at least be somewhat substantial... but no... nearly weightless and totally see through. The sleep nest we got on amazon was much nicer since it was thick and the shoulders had snaps, so you can lay your baby down and then tuck them in with two simple snaps and a zipper. This one provides no warmth.  If i had not ripped the packaging when opening it.. I would have returned it.  Maybe we can use this for summer... but totally not worth the price of the item.	
1. 	Being a new parent, I was not sure which bottles to use. I bought these and another brand-I will say hands down these are better, my daughter has no issues with gas or hiccups.	
1. 	ahora la familia descansa mas gracias a este calentador de biberones ya que el tetero se mantiene caliente toda la noches o hasta que el bebe la necesite, no hay necesidad de prender la cocina, solo meterlo en la boca del bebe y a comerrr....	
1. 	I bought these to use under my kids' car seats to protect the leather underneath. These do the job and keep the car seat from moving around too.	
- 1	What a disappointment!  We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted.  However, it did not live up to expectations.  The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static.  I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems.  For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful.  We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!	
1. 	We got one of these for my older daughters and I love the whole thing. The infant body support converts into a very good head support for older children, it's low to the seat so I can get them in and out easier with  other car seats and I can fit 2 Radians and a Graco Snugride 32 in the back of our little 2 door Sunfire.	
- 1	I didn't realize this pillow would be so small, however since I was planning to keep it in the car I figured I would keep it. But when I was removing the cover to wash, the foam was already falling apart. The pieces that are glued together are separating even though this is brand new. I am going to return to amazon. Also, the cotton cover is thin and the zipper opening small so you have to be careful not to tear the seams to the zipper. I use the My Brest Friend pillow at home and it is a much better product for the price.	
1. 	My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!	
- 1	Can't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags?  It's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed.  For the price, Medela should really come up with something better.	
- 1	These are so tiny! We tried to use them, but they barely cover anything! You are better off having a larger piece if cloth or a cloth diaper handy to really save yourself from getting drenched and preventing a larger mess.These are o tiny that by the time you fumble for them, the accident is in progress!	
1. 	I don't have much time to go out shopping for things we need with a new baby. The playtex bottles are easy since there's no real cleaning everyday - the liners just pop in and out! The price here is just as good as walmart but it comes right to my door without the walmart craziness :) Would recommend for sure! No problems with leaking or anything...	
- 1	Only gave it this review because it was much bigger than &#34;demi&#34; would suggest and did not fit our stroller.	
- 1	I originally ordered the safety first kensington bc of its beautiful looks, wipeable seat and small fold. When I got it together it didn't fold as compact as I needed so I ordered this graco in rittenhouse. I thought based on positive reviews id love it even though it wasn't my first choice. First thing I noticed is it is significantly heavier than the s1. The fabric is super cheap feeling. It's white and black which looks like cream and black on the photo and doesn't really make sense bc the frame is cream. It'snot made of a even slightly wipeable material. Its plan fabric which would stain horribly. It's way too short and the seat sitting area is not very deep and looks way uncomfortable. Needless to say,  id rather the other take up room in my teeny tiny kitchen than put up with this garbage. If you want something better quality with a beautiful look go for the safety 1st kensington from babies r us.	
- 1	i received a slow flow rate bottle, which is too slow for my son. there is no description on the website telling us it is a slow rate bottle. i opt to buy a new nipple, it will cost me another 7 bucks. in total i will spend almost 20 bucks just for a bottle. can you believe it?	
1. 	First I purchased the Britax Boulevard and then The First Years True Fit.  Both were huge and bulky.  When fully tightened in the rear-facing position using the LATCH system, both could be grasped by their bases from the front seat and pulled forward, pushing baby's head into the back seat.  The same could be done by just pushing on the backs of these carseats (in the rear-facing position), so baby's face would slam into the back seat in a head-on collision!The Sunshine Radian is different!  It has a detachable base which, when installed in the rear-facing position, fully fills in the gap between the carseat and seat back.  No bulky towels that shift, no water noodles that get squished down.  And a SNUG FIT!  Additionally, there is a very easy floor tether that secures this carseat further, even in the rear-facing position (The First Years True Fit offers no such tether, and Britax's rear-facing tether is strung over baby's head!) and even if your car doesn't come manufactured with a specific tether point!The mesh fabric stays dry and cool even on the hottest days, there's plenty of leg room even in the rear-facing position, and this whole seat fits (albeit snuggly) in the backseat of my 2004 Saturn LW300 (a very small backseat!).  Also, there's a little card pouch to fill out with your child's medical information in case of an accident so emergency personel can immediately treat your child!	
1. 	it's nice and warm. because of the location of the zipper, you don't need to take off the blanket when changing diapers.	
- 1	Wayyyy over priced!  Should have just used a cloth diaper tucked in.  Material is kinda rough.  Small and skimpy.  But does do the job.  Wouldn't purchase again.  Two does come in a pack, but for $16 it should be 6!	
1. 	I liked this product because unlike the Boppy this has the flap in the front that prevents the baby from sliding down.  Also, it would be nice if they had more attractive fabric/cover choices and the cover was removable like the Boppy.	
1. 	These bibs are really inexpensive and have a waterproof liner.  The bibs are absorbant and they can keep my baby's clothes from getting soaked.  They won't last all day - I still have to change her bibs pretty often.  But I can go a lot longer between bib changes with these bibs compared to regular bibs. They are about as absorbant as some Carter's waterproof bibs that I have.  My baby is a little droll machine and I am on here to buy antoher package of these bibs.	
1. 	The gate is a bit long and the panels feel kind of cheap. Mine was shipped to me damaged and i had to get a replacement. Overall, ive been using this product for a few weeks now and it does its job. I recommend this product if you have a big indoor space for your kids/pets or its a good playpen to take with you outside. Its a bit on the heavy side so pls becareful	
1. 	When I bought the carrier I wasn't concerned about drool- my newborn never drooled.  Now my 4 month old sucks on the front of the carrier and it's kind of gross, not to mention obvious to all by the 3 inches of darkened fabric.  I tried sticking a burp cloth there but it wasn't really helping, slipping out of place, falling, and still getting the carrier wet.  We bought these and are quite happy to say we stopped washing the carrier after every outing.  ;-pThey have:a water-proof barrier,are easy to pop on,stay in place,look good,and yet still seem tasty enough to gum and suck on.We are very happy and will buy another set of 2 for vacationing.	
- 1	my daughter didn't like these, however a friends daughter loved it. the shape is fun and it is easy for a child to hold	
1. 	I bought this for my 3-year old daughter as one of her Christmas present from Santa Claus, she is not that into it, I think this is best for kids age 6 months to 2 years. I was going to buy it on Amazon, happened to find it elsewhere for just a little over $20.	
1. 	Love Love Love these!  We can protect our little one and still use the outlets.  These are good for the outlets you still need to use.  Bonus:  our plugs were loose in the outlets before this.  These covers took care of that problem too.  A++	
1. 	Purchased this item when I had my second child so that I could monitor them visually as well as audibly.  Also purchased an additional camera, so that I could monitor both of the children's rooms.  Product is great.  Battery lasts forever when off charger.  Able to see well at night too.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it would be nice to have a feature that allows the monitor to switch over to the room where noise is recognized.  As it is now, you have to switch the button back and forth between the two rooms to monitor children sleeping at the same time.  Otherwise, product is great.	
1. 	I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.	
- 1	This pump is terrible. First of all it is loud. Second of all it is not at all powerful. It will NOT empty your breast. I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk.  The more I pumped the less milk I got out. I was losing my milk supply fast!!!!!! I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply. That didn't work this motor is not powerful enough. I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis. I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked. Don't waste your money on this pump. It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it.  I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give. I really give it zero stars. It is very expensive. I suggest renting a hospital grade pump. It is much cheaper & will definately work.	
1. 	Small enough for the baby. I have this kind of nail clippers for myself. So I have no problem with using.	
- 1	The idea behind this design is well intentioned but I find the design aggravating. Subconsciously I always go for the handle to move this thing, but the handle is connected to the removable bottle storage piece. There's no other way to pick this thing up unless you grab it by the warmer cup. It may seem trivial but I like to keep this thing out of the way (it's an eye sore) and I would have rather just the bottle warmer with no bottle storage chamber.Plus, the heating is inconsistent. No matter whether you put extra water or not, the bottles still don't get warm like they should. When we first got it (4 months ago) the milk would actually be too hot. That hasn't happened in a while.	
1. 	As new parents we bought a lot of gadgets to help entertain our newborn. We purposely didn't buy this type if chair because we had some many other gadgets and thought we had all basis covered. After we visited a friend and my parents who had similar chairs we knew we had to have one. It allows her to sleep, eat, and just look around and watch her surroundings. She is held a lot but occasionally wants her own space and this is her favorite place.  It sits between my husbands and I chair and she very content. Definitely one of the best baby purchases and it is wasn't very expensive.	
1. 	This is the best baby bath tub out there.  It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.  We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.  I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).  This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...  Win win!	
1. 	I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...	
- 1	Being pregnant with lots of expenses on the way, I hemmed and hawed and compared products before deciding that this was going to be a great investment as it'll help train me to sleep on my sides and help me get a good night's rest...I loved it for the first few weeks... and raved about it so much, baby's father wanted one too...so I found him one for half the price, same maker Leacho, but from a big chain.Until the thing deflated to half the size!!!  (Another 1 star reviewer said the same thing!  I should have listened!!)I wasn't even that big to begin with!  4'11 and was a size 0 pre-pregnancy!The thing deflated before I was even 6 months pregnant!!  And it went from extremely comfy.... to painfully uncomfortable!!What a HUGE waste of money on something I was only able to use for a few weeks!!Don't waste your money!  There are cheaper alternatives out there!	
1. 	A very wise friend gifted the Mustela starter set to me a few years ago for my shower and while I used mostly all of the products fully, this particular product wasn't included at the time, thus prompting me on my very expensive and disappointing quest to find the ultimate baby bathing products. Let's be clear: you certainly can use J&J;, Burt's Bees, Aveeno, Angel Baby, California Baby, Pretentious Baby or whatever you like without my judgment, as this review isn't an homage to all things green and organic. It's in fact quite the contrary. While I can appreciate why that is important to many, after 3 years of testing products, both organic and otherwise; I've come full circle with my original gut instinct: organic products simply can't get done the same job that formulated products can. I am sorry to all the tree loving moms out there, but I have found this to be true with both my husband and my products as well as our kids.Sorry...I digress. Back to the product review.This product, and all others by this maker, are head and shoulders above the rest. Here's why:1. The scent. It's perfect, heavenly and lingers on both of my kids until the next bath rolls around. I have actually found that their body heat intensifies the smell.2. It cleans. It also lathers beautifully. Not to say that indicates it's cleaning (as I've been told it doesn't) but truth be told, I'm old school here. Good lather = good clean.3. Rinses easily and leaves hair soft, shiny and tangle free.4. It lasts. no pumps, just squeeze a small amount in your hand, rub your hands together and apply. As other reviewers have pointed out, a little goes a long way.4. While I cannot speak to it's chemical composition, sadly I admit that it's French, so, uh, I trust it.Overall, run don't walk to grab this one and save money by ending your quest to find the perfect cleanser.	
1. 	I like that it is simple and can't get water in it.  I wish there was a way to make it squeak without having to worry about mold, then it would be a real rubber ducky.  If you by this for the temperature indicator you will get ripped off.  We bought it the firs time for that, but found that our son really liked it, so we bought another after it was lost.  Our son really enjoys it.	
- 1	This toy is neat looking with the googley eyes and bobbling head - but it doesn't stick to anything, making it a really awkward hand held toy. If it stuck at all, it would be a very cool toy - but at it is, I would probably not purchase again.	
1. 	I've been using the sound sleeper for a month now and it's great! I didn't purchase this item right when my DD was born because I figured it wasn't a necessary item. After fighting to get her to sleep during the day I didn't know what else to do. Then my husband and I were talking to each other next to her crib debating on how to get her to sleep (she was crying) and after about 5 minutes we realized that she had passed out! A light went off and I realized that all she needed was some background noise because the absolute silence was unnerving for her. To try out my theory I downloaded some rain music (I knew she fell asleep great when it was raining) to put on my iPod and it did the trick. I immediately remembered this being on our registry and purchased it right away. The sound sleeper has been playing ever since! We use the rain/thunder combination but our DD also likes the ocean/thunder too. There are definitely other combinations to choose from, but those work for us. The volume is great and has a great range from quiet to loud. We use ours on the continual on position but you can also put it to go off in 60minutes. I know people have trouble with their babies waking up after the sound goes off so we keep it permanently on and since the sound sleeper plugs in(!!!) you don't have to worry about eating up batteries. The sound sleeper is definitely a must have for out LO. So to recap:Pros:1. Volume is great going from quiet to loud.2. It doesn't interfere with us hearing our DD on the baby monitor.3. Lots of combinations to choose from.4. Choice of continual play or turning off after 60min.5. Plugs in so you don't have to worry about eating up batteries!Cons:1. If I have to list at least one, you can hear it on the baby monitor. It sounds like continual static. It doesn't bother me at all but it might be a down side to others.	
- 1	I bought this tub before my son was born, thinking it looked great and I could use it in the kitchen sink.  I do like that I can use it in the sink, but he's not a super long baby and his little feet always get stuck in the grooves where the tub folds!  It doesn't hold much water, either.  I wish I had read reviews before I bought it, because now, after only 2 months, I'm just going to replace it and throw it away.  What a waste!	
- 1	Useless is all I can say.  It cannot hold any weight - the velcro un-wraps as soon as you put a purse on it.  Not sure what I can use it for in my entire house?	
- 1	This bib is not soft enough and  after a couple of trips with it my son's cheeks were bright red from friction. What I do, I use it as a cover for the carrier, so I do not have to wash the carrier itslef, but I also use a big Aden and Anais bamboo burpy bib between it and my baby's chin and cheeks for softness. This combination works wonders for us and even if the burpy bib gets soiled and is removed for a little while I am replacing it, my baby carrier is still protected from drooling and milk.	
- 1	This was a gift and so I never thought to look up reviews on it.  She absolutely loves it and it was one of her favorites until I took it away.  She has had her bottom teeth less than a month and today I noticed big scratches in the plastic paint stripes.  I rubbed with my finger and off came a stripe of green plastic chips!  That has been going in her MOUTH!  I am contacting the company and urge all parents to STAY AWAY from this product.	
1. 	I have had other baby carriers with my two older children and this one is definitely my favorite. It was easy to use and felt very sturdy. Unfortunately, my son didn't like being in it, but he's not much of a snuggler so I'm guessing it is his personality and not the carrier that is the issue. :) I'd recommend this item to other parents.	
- 1	This gadget didnt really work for me, i could not get it attached and adjusted to where it made sense at all and it still didnt allow me to go handsfree. Spend the extra money and buy a pumping bra.	
- 1	At first, I didn't mind that this was just made of a thick foam material because it still did a good job protecting my 1 year old boys from hitting their heads on the faucet.  However, after just a few weeks, they were able to rip the foam apart while trying to pull the cover off.  (It looks like a toy, so they couldn't resist playing with it.)I have moved on to the skip hop whale that still has the hole for the shower diverter but is made of a heavy plastic.	
1. 	This is a must have for that weird stage between when baby is too big for the infant bath tub but can't sit up on their own yet. My son is average size and he fits in this great.	
1. 	While watching my friend lug her whole travel system out of her trunk, I can pop this baby open with one hand.  It's a great product, very maneuverable and light with an excellent basket underneath for all that baby stuff.  One drawback: the cup holder is small and shallow - won't hold a thermal mug, but holds a standard styrofoam coffee cup.	
1. 	I transitioned my son to the HALO sleep sack when he was 4 months old and he did great! We were swaddling him before and found it to be an easy transition. The sleep sack has a v-neck top so that it is not to close to baby's face. My baby does check on the bottom sometimes when he is rolling around his bed. The material has become a little frayed from washing it a lot but overall it's a great product!	
1. 	I love the Svan chair...and now that I have the cushion, my 6 mth old is as happy as can be. The cushion is quite thick and cushions her well. I haven't washed the cushion yet, but hopefully it will be easily washable.	
- 1	This cradler just pushes my sons head forward rather than supporting it when he falls asleep. I bought this thinking that he would have a place to lay his head when falls asleep in the car but he hates it because the banana shape actually forces his head forward,	
1. 	my 8 mo old has loved these since he was 5 mos or so, his favorite is the crab and the turtle as they are easiest to hold and chew on	
- 1	This necklace did not work out for my child. She did not like wearing it, it would get stuck in her neck and become irritating. Nowadays she just carries it around the house whenever she comes across it.	
1. 	This potty stays in our minivan for all trips short and long.  It is highly functional, fits my daughter perfectly (she is 2 1/2yrs old and weighs 29lbs).  I started with placing a plastic grocery bag in the bucket part, along with her unused diapers (since she is fully potty trained now), inside the potty.  This makes all waste fully disposable without having to do any cleanup.  Works like a charm.	
- 1	I haven't tried any other breast pumps, but from what I read on the internet, there are better alternatives. I cups, I guess you can call them horns do not come in bigger sizes like medela for different nipple sizes. I took out the plastic inserts for it to be relatively more comfortable. I got a lot of painful, plugged ducts from using this.	
1. 	I bought this stroller before flying across the country with my 3 year old and 5 month old, and it was great. First of all, the stroller folded fits perfectly through the scanning machine you send your carry-on items and shoes through. I don't know what people with larger strollers have to deal with passing through airport security, and I was happy not to have to find out. I was able to check the stroller at the plane door for both flights which was a necessity flying with two kids by myself. I did not bring the snack tray or car seat holder since they stick out farther when the stroller is folded, but I guess I could have.My 3 year old son LOVES the stroller. He hates being strapped in which is why I chose this over a double umbrella. He is unbelievably well behaved when he can ride standing. I was worried he'd be constantly jumping on and off but no problem, he stays put.My 5 month old sits fine in the seat as long as you put the footrest in the straight out position to keep her from sliding forward too far. I just added a body support for herJJ Cole Collections Body Support, Khaki, 0-8 Monthsand it was definitely a good choice, keeps her from flopping over and having the seatbelt rub on her neck.Great stroller, highly recommended.-------------------------------------------------------My daughter is now an average sized 2 year old and is probably reaching the limits of sitting in the front seat, she still fits in there for now, but I don't imagine she will when she is 3. My son (almost 5) is still very comfortable standing or sitting in the back. His head doesn't fit under the canopy when he's standing, but I think the canopy is really only meant for the kids while seated. We don't use this all the time, but I wouldn't dare to go for a day at the zoo without it! Really happy we have had this, it's a great product.	
1. 	I live in a trailer and we have super tiny rooms. This pail is a life saver. Since I'm a stay at home mom just about all the poops go in here but you can never tell there's a poop in the tiny room because it keeps the smell in so well! Just hold your breath when you go to throw another in and do it fast! When my husband takes the trash out at night he apologizes to me for having to deal with that smell. I let him think that I dealt with that smell all day but really my baby's room is always clean and fresh smelling! Just a tip: if you have small rooms or just don't want any bad smell in the room, take the pail else where or even outside to tie off the bag. The pail is super lightweight and the bags last a while!	
- 1	Leaks and really disgusting to clean.It get that orangey buildup in the overlap part and the whole thing has to come apart to clean.  Go with the primo eurobath.  love it!	
- 1	The print is cute, but the material is so rough and stiff I can't use it.  I've washed it twice now with fabric softener, thinking it might just need to be broken in, but it hasn't helped.  I'm so disappointed.  Feels heavily starched, and is very rough on the skin.	
- 1	I don't hate this pacifier really. I don't have much experience with pacifiers to judge.  Here is why I don't like this though.1. My son won't suck for more than a few minutes. He has an Avent one he will suck for a long time though.  Upon comparison this pacifier has a much shorter sucking part-- the clear part that goes in their mouth.  I think that's why he doesn't like it.  It also has a weird dent in that same part that matches the bottles. I have a bottle but haven't tried it yet.2. It leaves red indents on his cheeks.  It has a very prominent curve to it which causes this. I called the 800 number and a very nice sounding lady told me that that's what happens when you use pacifiers...is this true? I have no idea really.  I do know that his Avent pacifier does not do this.  That one is more straight.3. The Avent comes with a little clip on cover, these do not so they are inconvenient to travel with.	
- 1	I purchased this seat when my baby outgrew his Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat.  I bought this seat because it is rated #1 on Consumer Reports and it has the highest rating in the crash test category.  Early on, I thought it was much harder to tighten and loosen the straps compared to the Chicco Keyfit.  But the real problem (and reason I returned this seat) was that my baby was so uncomfortable in it.  Almost immediately, he cried a lot in this seat, which he never did in the Keyfit.  I exchanged this car seat for a Britax Marathon 70, which tightens and loosens much more easily (and similiarly to the Keyfit).  My baby hasn't cried in the Britax seat since he's been in it.  While the Evenflo Triumph car seat is highly rated and well priced, I would not recommend it because it is hard to adjust and most of all, my baby was so unhappy in it.	
1. 	My boys love their turtles. We have two and they are great for nighttime. The colors are relaxing and we also love that it shuts off after 20 minutes.	
1. 	yep....mommy got some help. Our toddler liked to lick the outlets so yep, we freaked out! We got thius right away andc they are perfect. Hard to take off,even for me!thank you mommy helper ... u sure helped me!	
- 1	This product came to us in the &#34;lock&#34; position on the top and the lid would not come off, effectively being in the &#34;locked&#34; position.  But, even in this locked position the lid was able to completely rock back and forth and was not anywhere near what I would call &#34;sealed&#34; which would make the sterilization process not very effective and most likely lead to steam burns for the user--even if we COULD get the lid off to put stuff in it.  It was returned, and I did not ask for another in replacement.	
- 1	We ony got this nipple and bottle because it's compatible with the professional grade Ameda breast pump machines. All of the other nipples we are aware of are medium to fast flow. We mistakenly thought that this was a slow flow nipple.[Good]The sturdiness of the nipple itself: Which competing products, the nipple bends and our baby just ends up playing with it leading to bad breast feeding and twisting while feeding. With this nipple, it's so sturdy that it keeps our baby still instead of constantly twisting and moving his head and body.Cool Looking: Pretty high tech in terms of initial impressions.No drip: The nipple requires suction before liquid starts flowing.[Bad]Fast flow: Yes the initial flow is slow. The baby needs to build suction. However once flow starts, it ends up flowing way too fast. It's so fast that our baby ends up choking multiple times during a feeding. This is anything but natural. About 30 minutes later, our baby has thrown up his milk. This hasn't happened with the cheaper nipples.Air Intake Prevention: This is no different from a cheaper nipple.Bottle Doesn't Dry: I'm not sure why, but this bottle takes a lot longer to dry than a normal bottle. I'm guessing it's probably due to the upper lip. I don't know why purpose that serves other than for aesthetics. Someone didn't test this product very well.Price: Given its big flaws, it doesn't deserve the price premium. It is way too expensive.[Verdict]This is not a breast milk feeding bottle. Real breasts do not drown babies in milk. Do not buy this garbage.	
- 1	I first received this bag and while unpacking it immediately noticed 2 areas with poor sewing where the fabric was coming undone.  One area was inside one of the exterior bottle pockets.  The lining was completely unsewn along the top.  The second area was on one of the backpack straps.  The padded strap was not sewn well and the fabric was coming apart along the edges.  I sent it back and received a replacement.  When I unboxed I looked it over to check for any similar areas and I found the same thing on one of the padded backpack straps.  The fabric was not sewn well and was coming apart along the edge.  I find this kind of quality control disappointing, especially in an expensive brand.  The first time I was willing to chalk it up as a fluke, but after having a 2nd bag with the same issue I am now suspicious of the quality of these bags and this brand overall.  I will likely send this one back for a refund rather than getting another replacement.	
- 1	i was excited to make my baby's first xmas ornament but this product was a complete waste of my money.here are the flaws:1. the clay is too sticky. i could not flatten it out smoothly with the rolling pin that was included in the kit.  the clay would stick to the rolling pin making it impossible.  i ended up patting the clay with my hand.2. the plastic shape ring is a long piece of plastic strip.  there's tape on one side to adjust the size of the ring you want to make.  down side is that there's no way you can make a nice circle out of it.  i ended up with a lopsided semi oval ornament.conclusion: save your money.  the ornament is difficult to make and is not cute at all.  a huge disappointment.	
- 1	Although the idea of this is pretty neat- the balls themselves are flimsy and easily misplaced.  The balls also don't put out enough light to navigate a dark room, and almost give off a creepy glow when used.  My kids won't use it at all.	
- 1	I am a first time mom and I bought this playpen for travel. It is a great product if you rarely travel with it.Pro's: Changing table folds away with the press of a button, had sounds and vibration, and is at an ideal height for my tall husband and myself to change our child. It is also large and sturdy enough I can see her using it until she is able to crawl.Cons: This product was not made to fit entirely into the travel bag. When I contacted Graco about this problem the phone system told me they were closed until normal business hours so I e-mailed. I was answered quickly and was told I would be sent a travel bag in the mail. I received the package Graco sent 2 business days later. Inside were 2 travel bags identical to the one that came with the product in the first place. The only reason the product dose not fit entirely into the travel bag is because of the bulky plastic changer tray and changer frame. I wish I would have know this, I would have saved my money and bought a more portable and more affordable model.	
1. 	I have only owned this for a few days but I love it so far. It's very cushion-y and very soft. It has already prevented my child from a scrape. It comes with a bunch of different sizes of tape as well. Its double sided and seems to be holding up.	
1. 	Soft and warm, easy to wear .But after my baby can and likes to stand up, I stop using it since he may trip over. I will use it again when he can stand more steadily.	
- 1	The idea and design of this swing is great. The function is not. Our baby is 13 lbs and the swing does not work well even on the highest speed. If she kicked or moved, the swing stopped and we had to give it a push to restart the swinging motion. The motor was very loud also. We returned it. Too bad because we liked the colors, size and the ability to plug into a wall outlet instead of using batteries.	
1. 	LOVE the Bundle Me products. So much warmer than competitors. The original is perfect for winters in the midwest. The 'LITE' version is great for our springtime also. Will continue to purchase for new mothers because everyone loves them.	
- 1	This bag is the perfect size for one days worth of cloth diapers. It has a wonderful pattern. It doesn't have any sort of handle of hook to hang the bag and we had to sew one on. These bags also pick up odors and need to be washed frequently.	
- 1	unless your child drinks their cups laying down, which is highly not recommended, this cup is useless and frustrating. i tried for 6 months to make them work and they just don't.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
1. 	These have been around for a long time, and it's because they're the best. We have several different kinds of sippy cups, but these are the most dependable and the easiest. Definitely a favorite in our household.	
1. 	I love these storage bottles! I bought two packs, one pack i froze the milk in the bottles and the second pack i use to pump into and dump the contents out into breast milk storage bags; since the storage bags are cheaper and take up less room in my freezer. These are a must for any pumping mother.	
1. 	I bought this mobile for our little girl to hang over her changing table.  I wanted something that didn't require batteries, but something that would require her attention and help develop her senses.She absolutely loves this mobile.  From the time I hung it up, at around 7-8 weeks, she was mesmerized by it, and now at 12 weeks she giggles and talks to the flowers.  She loves it when you spin it around for her and will happily coo at it while being changed.  It's great for parent/baby interaction together.I wish I would have thought to hang something like this over my son's changing table when he was younger.I will say that the only drawback is that it doesn't have a hook to hang it, so you have to find a way to secure it to the ceiling.  Right now, I have it thumbtacked up there, which is working fine, but once she gets older and is able to reach it, I'll have to hang it more securely.	
1. 	this is exactly what we needed to organize the top of our dresser that we converted to a changing table.  it fits perfectly on top of our dresser and with the lionheart wipes warmer on top.	
1. 	I'm a pumping working mom so having extra set of accessory just makes my days a lot easier. If you pump you know how much work it is just to dissemble the parts, clean them, sterilize them, and reassemble them until the next use. So one day I figured I really need to have an extra set so I can just run out of the door after the early AM pumping. The set contains the parts you need for breast pump along with 2 microwavable sterilize bags and 4 medela bottles. Pretty good deal if you ask me! The only downside is the horns and the valves are one part so you cannot take them apart and wash separately, which I find a bit hard to clean. But all in all this is a good set that serves the purpose.	
1. 	I have two kids; a 5 year old son and an almost 7 month old daughter. When I had my son, things were easy and I lived in an apartment where it was easy to keep him contained into one room. Things are much different now that I have my daughter (open concept livingroom/kitchen, a son that has smaller toys the baby can't play with, a dog that gets excited and sprints around the livingroom, etc) so I wanted a way to keep her safe without sticking her in a pack n play all day. I decided to give this superyard a chance and it is great! I have 8 panels total (superyard plus one extension) and it is the perfect size! I decided to purchase the alphabet/number mats to put under it so that I could just wipe up any drool/messes instead of having to move it around to vacuum daily.I would recommend this is ANYONE looking to give their little one a hangout of their own! It is very durable, which is something I was worried about since I knew my son would want to get in there with his little sister. He can climb over it on his own and it holds up fine!	
1. 	The corner pockets were perfect for nursing pads or pacifiers. The print looked just like the picture and I got a ton of use out of this product.A little overpriced and does not wash well around the boning.	
- 1	There are better options available for securing cabinets.  We are currently using the slide type lock on other cabinets (no complaints or problems with these), but we wanted to try this product on an entertainment center because this product is less conspicuous.  However, the hook portion of the product is too thick to use on knob style handles.  Also, the handles must be spaced a good distance apart because the hooks do not slide all the way together.  The gap on our entertainment center was too large (3 apart).  We also tried to use it on a kitchen cabinet with conventional handles, but it was not very secure.  This may be a usable product in the exactly right situation, but I don't know what that would be.	
1. 	Our youngest daughter, Essie, is 17 months old and is still postively mesmerized by the lights and pictures swirling on the ceiling. At bedtime she grabs her snuggle blanky, lays back and drifts off to sleep watching the birds go round and round. When she wakes in the morning or occasionally in the night we'll hear her turn the music and lights back on. It keeps her occuppied for a nice long stretch every morning which gives the whole family a bit more rest. It does take 4 D batteries and we go through them but I think it is worth it. The music is soothing, the birds are sweet, it has different settings for sound levels and Essie can work all of these features so it is truly baby friendly. We have been using it since she was born and I don't forsee it being retired for years to come.	
1. 	I'm 17 weeks pregnant and have been using this pillow for about 2 weeks after a body pillow wouldn't keep me on my side.  I love this thing, I wake up in the same position I fall asleep in, so I know I'm not rolling onto my back.  It's not too bulky either.  I'm 5'7'' and my husband is 6'3'' and we still have enough room in our queen bed.The only slight drawback is that it does such a good job of keeping me from moving that I wake up when I need to roll over because my hip or shoulder hurt.  But it's worth it to know I'm staying on my side.Almost a year later and I wish I could give this more stars!!  I loved it all through pregnancy - it kept me comfortable when I got huge and I was so very glad to be able to sleep.  I'm updating because my husband is sleeping on it now after hurting his back today.  He was finally able to get comfortable after I pulled my giant pillow out of the closet.	
1. 	Highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding.  It's clears the nipple confusion instantly.	
1. 	Easy to clean, secure when the lid is on. Great for travel. Flow is also great - my son loves to drink his milk from this sippy cup. Only complaint - not super easy to clean the holes unless you have a special cleaner, but I dont think too much - just put it in the dishwasher :)	
1. 	This is a must have for all moms and dads.  I have used everything in this little kit so far, except for the dropper.  I keep it in my diaper bag at all times!	
- 1	my daughter would not take, but i think it is simple preference, she gagged on about 4 different brands before i found one she would take	
1. 	I bought this for my son because he will be starting on foods in a month. I wanted a high chair that is a space saver style as well as easy to clean. This seat seems to be just what I wanted! My son has been sitting in it about once a day to get used to sitting with us at the table and he appears to enjoy it. He is 5 months old and a little small for the seat, but that is good as I hope to use it for quite a while. Also, cute colors!	
- 1	Not that great of quality. The lid was broken when I recieved it but I can see why. It was flimsy and had we actually used it my 2 year old would have broken it off himself for sure. I returned it and would not recommend it to anyone.	
- 1	So many awesome reviews and that's why I bought them but leaks every single time! I was excited about cloth diapering but not after trying these. Not sure what I'm doing wrong. :/	
- 1	Product is cute, but very low quality.  The foam feels very cheap.  There is a seam that runs along the top and ends at the top hole... this seam tears very easily when the products is pulled against the metal thing that pops up for the shower.  The first thing my child did when I put this on the bath spout, was pull on it... and within minutes the product was torn at the seam.  The tear is about half way through the seam now so I am not sure how much longer it will last.It's probably only worth about a dollar and honestly, if this thing only cost me $3-$5, I would probably just keep replacing it because it's so cute.  At $10, it's not worth replacing and is a total ripoff.I would recommend looking for a different product.	
1. 	This bib catches everything except what the baby throws, it's great! He doesn't seem to mind that it's rubberized vs cloth, and the adjustable neck is great. Mine has a skinny neck so it's on almost the smallest setting, but there's a lot of room to grow. It's very easy to clean as well, since it's fairly rigid as apposed to silicone bibs that are floppy and fold as you try to clean them.	
1. 	This is probably the best gate I've had so far. I really like the hands free foot peddle. I've had it for more than six months and haven't had any problems.	
- 1	I bought a case of these wipes without previously using them. What a huge regret! I've now tried them several times and they always cause a diaper rash. I recommend pampers sensitive or burts bees. I hate these wipes!	
1. 	We love these at our house and use them everyday.  I would recommend getting the top covers too, especially for using while out.	
- 1	My kid was never very interested in this toy, and I can see why. It is essentially a tiny blanket with a plastic corner and crinkle noises. Will end up in the Goodwill box and not be saved for future kids.	
- 1	im really disapointed with this product, i really expect thah the brand Fischer Price show the best articles for babies, but in this case the quality of the towel its poor, my wife take the whale and sewn on a quality towel by herself	
1. 	I cannot speak highly enough about this baby product!  I love this bath pillow.  I used it when my 3 year old was a newborn and now I am using it for my new baby.  It perfectly cradles the baby during bath time...even the tiniest of babies.  We used it with my oldest son well past his first birthday.  Once he was sitting on his own we would simply have him sit on it.  We tried a bath seat at one point but it was a hard plastic and the edges were not very smooth.  He looked so uncomfortable in it (plus it was difficult to get him in and out of it).  We never had a problem with mildew or smells.  We always dried it out by hanging it in the shower after the bath.  We washed it a few different ways...sometimes in the washing machine and sometimes by simply adding Oxyclean to the bathtub and letting it sit in the solution.	
- 1	where do i even begin? this baby monitor is not safe, that's where. our infant sleeps one level directly above us and well within the 150  foot range advertised. we have had several nights waking up to a monitor with video on but the sound off, or at best breaking up constantly (try to sleep with intermittent white noise, i dare you). so we would have an infant kicking and screaming but when you're asleep, you don't get to see this activity but rely on the sound to wake you; worthless. the camera also completely blacks out from time to time, meaning we can hear (sometimes) our infant but the screen is black. it requires turning off the camera several times until it 'reboots' itself and works; worthless. the VOX function, which is supposed to allow the battery rest while monitoring the infant and bringing the video and sound back to the monitor if sound is detected. this function doesn't work at all. never; worthless. upon attempting the 'live chat' function on the Levana website, i was told to return the monitor and have one of their technicians spend some time checking it and either repair or replace (2-4 weeks). when i requested a replacement sent immediately, i was told i had to purchase it until the defective one was ruled defective. the chat session lasted more than 30 minutes, with each customer service response coming around 3-5 minutes after mine; so, yes, customer service: worthless.when it comes to something as important as infant safety and adult sleep, don't waist your time or money with this worthless product. spend more money and get a better product; this is indeed one purchase no one should skimp on. after much advice, i've purchased the samsung safeview and am hoping for a much better experience than this one, which was worthless.	
1. 	I like the crib. My last crib was about 19 years ago. They have changed - a lot.It was much easier to assemble than I expected. When my son was nearing the point that I needed to lower the mattress, I was cringing at the thought. As it turned out, my grief was all for naught. Four screws out, then back. It was done.Sturdy it seems. Some thread-lock might have been a plus. It seems the sides get a little loose now and then. A simple screw driver fixes that, but you have to be alert to the potential for things getting too loose.Lastly, there are bite marks 3/4 of the way around the front and sides. Good thing these are the rails that will go away as the crib converts into a bed.I liked it so much I got a second one for my daughter who is still in a bassinet.	
- 1	This could MAYBE work for someone with a king bed. We have a queen and it was WAY to big to use, not to mention it's heavy and clunky, plus our son hated being laid down in it.  Not to mention that the legs are defective and  WILL NOT stay on. The snugglenest is a much better option. We are returning this.	
1. 	we actually use this to barricade our entertainment center. theres lots of expensive things make it up and my 1 year old seems to be attacted to that. this playard works perfectly.	
1. 	Could not find this size at any store so thanks for making this easy to order ,fast processing which aloud my daughter to breastfeed with the correct size and make breastfeeding a great experience for this first time Mom.	
1. 	I purchased one for my twins.... I plan to purchase another. The size is great, it can hold a lot of toys. The pockets on the side actually can hold books well. The bag with handles inside is prefect. I actually have it out with all my kids blocks and it adds more space in the toy bin. I don't close the top, I have it bent back and so far if I try to close it it works fine (hasn't reshaped to being bent back). The little toy mat that folds down in the front is a nice feature. My twins don't actually us it to play but I have hardwood floors so it adds a little extra padding. The best part for me is safety. My twins know how to get in and out of this but never get hurt because it's not wood or hard plastic. They also run around a lot and I don't have to worry about them bumping into this and getting hurt. And last it is extremely easy to set up and down. Takes seconds. In my opinion if you were going on vacation it's prefect to bring since it folds flat.	
1. 	I just love these cups. My grandson loves them as much as my children did. Bath, play chewing it works all day long!	
1. 	My daughter enjoyed this gym for several months, and it is now being enjoyed by a neighbor.  It comes with a pillow somewhat similar to a small Boppy.  It is great for tummy time.  I did not purchase this gym, it was a gift.  It is quite pricey for what it is.  Most babies I would think would be as happy with a less expensive alternative.	
1. 	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you!  No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).  The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.	
1. 	I bought this tub, but rarely used it.  As an infant my son was mostly washed while he was lying on the bed and I used a basin of water.  By the time he was really ready to be in a tub, we placed him on the teddy bear sponge you place in the bottom of a regular tub, which he enjoyed much better.	
- 1	poor quality and the &#34;piping&#34; around the edge looks cheap in the cheapest &#34;faux leather look&#34;. Was given a hand me down skip hop changing pad that lasted through 3 kiddos and finally gave in, so this was a replacement for that one and out of the box it looked so cheap I didn't even want to use it, so I returned it. Amazon was AWESOME at allowing a quick easy return.	
- 1	I purchased this based on the good reviews that it received here on Amazon.  I am not really impressed with it. It seems really flimsy and like it could fall off any second.  In fact, it did un-Velcro one time when I was trying to shove a Grande Starbucks cup into it.  Not being able to support my Starbucks drinks is a major strike for this product! I have an Uppababy Cruz and it was difficult to find a stroller organizer to fit on it so I am stuck with this one and just have to be careful not to put too much in it.	
- 1	My daughter is 3 months old, and this doesn't work well for her. I have it spaces as far apart as it will go, and it's too small to safely fit her head, yet just fits inside the carseat. I thought I would like this a lot more. I think the side pieces are too stuffed for it to be helpful.	
1. 	Baby #4 is due in a few weeks and we just assembled this today.I think my biggest concern (ordering site unseen) was the scattered reviews that said a normal mattress didn't fit the crib.  I have a Sealy baby mattress (probably really Kolcraft) - nothing fancy - and it fits just fine so that worry has been laid to rest.  Maybe some people had wonky cribs or wonky mattresses, I don't know.My other big concern was how solid is the crib.  I had a crib collapse on one of my daughters - luckily she was not hurt, but she was stuck by her neck which is not something I ever want to experience again.  What happened with that crib was one of the bolt plugs that the mattress support screws into popped out of the wood.  It was a drop side crib, but not exactly a drop side issue.  Still, I am sure the extra wiggle of a drop side crib added to the plug working lose.  For the record - I think drop sides CAN be made safely.  The problem is nowadays things are being made CHEAPLY - which is the real issue.  This crib is not a drop side, so it is super solid to begin with.  Then at each corner of the mattress, rather than a single bolt plug (sorry, I don't know the wood working term but you know it if you see it!) is a strip of metal with 4 holes, held in with 3 screws - which seems MUCH more secure to me than one single bolt plug.  This crib DOES NOT move when you shake it.I'm a little concerned about the gap between the two top rails that some have mentioned their kid getting stuck in.  Truth to tell we'd have gone with Kalani to skip that issue if Kalani was available in natural - but everything else we own is natural and I really wanted natural  so I am going to hope that is not a problem for is - or if it is it is something the child does once and learns not to do again.  Time will tell.  There are covers you can tie on to prevent this if needed.The wood IS on the softer side - I am hoping having it in natural will make scratches less apparent.  We live in an 80+ year old house, so I'm used to things having character.  None of my other kids have been crib chewers so I am not too concerned about that being a problem - if it is there are covers you can buy (the same ones to prevent the arm wedging).I love that it comes WITH a real toddler bar - none of this take a side off and call it a toddler bed when it's not, or having to order the toddler bar as an extra piece for a LOT of money.  That's just baloney.  LOVE that this includes it.OK all that said.  It's gorgeous.  It went together fairly easily (though I was surprised at how many pieces it came in - but I managed to get it all together myself except for the mattress support, even 9 months pregnant with 3 kids under foot).  The price is nice.  It's SOLID.  There is one thing I hate about it, though.  The curvey fronts make it very hard to side-car against an adult bed, which was my plan with this crib.  There is a BIG gap.  I don't like this at all.  So it's possible for the first year we might put one of my twins in this crib in toddler mode, and sidecar her current crib to our bed - or I might devise some sort of sling to go between this crib and our bed to close the gap (would also prevent the crib from sliding away - we have hardwood floors and the crib moves very easily).  I'm not annoyed enough by the problem to pack the crib back up and ship it back, but I wish I had gotten a crib with a flat front.  If you're planning to side-car, keep looking.  If you want a gorgeous solid crib and don't care so much about that, this one should do nicely.But stick with natural, since it scratches somewhat easily.  And because natural looks nicest anyway, LOL.  (I think I am out of the loop here, espresso and cherry seem to be the current trend in nursery furniture...  but I just love the look of real wood myself)	
- 1	My story starts back in Summer 2013 when my neighbor came home from a relay raced called Ragnar.  She was obviously still on her runners high as she exuberantly told me and my husband all about her adventure.  My husband in his great wisdom promptly contacted his friend who is a hard-core runner who then signed all 3 of us up for the race the following year.  My husband decided it would be good motivation for him to get in better shape.  I'm not sure how that involved me, but I somehow got roped into his newfound desire to become a runner.A few months went by, and it kept getting closer and closer to the race.  I didn't have a jogging stroller, so I guess I couldn't go running.  Darn.  This was a great excuse for a while. As the race came closer, I knew I had to get a stroller so I could start training, and consequently force my husband to start training as well.  All the research I did told me to get a BOB stroller, but in my infinite wisdom, I knew I could get away with a cheaper jogging stroller and have similar results.  So we settled on this much cheaper Graco quick-fold stroller.Upon opening the package, everything was perfect.  The stroller clicked together quickly and practically effortlessly.  We pumped up the tires, then put the baby in for a test run around the living room.  She was instantly proud of her new chariot (I mean chariot literally, this thing is huge).  The padding and buckle seem to be really comfortable for my baby.A few weeks later, I panicked realizing I have not prepared at all for Ragnar.  I really didn't want to die with my whole team watching me, so I knew I had to start training at least a few weeks before this torture fest that we actually paid money to run in.  The stroller unfolded quickly and easily and I strapped baby in.  I tried to put my iphone 5 in the designated phone spot, but it was obviously designed for a mini phone that I am not completely sure even exists in the market today.  Thankfully the parent console has a bigger compartment you can lift up and store things under, because the phone fit fine there.  I threw a few diapers and a jacket for baby in the bottom carriage just in case.  We stuck a sippy cup on the front and it held in the cup holder just fine (until the baby chucked it out anyway, so strap it on.)After much preparation, we finally took off on our first run.  The first quarter of a mile was going great at my slow 12 minute per mile pace.  Each corner baby got a thrill as the stroller lifted off of one of the wheels, and I got quite the arm work out trying to keep the stroller from tipping and helping it to go straight.  As the workout went on, and on, and on, so about a half mile in I noticed my arms were starting to feel like lead.  By the end of the first mile I felt like I was running while pushing a 100 lb. weight over my head.  The handle bars just seemed to high for my average 5'5 frame.My husband, being the caring guy he is, decided to take the stroller for a whirl the next time we went running.  He grumbled a bit about the discomfort of the handlebar height (he is 6'0).  The next morning is when things started to get interesting.  My husband told me he was pretty sure all of the muscles in his lower legs were ripping in half because he was in so much pain.  Upon further investigation, he really just had shin splints.  We chalked it up to him being out of shape and running on concrete, which will give shin splits to most runners.  We took turns trading off the stroller, but he mostly pushed it because he felt he needed an excuse to run slower than me.  That's easier than admitting that he is really just slower than me.  After a week of this, he was to the point he could no longer walk because as he described, his shin bone could break in half at any time.  He was doing everything right, stretching, icing, trying to run on softer surfaces, using compression socks, and nothing could rid of the shin splints.At this point I decided to start running during my lunch break at work because it was becoming an unreasonable task to get home from work, cook dinner, go running, bath baby, get baby to bed at a decent hour, etc.  So with me running at work, my hubby started running without the stroller since I was home to care for the baby.  Magically, the shin splints started getting better.  At that point we still had not connected that the stroller was the problem.  That was until we went running together again just one last time and the shin splints returned instantly to haunt him of their painful past.We haven't used the stroller much since this experience because we both find it unreasonably uncomfortable to run with.  There are a lot of good features about this stroller, such as that it is comfortable for baby, the parent and child consoles are fairly functional, and it is incredibly easy to fold and unfold.  I also have plenty of complaints, such as the canopy is completely non-functional, it is huge and heavy, the handlebar does not adjust, and namely it is exceptionally uncomfortable to run with.  Walking with the stroller is fine and I imagine we will use it in the future for walking on bumpy hiking trails.  As for jogging, I think we will either have to continue running at separate times or get a new jogging stroller.  As a final note, Ragnar came too quickly and I definitely should have started preparing sooner.  I went out and did my best, and it was honestly a blast and I did better than I thought I would!  So I won't hold too many ill feelings toward my husband for roping me into this experience, it has been great motivation to get into better shape and stay in good shape.  Maybe I'm still on my runners high as I am writing about the experience at Ragnar.	
1. 	When we started potty training, both my husband and I agreed we would not get a little potty, and wanted our daughter to go right away on the toilet.  She could easily get up on the potty with this seat.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts because at one point, when she was being defiant, as all toddlers can be, she did break apart the step on one side.  It was easily put back together, but was a little bit of a scare.Once she got more confident, she also used to sit on the potty and was constantly lifting up the step with the handles, leaving lots of bruises on Mommy's shins.So this is perfect to start out if you don't want to use the little potty seat.  Once they gain their confidence, I would recommend that you replace you toilet seat with one that has a built in toddler seat and just get a little stool for them.	
1. 	love it. has 3 different color modes. found same product in stores but at least no sales tax and shipped to home. very soft and cute. makes great nightlight. only bad thing is that it turns off after 15-30 minutes, would like it if it stayed on all night.	
- 1	I purchased this seat in March 2013 for my husband's vehicle, a 1999 Ford Explorer. We didn't want to spend as much money as we'd spent on the Britax Marathon 70 that is installed in my car, and the positive reviews I saw were encouraging. My disdain for this seat developed very quickly. Because my husband's vehicle doesn't have LATCH, we needed a seat belt install, and even though the seat belt locks, the locking retractor causes the seat to tip to one side. That isn't unsafe, but it drove me nuts putting my son in the seat and trying to get the harness secure. I also found the seat got loose over time. I finally used the locking clip to stop the tipping, which did a better job of keeping the seat tightly installed and upright. This was a minor annoyance, however.My biggest complaint are the harness straps: they twist very, very easily. This is caused by the vehicle's seat belt pushing up against the harness straps along the belt path. The harness is one continuous loop, so it's very easy for the sides to become uneven. It's a rethread harness, which isn't a huge problem when the seat is installed rear-facing, as it is in our vehicle, but would be really annoying if installed forward facing. You have to be very careful when rethreading the harness; the first time I put my son in it after doing so I tightened the harness and one of the straps came completely off the splitter plate.My husband was growing very impatient with my continuous fussing over the seat, but proper use is important to me and it's darn near impossible with the Tribute, at least for me in this vehicle. As it is, the seat has a short shell - a full inch less than his Britax seat. Our son was at about the 10-15th percentile for height until his 18 month check-up; he's hit a growth spurt and is now above average. The short shell means he is running out of room to be rear facing in this seat, something I did not expect when I bought it a year ago. He's not yet two, and I had hoped to keep him rear facing longer. So, given my hatred of this seat and the fact it won't work for us much longer, we replaced it with a Graco Headwise 70 for my husband's vehicle. I installed the Tribute in my parents' car with LATCH, and that was slightly easier. For ease of installation,the Britax is the hands down winner; the Headwise in my husband's vehicle (even with the seatbelt) is a close second.I don't have many positive things to say about the Evenflo Tribute. It is very light, and even though it's not well padded, my son has always seemed comfortable in it. That's about all I can think of.	
1. 	These are great for nursing mothers.  I've given these as a baby shower gift along with an Avert breast pump before.  They were received well and I've been told they're comfortable and very convenient.	
- 1	This just kept tipping over and/or falling off, so we returned it. The fastener just isn't very strong. When you would fold up the stroller, this would get tweaked. Not a good product.	
- 1	I bought these to teach my son to use silverware but they are harder to use than my real stuff.  The fork is useless but the spoon is good.  Unfortunately, my son won't use them and just uses my everyday silverware.  Made me nervous but he learned with in a couple days and doesn't hurt himself.  For us, this was just a waist of money.	
- 1	It takes too much space. Make me feel my baby was squeezed in. I didn't use it at all. Maybe it is good for very little baby.	
- 1	I will not be ordering again because it does not have the slanted edge- which really helps when trimming babies nails. They are also very small in size which makes it difficult to maneuver. I find these over priced for the quality.	
- 1	I bought this for my twin girls and was really excited to use it at bath time, it worked for about five minutes and hasnt worked since.	
1. 	This is good with music and light.. most of the other gyms don`t have light..My Son is enjoying being in the playmat. It works well in the tummy time too..Believe your angel will start exploring about rainforest...	
1. 	My son loved it right away. He felt like a boy sitting in. The tray was great while he was younger but we don't use it any more since he sits at the table. The height adjustments are great for growing toddlers. Very easy to clean and store. I am very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	The idea is good, put your sleeping baby from the car to the house without the baby waking. My daughter is rarely sleeping when we come home so there goes that good idea and when she is, unfortunately she still wakes and wants out. So, I rarely use it and even though I rarely use it, the motor all of a sudden started making a loud disturbing noise that wakes my baby anyways. Its not worth the money spent, in my opinion. Save your money and buy something else.	
- 1	I bought this sling for my 2,5 months baby because she isn't very comfortable in ERGO (which i love) yet. When i opened the box i had 2 surprises: it's for babies 4+ months and it's 100% polyester (it doesn't say anywhere in the product description and I mistakenly thought it was cotton like many other slings like this). The quality is very nice though, it even feels like cotton, pretty soft. I would recommend to go for a Large size, because S/M is way too tight (not stretchy at all) even for someone skinny.	
- 1	This was just too small and didn't seem stable enough. Plus the peepoo hole is too small! We returned it.	
1. 	I have several of these halo sleep sacks in 100% cotton. They are great - except that the fabrics are not all the same weight depending on the color you buy. Soft pink is nice and heavy as is the one that is sweet pea green (sold on another amazon listing) . The pink stripes with the bird is thinner (also on another listing) . It is still a bit heavier than the one Summer infant sleep sack I have (pink butterfly's) . The differing fabric weights are why I knock off a star. Of course fleece would be warmer but you expect that when buying fleece. I thought all the 100% cotton would be the same weight (warmth) but they are not. I will stick to the solid colors since I also have a solid halo swaddle that is heavy fabric.	
1. 	Our boy started potty training around 15 months, and this high back was great for him at that young age, plus it is very easy to clean and fits his small tush (he is only 25 lbs). We got one for each of the grandparents house because he loved it so much and wanted to use it there.	
1. 	This changing pad is very soft. My baby boy has tinkled on it and it just beads up because of the kind of material, makes for easy clean up.	
1. 	I don't have anything to compare this activity gym to, but overall I am satisfied with this purchase. My son is 4 months old now. When he was a little younger he enjoyed watching the lights and listening to the melodies. Now he is mostly interested in grabbing at the dangling toys. He doesn't engage with much of the other features yet. He doesn't use it for very long. I think because he doesn't really like being on his back and also he gets frustrated because he wants to pull the toys down to chew on them. However, it is good when I want to get something done like the dishes or washing my hands after a diaper change.The thing I don't like about his gym is that the battery is in the giraffe which connects to the lights and sounds on top, so if you move it around a lot it messes with the connection.	
- 1	my daughter would get hot in the carseat and my wife and i needed something to cool her down when we drove her home from daycare.we thought this product would help, but it did nothing. it doesn't cool the seat down at all. she was still sweaty. we kept it there hoping for some improvement on temperature, but nothing happened.	
1. 	I love this toy. I've used it for my 2 girls and so far there is no show of wear! LOVE IT!!	
- 1	The music quality on this toy is horrible. It is poor quality and there is a big lopsided lump on the head where the speaker is. My daughter never cared for it. However I do know someone who said their child loved it. My dog wants it more than my baby.	
1. 	This is one of those things that I wish someone would have bought me for my baby shower.  Thank God I found out about it on my own during one of my Google searches for baby stuff!  I love this thing. I have twins and have two mirrors.  It's so nice to be able to do a quick glance in the rear view mirror and see my babies smiling, kicking, sleeping, etc. It's nice to have this mirror as well when your baby is quiet and you can't pull over to see if he/she fell asleep, if something is wrong, or if they're just being quiet! I like this mirror as well due to the fact that it's adjustable. You can tilt it any which way you want! Great find and so glad I found it.	
- 1	We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children. We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time. Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child. I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice. My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool. He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?) inside. Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough. If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.	
1. 	This chair was recommended to me by the staff at babies r' us.  I have not been disappointed with it!  It reclines to three positions (like many chairs do), but, unlike other chairs, the footrest reclines with the chair--a very nice feature. It has a height adjustment as well, and folds fairly flat for storage.  It rolls like a dream and the wheels have locks on them for safety.  I did notice, like the above reviewer, that the tray was a little tight initially, but with repeated use has loosened up nicely and I can now slide it easily on and off with one hand.  The tray locks in three positions as well and also comes with 2 additional dishwasher safe removable tray tops.  The seat is very colorful and cute and wipes clean with ease. The chair also comes with an additional reversible seat pad (green one one side, blue on the other side)--I guess this would be used as additional padding for the chair if you were just using it as a chair (if used for eating, it would have to be removed and washed if anything got on it).  My son sits safely in the seat because there is a 5 point adjustable harness built into the chair as well.  I am very happy with this high chair and will be recommending it to all of my new mommy friends!	
- 1	this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies. after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!	
- 1	This does not hold and it keeps falling off.  What a waste of money and time to return this crappy product.  Do not buy this!	
- 1	The cover I got is a low quality one. The fabric is harsh and covered in lint balls.The stiching is porrly made as well.I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this, but still upset about this purchase.	
- 1	We currently have four of these gates installed in our home. Personally, no one in our home has tripped over the bottom support rail. I don't see how you could unless you drag your feet when you walk. These gates do have a couple of potential downfalls. When you allow them to auto close, it's really loud. Like wake your kid up from her nap at the other end of the house loud. Also, the other day I was a bit aggressive lifting up on one of the gates when I opened it and the screw that holds the top hinge together popped out and the whole gate came up out of the frame. Let me say though, I was trying to open it quickly and jerked the gate up much harder than a person would with normal use. I like that you have to lift the gate to open it. Keeps our smallest child from being able to open it but the older kids can manage it just fine. That lift to open feature is one reason why I wouldn't recommend it for the top of stairs. It would be difficult.Update: February 2013. I was a fan of these gates in the beginning. After a lot of use, they are losing their auto close function. Not that bid of a deal, my hands aren't broken, I can certainly take two seconds to close a baby gate. What I am becoming irritated with is the failure that I wrote about in my initial review. We have now had all four gates come completely off their frames multiple times. Other than the instance I wrote about previously, I am not strong arming these gates, this shouldn't be happening. The problem is that the post on the top of the gate that fits into the frame is made of plastic. The screw that hold said gate post in the frame is metal. The plastic post has cracked on every single gate and the metal screw is popping out, thus allowing the gate to come completely off the frame when opened. The gate comes off, the metal screw goes flying one way, the metal spring goes flying another and I am left on hands and knees looking for these two pieces before the baby finds them and chokes on them. Not impressed.I don't see a way for this to be fixed. We can't uncrack the plastic post, the only way to fix it is to get a new gate. Unless Munchkin can figure out a way to reinforce the plastic post or make it out of a different material, I don't see how this won't happen after time on a replacement.	
- 1	I bought this cup after hearing how it is supposed to help the baby learn to use a straw.  You are supposed to be able to squeeze the sides and the water goes up into the straw.  However, the design of this cup has recently changed.  The outside is very hard plastic and is impossible to squeeze, which defeats the whole purpose of this &#34;training&#34; cup.	
- 1	I got my ergo when my daughter was over a year so I didn't know how to use it with my newborn son. I got this and can't say it did any good. I could never get a natural, comfortable hold. I used my moby for the newborn days.	
1. 	This is a god-send. Our 2 year old toddler just advanced from her crib to her new adult bed, and we were worried that she would get out of bed and go downstairs in the morning. However, since we purchased this, she has stayed in bed all morning (sometimes singing songs and playing games for up to an hour or two until it's time for her to get up and get ready for the day.Construction is what yielded the 4 stars. It is pretty well made, and I was able to assemble it with only a minimum of straining. However, about a month or two after I installed it, the main section has begun to rattle a bit. Not too much to worry about, but still a bit annoying when it should remain perfectly still. It is sturdy enough that I can lean on it to kiss my daughter good night.It folds down to slide under the bed with some ease, but you wont be doing this too often as the weight of the mattress is often enough to slow down that movement. We dont have a box spring (just a metal frame) so we never slide it under the mattress, but someone with a box spring probably would have a slightly easier time.  There are hooks to catch the other side of the bed so it stays upright and does not collapse at all unless you want it to by pulling the tabs on either end. The only negative is that once you've tightened the ropes, there is alot of extra rope material that has nowhere to go.My only concern is that it is a bit low. It's about a foot and a half tall, coming up to just below her waist, and she stands on the bed with her hands on it and jumps up and down. If she jumps too much, she could fall forward and towards the ground, and I'm worried about her breaking her neck. If it were say above her waist and she could not jump over it, then my concerns would be alleviated.	
- 1	I purchased this because it was a small chair that folded up. I have a very small kitchen and no room for extra furniture; and my kitchen chairs are designed so that a strap-in booster/chair is difficult to use. As a bonus, it was pretty cheap, which is helpful when you are constantly finding more things that your child has to have and they outgrow things so fast! However, we had a lot of trouble with this seat, and I eventually threw it away just before my son's first birthday. It gave us six months of service, but we had to repair it about a month into ownership.First of all, because of the non-removable fabric and construction, the fiberboard core that makes up the seat is going to get wet. Whether it's from you trying to clean it or your child dumping out a sippy cup, water is going to get inside the seat, and you won't be able to get it dry enough to salvage it. I first noticed rust-like mildew stains about a month in, so I did my best to clean it with a bleach solution.. Then we noticed that our six month old was slouching back a lot more than usual. The seat is very reclined anyway, but he seemed unable to right himself. That was when we noticed the fiberboard seat had bent in the middle from water damage. Our son was basically sitting on a saggy hammock at this point.My husband cut a piece of thin plywood to fit under the seat to shore it up. It worked really well, but obviously, we couldn't remove the old wet fiberboard, since it was sewn in. We would clean the chair rigorously and then leave it tipped for drainage, outside, in full sun, and it would still be wet by the next meal.All the little connections and fabric brads collect food like crazy, as do the latch components of the belt. We stopped using the belts much for this reason, and just made sure our son was 100% supervised while sitting in it. A few days ago, he figured out how to twist around and stand up in the chair, so we started using the belts again. When I moved them, I noticed they reeked of mildew, and sure enough, the fiberboard core had completely erupted in mildew.We cleaned this chair twice a day at least, every single day, and due to its severe design flaws, we had to repair it once and finally threw it out. I have taken great care of all my baby things in hopes of reusing them with our second child, but this one was a huge waste of money, even as cheap as it was. You make up for the money you save by fiddling with the thing all the time and never getting it clean enough.I went to Target and purchased a Graco Contempo that folded up better (with its tray!) and came with a spare (and obviously removable) cover that I can put in a washing machine. I feel much better about it being hygienic. It also has a 5-point harness, adjustable height, and castors, along with a built in snack tray, regular meal tray, and tray insert, meaning I can feed breakfast, snack, and lunch without having to wash the whole tray in the sink.Pros:Folds upLow cost3-point beltSmall sizeMost of our cups and bottles fit in the cup holderCons:No way to remove fabric pieces for cleaningHole where crotch strap comes in exposes the fiberboard core that makes up the seat, making it extremely susceptible to water damageBack rest is permanently reclinedMany parts are hard to cleanFoot rest sticks out when foldedTray doesn't fold up with chairTray latch stopped catching all the way after a few monthsLots of extra space on the seat that catches lots of extra foodPoorly designed seat promotes slouchingOverall:If this is going to be used at grandma's twice a year, ok, go for it. If you intend to feed your child three meals a day, spend 50 more dollars and get a real chair. You won't regret spending the money on something that is actually easy to use and clean; you will regret all the time you spent fiddling with this nasty thing.	
- 1	I have other SwaddleMe products, and they are much more satisfactory than this. In general, the concept is that they're swaddles for dummies. I.e., you don't need to figure out the ridiculous trick that allows swaddling with a banal, square blanket. Instead, you can just use the velcro to turn a formless sack into its baby-straightjacket mode. For those of you without a screaming infant, that's a major plus. A priori, I kind of imagined that they would lie there and gently submit to being swaddled (especially since they're supposed to like it). But they don't. They squirm and writhe and freak out. As such, velcro is a winner. (Although it is generally a nuisance all other times&#8230;). So, the other SwaddleMe products are a big win.This one is not so much.Let me start with the most obvious failure. The zipper runs not parallel to the length of the sleep sack (which is the way to do it that makes sense, because then you can just lay your baby inside), but rather transverse (which means that you have to pull it over the baby's head, so&#8230;instant unhappiness). Ostensibly, this makes it easier to change diapers. But, as is so often the case, the distance between theory and practice is rather vast. In reality, this just makes it much much harder to get LT into the sleep sack, and results in fussing, crying, and wailing. And the baby isn't happy either. As a side note, it also doesn't really make it easier to change the child. Alone, this would make it suboptimal and undesirable.As they say, however, &#34;But wait! There's more!&#34; To wit, despite the fact that the other SwaddleMe sleep sack that we have is Small, and this one is also Small, this one fits really poorly. LT is at&#8230;the 10th percentile or something like that in weight, and 75th percentile in length. So&#8230;not a huge baby. But it's not the length that is the problem. It's the girth. When I try to velcro the swaddle, it's a little TOO straightjackety. It's a bit ridiculous to imagine that many babies are going to fit well in this thing. I understand that swaddles should be tight but this is a bit extreme, reminding me of tasteless jokes from childhood.I was truly hoping that this would be an excellent product, like the Winter SwaddleMe that we have. I was pretty disappointed.I said all of that about the small size swaddle, and I was really hoping that the larger one would be better. But it really isn't. There is no middle ground here; our baby falls squarely between the sizes, and the large SwaddleMe is too big, and doesn't effectively swaddle.In a nod to sanity and to retain my sense of composure, I did what I always do with two star products. I tossed it aside, and went and got something else. In this case, I got the Halo 100% Cotton Sleepsack Swaddle, Amazon Product: B003E6OBMA, which I would give four stars.All my other complaints about the small exist here as well. Just go get something better.	
1. 	These two covers (in sage and cream) arrived and is exactly as depicted and I've used them on two different changing pads; they fit without a problem.  They have held up great after a number of washes (I do hang dry these covers, though, to save room in my dryer).  I knew I was taking a chance ordering these (they might be poor quality or not soft), but they arrived and were just as nice as the covers I paid double for! I have recommended them to all of my friends having babies because of the price and quality and it seems like I have to change these every other day so it's good to have multiple on hand!	
- 1	Quite useless	
- 1	My son hated them from the beginning and they are not that useful because food slides on them and they are small so it ends up on their lap...plus they are sized for children with extra slim necks!I used them twice and will give them away. Waste of money.	
- 1	I bought this thinking I would rather a soft shield on my breast pump horns, and I tried this thing on multiple occasions, just to be let down (and not in the way you want while breastfeeding lol). This serves mo purpose and decreases my output while pumping, just stick to the normal horns!	
1. 	I got it on the recommendation of a friend and I am so happy with it.  The sling was perfect and I felt at ease using it when my daughter was an infant.  She loved playing in it as a toddler tub.  Easy to drain, the inside has a bit of padding and she didn't slip around in it.  Stores neatly under her crib.  Don't waste time and money on the fancy ones, this one is the only tub you will need.	
1. 	I got this pump for free at the hospital. I also have an electric one which I bought that is great, but this one stayed in the nursery and was great for relieving engorgement in the middle of the night, or when I need a little more out than the baby took. I could also use it while walking around the house which I couldnt do with my electric one. It was pretty powerful too - could get a whole feeding in a few minutes. It is also easy to clean.	
1. 	We have a 6 month old son and we have been using this carrier since he was a week old.  I think this is a great product.  I tried a Moby wrap sling and Infantino side carrier and Infantino 6-in-1 carrier and they just can not compare to BabyBjorn.  It's so easy to put on!  The fabric is soft enough for the baby, but hard enough so you can adjust the straps every timie you want it.  We adjust a lot, because 3 people in the household use it and we all are of different built.  We use it at least twice a day when walking our dog.It is easy on my back as compared to the ones I mentioned above.  I can not compare with a classic BabyBjorn though, but we bought this one becuase of Amazon reviews.I would recommend to buy BabyBjorn bibs for the time when your baby starts riding face out and chewing on the front flap.  But even if you don't the carrier is easy washable.	
1. 	When the doc told us to put cereal in his bottle, we couldn't have lived without the level 3's.  They are the only one with a hole big enough to get the thicker liquid through.	
1. 	This is a great seat protector.  Our son spilled a milk shake in the car and it dripped through the car seat onto the mat.  The mat saved our upholstery and cleaned up with a damp rag!  Great!  It is very thick and sturdy, and the car seat does not slide when placed on it.  It also keeps your vehicle seat from getting indentations from the car seat as well.  It also covers the whole seat top to bottom.  I accidentally bought a Kiddopotamus cover for our younger son thinking it was this one and it doesn't go all the way up the back of the seat to protect it from indentations from the car seat...plus it's not as thick as this one.	
- 1	I really liked these, until one broke after 3 months.  I do not recommend, because they do not stand up to normal use.	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to travel with! Works great in crib or playpin.  Our son is now able to rest thanks to this product	
1. 	I use the brush to clean both wide neck and classic bottles, even the tip of the bottle nipples. Good brush design.	
1. 	The product is great.  Comfy for my little one, easy to use, and dries fast.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	My children are 18 months apart in age. I did not want to buy two full sized cribs (and in our previous house, we wouldn't have had the room!). I bought this for my son and he happily slept in it for well over 1 year. The wheels are so nice to be able to move it from one room to another as needed. I bought a smaller mattress, smaller sheets and a smaller bumper to fit this and make it cozy for him. At 16 months (30 inches and 22 pounds), he still fits into it just fine, but I've since moved him up to a full sized crib as his sister is in a toddler bed!	
1. 	I'm not exaggerating when I say that we tried every single bottle on the market with our DD (due to reflux). As first-time parents, we wanted nothing but the best for her. After trying all the crazy, expensive, gimmicky bottles, we continued to go back to Playtex Nursers.  These bottles are just about perfect. I don't love that they create more trash, BUT they save so much time by not having to wash bottles every day. I buy store-brand liners, which work fine. I haven't experienced a single leak, and we've been using these particular bottles about 5 months.	
1. 	My coworkers gave this carrier to meat the company shower. I have loved it-for the first few months walked aroundthe house with it and went on walks around the track &park with my husband and dog. It's been great as I wasable to get things done around the house whilebaby slept close to me.We also enjoyed our walks with baby &he was able to feel safe and happy while observinghis new world.It was mostly helpful to me the first few months, but as he began to grow, my back began to ache and we optedto use our Chariot jog stroller during walks.I no longer use the carrier at 9, 10, 11 monthsbut it has been the best/most comfortable carrier by far.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this diaper, it's very modern looking and extremely trim-by far the smallest diaper I own. I actually ordered a grovia cover but this is what I got instead. That was when I first started cding so I didn't really know what I was buying to begin with but then decided to keep in since it would be nice to have an All-In-One for Dad or babysitters. This is probably the worst all-in-one for what I had in mind. There is a flap on the inside that needs to be positioned before putting on baby along with a second snap-on doubler for extra absorption. I have only ever used it with the snap-on doubler and even still I can't go a minute over 2 hours or it leaks. The closure is opposite most cloth diapers and the biggest issue I have is that everything is soaked with urine, often getting on my baby's shirt or waistband. I would never consider using it for an overnight diaper. Also, I'm used to the stay-dry lining on my BumGenius 4.0's where the poo can literally be dumped into the toilet, no sprayers or scrapers needed. I usually try to use this diaper after baby has just had a bowel movement so I don't have to deal with getting poo out of all the different hiding places due to all the flaps. Also, it almost never falls right off if he does happen to have a bowel movement and I don't have a sprayer or scraper since it's not usually an issue...what a pain. The only reason I am even considering holding onto this diapers (instead of reselling it) is that it *might* be a good newborn diaper.	
1. 	My little one really liked this toy. I got to teach her colors by pointing them out along the ring. The colors are bendy and the loose rings are fun to jiggle around. Definitely a baby toy. By the time she was 12 months old, she had moved on.I still like it.:-)	
- 1	The large size of these wearable blankets is a nice idea in theory, but poor in practice. At the age where this size is appropriate (18-24 pounds), children are moving on their own (even in the crib), and the extra floppiness just gets in the way, while the enclosed feet just tended to frustrate my daughter. To make it worse, the opening to one sleeve of this garment was half the size of the other, and her arm didn't fit through properly without a few alterations (I shouldn't need a seam ripper and a sewing machine to get a product this expensive just to function).I can understand this company's products for newborns and younger infants. Swaddling makes sense when kids are that young. But as children approach a year, this product really isn't necessary or all that helpful. Or even made well, in the case of the one I received.	
- 1	The folding mechanism broke on it, but we did use it a lot. Very poor ride/manueverability.Pros:lightweightbellybarCons:Not built for medium/heavy useVERY poor manueverabilityfolding mechanism breaks	
1. 	This is the only sheet I have found that fits my traditional DaVinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 coil mattress.It's thin but fits perfectly. I highly recommend buying a few.	
1. 	Everyone should have at least one sleeved bib for messy meals. This one worked great and seemed well made. Fit nice and I liked the tie back	
- 1	Those mittens are not elastic, and it is a hassle to put on a newborn's hands because it won't expend. You just have to try hard and put baby's hand in it, which makes it difficult and painful to our fingers while trying to make it fit.	
- 1	Got this for my son at 3 months and the plus is that it doesnt take up much space. My son doesnt really get entertained more than 5 - 10 mins on it maybe 15 if I keep him in the view of the mirror. If it had music it'd be better..	
1. 	Our son was born in September and we got this as a shower gift!! We absolutely love it! It is so convenient!! Although we no longer get to showcase all his cute little costs and sweaters there is always the fall and spring!! It fits our Britax Chaperone carseat perfectly and does not effect the harness system at all! It is warm and cozy and we never have to take a jacket on and off our son even with the cold New England weather!! I would definitely recommend this product to moms who live in climates with chilly winters!! Sure beats unstrapping your baby to take their coat on and off a hundred times!!	
- 1	It leaks, that's about it. Great for dry snacks, but I was using it for my homemade baby food. So not good in the fridge if it ends up not being perfectly straight.Maybe I should not have washed them in the dishwasher...	
1. 	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.Love it!	
- 1	You are better off spending the extra money to buy a better sippy cup. These leak like crazy and the lids are a hassle to put together. I recommend NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce.	
- 1	I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews for this monitor.  I've waited to write a review until I had the opportunity to use this product for several weeks.  My only other experience with a baby monitor is a Summer monitor which I'ved used for hours each day and throughout the night for the past almost 3 years (I actually have two of them, which I love). However, the Samsung pales in comparison and it seems considerably overpriced.There are several features of the Samsung monitor that I find problematic:1) The resolution is poor. While one is typically using the monitor to make sure his/her child is still in bed or out of harm's way, so seeing in detail with great resolution isn't really a necessity, I was still surprised at how poor the resolution is - it does have a larger than average screen, but I don't see the point of a large screen with poor resolution.  A smaller screen with better resolution seems to make a lot more sense to me.2) The battery life is terrible.  The system comes with a power cord and most of the time it needs to be used while plugged in.  It's also possible to use it in sleep mode which means less battery power is used, but you can't see your child unless there's noise detected by the camera. I prefer to keep the picture view on while I'm using it as my child sometimes gets up and gets out of bed without making a sound. When the battery does get low, there is a battery low indicator to let you know, but it's typcially only a minute or two until the monitor dies completely and it must be plugged in.3) You want to make sure you don't forget to check that the camera is in view of your baby/child before he/she falls asleep because the monitor makes an obnoxious sound when powered on - one that would likely wake up anyone else sleeping in the room, especially your baby.4) It's very easy to touch the wrong button on the monitor which then means that the camera and monitor must be paired again - this means walking into your child's room to touch a button on the camera to make this happen.  This is not good at all if it happens when your child who doesn't sleep well to begin with is finally fast asleep5) The cord on the camera is very short, which reduces your options for where you can place the camera in relation to an outlet.  Mounting the camera in the corner of a room is not an option.6) The menu/navigation seems primitive - it feels like my first computer (in terms of functinality, this is irrelevant, but given the price point, I expected something a bit more advanced.The only real positive features I can see are that it has the capacity to integrate multiple cameras and it has a talk feature where you can talk to your child.Overall, I was very disappointed by this baby monitor.	
1. 	I think a lot of kids these days have this toy. It's quite popular. All my friends with babies have it.It's a toy providing light entertainment.I'm a trained musician and I disagree with some reviews saying that the quality of the sound is poor. Trust me, for a toy it's totally fine. You can still tell the instruments apart. You can't expect your baby to become a little Mozart just by listening to this cube 5 minutes a day anyway.Everything seems to function well. It's safe. I'm not scared to turn away for 30 seconds. I know that there are no sharp edges and my baby won't hurt herself.I'm not sure this toy carries a lot of educational / developmental value but it's nice.	
1. 	Absolutely love this bib!!! After purchasing many cloth bibs covered in plastic with velco closures, finally stumbled upon this awesome product. Super easy to clean and catches plenty of messes. Will definitely be recommending to my Mommy Group friends. Must have product for feeding time. Don't waste your money on nasty, mildewy plastic-covered cloth bibs. ***Only complaint is that LO figured how to can pull it off.	
- 1	These are terrible, they don't stay in your babies mouth.  Try the Mam brand, sooo much better!  I have to think anyone who gives these a positive review haven't tried Mam.	
1. 	This has been the only one of her toys that she has loved pretty much from the get go... by the time she was about 4 weeks she would last about a half hour on it, looking at the lights and listening to the music. She went from accidentally batting the animals to now, at 5 months, playing with them and laughing until she eventually falls asleep all tuckered out :) I am going to buy a second one for her to have at her babysitter's house. Absolutely LOVE this!!	
- 1	I found this sling complicated to use.  They have an instructional booklet with photos but it isn't clear on how to position the baby correctly.  I eventually figured it out but my baby really hated it.  He's normally a very placid baby but cried the moment I put him in it and didn't stop until I took him out.  He loves his other carriers but this one didn't work for us and I wouldn't recommend it to any babies who don't enjoy being swaddled.  I appreciate that they offer this carrier in organic cotton but it ended up being a waste of $60 for us.	
1. 	Easy to clean, feels soft and comfy for my toddler, just the right height to sit at our dining room table. I like this brand much better than the cushee tooshee one we have	
- 1	It looks great. My daughter was happy as it is pink...she sat in it and thought it was comfortable...but when I looked for the instructions to get her into the harness there were none. When I called amazon - amazon was lovely - I was told that that was how it arrived from the manufacturer. Ok. But so manufacturer also sent it simply in a box with a plastic bag on it. Hopeful that this wasn't thrown around too much in transit. I really wanted to like this...we need a new car seat ....but I am returning this tomorrow. (Note: many of the reviews that I have read on this said that it was very important to read the manual as it is hard to install)	
1. 	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews about other bottle warmers.  Some claimed that water would get trapped and were hard to clean.  This one is pretty easy and straight forward.  It does an excellent job at warming our bottles.  It will simply warm up any water that's in the compartment.  With that said, if you pour too much or too little water in, that will alter the results.  The only downside for me is that it won't let you warm glass baby bottles.  I think it's a great product for the price and simplicity.	
- 1	Let me start by saying: the idea is genius. Too many kids are using sippy cups for way too long.  It's a nasty habit and gross to see a 4 year old walking around sipping milk from a sippy.  Milk and juice beverages should be drank at the table, not wandering the house.  That said, this helps kick that habit and offers a little extra security with the lid.The bad:  it leaks.  Leaks. Leaks.  Mason jars are cheap and non toxic. No chemicals no stinky plastic. My kids don't throw their cups so I'm not concerned about breakage but, they're also durable in case of a fall.  But this lid?  Leaking disaster. What a waste of $11!!!  I mean a cheap plastic lid shouldn't cost that much it I was willing to fork out the extra cash for something good. Nope that was a bad idea.I the end, we just serve our kids their drinks at the table, with no lid, in a mason jar (small 8oz size). It's less of a mess without the EIO lid than with it.  The lid makes a dribbling mess everywhere.Don't waste your money. Just teach your little ones to drink from a cup the old fashioned way whenyoufeel they're ready.	
- 1	my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).  The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.  Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.  I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.  Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.  I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?  Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.	
- 1	I ordered the 21 mm and they sent the 19 mm. All they had to do was match my order with the number on the product.	
1. 	I'm a stay at home mom with my first baby.  I had trouble from the start getting my little one to latch on when I delivered.  The lactation nurse in the hospital brought me the Medela Symphony (the fancy, hospital-grade pump) to help me along. It worked great and I even rented it for 2 months.  Since I knew most feedings would be direct from me I didn't need to invest in a double electric pump so I gave the Harmony a try.  I wanted to have some expressed milk stored for the moments when I needed to be away from my baby, nights when daddy helped by getting up to feed with a bottle and when it was a better option to feed from a bottle when we were in public or visiting friends.This pump expresses milk really well!  I got 3 ounces with my first try (baby was 2 months old) in about 15 minutes. I've had it for a month and easily express 2-4 ounces from each side depending on the time of day (baby is 3 months now).  It takes about 30 minutes to pump both sides at one sitting.  My hands do get tired and achey at times, but it's manual and I sort of expected that.  This comes with a soft shield but I personally prefer the hard plastic one.  I found the soft one twists a little with the suction and tiny dribbles come out.  I like the portability to walk around if needed unlike with the electric pumps... it's super lightweight.	
1. 	If you are doing CLOTH diapers and wipes, this is the wipes warmer for you!!  It's great for disposables to pop-up in case you ever stop using cloth ones, so why wouldn't you want to cover both if you can?! I have used this for 9 months now and wouldn't use anything else.The best thing about it is that you can have a pool of water in it if you want to dip cloth wipes into a solution.  It won't leak water out like the munchkin one will once filled more than 1/4 inch. It's also easier to clean than the munchkin; it has a flat bottom as opposed to a groved bottom. I used to put a cloth wipe solution in and dip the wipes and ring them out. Now, I prefer folding two kinds of wipes, placing them separate piles in the warmer, then pouring solution over them.	
- 1	These inserts were very disappointing. They take forever to dry, and leak right through!! Worst inserts I have tried. I recommend the Flip inserts, they are much more absorbent and dry faster. These inserts also stain more than any other inserts, they don't contain newborn pee or poop at all, and take a very long time to dry (longer than any other inserts I have tried).The flip inserts soak up the pee and wick it away from my daughter's skin. These Thirsties inserts just soak and sit wet on her.	
- 1	So, maybe I am doing something wrong but these are terrible.  We have only had them about a week and I hate them. I was really excited about these because I like the idea of the organic cotton, but they have leaked every single time.  My son gets a slight rash with microfiber so I was hoping cotton would fix that.  I will say that has been the only good thing about these, no rash.  But they do not absorb at all. He is 20 months old and cannot even wear these for an hour without a leak.  In the mornings I change him at 8 right before we leave to take my daughter to school, by the time we get home at 9 he has already leaked through these diapers.  I much prefer my Flips and Thirsties AIOs.  I am going to try the organic cotton flip inserts instead of these.  And they take FOREVER to dry.  I find that it helps if you flip the top layer of cotton around the diaper, but even then they easily take an hour and a half in the dryer.  I tried to put them on the drying rack and 24 hours later they felt like they had just come out of the washer.  They also stain very easily, which isn't a huge deal to me since no one sees it but still not very pretty. Save your money.	
- 1	I was so disappointed in these pads. I had used Lansinoh nursing pads and they were wonderful, so I thought these would be too. Unfortunately, they leaked on me! This happened a couple different times. I'm usually one who will just suffer through so I don't waste the product I've already bought but I had to just stop using them, leaving at least half a box.	
1. 	I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4.5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag.  I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK.  A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the basket. I wouldn't even call it that but it's there.  I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back. This is definitely the best and prettiest umbrella stroller I've had after three daughters so I'm going to enjoy it.	
- 1	This is great for the first 30-60 days with a new baby, but good for the garbage after that.  It gets moldy fast, and a larger baby will flip right out.  I would say it's likely there is something better, but for the price it's good.	
1. 	Added a lot more room for my son's playzone.  Since the original is smaller, I wanted to make it a wide enough spaces for him to move around.	
1. 	This is a nice looking giraffe but the sounds could be better. They are not loud enough. Also, the volume control is not that easy to turn especially when you are half asleep at night. It is hard to grab.	
- 1	I bought these containers thinking they'd be great to supplement our OXO and Nuk baby food storage containers (we make and store our own baby food and bring it back and forth to daycare, so we use a lot of containers). And they were great -- once.  After one washing virtually none of the lids ever formed a strong seal on its matching container again.  I've given them a few tries even after discovering that the lids don't stay on -- when all of my other containers are in use -- and each time the result has been baby food or yogurt spilled all over the inside of our baby's lunch box.  I think the issue is that the cup units warp.  Whatever the reason, don't buy these.  There are much, much better options out there.	
1. 	These are super affordable.  They are a towel like material so very absorbent and are large enough to catch spit ups.  The colours are lovely and bright, the photo does not do these justice.	
1. 	This toy instantly became my five-month old's favorite.  We also have the Baby Einstein Bendy Ball and he far prefers this one.  It's a partially complete orb with plastic slices that move around the outside.  They slide easily and make a nice clacking noise that my baby likes.  Each slice is a bright color and the outside is textured, while the inside is reflective.  The little character in the middle spins easily.	
1. 	This is small, sturdy, and great for the price.  It takes up minimal space on the counter yet holds all my bottle pieces and accessories and then some.  I would recommend this over some of the fancier ones.  It does the job well.	
- 1	I don't like because is poor quality. I never use, after first wash. I thought it was better quality, as Carters always has good products	
- 1	I bought these bibs because I liked that they were 100% cotton & they seemed highly reviewed. The downside to these bibs is that the neck is very small. I feel like they are already VERY tight on my 2 month old & he is not a particularly big baby. I feel a bit uncomfortable even putting them on him because of the small neck size. These bibs are cute and in terms of material and sewing they seem well made...it's just a shame that for the price you pay for them that they aren't going to work for your baby for very long at all.	
1. 	These are great and inexpensive covers! The quality of material is great! I bought two for myself and am giving as baby gifts bc I love them so much!	
- 1	I received this as a shower gift from someone who raved about it, and installed it into my car seat to take my premie home from the hospital.  It looks so cozy, and is very soft.  I'd love to have one of these.  However, babies should not have these in the car seats!  Despite what other reviewers say!  Despite the fact that they say it's safe!I had my baby 5 weeks early, and because he was a premie, he had to pass a car seat test before being released, in which they monitored his O2 levels and heart rate in the car seat for 90 minutes, to make they didn't drop too low.  I put my son into the car seat with this, and gave him to the nurses for the test.  He failed it (his O2 levels went slightly lower than what was considered passing).  We redid the test the next day, and he failed again.  On the third day, I took everything out of the car seat (except of course the straps!), because it looked like he was kid of squished in (which is the point of the snuzzler I think?), and he passed.  Of course, he was 3 days older (I recognize the confound).  But, it did made me wonder....  I contacted a few people about the safety of types of after-market add ons to car seats, like this, and other head supports, but asked specifically about his one, as it claims to be safe despite others like it not being safe.  Basically, you should have NOTHING in the car seat other than the straps.  Even the head stabilizer that comes with most infant seats is not completely safe. The snuzzler DOES have fabric that's behind the baby (at least the one I got), albeit it's not thick and I agree that I did not think that it would push the baby's head forward, but heeded the warnings of the people I talked to (nurses, the carseat lady (google her)), and it also has all of the padding around the baby that push in the arms.  Anyways, this might be ok to keep a baby comfy when lying on a flat surface, or maybe reclining in a jogging stroller? I'm not sure.  But it's not safe for a car seat (my car seat's warranty is voided if anything is added, and certainly does not have a special clause to allow the use of snuzzler despite it's claim to be tested and safe).	
1. 	This high chair is great.  My son is a little over 6 months old and we've been using it for about a month now.  It attaches easily to your standard kitchen chair - but the straps are long enough to even attach to a bulkier dinning room chair if needed.  It is very stable.  My son is quite tall/big for his age and we've had no problems with stability at all.  It comes with a 5 point harness - but we only use the three.  I love how it can be adjusted to tilt to multiple levels.  It's also very easy to clean.  My son is a spitter as they call them and has a very slight gag reflex.  So if a little bit of cereal goes down the wrong pipe or he catches some extra air with a bite of squash then all it takes is a couple good coughs and all of dinner is up and all over the place!  Granted I can't wait until he's over this stage, but until then I need a chair that is easy to clean and this one is!  The cover and the straps come off very easily.  I just take it all over to the sink, hose it off and hang dry it on a drying rack.  I've never tried washing it in the machine.  This routine occurs a couple times a week and I can have it all apart and back on in under a minute.  I would definitely buy this again, especially since your child can use it through the toddler years.	
- 1	My son loved these but they were ruined after one cleaning in the dishwasher, kroger brand is much better.	
- 1	This wrap is too stretchy. My 9 lb baby was sliding right out and it was not supportive enough. I think the design is cute and attractive. But that's it. Save your money.	
1. 	I am absolutely in love with this.  I sleep better, my son sleeps better... I can lay, half asleep, rubbing his belly, helping him keep his pacifier in... and it is so nice to have him right there...  I bought it when he was 4 weeks old and wish I had it from the beginning.  Absolutely love it!	
1. 	This is a great first toothbrush. Our son likes to chew on it, but doesn't let us help him with it. So while it does get his few teeth clean, soothe his gums, and provide general merriment for him, it isn't preparing him to use a toothbrush. Overall, a good product. I'm glad we have it.	
1. 	Soft glow of green, blue and amber. Amber is very soft, the other 2 are much brighter. Also, fun for babies to investigate. Stars are more defined if only about 3 feet from a wall, but still neat looking even if further away. Will probably use ourselves for ambiance when our son outgrows it. :)	
1. 	At first I didn't like this step as it wasn't tall enough for my then 2 year old son to get to the toilet seat on his own. At nearly 3 years old, he can get up-and-down from the toilet seat on his own, but he's still not even close to reaching the faucets on the sink. However, after several near miss falls on a small, sliding two-step Rubbermaid ladder, I realized that the BabyBjorn one is a safe choice. And I like the way that it looks too and the fact that ours was made in Sweden (I believe it's now made in the USA).	
1. 	Our  son enjoyed this  bouncer from day 1. It' s  his  comfort  zone: the place where he  sits to observe, to play with  his rattles and  teethers or talk with his  teddy, to  soothe  himself or  have his  mid-morning  nap. He also has many  of his meals while sitting in the bouncer. During  his days of  colics it was a saving accessory since its  vibrations seemed to be the only  true immediate  comfort.	
- 1	Runs very large. My daughter will be in first grade by the time she fits in this. I followed the size guide.	
1. 	duck floats nicely, my baby follows it and grabs it.i don't really use it to check the temperature - but comes in handy	
1. 	This item is great for on-the-go feeding. Plus I figure when he's done with formula, we can use it for cereal or another small travel snack. Very pleased with this purchase, especially because we got lucky on the colors and got the green and blue shown for our little boy!	
- 1	I bought this baby wipe warmer in hopes that it was compatible with german housing. Well it wasnt. I should have read more into it. It basically just serves as a very expensive wipes holder. I dont really know how well it warmes up as I haven't been able to use it.	
- 1	These are really cute bottles. I liked that it went in on the sides of the bottle for easy grips. A family member used these exclusively with her daughter when she was born with no problems. We actually got a few hand-me-down bottles in addition to this set, which I received at my baby shower. The nipples seemed wonderful because I needed something that was like my nipple. This is the largest nipple I've ever seen and really mimics the breast. It has a softish, but pliable texture.So when I started supplementing with formula, I was really eager to try it out. Unfortunately, my baby tried hard to latch to these and was unsuccessful on most attempts. When he did attach, he'd have formula dripping down his face. He'd cry because he was frustrated. So, I can't use these right now.But, I do like that I don't need to toss the bottles just yet. I may be able to wait for him to need a faster flow (I am using the slow flow nipples for newborns, btw). OR, I may be able to replace it with a sippie cup lid. Even better. So these will sit until my son is ready for change.	
- 1	My son was incredibly colicky and gassy as a newborn and we tried many different bottle types - Dr. Brown, First Years Breast Flow, and Tommee Tippee, to name a few. The Dr. Brown's came highly recommended by friends and doctor's but did nothing to help our little guy and actually made him gassier. Not only did these not really do as they said, but they are also a pain to clean and put back together. These bottles have so many parts that they are more of a hassle then they are worth. Overall, a waste of money for us and not a bottle I would recommend. We discovered the Tommee Tippee's and will stay with them for the duration!	
1. 	When our baby started standing up, I held him under the armpits and helped him walk while supported.  It's not the most comfortable position to hold over the long run - for me or for the baby.  This harness distributes the support over his whole torso using a durable foam-padded soft wrap-around chest piece connected to nylon web belt and soft loop handles for the adult to hold.  The loops can be adjusted in the length to adapt to your height.  There are no pressure spots so this makes wearing the unit comfortable.  Baby can take supported steps while you hold him from above.  Our baby enjoyed this activity so we spent a long time each day walking around the house.  I credit this item for making this activity a comfortable and fun way to spend time with our baby and for helping him develop good leg strength.  We stopped using it once he was able to stand and support himself using a push-cart with wheels and used that to walk while supporting his body until his balancing skills developed.	
1. 	I LOVE these because they are really convenient and easy to use. We have it by our pool (baby gated) under the overhang so we can enjoy the pool and sun and yet have LO out there playing or asleep at the same time. It is very convenient. I do not like the cleaning issues. It is hard to clean and though it is billed &#34;PACK N PLAY&#34; like it is the &#34;umbrella stroller&#34; of play yards, it is hardly that easy to just fold and run.	
- 1	Our 3 month old daughter has horrible GERD since birth. She's on meds, special formula, cereal added, we keep her upright for feedings and for an hour afterwards, etc. We were able to raise the head of the bassinet which she quickly outgrew, but not the new crib. Our pediatrician whose son also had severe GERD basically said good luck because she's going to probably have to sleep in her swing until she's a year old. No way do I want to do that! It's fine for a nap, but she never sleeps as deeply in her swing and she really needs to be trained on good sleep habits like all other kids or she'll have problems all her life (and I'm speaking from experience, I had her same issues as a kid and have had lifelong insomnia -- now I know why). This under the mattress is working well for us for right now. During the transition from the bassinet, we had to put this in the middle of the crib for a few nights with a towel around her to keep her from sliding down and from freaking out. The first night we didn't do this and it was a disaster even though we'd introduced her to the crib earlier with no problems. She moved in her sleep and when she couldn't figure out where the heck she was with all this space and even with my picking her up immediately (we co-sleep in the same room with her) she screamed and fretted for a good hour (staring at me as if she wanted to make sure it WAS Momma and nothing else had changed! so sad but adorable at the same time!).When I went to remake the crib once she was used to it (we just kept spreading the towel around her until she was used to the extra room, it took 3 nights) and I moved the wedge up, there was a VERY unsafe gap. While someone (MIL....sigh) suggested that if I *had* to 'mess with it' to just roll up towels, but this is so not a good idea. Very dangerous! Instead I put this under the mattress and it solved the problem even if the angle doesn't seem to be quite as high. As far as wedges go, this is a decent price although the price fits the cheap quality (two pieces and it off gases terribly). We're going to replace this as soon as we find something that works better (and is safer and made with better materials).So yes, it works, but I can't recommend it.	
1. 	This isn't my sons favorite toy but it does keep him entertained when his attention finally falls on it. Plus it's so cute in his little hands.	
- 1	I got this for my son when we visit friends and family so we don't have to drag his high chair along. We ended up having to buy a real booster seat anyway. This seat is very unstable and just isn't safe or efficient.	
- 1	Mine was included with the set I purchased. The sheet is as soft as some of the others that I have purchased, also it doesn't fit my mattress very well. It is a bit too tight, and it can't be my mattress, because the others fit perfectly.	
1. 	The best thing i found about these toothbrushes are that they are not a straight long typical brush, because these bow out into an oval it makes it harder for a child to accidently swallow or push too far back into their mouths. i only really used the two brushes rather than the finger brush. finger brushes just dont cut it for me in teeth cleaning so i just gave that one for my daughter to chew on since its rubbery and she did enjoy chewing it, but i didn't really use it to clean her teeth. these ones i feel the most comfortable giving to her to walk around with to munch on.	
- 1	We got this mat for our 9 month old so while she was playing the surface wouldn't be as slippery..  It smells after 2 months of use everyday so I'm disappointed.	
1. 	We've had great luck with this tub. Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. Our son has fit just perfectly.  The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.	
- 1	The item was cute, which is why I purchased it but I was sooo close to just returning it. I followed people's reviews and went up a size (to the 3-6 months) even though I have a 2 month old. I'm glad I did, this DOES fit him, but the sleeves were super wide in comparison to the rest of the item and yet somehow it was difficult to put on my baby. Maybe I'm just used to Carters and other brands of baby clothes that seem to slip easily over baby's head and allow easy insertion of arms etc... but this was a struggle. By the time I got it on my baby he was so fussy... and like I said, I wasn't that thrilled with the fit, the arms are huge in comparison to the rest of the outfit. My boyfriend came out and saw him in it and asked why we had dressed our son like a monk...	
1. 	I had a very difficult time nursing in the beginning. Without getting into all the details, I was given this shield in the hospital And hated it at first -- it almost seemed to make my daughter hurt me even more and she continued to be frustrated. Every feeding consisted of a failed breastfeeding attempt, followed by me pumping while someone else gave her some formula. Later, when my milk came in, I realized that the reason the nipple shield had hurt even more than her powerful suck was that she was sucking extra hard on my nipples because she was having to suck the thick colostrum into the shield and then out of the shield! Poor baby! Once my milk came in, though, I realized the benefit of the shield.I have been using it for 4 months. There are days when I consider trying to wean her off of it, but to be honest I just don't have the nipples for going shield-free. It hurts me too much to even attempt it, and I'm just not willing to put myself through that when she's doing just fine with the shield. The most important thing is that the milk gets into the baby!	
1. 	This is the third Cloud night light I purchased for a gift; the other two were for my grandchildren.  The lights are so soft and soothing no matter which color you choose red, blue or green.  It shines stars all over the room (ceiling & walls) depending here you put the  stuffed animal (we usually place it on the floor).  Wish I had this when my children were babies as it's really neat!  Made well and the batteries are securely placed where the children will not access them.HIGHLY recommend this for your children, grandchildren or for a gift.  An excellent gift that will be loved for years to come!  Being that this is the third one I bought, it's obvious I like the product, that's why I gave it 5 stars.	
1. 	My dad bought this and one other (Safety 1st Prelude Sport Playard, Citrusplayard for us before our twin girls arrived.  I picked the Dream On Me because I wanted one that was bigger that both my girls would fit in for more than a year.  This one is definitely bigger than a Graco!  My girls are now 18 months old, 31in tall, and 22lbs each and still fit great.  (I know the weight max is supposed to be 35lbs, but I see no drooping or wear with 44lbs in it) It IS a little difficult to set up and take down at first, but once you figure it out (and remember!) it is VERY EASY.TO SET UP:DO NOT PUT THE BOTTOM ALL THE WAY DOWN FIRST!  The bottom must be pulled up in order to lock the bars! I always leave it just over halfway pulled up, then lock the longer bars first, then the shorter bars  THEN PUT THE BOTTOM DOWN.  The locking mechanism is double jointed so be sure you lock both joints in.  If you do not leave the bottom up far enough it will allow you to lock all but one bar into place.  That is why I say to leave it just over halfway up and you will not have problems.TO TAKE DOWN:FIRST PULL THE BOTTOM UP! Again, I go over halfway up with it. I then unlock the shorter bars, then the longer.  Again make sure you unlock both of the joints, or it will not fold up properly.  My only issue with this playard is that because it is larger, the pad is larger and it has to fold over on itself once when you wrap it around to fold it up.  It can be a little difficult to do alone, but I usually just put it on the floor and squeeze it together.I read all the one star reviews on this wondering why on earth anyone would give it one star and almost all of them said they couldn't get it set up.  I didn't mess with it for about 5 months (it stayed set up) and I did forget how to set it up/take it down and started to get really frustrated.  Once I figured it out it was a cinch!My girls got sick and vomited in it and it was easy to clean.  The pad was very easy to clean and it did not soak up one bit of the cleaning solution I used on it.  We've been using it almost every day for a year and a half and it still looks like the day we bought it.If you're looking for a larger than average, no frills playard at a great price, this is it!	
- 1	I used to struggle with my daughter to wash her hair because she didn't like water by her face.  I thought this would be a great solution.  It's not.  By the time you cram this on your kids head, you've lost already.  Plus, you can't really get it perfectly positioned.  Somewhere, there is always hair that is not getting rinsed/washed properly.  It's better just to take the time to slowly get your child used to the water.  Leave the gimmicky things like this out of it.	
- 1	I have no idea how so many people can like these crappy, cheaply made cuts. The handles and bottom of the cup spin around and around the cup itself, so my daughter can never get a steady grip on it. The plastic itself is thin and seems cheap. I found something better at WalMart, and I loath that place.	
1. 	i love the floppy seat.  it is easily put onto the shopping cart, fits any size of cart (even the huge costco ones), covers everything baby touches has a seatbelt that works great and is very soft and comfy.the reason i gave it just four stars is that the fabricd fades quickly.  couple times of washing it and the fading starts.  the second thing i wish is that they had some hipper fabrics, like pink camo, or some retro look.	
1. 	good price, good product and saved me a drive to go buy these items seperately.my sister is having her second baby and we gave her back the breast pump which she lend us when we had ours, this kit contains all of the parts which can not transfer from one mother/child to another. and then some.good value.	
- 1	I bought this sling because my son would not sleep unless I was holding him. I work from home on the computer and I needed both hands to work, so i thought this would help. It did, as long as I was sitting down. It was very difficult to walk around with especially since my son was heavier than most babies his age. This sling is okay, but i really didn't use it much because it hurt my back. I ended up using my front carrier more, it supported my back better and still served the purpose of making my son feel secure. I would not recommend this product unless your baby is not heavy and you have a strong back.	
1. 	My son started to resist going to bed at night so I bought this turtle to make bedtime more entertaining and provide a nightlight until he fell asleep.  He LOVES it.  It really is so cute.  It lights up his whole room and he likes to change the colors and point out the moon.  I was concerned that the shell would be too hard to leave in his crib, but it's fine.  I like that the turtle has a timer and shuts off in 45 minutes.  The &#34;tootell&#34; is already very well loved by my son and I would highly recommend it to other moms.	
- 1	I ordered this product a few times because I keep one in the basket of each of my strollers.It looks and works just fine. The Delux version basically covers your basket in the back so rain doesn't get in. The regular version is shorter in the back.This product is also supposed to come with a nice black cover for the rain cover. This product also comes in a green and brown cardboard box.Last time I purchased this from The Baby's Gallerie through Amazon, I got only the rain cover, not the black cover for the rain cover and wrapped in a plastic bag instead of the manufacturer's packaging. When I wanted a refund, The Baby's Gallerie says The packaging is what we like to call internet packaging. We find the fancy store packaging to add unnecessary costs. Not to mention it is less waste making it environmentally friendly as well. They went on to tell me that this product does not come with the bag anymore.I'm sorry but when I buy something that is new, I assume that I also get the packaging. I want them to ask me if I want internet packaging as Amazon does, and IF I elect it, I want it to be packaged professionally, not in someone's kitchen ziplock bag. Of course, replacing cardboard with a plastic bag does not make it more green and that's how much credibility I give them when I consider their claim that it does not come with the black cover anymore.	
1. 	It is a nice product and definitely keeps my baby warm with the colder months coming up. I can also tell that he will be able to use it will he is much older. However, I am currently using it on my City Mini Baby Jogger. I have found that after installing Bundle Me, I am not able to recline the seat. I need to leave it upright as the rubber strap that holds Bundle me to the stroller would not allow it to extend. also, with this installed, trying to get out the strap that folds the stroller into half is a little more cumbersome. Not absolutely perfect, but still defintely useful and more convenient than using a blanket to him him warm .	
1. 	Who wants a big ugly formula tub on the counter all the time? Who wants to measure formula in the middle of the night? How many times do you want to tell your babysitter how may scoops and how many oz of water...This product saves that.I was buyingEnfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2), they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS!Most moms have and use either theMunchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Varyor a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got aPhilips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cupand I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not leak into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts. So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these 500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3 X 4 were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.That said I would NEVER Give up this formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pour it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.  Hope this helps.	
1. 	When I first saw this, I was sure that it would leak, but it just seemed like such an innovative idea that I bought one anyway. The bottle is incredibly easy to clean because both ends can be removed.I unscrewed the nipple ring and the bottom of the bottle. I was so sure that it would leak if I put anything liquid in it. I filled the bottle full of water and tossed it around on a white sheet to see if it leaked. It didn't, but I still wasn't sure. So, I washed the bottle in hot water. I've noticed that some bottles leak after being washed. Then, I tried the sheet experiment again. It didn't leak. This bottle is 9 months old and still hasn't leaked.I also liked how these bottles were wide and took similar nipples as the disposable bottles from Playtex, which makes switching back and forth from the Playtex disposable and reusable bottles much easier and causes less nipple confusion.	
1. 	We bough this railing for our youngest son (age 2) when he moved from a crib to his big boy mid-high loft.  We thought/hoped he'd use the trundle, but he wanted to be in a bed like his older brother.  It is incredibly sturdy and covers almost the entire length of his bed.  That's good because I was honestly envisioning ways to cage him in his bed so he wouldn't fall (or escape...think Curious George and you have our little man).  It was simple to assemble and install (I'm naturally blonde and did it myself in 20 minutes, so it can't be that tough), and it is remarkably easy to clean and still looks like new after a year.  Our son has stood against it and leaned on it, but it still holds firm, keeps its shape, and prevents him from falling.  The straps were much easier to adjust and the railing is MUCH MUCH sturdier than our other son's railing (Dex Products), something that stopped us from using them on his brother's bed.  We feel confident that our son is sleeping securely and have never worried about him falling off, even though I was against him sleeping on the mid-high loft.  Buy this railing and you and your child will sleep safe and sound, too!	
- 1	I ordered this mirror thinking I could use it with a rear view mirror to see my son while driving in the car, but it's not a real mirror... it's like a fun house mirror in a haunted house or something. It's actually a bit scary for him because nothing is recognizable. Also, the stand is flimsy, and the straps are too, making it hard to even use it if you wanted to. I'm returning it.	
1. 	Very easy to use, combined with almost nothing to clean. The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience.	
1. 	Love these!! Such a great value.  We go through bibs so quickly now that our baby is eating solid food and teething.  Good quality.  Very absorbent.	
1. 	These are good basic bottles.  Going to the baby store and shopping for baby bottles as a new parent was daunting.  There's a litany of choices and every imaginable variation on design.  How do you choose?  For us, it became simple when we decided to stick to glass bottles.  There aren't many choices out there in glass, and those that are available are usually very expensive.  Our daughter has had no problems eating whatsoever so I can't say anything about any of the specialty bottles on the market, but for most babies, I can't imagine needing more than a basic bottle.  These are more or less the time tested glass baby bottle.  Basic and no frills, but solid and sturdy.  We like them a lot, and the price is very affordable.	
1. 	great for rice cereal bottle at night time. watch and listen to make sure nipple doesn't get clogged but overall great	
1. 	My toddler son will NOT keep a blanket on no matter what. this is awesome love it!!!!!  Hope they make these in the future for bigger boys	
- 1	i bought this for my son's diaper bag. i found it was just another thing to have around. i keep his pacifier in a pocket by itself so it can't get dirty. its good quality and fits a natursutten pacifier just fine.	
- 1	I purchased these after a lot of research. I was so unhappy with the plastic bottles, they leak, and for the price I paid, they should have been the best. I would not recommend them to anyone.	
1. 	Very easy to operate with one hand and fit perfectly in the archway between the living room/kitchen. Keeps the kid in, and the dog out!	
1. 	My baby likes it. She likes the colors and the toys hanging on it. One small thing - currently at age of 2.5 months, she kind of leans on one side in the rocking position - could be baby specific but could also be how the seat is shaped.	
1. 	Love this product! Keeps my son's arms swaddled much better than other products. I struggled a product that would keep his arms secure because he was around the 70th percentile when he was 4 months old and most products were too big around or too short.	
1. 	So cute! It's exactly what I had hoped for.  It even has a little spot to store a bottle of body wash and shampoo.  I do wish that it had come with more than 1 set of sticky tape for the wall.	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
1. 	My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.	
- 1	What I don't like:The size is on the small side. The bib itself as well as the opening for the neck.The size of the velcro and the part that attaches to the velcro do not match, so the extra velcro scratched my son's face when he moved his bead in that direction.The appliques that are attached to the closure part are so hard and rough. It also scratched my son's face when he moved, so I went ahead and cut them off each one with a scissor.The material is on the thin side. There are times where it would literally be soaked after a feeding.After a few washes, the material shriveled up and started to fuzz.I do not see myself reaching for these bibs at all. I only use them when I need to do laundry and have nothing else to use.	
1. 	I tried 6 different cup holders for my Baby Jogger City Versa (LOVE the stroller, by the way) and none of them worked until I tried this one. It was relatively easy to install and it fits great. The cup holder is big and feels sturdy. I was also able to easily remove the stickers so the cup holder looks like it belongs with my stroller. The stroller folds easily with the cup holder attached so there is no need to ever remove it.	
- 1	Poor raw material. The locker system tires the bag straps and it isn't simple to be adjusted in strollers for example.	
1. 	I use a large double electric breastpump at work (Medela Pump In Style) and like it ok, but it's large and cumbersome to use at home.  So, I use this little manual pump whenever I'm home and used it during my maternity leave to build up a stash before returning to work -- it's WONDERFUL.  SUPER easy to use, quick, and much more comfortable than my electric pump.  I would leave it on the counter ready to go, and when baby was happily playing quickly pump out a couple of ounces to freeze.  Highly recommended by a breastfeeding working mom of two!!!	
1. 	I like the simplicity of the chair, its easy to grab and use when an any room and clean is really easy. The only complaint I have is the comfort factor, but I don't see how that could be improved without loosing the ability to grab and go and clean easy. I use it with my 9 month old twin girls when I catch them. We aren't full blown potty training yet, so I imagine when we do we will probably need a more perm. fixture.	
1. 	When my parents took my husband and I to Babies R Us to purchase our swing, this one had just come out.  We had originally registered for a different swing, but none of us could resist how cute and cozy this swing looked.  (Wouldn't you want to doze in an adult-sized version of this swing?!)During her first 6 weeks my daughter would only sleep while moving (i.e. in our arms and doing laps around the house!).  This swing was a blessing!  I felt very comfortable leaving her in it for hours because of how far the seat reclines (practically FLAT!) and how comfortable she looks in it.  I especially like that it doesn't have that huge plastic thing that goes between the legs like other swings... this allows us to lay her in it completely swaddled.  I've found that even with the many, many hours a day we run this swing, we've only had to change the batteries about once every one to two weeks.  We even took this swing with us instead of her pack-n-play when we went out-of-town over the holidays.  It broke down very easily and she slept just as good as she did at home.  Her grandmother liked it so much she bought one for when she goes to her house!Now anytime she is fussy or needs some quiet time we put her in the swing and it always does the trick.  She loves the cricket sounds and looking at the mobile.  I dread the day she outgrows it!This swing is definitely the best one on the market!	
1. 	Great product!! Easy to move around, up and down grocery store aisles etc. Very lightweight compared to the travel systems.  I am glad that I bought it, enabled me to spend more money buying the jogging stroller I wanted.  This is great for trips to the grocery store.	
- 1	I have been pleased with a number of my other Munchkin purchases, so I decided to get this bottle brush to replace one that I have overused. Unfortunately, this brush is not useful for us. The blue bristles are so stiff that they cannot get into the corners of bottles. For some of the bottles, the brush hardly fits into the mouth of the bottle at all (4-5 oz storage bottles from the hospital, and regular Dr. Brown's bottles). And, there is no way this brush can be used at all on any pump parts. The white bristles are actually more flexible, but since the blue bristles are at the top and bottom, it makes it virtually impossible for the white bristles to get into corners. We have toyed with the idea of cutting off most of the blue bristles, but that is pointless.The &#34;nipple&#34; brush, which is at the base of the brush, is slightly more useful, but there is a bent over piece at the tip of this brush, which makes it slightly too large to fit into some parts. Also, these bristles are also quite stiff, but this part of the brush is still more useful.I would recommend getting another brush, like the Dr. Brown's bottle brush, instead. They also sell tiny nipple brushes. Both of these items are more useful than this Munchkin one.We have been using this brush to wash vegetables.	
- 1	We bought this crib because it was inexpensive, and we needed one to set up at my parent's house.  My son stays there while I work and naps in it.  The smell permeated the entire room, and still smells after several months.  It is sturdy and functions well, but I wonder what kind of damage the chemicals are doing to my son.  :-(	
1. 	When me and my husband started looking around for which bottles we wanted to get for our twins there was just so many to pick from. Between brands and liners or no liners. What were we to do. We had a lot of friends who just had had babies and many of them got the Avent bottles as gifts. I did some compare and reg for both avent bottles, ventair and one set of the platex nursery bottles the ones without the liners. These bottles by far our both my son and daughers fav. I always thought these bottles had a werid bulky look to them. I thought they would be harder to store in a diaper bag rather than the traditional shaped bottle. Looks meant nothing! My babie took to these bottles right away. We ended up taking all the other bottles back and getting all Avent bottles. We do have a few Gerber bottles that we are starting to use now that the babies are getting older (6 months). But ever since day one both of the children took wonderfuly to the bottle. I dont know if its the shape of the nipple or the design of the bottle that does it. But it works! They are SO easy to clean. Unlike the smaller bottles where it hard to get in and clean them! My children both take the avent took very well. The avent brand is actualy the one brand my daughter will take. SHe will not take any other nuk. My son on the other hand it doesnt matter which brand. But mainly we have avent nuks. All around this is a great buy for a new mommy and daddy!	
1. 	It is very easy to carry and very practical too. I can keep a couple of diapers and other hygiene items inside the bag.	
1. 	I had this with my firstborn, it was an awesome little tub. We only used until he got big enough to sit himself up in the big tub with mommy in there for extra safety.  But he was 6 weeks preemie and this tub made him feel safe enough to enjoy his baths at only month or so old. We liked this so much I was very sad when I found it ruined in our storage shed. We are having our second child soon and you can bet I will be buying this one again. It filled up very nicely and was easy to use and store. Not to mention very sturdy.	
- 1	Converts to backpack-i don't think so!  Unless u like backpacks that only touch 2% of ur back-this bag is not for u.  Does not hold a shape. Its just a blob of a bag. Nice to know where wipes and milk bottle are....but everything else is a pain to get to. Wipes container does not stay closed so dries wipes.  Huggies wipes do not line up with wipes opening. Changing pad is tiny. My 3 month old is too big.  Regret buying.	
- 1	It doesn't look as cute as I see in picture. My daughter doesn't really into it. The design is below expectation	
1. 	We first used this when our son was 4 months or so.  The number of toys was overwhelming to him then.  But by six months he enjoyed playing in it and he was thrilled when he figured out how to make the apple pop up and back down.For us, it was useful for ages 6-11 months.  We mainly used it as a means to occupy our son when we needed a few moments to get something done - to take a shower, to do something on the computer, to complete a household task.  For 10-20 minutes at a time, our son was safe and occupied in this exersaucer.  We were satisfied with the product.	
- 1	My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds.  I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)	
- 1	We were using Tommy Tippee bottles when my daughter was first born and almost immediately she was throwing up entire bottles. My doctor actually suggested us moving over to the Dr. Brown's bottles and wouldn't ya know it! The throwing up stopped instantly.Washing them are a problem because there are 2 other mechanicals besides the bottles that you have to wash and in order to get them adequately clean, you should really do this by hand. No big deal, but I spend 20 extra minutes a day washing all the components of these bottles by hand (even though they are dish washer safe).Now for the Biggest problem of all with these bottles - they leak and sometimes for no reason at all.  This morning I put the bottle on the nightstand and it was about half full, had not been tipped over and not bothered at all, the next time I picked it up to give it to my 11 month old she got doused with milk. This happens on an almost daily basis and every day it infuriates me and I yell I HATE THESE BOTTLES!!!.I really have tried different bottles with her like Avent to keep the colic and throwing up down, but for some reason these leaky, messy, pain in the ^@(#&)@)# bottles seem to be the only ones that keep her from throwing up. So with that, I am willing to put up with this long enough that her little tummy doesn't hurt and move into sippy cups as soon as she gets the hang of them.I HATE THESE BOTTLES!! ARRRRGGGGGG!	
1. 	I was starting to wake up from bad back pain in the beginning of my third trimester.  I bought this pillow and it's been great.  I can sleep longer without waking up from back aches.  I also plan on using it for nursing.  I like that I can sleep on either side without having to adjust the pillow.  Some reviewers complained about the seam digging into their shoulders.  I did not have this problem.  I'm 5'2 and found that the size of the pillow was fine for me.  Seems pricey for a pillow but the comfort is well worth it.	
- 1	I am not sure how 'good' this toy would have worked as I returned it as soon as I got it.  I thought the toys looked very cheapy!  I  have seen much better car seat toys for a cheaper price.  Will be getting something else.	
- 1	After I had my baby and my milk came in, I was leaking like crazy and tired of spending money on disposables. These arrived and I put them on right away. However, I leaked right though them! They have no waterproof backing and are very thin so if you leak even a tiny bit, you are screwed. Additionally, they are scratchy and itchy and my poor sore nipples stuck to the fabric. Imagine my horror trying to peel them off my raw nipples :(	
1. 	I love this sterilizer.  It is very quick and completely uncomplicated.  In 5 minutes I can sterilize bottles.  The Avent bottles fit perfectly.  I now use the Dr. Brown's bottles and just have to lay them on their sides.  Obviously the sterilizer is using steam and is incredible hot when it first comes out of the microwave.  I ususally let it sit for about 3 minutes or so before removing the bottles.	
1. 	This item is basically a tougher version of those sip tie holders with the sticky backs. instead of sticky backs, you get two screws to screw the item into a wall. These work GREAT! For optimum safety, be sure to screw these into studs. Where studs aren't available, make sure to get yourself some good anchors. This has helped keep a shelving unit and a light fixture in place. My niece has tested these and she can tell you they hold items well. Just a note, be sure that the item you want to secure can either have screws screwed into it or has some kind of bar the zip ties can hold onto. Otherwise, this may not be the product for you. Quakehold makes a couple of Velcro based items that may help in situations described above.	
- 1	This did well for 5 baths. The next 2 times we used it the alarm didn't turn off after being removed from water and I had to unscrew 2-3 screws from the battery cover before it would stop beeping. I E-mailed the customer service address on the package and have gotten no response.Update: 6/4/12 The company finally responded to my E-mail. They are sending me a shipping label to return and sending me a new thermometer.	
- 1	I purchased this as Amazon recommended it to buy together with Dream On Me 3 extra firm mattress which I also purchased. It literally just fit the mattress after one wash per its washing instructions. I would look for other sheets.	
- 1	this think fell off my car and i almost got into an accident. it doesn't stay on well and isn't safe. i would not recommend this stay away	
- 1	The wedge has a pretty big bump where it meets the mattress and our son just slid down the side of it. We only tried using it one night and then took it out. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	I tried installing this on two strollers and it just slipped and fell off of both. I tightened it to as tight as I could make it and it just kept failing. Water ... all ... over.	
1. 	I used these with the Evenflo glass bottles. They work great.Evenflo Classic 4 oz. Glass Nurser - 6-Pack	
- 1	I'm really upset about the quality of this bag.  We purchased it to keep our Chicco Keyfit Carseat safe during a flight from Seattle to California.  After the first flight, we found a large rip near the handle (almost 6 inches long).  We've had to repair the bag with duct tape in order for it to be usable.I know this is the cheapest option out there for carseat travel bags, but I would caution others not to get this product.	
1. 	I love these bottles. My NB became accustomed to the Breastflow type so it was hard to switch him, but we had to due to such bad gas problems. The only problem I found with these were the nipples.. We got a fast-flow and even though he's a savage eater, it was just a little too fast for him so he gave up completely. Our babysitter got over it fast so she went to walmart and bought some slower-flowing nipples (same brand, same fit) and is swearing by them. I BF my baby, but when we wean him we'll be sure to get a slower-flow nipple top and just use the fast-flow for his rice cereal/BM concoctions. Definitely would buy again if I hadn't already stocked up, haha!One thing to note:: These bottles DO NOT work if you're trying to switch parts with any other brand.(which is why the docking of 1*) It's not as wide a neck as Breastflow and Gumdrop, and not small enough to fit standard hospital bottles and Medela brand. If you get this brand of bottle, you'll only be able to use the corresponding parts.For us it's no biggie, it works the best and has so far proven to be a pretty decent investment.	
1. 	These replacement caps do exactly as they say they will do.  We didnt have enough caps to fit the amount of bottles and these were just an addition.	
1. 	this swaddler is great.  It is nice and warm, so I can put my son in lighter pj's with it and he is still comfortable at night when I put him to bed.  Plus, it didnt shrink much in the wash.  Other ones I purchased shrunk and barely fit around him now.	
- 1	I bought these because I threw out all our old squeeze bath toys since I was worried about the mold inside.  Loved the idea that you could open and clean these out.  Problem is that they are are sort of hard and inflexible so tough to squeeze, and not really that much fun.  Kids can't squeeze them at all, so they never fill up with water.  Plus once the kids figured out they twist open, they just want to open and close them (usually bugging me for help, which means I'm spending bathtime opening and closing them for them).  Not exactly play as the product was intended.  They are super cute, and I'm disappointed.	
1. 	Not as easy to put on as the harness that slips over the arms, but workable. I may be putting it on incorrectly, as the words, which in the advertisement appear on the front, appear in the back, but any other application puts the hook in the front, which is not ideal. The velcro is wide and thick and unable to be easily removed by a toddler who views No as a challenge to do just that very thing. I'd still opt for the harness that goes through the arms, rather than over the head.	
- 1	came very dirty. was not happy and when i called to exchange i had to completely reorder and get a credit.,kinda annoying.	
1. 	Baby sleeps through the night with this!  We have been using Halo's since our baby was born.  The sleepsack recreates a womblike experience for the baby and he also cannot hit or scratch his face with his arms swaddled.  He also has enough room to kick his legs.  The puppy dogs are cute & the material is soft.  Our baby started rolling over, so we had to start putting him in a long-sleeved onesie and leaving arms out.  It is nice to still be able to use the sleep sack for both swaddling arms in & then letting the arms be out after he started rolling over.  This keeps him nice & warm at night especially during cold WI winters.  Good product!	
1. 	My husband and I originally bought the safety first pack of outlet covers (which my son figured out in 2 seconds flat, and then thought it was seriously funny to remove every one he could find) for a higher cost.  We were fortunate enough to have a relative give us a few of this brand of covers to use in the play area that he could NOT remove.  We are having a second baby at the end of November and one of my first buys was this product to cover the rest of the house!They are a little difficult for adults to pull out (yes, especially on newer outlets), but that's what is needed for tiny fingers!  Would recommend these over any other brand so far!	
- 1	I received the activity mat today, and it didn't even occur to me that this product would be treated with flame retardants, but it is. The tag says not only that it meets the ridiculous California flame retardant requirement, but specifically that the filling is resin treated polyester. This could have been a fantastic product, but I'll have to find other ways to entertain and enrich my baby without letting him burrow his face into a toxic mat. I would have appreciated knowing about the contents of the mat ahead of time to save myself the trouble of returning it, and I hope other parents will request healthy products for their children as well.	
1. 	I used this product with my first baby and plan to use again with baby #2. My son loved the flavor, and the cleaning brush is gentle, but introduces the sensation of brushing. Sometimes I would use the brush to massage his gums when they were teething. Also, the brush and the cleaner last for a long time, so it's worth the price.Keep away from dogs though... we lost quite a few to our lab who thinks this is a tasty chew toy.PROS:Convenient useEasy to cleanPortableSturdy constructionCONS:Dogs love them	
1. 	What you see is what you get. No complaints. Plug in tightly and don't overlap the socket beneath. Works as advertised.	
- 1	It is nearly impossible for the liquid to come out of the top of these cups. I even contacted the company and they sent me a new valve. I was excited to get it but it didn't improve anything. I am extremely disappointed.	
1. 	When I was traveling alone with my baby, it allowed me to push a stroller, pull a suitcase, and carry the carseat at one time.  If I can make one addition to the carrier, it would be to add another strap so that an adult can wear it like a backpack.	
- 1	These are not any good, the lid isn't secure enough. After spilling plenty of medicine we ordered the munchkin brand	
- 1	It won't stay shut which is a total pain.  I actually bough some cheapo dog poop bags dispensers that work better.	
- 1	Wasn't impressed with the avent washable nursing pads for the following reasons:- material is non-absorbant- material is not as soft as other options available- pads stick to nipples- lace on the outside can be seen through bra/nursing tank- small circle creates a strange raised bump seen from outside	
1. 	My 14 month old son loves to turn off the TV while 28 month old son is enjoying the show and drive my older one nuts. Eneded up they starts fighting and pushing each other. With this, it definitely works for its purpose. My little one can't push the power button to turn off the TV which means less pushing, less fighting. Also I got one for the floor heater that has buttons on the top which my younger son loves to push them and changes the temp or simply keeps pushing the power button to turn it off and on, off and on. But with this, not anymore. I give 4 star because I can see the sticker through the guard so it is not that pretty.	
1. 	Been using these a year with no complaints.  Velcro is still good, catching food that falls, washes well.  The only thing more I could ask for is sleeves for the messy days.	
- 1	Nice soft pillowcase for the price. I am ordering our third one so that should tell you something. The only complaint I have is that because this is made of a knit fabric, it does not remain rectangular. My son stretches it all out while sleeping and it ends up completely twisted (with seams ending up partially in middle of the pillow.. you get the idea). Oh, and washing/drying the cases doesn't restore their shape. They remain forever twisted. This does not affect functionality, it's just less than tidy looking.UPDATE - It's several months later and all three of these cases have not held up well to normal toddler use and washing.  None of them are rectangular; You can't even fold them.  Since they are all stretched out and askew, they shift around during the night.  My son then gets frustrated with them and takes them off.  This means the actual pillow is getting drooled on night after night and needs to be washed often.  Now the pillow stuffing is lumpy and I'm back online buying a memory foam travel pillow.  I was thinking maybe if these cases had velcro, a zipper or snaps to close off the open end, this might solve our problem of him removing the cases constantly.  I'd add buttons, but I'm afraid of the choking hazard.  Anyway, it really should be this difficult to cover a pillow, right?I initially really liked these because they were a great bargain and were inexpensive.  However, these are not worth the hassle after they get stretched out and twisted.  I'm reducing to two stars.	
- 1	Wish I had gotten something else....Pros:LightweightNice colorCons:No recline at allPricey for what you actually getFlimsy basketSun shield is not adequate at all	
1. 	These are soft on both sides with the waterproof fabric in the center so it helps keep the dampness off baby's chest.  Seems to be a good size for drooling and early meals. Cute colors too!	
1. 	I got these as a present for a friend's child and she loves them!  They're very versatile and can keep babies amused for hours!  She especially likes the crinkly wings and rattle noises two of them make.  Does anyone else think the one with purple antennae looks like it has a cat face?	
- 1	This product is not safe!!!!this carrier is horrable! Its cozy for the adult but bad for a baby. I doesnt truly fit infants. the insert only smashes, and contorts the babys legs, and maks baby unconfortable.  if you try put the legs out, it pushes out on babys legs in a way to slowly injure there knees. this carrier will not work until your baby is practly old enough to walk on his/her own! Its also to hot with the insert, your baby could get heat stroke. I wish i kept the reciept so I could get my money back.	
1. 	I have these on our stove, they work great, my kids will play w/ them every now and then, they are 1 and have not been able to open them yet.	
1. 	This is by far the best bib I have ever bought! Originally I only added to my order so I could get free shipping, but it turned out to be the best bib purchase I have ever made! Before this bib we were using plastic/fabric bibs and over time they get smelly and dingy, this bib is SO much easier to clean, never gets an odor to it, and it catches everything because they pouch always stays open unlike fabric bibs! You will not be disappointed! It is also harder for children to rip off during meal time unlike the ones with velcro. My son is now 2.5 years old and has just started learning how to take it off. He could take off the velcro bibs around a year old! So this is definitely an improvement! I cannot say enough good things about this bib, I recommend it to every one I know.	
- 1	Appeared to be made of good quality (very sticky, wouldn't move with 16 month old toddlers), however, upon peeling it from the wood kitchen table, it pulled up the top layer of the table.  The wood kitchen table is now damaged because of using this mat.	
- 1	I love these night lights, and so does my daughter. You can have them set to stay on all night. They are bright enough for me to see her when I check on her, but not too bright to keep her awake. However- they stop charging! I now have 3 moons and 2 others and I still don't know if its the charger that breaks or the light itself. I can't keep buying them though. They are great- if you can get it to keep working!,	
1. 	These were my favorite nipple shields by far!  I tried the Medela brand prior and always had trouble with it staying in place.  The Avent nipple shields allow more of your skin to touch baby and they are soooo much more afordable which enabled me to purchase more so that I had a few to get me through night time feedings.  Also very durable and didn't seem to get as flimsy as the Medela with repeated washing & sterilizing.	
- 1	When I first bought Snoogle, I loved it, as it was perfectly supportive as promised. Then my toddler barfed in our bed, and some of it unfortunately splashed on Snoogle. Snoogle's cover had to be washed. Snoogle's cover is very snug, without a hint of stretch. Snoogle's ONE cover opening is in a very awkward location. I was so frustrated with trying to put Snoogle's cover back on after washing that I left it off and left the pillow bare. Big mistake. Snoogle's supportive secret is in its cover because when left without, it's basically a flat blob of cheap batting that stores body heat like an extra-lumpy camel and then spits it back at you during the night. Why do people devise ways to frustrate pregnant women? Finally, today, I put Snoogle's cover back on, and after a half-hour of twisting, writhing, cursing and taking two breaks ... I got the stupid cover back on but didn't even have a post-coital glow as an added benefit.My recommendation? Buy a straight but fairly flexible body pillow. It's what I had for my first pregnancy. We simply used two king cases to cover it, and I had no problem curving it to fit between my knees as needed.	
1. 	My now 3 month old new grandson is just learning to grab and hold onto things and loves all 5 of these toys when he comes to visit his Nana, which is practically daily.  Thank You they're everything I expected and more.	
- 1	It spills really easly, and my daughter hated it. It is just not a great cup. I was trying new cups for her, but this one is not good.	
1. 	Everywhere else sales these for almost $10 each!The newborn (one hole) size is perfect for breastfeeding babies. Love this brand!	
- 1	I'm so disappointed in this pacifier.  I bought a two pack and both pacifiers deflated within 4 days.  I didn't even know this could happen.  It's like all the air was sucked out of the nipple part and my baby was just sucking on a piece of rubber.	
1. 	My son loves this.  He likes the &quot;kangaroo&quot; position best. He was actually crying the first time we put him in it this way, and stopped immediately.  DEFINITELY make sure the one you buy comes with the video, though.  At our Babies R Us many were just in plastic bags (returns?) without the book and video.  They are a must.  The usual type carriers which have baby putting all their weight on their pelvic bone aren't good for their developing bones.  Slings keep the baby in more natural positions.	
- 1	I bought this and could never use it. I first installed it on my car few days before my son was born, it fell off about 30 minutes after I installed it. I though maybe I did it wrong so I tried like four more times and it kept falling off... I couldn't use it because I was afraid it could fall over my newborn baby. Don't bother buying this	
- 1	This is the second Levana video baby monitor I've owned.  The other, the BABYVIEW20, is pretty decent.  This one is the opposite.  The best thing I can say about it is that it handles interference well and has a nice receiver unit.We use a sound machine to provide white noise for our kids.  This monitor has a sound threshold so that it will be silent until there is sound.  Unfortunately, the white noise sets off the threshold so it's always pumping out the white noise, which wouldn't be so bad if the lowest volume setting on the monitor wasn't so darn loud.  The thing doesn't resample the baseline ambient sound, so the white noise always ticks off the mechanism.  It's super annoying, and strange since the BABYVIEW20, an older product from Levana, *does* resample the baseline.Next up is the horrendous base station that is permanently fixed to the camera.  It is NOT omni-directional at all.  When you turn the camera on the base, the angle moves up and down in a continuous wave.  THAT's how you adjust the angle of view... ya.  The peaks and valleys of the wave are not large enough to provide necessary versatility.  The base oddly has a slot for a screw to mount it to a wall.  However, you would have to mount the camera directly over your child's bed, which might be OK if the power cable wasn't so short.  On top of that, the camera easily twists in the base, which throws off the angle.  I found myself readjusting the camera every night, which is a frustrating process altogether.The receiver unit does actually have one advanced feature.  You can pair multiple cameras to it (up to 4 I think) and cycle through them.  The main selling point of the camera, the invisible infra-red LEDs, is actually true.  I guess some kids get scared of the red ring on other cameras?  I don't know, but this one doesn't have that ring at night.  However, my camera strangely sent a foggy night time image after only a day of use.  I tried cleaning the front with lens cleaner, and it helped a little bit, but was still foggy.I really cannot recommend this product.	
- 1	Being pregnant with lots of expenses on the way, I hemmed and hawed and compared products before deciding that this was going to be a great investment as it'll help train me to sleep on my sides and help me get a good night's rest...I loved it for the first few weeks... and raved about it so much, baby's father wanted one too...so I found him one for half the price, same maker Leacho, but from a big chain.Until the thing deflated to half the size!!!  (Another 1 star reviewer said the same thing!  I should have listened!!)I wasn't even that big to begin with!  4'11 and was a size 0 pre-pregnancy!The thing deflated before I was even 6 months pregnant!!  And it went from extremely comfy.... to painfully uncomfortable!!What a HUGE waste of money on something I was only able to use for a few weeks!!Don't waste your money!  There are cheaper alternatives out there!	
- 1	I'm bummed because this is the first bottle my baby has been able to latch onto easily, but the slow flow is much too fast for her.  She ends up crying because too much fills up on her mouth.  I went and bought more, twice, thinking maybe I had bought malfunctioning ones or something.  Unfortunately not, they are all way too fast flowing.  When the milk is warm and I turn the bottle over it doesn't even drip, it actually sprays out.  Not for us. I'll give it 2 stars only because my baby has a good latch on the nipple.	
1. 	These bottles really work! I was skeptical at first, but my son actually seems to have less gas after eating from these bottles. I found the same results from Avent bottles, but those cost more. The only downside to these is that each bottle has 5 parts, so if you don't have a dishwasher they would be pain to clean. You should also know that if you plan to pump into these bottles you will need an adapter.	
- 1	The product is a solid product but it is tight on my 1 year old so she cannot chew on it while wearing it and she doesnt like to chew on it because it is harder than the ones her other baby friends has	
- 1	The name of the company is really misleading. These products are made in China. Just sayin'. So, if you're looking to buy American made sheets, this is not it.	
1. 	I coupled this with the summer infant changing pad and baby is much more comfy. He used to be crankier with the other stiffer folding change pad and I decided to get the contoured pad with this plush cover. Baby likes it. I like it, it is very very soft and it seems soothing to him when he is on it bare skinned too. I bought this in blue and it is a darker blue than pictured but I don't mind that. So far it has not fell apart in the laundry as well which is good. The material is thick enough and feels sturdy enough. The elastics holds the cover well onto the changing pad and fits as the picture shows on a 2 sided changing pad.  BTW this one is cheaper than many of the others I've seen but feels and performs just as well if not better.	
1. 	best thing ever invented...ok not really but I love this thing! my daughter is a mover & shaker and hates to be locked up but this is the best thing ever!	
1. 	This cover fits nicely, is soft, and washes well.  I have two so I always have a clean one when accidents happen.  Liquids absorb instead of roll off, which is a good thing.	
1. 	Got these for my 11-month-old son as an early Christmas gift.  They are a great quality block.  They will be used for years to come.  My son has a great time knocking down the pyramids we build.  Even though he chews on them (he's got eight teeth) I haven't seen any paint in his mouth.	
1. 	I ordered several of these to use all over the house. The fit very well, and look great. I can now worry a bid less when my baby gets close to an outlet.	
- 1	Got this primarily for the suction plate since my 12 year old has decided that picking his plate up and letting the contents slide into his lap is great fun.  When it arrived I was disappointed that the spoon was all jaggedy at the end, where it's supposed to connect w/ baby's mouth so definitely not using that.  Both spoon and fork seem awfully cheap and clumsy-big but that's not why I bought the set.  I really wanted the suction plate and this one kinda works alright I guess.  Took my baby about 2 minutes to figure out how to lift the tab and un-suction it, twice, but I'm not sure if he's really figured it out or if he got lucky (twice).  The lip on the bowl is actually what kept everything from sliding into his lap, earning this product a whopping 2 stars.  I have nothing to compare it with since this is my first baby and first purchase of this sort, but I'm not terribly impressed.	
1. 	i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.	
- 1	I prewashed these about 6 to 8 times like the internet suggested you do with cloth diaper liners, but when they were dry afterwards, I drizzled some water on them, and it all just beaded up and ran off the edges...How is this going to be helpful for absorbing urine? Answer....it's not. So most likely, I will not be using them at all, and they were a waste of money :-(	
1. 	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	
1. 	our 8 month old baby loves this book. each page has a slot to put the bone that's attached to the string, unlike other books like this that only include inserts on some of the pages. it's made with good quality stitching and thick fabrics for the pages. when you turn the book around and open it up it turns into the full dog with a tail that's attached to the book like the head. it's very cute and i think she'll enjoy this book for a long time. this is the 5th product we've bought by manhatten toy company and every one of them are 5 stars.***UPDATE***we've had this book for 10 mos now and she still enjoys reading it and doesn't look very worn at all. this is a great buy and i highly recommend it and any other of this company's activity books.	
1. 	I ordered this for my almost 2 year daughter and it is gorgeous. Much better looking than in the picture.It is sturdy and putting it together was pretty easy. The hardest part was aligning the slats into the holes on both rails at the same time by myself. If I had waited and had somebody help it would've been a cinch. Otherwise it was super easy and didn't take long at all.The crib mattress fit perfectly, nice and snug. The weight limit is 50lbs but I have sat/lain on it and it held up fine although I wouldn't make a habit of it since I am 100lbs over the limit!I would definitely buy this bed again, it looks beautiful in her room.	
1. 	Originally bought to go with the baby changing table I purchased from Amazon.  They were actually recommended to go with it.  Well they didn't fit in the cubby holes, grrr!!  I kept them anyway as they came in useful in the nursery and they look good.	
1. 	I love the Diaper Dekor PLUS. Its very convinent and our twins are almost 20 months old and we STILL use it, they are late bloomers and are in the 27% for height and weight. We also use it for our 8 week olds dirty diapers, yuck!PROS-* Nice and big, can hold many diapers* Really is one handed, very cool and easy* No smells, not now and not ever!* Bag refils are inexpensive and last months* Looks very cute with some decales on it lol* My sons have yet to figure out how to open it* We keep a deoderizer in it, keeps it fresh* Very easy to change a bag and thats about the only time you get a whif, and we only change it about every 4 days or so* bags are sold at BRU, Target, and walmart, so they are EASY to find* Holds MANY diapers and pull-ups, my sons will soon be using them* You really only occasionally have to scrub it down with soap and waterCONS-*Refils, it would be PERFECT if it didnt need special refils, but actually that just means, like another reviewer said, ALOT more garbage bags* It would be nice if the refils changed colors near the end, its funny when you realize there are no refils left, and you NEED them lolI would recomend this over any others, all my friends got rid of thier Champs and bought this, its the most expensive for a reason	
- 1	But they leak.  Every Avent bottle we have used has leaked.  Not just the hard, yellow ones, but the clear ones that come with the blue ring as well.  The funny part is, when you first buy them--they don't leak at all.  However, it seems that the more the bottle and nipple are used, the more likely they are to leak, and since babies can eat anywhere from 6-10 times a day...they start leaking pretty quickly.  Hated every Avent bottle I tried.  Everyone I know has had the same problem.  However, if you want to keep replacing the nipple every few weeks, that's up to you.  And there is a trick, supposedly, to fix the leaking.  What you do is when you put the nipple in the ring, you line up the vents in the nipple so they are blocked by the white things where you screw on the bottle.  This only worked for maybe one feeding and after that never worked again.  Don't buy these.	
1. 	I was concerned about all the BPA fuss and considering that according to studies ALL plastic bottles can be harmful, I decided to find an alternative.. Although, I still use the playtex drop ins once in a while, when I'm giving my baby water or we're on the go, because its convenient. Anyway, back to the point, these bottles have been great! I noticed that with my plastic bottles (NUK- although I love NUK nipples) would still smell funky after several washes AND having them in boiling water. These however, are very easy to clean and SMELL clean! I didn't like the nipples it came with, so I bought NUK regular nipples to go with them, it fit perfect and my son liked it ! I saw reviews that said the medela nipples went along with it too, but I prefer nuk since I have found it is less confusing for my son (since I Breast feed and bottle feed)I got the 4oz pack of 3 for about $5 at target and that's enough for me, I recently purchased the 8oz 3pack from babiesrus for 6.99... GREAT BUY OVER ALL!	
1. 	I bought this to take on a plane with my little one.  Although I also had a full diaper bag with me, I knew that taking the diaper bag to the airplane restroom with me and carry the baby would be too difficult. Not to mention that airplane restrooms aren't exactly roomy.  The kit worked really well for quick diaper changes on the plane.  I like the carrying strap on it that I can put around my wrist.  Sometimes on short outings I only carry this kit and not the full diaper bag!  It's an all-in-one diaper changer kit that makes diaper changing quick and easy!	
1. 	I'm a new mom trying everything for the first time and I recieved the diaper genie(the new one) as a shower gift. It's very simple and easy to use after reading the very short directions. This product is a must for my house since I have 2 dogs that love to get into the trash. The only time I ever had problems with the cutting mechanism was when it was filled too much and no big deal I cut it with scissors. And now I empty it when it needs to be emptied and have no problem. I don't put all my son's diapers into the pail if the diaper is just wet sometimes I throw it into the regular trash. But this is definitely helpful when it's a smelling diaper. My house and my sons room do not smell at all.	
1. 	Very good, I hope my daughter loves, my daughter is too young, still use it not very good, I was prepared for her	
1. 	Absolutely love this bib!!! After purchasing many cloth bibs covered in plastic with velco closures, finally stumbled upon this awesome product. Super easy to clean and catches plenty of messes. Will definitely be recommending to my Mommy Group friends. Must have product for feeding time. Don't waste your money on nasty, mildewy plastic-covered cloth bibs. ***Only complaint is that LO figured how to can pull it off.	
1. 	It's a decent product for the money, would recommend to others. It's machine washable, sturdy and has a nice design.	
1. 	Of course this has been a great/easy way for me to record all of my baby's routines and a simple way for his caregiver to let me know how the day went.  What I really love about it, though, is that it was so easy for me to jot down all of his major milestones as they happened.  I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.  Life saver!!  All of the funny little things would probably have been forgotten!	
1. 	This is the cutest hat ever! I am going to buy the larger size for this winter possibly ( if they have one for one year olds). I will say that he definitely wouldn't have been able to wear by the time he was 4 months though. It took us through the winter ( he is a January baby). So I would definitely suggest it for a winter newborn. Older babies should definitely get the size up or cut the lining maybe as someone else suggested.	
- 1	After reading reviews, I was so excited about this diaper and bought 2 to try. I wish I hadn't spent my money. While they are super trim, they leak. The leg gussets never fully fit around my sons thighs, they always left a gap. My  son is rather large for his age(3 mo), but he is proportional. He is in the 97th percentile for height, and 96th for weight. He is not chubby, or skinny... and the gussets just never were able to enclose his entire thigh area no matter what setting the diaper is set to.  Gaps in gussets = LEAKS!!! I have never once put this diaper on my son when it didn't leak. I kept trying it thinking that it would fit differently the bigger he got... but it hasn't happened, and I doubt it will, unless he just gains weight in his thighs... On the bright side, the hemp insert seems very absorbent if put in another diaper...	
- 1	The Amazon seller sold me an opened box. this is unsanitary as these are factory sealed for sanitary reasons and now I'm stuck repackaging and shipping it back. Ridiculous!  Please don't buy from them! I have already reported them.The product itself I already owned and I can tell you that I'm finding them quite uncomfortable. I've tried the 24mm, 27mm and the 30mm and all have caused me problems with nipple damage. I'm now trying the Pumpinpals shields and while it takes me a couple minutes longer to letdown with them, they are far more comfortable. I recommend buying all sizes. I thought I might use the largest, but I used the middle. Cheers,	
1. 	We could not be more pleased with this item.  A great item at a fantastic price.  We are very happy we chose to try one of these prior to purchasing a high chair.This seat is simple to clean, easy to install, and has some great features.  It folds for travel, and we really like that the backrest folds down so easily.  This allows us to fold it down and push the chair back under the table with all the other chairs.  Clean up is very easy, everything wipes off without problems and our son likes sitting in it and eating.  He now goes over to the seat and points to it when he's hungry.We haven't traveled with it and aren't sure we will, but it's nice to see how easy it is to fold up and take along.Would be 5 stars even at a slightly higher price point, well worth the money.	
- 1	I stupidly went out and bought a bunch of these bottles before our baby was born, after a few people recommended them...should have just bought a 2-pack and tried it out before making such an investment. I thought the large amount of parts due to the vent system would be annoying, but that actually turned out not to be much of an issue, since the bottles come apart really easily. The main problem with these bottles is that they LEAK CONSTANTLY, no matter what you do. Literally, I would fill a bottle (not past the max fill line), start to feed my baby, see it leaking like crazy from under the bottle rim...and after wiping up my son, I'd go to pick up the bottle again and literally see streams of milk continuing to leak out from under the rim while the thing was standing up vertically. Tried tightening the bottle rim, and when that failed, tried loosening it - nothing worked. At least I can say with certainty that it was not a defective issue with one pack of bottles, since we had at least 15 of them and they ALL did it. In addition, the plastic is soft and they'd leak even more if you squeezed the bottle at all by accident...and they're too tall to fit in many sterilizers. Just plain annoying from every angle. We finally chucked them and switched to Born Free bottles, which are 100% awesome. I seriously don't understand all the hype about Dr. Brown's bottles - I don't think their special vent system is any better than any other bottle's, and I actually think the vent system is what causes the leaking. Don't waste your money!	
- 1	I have not been able to measure the temperature with this device. I tried it on myself, my spouse, and my baby. Each time the temperature reading was different and completely off from a normal temperature when all three of us were healthy. I can't imagine using it when the baby is actually sick.	
- 1	My son is 50th percentile for weight and height, so pretty average sized for a 2 year old.  As lots of reviewers have mentioned, the height of this potty is great, the handholds on the side are a help, the splash guard is built in so there are no pinching problems there, and the back WOULD be nice except...There is about an inch of space between the edge of the bowl and the back of the seat, so that when my son sits on it, the bowl shifts ever so slightly and his bum gets pinched in the back.  The reviews have been so positive on the no-pinching thing that I was stunned by this.  Even when he does not get pinched, he also ends up with seams cut into his little bum and back of legs, and as a result will not remain seated on this seat at all.  Therefore I cannot comment whether the pee goes into the bowl, because we never get that far.As far as disinfecting, I thought it would be really easy--just pull the bowl out, dump it out, wipe, disinfect with clorox on occasion...BUT several times poop has gotten under that back edge of the bowl, necessitating a cleaning of the rest of the seat as well, which is just a pain.Finally, the bowl is way too light and often sticks to my son's legs and he stands up.I cannot say, however, if there is anything better out there--we haven't found the perfect potty yet, but if this is the best of the portable potties, I guess we're going to have to go with the seat insert for our toilet, because this has turned out to be virtually worthless to us.	
1. 	I was using the mediums, which seem to be the standard size. I couldn't seem to effectively pump enough milk until I decided to try the small size. What a difference!	
- 1	My baby never liked to wear this bib.  He is now 10 months old and average size. It was never comfortable for him to wear.	
1. 	These are great adapters! I use an avent pump and bottle system but since my husband got a free medela pump from his work, I now needed something to adapt to my avent bottles and cups. These work perfectly, I have never had any issues with leaks or spills.	
- 1	I originally left a great review on this product, until my experience 2 weeks ago.  This pump completely broke while on vacation after only using it less than 3 months (maybe 20 times).  It no longer had suction, even after replacing the tubing.  Unfortunately the warranty only last 90 days after the purchase date, which was 2 months before I even opened the box.  So, I went out and bought a medela which has a 1 year warranty, and a great reputation.	
1. 	It did got very messy, but we put old towel under our baby, any put the baby oil next to us, and clean his little hands and feet right after it was done. Suggestion: print the baby's feet and hands in different days, try feet first, it's easier.	
1. 	The Chicco Smart Support Backpack works great. We have used it to carry our 2-year old (approx 25lbs) during hikes. So far it has held up well. There is about an 8 inch height difference between me and my husband and the backpack adjusts easily to fit us both. We both find it very comfortable to wear.	
1. 	These are MUCH better than the flat discs that come with the bottles.  I use these for my 4oz and my 8oz glass Dr. Brown's Bottles.I find that when I use the travel disc, the bottles still tend to leak.  If I'm packing a bottle for an outing, I'll put the straw, vent, nipple, ring, and cap in a ziploc bag.  I'll put one of these caps on the bottle, full of liquid, and I'm good to go.  I have left this bottle (by accident) upside down in the diaper bag, and it didn't leak.When I need to use the bottle, I'll take off the cap, put  the bottle together, and put the cap in the now empty ziploc bag.  If kiddo doesn't finish the bottle, then the straw/nipple/etc can go back into the ziploc and the travel cap can go back on.I think that this is a must-have if you have Dr. Brown Bottles!	
1. 	A friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and I wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top. This was the perfect solution. Looks sturdy and I think it will really meet our needs! :)Here's a link to the changing tray:[...]	
- 1	I purchased this for my bathroom and guest bathroom. While this does work when used properly , its opening is not very intuitive. What happened is that my husband never learned to use it, my guests could not figure it out how to use it ( i couldn't go into the bathroom and just open for them or teach them right?) and the cleaning lady never understood how to open it either. Thus, the device would always end up on the floor. Also i found it unsanitary because it attaches to the bowl rim, thus getting dirty itself....just not nice at all. I got another one that attaches to the top of the lid- don't remember the brand, maybe safety 1st. Anyways, i don't recommend this.	
1. 	These are perfect for the little one/s in your life who eat two and a half ounces or less at each feeding!  They are small enough to fit at least six bottles and nipples into the Medela Quick Clean Micro Steam Bags to sterilize in 1 1/2 minutes.  These have been a life saver for us with twin premies!	
- 1	I don't recommend these at all.  If you're looking for a washable trainer, spend the extra $ on something that works and get some from Little Beetles or Imse Vimse.  These are no more absorbent than a pair of regular cotton underwear.	
- 1	Updated Review:Well, this thing has turned into a brick after doing a firmware update. It will reset itself, but it will only hold a connection via my ipad/iphone app for a minute or so then lock up, and then say its busy. While doing this, it will basically take down your wireless network. So yes, I threw it back in the box. At this point, I do not recommend.OLD REVIEW:First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived in good shape, good job again Amazon. The Motorola Blink1 Wi-Fi video camera is a great option for those who are expecting a newborn in the near future. I have older kids now, so my reason of snagging one of these was to monitor my wife and her misadventures while I am away on business (I kid I kid). I set this up in my kitchen to keep an eye on my pets when we are out of the house, as well as maybe catch a burglar and alert the police. Setup is pretty easy, just hold reset till beep, download app, install software, sign up, and your good to go. The camera has some cool options like pan and tilt and listen and talk (you can scare some folks.. heheh). A temperature reading is also good just in case you are conscious about your home heat/cooling bill. Daylight visibility is pretty good. Nightime camera visibility is ok (then again, its a cheap night time camera, this is no $5k surveillance camera).I am pretty impressed with this setup. A few bugs and hiccups here and there, and some better software improvements might knock this review to a 5 star. Overall, I recommend.	
- 1	we got this as an introduction to fruits for our 18 month old but he doesen't like it hes weird out about it and rather eat the fruits alone then use this ....it was pointless to buy it because hes never wanted to use it totally afraid of it.	
1. 	These are the best! Super warm and wash well. The size xl is just now getting too small. My son can walk fine in these and the sleep sack is part of his bedtime routine.Love it!! We own about 4 of them- in case one gets dirty or such.	
1. 	It was great when my daughter was teething. I put an ice cube in there and it kept her happy for a while.	
- 1	I bought these to use with my Kleen Kanteen's - and although they do fit they leak like crazy. If the bottle is not upright the water just flows out. I was so disappointed.	
1. 	I've tried several monitors and was ready to return this one as well b/c of the awful static sound on each one. Then I read this on CR and decided to live with it or change my phone:Mind the frequency. None of the baby monitors Consumer Reports tested was immune from static. The closer your monitor's frequency is to that of another device, such as a cordless phone, the more likely you'll hear static or cross talk. You may reduce interference if your monitor lets you switch to a different channel within its frequency band.Consider your phone. Choose a monitor that operates in a different frequency band than your cordless phone. Most newer cordless phones are either 2.4 gigahertz or 900 megahertz. If you have a 900 MHz cordless phone and a 900 MHz monitor, they can interfere with each other.Hope this helped!Also, quick side note. I was given a fisher price monitor that is a few years old from a friend and it was the best. No static. Sadly, the wires loosened (it is many years old) I am going to look for a slightly used model online, its model number is 1550.	
1. 	The balls have a hole in them and are like &#34;squirties&#34;.  I've refrained from buying anything like this anymore because it gets mold inside.  That said, my 2 y.o. daughter would much rather fill the balls and squirt the water everywhere than throw it into the basket!  Still a fun bath time activity.	
1. 	Fits perfect by size to my changing pad and also fits my nursery - its very nice green, little lighter then in a picture. Will order another one in beige.	
1. 	This is a great Bouncer. My daughter loved the vibrations and watching the fish swim by. When she was older she loved to bat at the objects hanging down. When all else failed i would put her in the bouncer and she would fall asleep. The music was calm and relaxing and she could spend hours in there.	
1. 	These plugs are easy to use and do the job.  The new fangled products look like a pain and are probably no more effective than these.  These are a good value for your money and you don't have to waste precious time figuring out how they work and how you are going to install them!!	
- 1	I have wasted so much milk using these drop-ins.  I bought a box of the 4 ounce and a box of the 8 ounce liners, and in both boxes there have been multiple liners with holes in them and my milk has ended up all over my counter.  Any pumping mother knows that it is perfectly reasonable to cry over spilled breast milk, and believe me, I've done that many times.  I've tried to be good about pouring in just a little bit of milk so that if there is a hole, I'll only waste a little bit.  But, come on, I'm sleep deprived, and stressed and sometimes I forget, and I end up with 6 ounces of milk on my kitchen counter, and I shouldn't have to check like that for a product I've paid for.  No good.Out of a box of 100 liners, I would say about 1/4-1/3 have holes in them or leak.  That's quite a lot; we're not talking one or two here.  Unfortunately, I've invested in Playtex bottles and Playtex nipples, so now I have to spend even more money buying a whole new bottle feeding system because I cannot afford to spill breast milk every fourth time I go to fill up a bottle.  I'm extremely disappointed at having wasted so much money on this system and so much time pumping milk just to pour it on the kitchen counter.  I would NOT recommend.	
1. 	We have not tried a ton of bibs, but enough to know that I can stop looking.Pros:-SO easy to clean (just run them under the faucet, use a soapy sponge if necessary, shake and hang up)-SUPER fast drying - I hang by the cabinet knob over the dish drainer, but have also used a towel to dry them off with success-Effective - have not had any messy baby food leak through these-Decent fit - I have a skinny 7 month old - these are still a touch big around the neck even with the velcro tight, but I expected this. We have had FAR fewer issues with food getting on her collar with these bibs (still happens sometimes but these are the best so far).-Design - the pocket is easy to invert and clean. I like that the velcro is on the side, makes it easier to take off one handed while also cleaning baby off.I bought a three pack but have been using the same one for two weeks and it still looks brand new. I can't think of any cons...	
1. 	I know that's a little corny, but it's true!  Great binding! I love the options for the title on the spine.  Holds all landscape pictures, so I trim my favorite portrait pics into squares.  Nice and easy album!	
1. 	This is fantastic!  I prefer to mix formula one bottle at a time and this was the only thing that I could use to do that short of shaking the bottle (and thus adding bubbles that upset my baby's tummy).  It's inexpensive but it lasted the entire time I was making bottles of formula - for about a year.  I really wish I had had one of these with my first baby.  Worth more to me than what I paid, for sure!	
1. 	Good fit on changing table. The sides prevent baby from rolling over on the changing table, however never walk away while baby is on the table. It is easy to clean and rinse off since it is made of plastic.	
- 1	We bought these and didn't hardly use them. They didn't fit in the bottle warmer and the way the nipples went into the cap were hard to get in. Do not recommend them.	
- 1	Nicely constructed, thick fabric that maintains privacy, but &#34;natural&#34; is not remotely close... Let's try &#34;yellow&#34; on for size. Also way too large for petite frame. Picture looks sophisticated, but sets expectation that just isn't close to being met.	
- 1	I tried these pads first after being so happy with other Avent products. Unlike other Avent products these pads are barely passable for the job. They are very thick, you can see them through clothing, the diameter is far too small so even a small shift and they will leak. After many leaks with these I switched to Lansinoh pads.	
- 1	I am obsessed with my Swaddle Designs blankets, and use them exclusively to swaddle my 4 1/2 month old for every nap & every night. With summer here, I was more than excited to discover this thinner options. However, after multiple tries, my son would wiggle free from the Lightweight Marquisette every time! I don't know why, but this product really didn't work for us.	
1. 	I wouldn't use on an 8+ month old (or so), because it really isn't that good for a sitter upper who isn't very good at safely climbing off things, and worse for an active toddler trying to climb on everything.It was very nice before then, because it laid back nicely and reclined nicely, and it looked comfortable for a little baby, and later less reclined for an emerging sitter.  It was also good for training him to drink a bottle by himself, and he seemed very comfortable in it.I used it one day with my 16 month old, when he was very sick and just wanted to recline and relax in front of the TV.  The next day, he was once again trying to climb up the back of it, and I had to put it back away.  Not that a toddler wants to sit around in a chair anyway.	
1. 	I love the super-soft fabric, deep pockets and eye-catching polka-dot print.  The colors are bright and cheerful and they launder well.  Great price and shipper, too!	
1. 	First off - don't leave your baby alone sitting in it. ELIMINATES the safety issue! I have seen and heard many complaints of babies toppling over who don't yet sit up without support. But really, this is more of a place to support your baby to sit while you sit with them and interact.We were gifted one by our PTs office for our then 9 month old daughter with Downs who did not yet sit up on her own but really wanted to interact with us. Considering her reduced muscle strength it was PERFECT. We could sit with her for a good half an hour while she worked to maintain her balance (like on a yoga ball...) and we used toys and games to keep her entertained. She was sitting up in it on her own in no time, and then without the seat shortly after.We love the seat. Will get a new one for the new baby when she is beginning to try to sit up! Easy to clean, easy to store, and endless possibilities for play.	
1. 	I received one of these bibs as a hand-me-down and really liked it. I bought this as a back-up. They work really well, have great coverage for a messy baby (mine is two now) whether they are eating or doing arts and crafts. They are easy to clean with a quick wipe down or rinse in the sink or in the laundry. I highly recommend!	
- 1	Set this up, and it literally spun around one time, and then quit.  There wasn't enough air blowing to even make a bubble anyways.  Bad product - save your money and time and pass on this product.	
- 1	I did a lot of research to find a stroller that wasn't loaded with flame retardants and other toxins, and finally settled on this Uppababy. When it came though, it had a chemical smell that was so strong it stank up an entire room, even though it was still in the box. It was clearly not chemical free. I called the company to find out what they use in these strollers and they claimed that it must be defective, that it shouldn't smell, and that they had never received any complaints about the G-series before. I know this isn't true though, because I ended up having to call them twice and both times they insisted that no one else had complained - since I hadn't given them any identifying information on either call, they couldn't have known it was the same caller.On further inspection, I think it may be the packing materials that are primarily responsible for the awful toxic smell, but at any rate if you are interested in avoiding toxins I would cross this stroller off your list. It doesn't belong anywhere near a baby. (I didn't try the stroller out, but it didn't look comfortable and it also didn't seem all that well made. It was super light though and folded up small. If you buy from Healthcheck Systems, know that their return policy is bad, they have a big restocking fee and you have to pay a lot in postage to mail the large package back. )	
1. 	I love that this mirror is cute and holds the baby's attention.  I also love how easily adjustable it is to different cars as we switch around on occasion.  I also think it attached the best of any mirror I found.  I like the dome feature because I can see the baby better from the front seat, although I would love to figure out a way that she didn't seem so far away because of the dome.  Maybe the next design they can magnify it or something.  All in all, it does its job and is cute on top of it	
- 1	We purchased these, and have found that they pop and crackle very loudly in the evening, to the point I have to just turn them off.  They worked well enough in the first year, but after 12 months, their speakers must have blown out.  We can't use these anymore.	
- 1	These bibs are cheap but you get what you paid for.  The velcro comes off easily and the loopy side is very rough and sharp.  My husband tried to take the bib off of our baby once and it slipped and gave him a bad gash on his neck!  Our baby drools and spits up a lot too and it goes right thru the bibs and onto his clothes.  It's not worth it.  We'll stick with the Carter's ones from now on since their velcros are very soft and it actually sticks.	
- 1	I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews about this product before I bought the postpardum girdle with side zipper.  At first, it was great and I loved how my clothes fit.  However, after less than the week, the boning in the girdle had developed permanent dents that dug into my skin.  It left marks and became increasingly uncomfortable to wear.  It isn't made for anyone who sits for any period of time, and as a new mother, I have to sit in order to feed my daughter.  Too much money spent for only a weeks use.  I did notify the company because it is not a good product for new mothers to wear.  Maybe the pull up support is better but there is no way I am spending more money on a new girdle to find out.  I do NOT recommend this product.  I will probably go out and buy a good pair of spanx.  Much cheaper (and more comfortable).	
1. 	I love the images of stars that this nightlight projects on the ceiling, but I have bought this nightlight twice b/c it has stopped working twice. Not sure why, but it's not anything we've been able to fix so I've had to return and re-buy.	
1. 	This is one of the best investments that we have made!  We have two that keep half the house off limits.  It's aesthetically pleasing, durable, reliable and easy to operate.  It's also tall enough to discourage our two golden retrievers from jumping up on it or trying to get through.  My husband and I are fairly tall and it's nice not having to bend down at all to open them.  Our son (now 16 months) hangs onto them and shakes them with all his body, like a prisoner trying to escape and it's hopeless- he will not get through no matter how much he may try.The only reason to not give this gate 5 stars is that the installation process, however easy it may be, is very sensitive.  You have to make sure that the bottom of the gate is exactly level, otherwise the swing-closed mechanism may not work smoothly.  We had to re-install one cup that holds the pressure mount in order for the gate to swing closed on its own like it's designed.  Also- the installation requires you to drill screws into the door frame (or wall or wherever you install it) and this will leave holes once we eventually take the gates out.  We don't mind because we know they'll be there for at least a few years until we're done having children.	
1. 	my baby was sensitive to the cold wipes for the first 2 months.but now it is of no use anymore. The wipes are not too warm, just not cold to the touch,thats all. I liked it the first 2 months a lot though.It served the purpose well.	
- 1	A friend of mine swears by this cup so I bought it but my son never took to aspirate from it, I think the spout is just too thin and small for him. So it's sitting here taking dust.	
- 1	I bought this nipple for using with thickened milk but it didn't work. The nipples collasped easily and baby got really frustrated.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and never used it (minus one time). This is something that is not needed. I had it in my baby registry since I read such good reviews here. My bad! I sold it on craigslist right after the first time I used it. Please don't waste your money here, go buy something useful for yourself or your baby. Good luck with nursing!PS: I didnt have the fireworks, I had one with polka dots cover.	
1. 	My husband bought me this pillow as a gift when I was in my first trimester.  I had never even heard of a pregnancy pillow, but was pleased to discover how comfortable it was, even before I was showing.  I am now 25 weeks, and this thing is a lifesaver.  It provides so much support when I side-lie on my left, which isnt a natural position for me at night (I usually lay on my back and had trouble with the transition. The snoogle doesn't allow me to roll all the way over).  Plus as my belly gets bigger it provides wonderful support under it as well.  I sleep very well every night snuggled into this thing.  So well, in fact, that my husband grabs it as soon as I get up for work at 5am and sleeps with it until he has to get up! LOL. I've also found it is really cozy to wrap around me when I'm just sitting on the couch, and may also double well as a nursing pillow when the baby is born.  There are many different positions in which you can use it.  Great product.  Would recommend to anyone.	
1. 	I registered for this and got it at my baby shower and am so glad I did.  The nurses in the hospital always put my baby on her side to sleep using receiving blankets that were rolled up.  When I got home and used the Rest Assured it was wonderful.  My baby loves it and it is so easy to use and switch baby from side to side when you are laying her down.  It definitely makes me feel more comfortable when laying her down.  I don't have to worry about her choking if she spits up.	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
1. 	It does its job. No issues with the connector. Our doorway was too wide and this worked out perfectly. Great.	
- 1	Quality of this is not as good as I expected.  After using it just for 6 weeks, the sponge in the front of the brush started tearing off. However I like the small nipple brush that comes along with it.	
- 1	My baby is a shade over 2 months old, can barely hold his head up... and is too tubby to fit in this seat. His thighs barely fit into the leg slots, and even in his thinnest footie pajamas i can barely wedge his diapered bum into the seat. (If i let him go naked he might fit a little better, but that would end up quite messy.) He's between the 75th and 90th percentile of weight for age, so he's big for his age but not huge. And even so, two months is pretty young for this product. The babies in the pictures are clearly older.If there were any information in the product description or on the packaging about the maximum size or weight of babies who can use this product, i might have been saved the trouble of finding out mine is too big.	
1. 	This seems like it may be unnecessary but they truly are a great baby tool. I found that nose suckers only work when there is congestion and moisture but usually my baby just woke up with boogies. These made it much easier to keep her comfortable and clean. the tips are rounded so your little one doesn't get poked. It is also more sanitary as you can quickly wash them with soap or alcohol. good quality, good tool.	
1. 	I am currently six months pregnant and have been using this every night for the past month.  I love how I can use it several different ways to provide the comfort I need during my pregnancy.  I use it prop myself up at night when I have bad acid reflux, other nights I use it for back support and to have something between my legs to help prevent leg cramps.  I recommend this to any pregnant woman out there looking for a better night sleep!	
1. 	I love this jumper! Both of my kids got a lot of use out of it, enjoyed it immensely, but also got there fingers slammed on more than one occassion between the large, hard tray and the door jam.	
- 1	Just when I think that this Nurser system will replace all my other bottle collections, I realize that it is SO hit and miss that I might just give up on it entirely.  Overall, if you are pumping all the time, the savings on bags might be worth it. But if you occasionally pump or use formula,  then I would opt for the Tommee Tippee or Avent. If you are really concerned with colic or gas- save yourself the bottle confusion and go watch Colic Massage videos on youtube. No matter what system you use, you will get air in it.The pros:1. I love that I can use my handheld and electric Medela pumps right into the drop in bags with this kit.  Easy peasy.2. Overall the buy-in price aint that bad. Especially the liners.3. As one reviewer said, you can pump, freeze and then remove the lids and keep all stored in a larger freezer bag. Much cheaper than medela's system.4. No extra contaminates. Pump directly in bag reduces my handling of it, while freeing up bottles for use. Less cleaning too.5. The bag system makes prepping bottles easy and less time consuming. We drop this in hot water and it takes about 1/2 to a 1/3 of the time plastic bottles requires. Great when you have a screaming kid in one arm.6. Easy to clean.The cons:1. This adaptor that fits on the Medela unit cannot be securely tightened. Rather when you think you are about to finish tightening the adaptors together, it goes right back to loose. These ring threads also can become less tight during pumping. (Which I just found out tonight. I leaned over to turn off the machine and I lost a good ounce on one side. FRUSTRATING! I cannot tell you how upsetting this is.) No it wasnt user error, nor overly full.2. When my newborn is sucking, air still gets back into the liner (which seems to defeat the purpose, no? And this isnt because she is taking her time, opening wide and/or letting the nipple just collect new air.)3. As with Con #2- if you ever have to pull the nipple out, air immediately collects in the bag.4. Try getting your hand inside the bottle to push out air from the liner when it is less than halfway full. It really requires a separate pushing mechanism.5. Sometimes the bag gets caught or stuck on itself and when she is feeding, she ends up loosing milk. Again-liquid gold anyone?6. I see that the nipples can collapse in on themselves, causing a very frustrated baby. At the mall the other day, she probably lost over 1 ounce, maybe 2 when the nipple seemed to release a gush of milk when the nipple inverted. It came spilling out the front.7. Just as much convenience it does add, it is a waste to throw away liners again and again. Thus making the system a cheap buy-in but overall more expensive.8. Its very difficult, if near impossible to see how much is pumped into the liners. And also how much is consumed is also a mystery.9. The packaging on this product is confusing. On the back is a picture of the complete system with a line clearly drawn to the clear breastshields, indicating that a) they are included and b) required to make this function. Neither is accurate. In case this doesnt make sense, you simply use your own breastshield (medela, in my case) and screw in the Playtex adaptor with the lid base and a liner.10. Unless you take the lids off these when frozen, and store in larger ziplock, the price is too high. Rather- use the medela storage bottles.11. Other care givers, including husbands will give up on this system mid-feed!  Whether they think its empty or the nipple collapses or they constantly have to pull out and reinsert the nipple (which is common with caregivers who simply dont spend every second with your kid and dont know how to nurse like you do.)	
1. 	I recently bought this chair to replace my 1-year-old daughter's high chair.  I LOVE it.  I was pulling my hair out cleaning the high chair after every meal, this chair is so easy to clean and much more versatile.Pros:-Really easy to clean - no cracks for the food to slide into (ahhhh)-Chair attaches very securely to any chair with a back, the chair will not slide off, nice long straps in case you have a big chair-The tray is close enough to the baby that not too much food gets on their lap or on the seat (there are three different places you can attach the tray depending on your baby's size)-The tray is smaller than high-chair trays and fits easily in sink or dishwasher-You can pull the tray off completely and just pull baby up to the table (different heights in case your table is high/low - MAKE SURE you get the one with the three trays (labelled as blue, actually has a blue tray with a white tray on top and green tray cover), Amazon makes it look like one chair that comes in three colors but the red/yellow and green chairs have only 1 tray and no height adjustment)-Chair is light and folds up easily, easy to carry to restaurant to use as a booster, etc.-The price is right:  there is absolutely no reason to spend $100+ on a high chair with a nice cushy seat that you will have to dig food out of for the next 2 years; that you will have to roll around your kitchen/dining room to get it out of your way. This seat is comfy, versatile and folds up very nicely when you want it out of the way.Cons:  If you have a really big baby, this may not be the chair for you. My daughter is ~22 pounds and fits fine, but if you have a big baby, his belly might start to push up against the tray, it only goes out so far.******* UPDATE **********My daughter is now 2 and still uses this booster chair everyday.  And I still love it.  She has tested the limits of this chair - tried to pull of the tray, tried to lunge out of the chair while the waist strap was still fastened, tried to rock herself out of the chair, etc.  She is VERY secure in the chair, and it is no worse for all the abuse.  She is about average size and still fits just fine.  She now recognizes that this is her eating chair and taking it with us to restaurants makes dining with a todder a less miserable experience.  Especially since she can't climb out like she can from the restaurant high chairs.	
1. 	I bought this to use as a travel bath for my baby on quick trips. It is basically a thick large sponge that a newborn can lay on and an infant can sit on to bathe in a sink, tub, shower stall or on a countertop.Pour a cup of warm water on the sponge before placing your child on it. Also be sure to wring it out very well and allow to air dry after every use.This is an excellent alternative to an infant bath while travelling and is very portable. You could also place in an infant tub for extra cushioning.	
- 1	I would recommend getting the drink cup spouts instead. The holes are much to small in these spouts, rendering them useless.	
1. 	After searching and buying many many sippy cups to find the perfect sippy cup i finally decided to buy these. They work perfect for my 12 month old son. I always skipped over this product because of the low price, automatically made me think and the cups are cheap and do not work good. I wished i bought this cup MONTHS ago, it would have saved me so much money and trouble. This is the perfect sippy cup, does not spill or leak unless it is turned upside down but not to much. Easy to take with me wherever i have to go. The only thing is that i wish i can find more of the to go spout covers. But these cups are so cheap I have no problem buying more.	
1. 	It is small when folded and can be fit well in the diaper bag. We always have it with us when use a public restroom. Well made.	
- 1	Whenever we leave the window open in the nursery, which is on the back of our house, we get a low level hum from the outside noise, even when the sensitivity is all the way down. It makes t very hard to sleep at night when we crack the window for air circulation.Also, when the parent and baby units get close, they create feedback. When you carry around the monitor with you, it's difficult to remember to take it off and leave it in another room when you go in to check on your baby.	
- 1	Beware of this system.  We have owned this system for 2 years now.  We are on our 3rd monitor.  The video cameras work just fine, but the monitor is awful.  Our first broke after 15 months.  Because I didn't have a receipt, Summer Infant wouldn't exchange it.  I looked into purchasing a different system, but we already had multiple cameras, so I just decided to do the Secure Sight monitor again and save the Amazon receipt.  (Summer Infant offered a &#34;discounted&#34; price to replace the 1st broken one, but it was cheaper to buy a camera + monitor on Amazon.  Thanks for the &#34;great deal&#34;, Summer Infant!).  We are now 2 years and 4 months later and the 2nd monitor broke a few weeks ago.  I contacted Summer Infant. I had to email them a picture of my Amazon receipt and they sent me a prepaid packing slip to mail the monitor back to them.  The customer service rep said they would send a replacement.  I don't know how long it will take to get it.  Meanwhile, we are without a monitor in for the 2 year old we moved to a &#34;big boy bed&#34;!Picture quality is great, sound is great.  It is so frustrating because I am overall very happy with the quality, just not the longevity! I truly think they should last longer than 12-15 months.  If I were starting out completely over again, I would NOT purchase this system.  Because I already have multiple cameras, I just didn't feel like I could change brands, but we may have to if this 3rd one breaks.....when it breaks.....	
1. 	I've used these bottles for all three of my kids as they are the only thing I've found that most closely resemble the breast. We've all read about nipple confusion and it concerned me since my kids attend daycare and I still nurse when I'm with them. All three of my kids took to this bottle with no issues and I like that you can take them completely apart for cleaning. The two size option is good as your baby grows and his appetite follows.	
1. 	I love this. Saved me. Take it with me to work and pump 2-3 times, get about 8-10 oz all together. Pump for 10 min each time. Easy to clean. I also have Pump in Style and cannot get nothing. Went to lactation consultant 4 times and finally took this out of despair and it worked!	
1. 	Small enough for the baby. I have this kind of nail clippers for myself. So I have no problem with using.	
- 1	I was so disappointed in this monitor. If you want to put the parent unit in sleep mode it turns the sound off and then it only activates when a sound is made. It also has an alarm that goes off when the baby cries (as if you couldn't figure it out on your own from the actual crying.) It fails mostly because you can only choose between beeping or vibrating, you can't turn it off. As if the crying wasn't enough now you have to listen to the monitor beeping or vibrating at you. Impossible if you let your little one cry it out. When we first got it. The sensitivity was too high and the fan in his room was setting it off so we turned it down a little. Then it was the air conditioning setting it off every time it kicked on. That was a fun night... So we turned the sensitivity down some more. Now I can hear him crying in his room before the monitor goes off. Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this product. We went with the motorola and are very happy. You can turn off the screen and still hear. There's no stupid alarm and the picture quality is great!	
- 1	I don't know if it's because of the size of my baby (over 10 lbs and 22 in long as a newborn), but this sling doesn't hold my baby up during baths.  He slides right down it and ends up in a hunched over position before too long.  The only good thing about this product is that it's cheap so I don't feel like I wasted a lot of money on it.  We used it twice before giving up on it.	
- 1	I bought this product because of the glowing reviews, but my son had zero interest in it.  It's a shame, too, because he's had 8 teeth since he was 8 months old and at 11 months I still haven't figured out a way to get them brushed.	
1. 	I love Mustela products.  They have a faint smell that is so nice.  The products are super gentle on your baby, too.  Most importantly, they don't have many of the harmful chemicals found in J&J products.	
1. 	We had one of these for our first baby. Now that #2 is on the way, I purchased another. For us, it's perfect. Our bathroom counter has two sinks, so their isn't enough counter space for a standard plastic baby tub. We have a two-story home, and don't want to lug baby bath stuff down to the kitchen, only to trek back upstairs to the bedroom. This works great. It keeps baby secure, fills with warm water, is inexpensive and doesn't take up a lot of space. I imagine it could get moldy if left in a damp environment, but ours never did, and we used it for more than a year. However, we wrung it out as much as possible after use, and hung it from the shower head, so it could drip dry and had air circulation.	
- 1	I have a baby with big plump cheeks, and unfortunately this pacifier leaves marks on her cheeks because the hard plastic curves a bit.	
1. 	We bought 2 total, one for each floor of our house; we've had the first one for 16 months already, no issues at all.  Very simple look, goes well anywhere.  Be careful not to load too much weight on the bottom and middle shelves, it needs reinforcement to support extra weight; a simple metal bar like the top shelf is all that is needed. Assembly was not to bad, little tricky but doable.	
- 1	I like how this diaper wicks moisture away, and I started using it more for my daughter when she began sleeping through the night.  The problem is that the tag, which is sewn into the back center seam of the diaper, hangs outside the diaper.  So by the end of the night, when her diaper is pretty much soaked, the tag has become soaked, too, and the moisture wicks onto her clothes.  I end up having to change her whole outfit, sometimes in the middle of the night if the wetness has woken her up.  I'm going to see if there's a way I can pick out the stitches to get rid of the tag, but it's sewn in pretty firmly.  Other than this fault, I like the fit of the diaper OK, though it tends to get bunched up under her belly like low-rider jeans.  And stuffing the liner into the pocket can be really annoying because sometimes it doesn't want to lie flat since the rise is still snapped at medium height.  Anyway, I only have one of this kind of diaper, and I'm glad I didn't buy more.UPDATE: It's been a few weeks since I removed the tag, but the diaper still wicks moisture along the back elastic, so I'm no longer using it as a nighttime diaper.  I still don't like the way it bunches in front and looks like an abdominal pannus, so she only wears it at home.UPDATE #2 (downgraded from 3 to 2 stars): This diaper started to retain stink badly, and half the time the inner soaker didn't agitate out in the wash. After 14 months of use, I threw it out. I'm only buying all-cotton diapers now, since I've had very little stink issue with them.	
1. 	I got this from Amazon's warehouse deals so I got $40 off the retail price. With that said The box it arrived in was barely hanging on, but the wood it's self was in another box in the torn up on and wasn't damaged. The woo is pretty good seems some parts are real others are not. But the one that aren't are not really visable. My husband and I put it together in a few hours, we had a few mishaps but nothing to big. Stand really sturdy and looks great from afar. Some of the wood arrived damaged but it isn't anything to big for me. My baby won't care and unless you look up close you can't tell. If you are anal about things looking perfect you may not want this for me it works just great.	
1. 	this is a great diaper pad. sure it's not fancy, embroidered, blah blah blah. but it's small and fits all the necessities for a short outing. and if you have someone to watch your stuff while you run to a changing station, you can take it out of your gigantic diaper bag and only carry the little bag. and the zipper compartment can hold a couple of plastic bags for chucking #2 diapers while out and about. if you want to save some money, go with this.REVISED ON 5/29/09: i had no idea that the price went up to over $14!! (i got it at an embarrassingly low price that i cannot mention...) still it's cheaper than other brands. also. if you can get a better wipe dispenser from a hospital swag bag or something, switch it.	
1. 	This chair is a great place to put your baby so he/she can:*take a nap (in the reclined position)*watch a Baby Einstein video*play with toys*safely watch Mommy take a bath/quick shower*eat solids (I use it as a feeding chair)*sit near Mommy and Daddy as they eat dinnerEven though it is supposed to last until the baby is a toddler, I would not recommend using this chair once your baby can sit up because it can tip over. You could drag it back out once your child is big enough to use a rocking chair, but I do not plan to use it as a rocking chair.  I would treat it as any other bouncy chair and store it once baby no longer lies around.	
- 1	I picked this up before our twins were born based on the various must have reviews and really we never used it.We found it too large and awkward and generally just one child breast fed at a time.So really wait until your kids are born and then see if double feeding is something you want to do.  For us this ended up in the closet unused.	
1. 	I was looking for a good solution for keeping my twins reined in while outside.  They are 15 months old and toddling around everywhere. I ended up getting two of these six-panel sets, and I am very happy that I did.  It was so easy to connect them together- the latches easily connect each set to eachother, so you don't have to do anything permanent like if you just got the 2-panel extension set. And the 12-panel blocks off a large area-  I was surprised at how huge it was!I already own a Northgates play yard which is 8 panels.  That is a great size for inside, but I wanted more room outside. Plus two of those gates snapped because the pieces that hold the gates together get stiff when you are trying to adjust them (Granted, I have had this gate for years).  The Summer gate shouldn't have this problem- see below.  The Northgate is also much more expensive if you want extra room.  I got 12 panels for not much more than the Northgates 8-panel.Material: The gates are both made of similar material, plastic.  They feel basically the same all-around to me.  Thin plastic in the middle, thicker and sturdier on the outside.Size of panels: Both panels are the same width, but the Summer is a good amount higher.  I like the fact that I can step over the Northgates, but for security, higher is better I suppose.  It probably makes them seem flimsier, though, since there is more area in the middle which is made of thinner plastic.Adjusting: Northgates has a piece on each hinge that helps each section snap into position.  I have had two of these break, and that whole hinge breaks off so you cannot connect that side any longer.  Summer has a similar construction, but these pieces either screw down or up to adjust them, so there would be no reason for them to break (unless you forget to loosen them).Moving: The weight of both is similar, but the Summer should be easier to move because the panels move more easily due to what I explained above.  I also like the strap.  I bought these for our back yard, but I can see taking at least one other places to keep my twins from running everywhere.All in all, I feel the Summer is a better deal than the Northgates.  I'm sure they both have their flaws, but they are very comparable in quality and function, so for me, it came down to the price difference.However, the price is only better if you are going for the 12-panel size.  Six-panel would be way too small (that's how the Northgate used to be, but now they just sell it with 8), so buying this plus a $36 extra two panels is no bargain- you might as well get both sets, and even if you don't need all the panels, you could use the extra to block off a room, tv, fireplace, etc.  Or buy one set for a crawler, then get another one once they are walking.  Because trust me, they'll want the extra room.	
1. 	Great padding that was essential when baby arches her back thereby slamming her head on it.  It is a standard sized changing pad--the covers I purchased fit perfect.  It has a textured bottom to prevent slipping.  I know they probably have to put that strap on it for liability reasons, but I removed it permanently (I think it hindered the traction on the bottom and I'm not walking a way from my kid on the changing table anyway, and it would only get in the way of changing diapers/clothes!).	
- 1	Baby just slides out of it! Pushes his legs and slides out ! Sue the manufacturer for unsafe product! gotta return this one and get a 4-sided instead.	
- 1	I used these bottles and loved them with my first child who was formula fed. Since then, the design has been changed (they added the ring)as well as the materials used. Everything I loved about them with my first I still love. The problem is with the nipples. My second is exclusively breastfed and the flow is just too fast. We are still using newborn nipples (baby is 4 months old) and it drowns him. Hes used to the super slow flow of eating on the breast and this just doesnt cut it. He ends up eating too fast and then throws up a good ounce of precious milk, only to be hungry again in 30 minutes. Needless to say, I am now in search of a new bottle.	
- 1	Do you notice the fluorescent light from the yellow part of the elephant rattle? I have been concerned about it ever since I discovered it one day under the blue light of our ceiling lamp.I think safty is the top 1 standard for baby products.	
- 1	pros - easy to clean- works like a straw as you only have to suck to get the air out and as soon as the air comes out the milk comes up so the bottle works at every angleCONS -The liners break when you try to burp them to get all the air out...would rather take the time to burp baby then the bottle.- measurements are WAY off (8 oz bottles will NOT hold 8 oz)- extremely hard to read the off measurements when baby has drank a couple ounces. i would ahve to pour the leftover formula into a regular bottle to see how much he ate which was bad when i thought he wasnt eating enough.- my kids had more gas with these.- leak all over everything if baby tips the bottle over on its side if he tips it upside down FORGET ANY CHANCE THAT IT MIGHT NOT LEAK	
- 1	The straw has a design that opens when the straw itself is squeezed (with teeth or gums).  When the straw is not squeezed, liquied doesn't flow.  Even the straw is squeezed, very little liquid flows through.  I tried it and had a really hard time with it.Perhaps this is a design for kids learning to drink through a straw.  My 16-month old daughter did not like it.Ultimately, I used some scissors to cut that little plastic closure.  The flow has improved greatly.  The cup itself is nice and sturdy.  Easy to use.  I like the colors.Still, I wouldn't recommend this cup.	
1. 	This gate requires common sense, not instructions.  There is no sense in down-grading their rating for this reason.  Why does toothpaste have instructions?  People like you, who lack common sense and basic problem-solving skills.The height is better than the taller Evenflo model, because even at 5'4&#34; it is still possible to step over the gate, even while holding a laundry basket.  We've had this gate set up on the stairs (prior to setting up a permanent gate) and it is possible to step over the gate and down one step without issue.Bear in mind that the bottom corners must be placed above floor molding so that all four rubber nubs have equal pressure against the wall.  Even with the added height, it is easy to step over.  This is not the type of gate you want to unlock and replace every time you want to go by.We have permanently mounted gates in addition to these pressure gates since each gate has its own benefits.  Permanently mounted gates are just that, you never intend to move them, just pass through.  If you go this route, be prepared to use the screws they provide since they are not strong enough to hold back toddlers without the extra reinforcement.These pressure gates are for blocking off an open slider (the nubs fit into the slider so it is impossible to dislodge) or the kids' bedroom during play time.  We also use them on the front door when we are looking for a cool breeze.After a few weeks you will notice that the metal leaves marks in the commonly used settings, so it is quicker to install over time.	
1. 	My Sister who is 7 months pregnant again with her second child has this bedding set for her son (11months old) with the green hamper... she loves it because its a unisex bed set (she is not going to find out the sex of the baby...which most people find out (pink or blue) we wanted something that can fit both boy or girl! over all we love this set and will use it for baby #2 crib!! over all the other crib sets some are too girly or more boy looking this is unisex!!! and its A GOOD SET!	
1. 	These blocks are perfect. We actually purchased them to do a maternity photo shoot & will also use them when the baby is born for to play with. Them seem to be great quality.  The yellow, orange, green, & blue letters are embossed. There are symbols & animals. And they're made in the US!  I'm happy so far!P.S. Baby is 5 months old now & she loves them!! She loves to pick up the blocks in her hands & just hold them.	
1. 	I got these to use on our dining room table because my daughter kept walking right into the edges and hurting herself. The tape worked great and the brown color doesn't look to bad w/our dining room table. Would definitely purchase again! We also have a similar product on our living room table that is peeling only because our daughter kept pulling at it. If you are having issues w/the tape I would suggest getting stronger double-sided tape from your local Home Depot or Lowes, just make sure it won't damage the woodwork.	
- 1	I just got this flannel fitted crib sheet yesterday. I washed it in baby detergent because it had a strong smell from the plastic packaging. When I pulled it out from the dryer I noticed that the sheets have unraveled from the elastic. The sheets fell apart and I hadn't eveN used them yet. Horrible!	
1. 	Our two year old was getting tired of sitting in his high chair, but wasn't tall enough to sit in a regular chair. This booster seat is the perfect compromise. We have it set to the lowest setting and he is able to sit right at the table (without the tray) and eat with everyone else. The straps make it super secure on the chair, but it also seems pretty easy to take along with us when traveling. Great product and a great value.	
1. 	We got this gate plus two extensions, one for either side, almost a month ago for our triplets who just turned a year old. We were concerned at first if the extra extensions would be able to support the three babies sufficiently. It does! The only downfall, which I've seen mentioned a few times before, is that the available width space doesn't match up with what the gate says it can support. So if you get this and are running to the border of width, add that extra extension for sure so it's not wobbling. And after measuring and you think using the gate with both extentions will just barely fit, try it, but more than likely it will be wobbly a bit. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, this is a great gate! We have the added baseboards along the bottom of our walls plus the tiny toe boards and because this is all pressure mounted it adjusts great. Just take your time and get things even and straight. It doesn't take long to set up, 15-20 minutes tops. It works great for us since we live in military base housing and want to avoid putting holes in the walls to fill in later. It's odd at first to get used to the foot petal but once you get used to it, it's a lifesaver! We have the Clear View Gate on the playroom which we love but for the kitchen doorway we needed something wider and more convenient with the smaller swing door since we use the kitchen more. The bar on the bottom took only a couple days to get used to and with the ramps on either side it helps with not tripping. The gate swings either way which helps too! Sooo worth the money since these things can be used for years!	
1. 	The sleep sheep has been a staple of our sleep routine since the beginning. After using it steadily for a year, the sound box stopped working. As soon as I contacted Cloud B, they sent us a replacement sound box, no problem.We like the ocean sound best and rain is very nice but really haven't used the other sounds. I do wish it had an option for night-long sound.As a tip, when we travel, we take the sound box along so she has the continuity of the same sounds to fall asleep to. No need to find room to pack the whole sheep.	
1. 	We've been relatively happy with these bottles, but I think we may have gone with something different if we had done any research.  We got these from the lactation consultant's office a day after our daughter was born in a panic of needing to buy something.  Our daughter was breast fed mostly, but used these a few times a week.Venting system: I do hear air going back in the back end, so I suppose it is doing its job to some degree, but I also see air going back in through the nipple.Ease of washing: I dont think the five parts are all that difficult to wash/keep track of.  The bottom stopper does take a bit of attention to make sure formula isnt remaining there after washing though.  Dont use a bottle brush and put it through the bottom stopper... it can cause it to tear and leak.  We've generally handwashed the bottles and parts, but have put them through the dishwasher with success.Leaking: We ususally have at least one bottle a week that leaks.  We havent been able to identify the exact cause, because as far as we can see, they're clean and assembled correctly.  The only time we had a consistent leak to troubleshoot, it was due to the bottom stopper having a tear in the inner ring.Replacement parts: I'm really confused as to why the bottom stoppers are not available in most stores.  Also, why do they sell three packs of bottles and only two packs of nipples?  So we have nine bottles and eight nipples.  Silly.Having not used anything else, I can't really compare. Parents in our parent's group seem to all use something different and they all seem happy with their choice whether it was the Dr. Browns, Medela, etc.	
1. 	Didn't know the thing moved around kind of like a snake.  My daughter thinks it's fun for about 20 seconds and then tries to gnaw it to pieces.  Good toy!!!	
- 1	I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem. I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag. However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet. I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle. I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook. I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded. I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.	
1. 	This high chair has an edge and really is convenient to clean spilled food.  My only complaints would be that the seat doesn't rotate around the base so you have to lift the whole chair if you want to switch the facing position of your infant.  The base is kind of heavy for that purpose.  Still a great, great product.	
1. 	We tried at least 7 different bibs before these and these are #1. They are large, waterproof, and have a big crumb catcher pocket. They are also very flexible instead of some of the others we tried that were very rigid.	
1. 	I did a lot of research before buying a car seat and this one is top notch. It has one of the highest safety ratings. I love this chair. My son loves it too. It not only looks good but is comfy too. It's easy to install, we have several vehicles and have had no problems installing it in any of them. My son is a big baby. This chair has the capacity to hold up to 65 lbs vs. a lot of other chairs which only hold up to 45 lbs. It is a bit pricey but well worth it!! This is a great car seat!	
- 1	The Arm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat is too large for our standard toilet seat. We have a regular (round) toilet, and the potty seat is too long, front to back. Though it seemed like a good product otherwise, we had to send it back. Also, just FYI, the deodorizing disk on the back has a fairly strong scent, but one can remove it easily if desired.	
1. 	This is a great little gift set for younger children. My girl got bored fast but thats because she was older when we pourchased this. Very well made and colorful.	
1. 	I recommend using these for short term use only. They are not recommended long-term, because it can affect your milk supply, and/or the transfer of milk from you to your baby, causing slow weight gain. However, there are some women who can use one for the entire breastfeeding relationship and never have a problem.I had sore/cracked/blistered and bleeding nipples from a bad latch. Breastfeeding was extremely painful. The very first time I used this shield, I felt no pain at all. It was instantly gone. The shield quickly filled up with milk and my baby had the swallowing sounds. I had to hold it into place a lot of the times, and had to wash it everytime I was done with it, but well worth it. If you are about to give up on breastfeeding because of problems with the latch, this can save your breastfeeding relationship. Try this before you quit.	
1. 	Works good a little tough to remove the food but i just run it under hot water and they pop right out	
- 1	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor.  He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work.  The lowest setting is still slightly too high.  Not impressed.  Kinda boring.  Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.	
- 1	I returned them because they didn't cling onto the window smoothly. They had lots of air bubbles that wouldn't come out and it just looked so tacky.	
1. 	This was a life saver! Best bath tub for its side. Lightweight and enough room for my LO who is 8 months old to play.	
- 1	I don't know why this product is so popular. It's full of chemicals that you don't want to put on your baby skin. More than this when I washed my baby with this it made my hands very dry and itchy. I'm sure baby's gentle skin feels even worse than this.	
- 1	I am not sure what the difference is between these and other wipes... outside of the expense.  It's not made with castile soap, and that seems like it would work better than these wipes.  I was not comfortable enough with the cleaning power of these to use without thoroughly rinsing all pieces of my pump.  I see how it seems easy, but now that I've tried these, they are pretty much a waste of money.	
1. 	Love under the nile products for being fair trade and always using organic cotton.  This is a great toy for a teething baby.  My daughter loves chewing on the ends of the green bean.  I think it is very comforting to her.  This kind of toy is a much better shape then some of the other under the nile toys because my daughter can chew and hold it easily.  We also have the strawberry, broccoli and tomato and this is her favorite one to chew on out of the bunch.	
1. 	I think that this food processor is a bit small for when you want to do big batch of food but I love it because :1. It gives a really smouth purees2. It's easy to clean (diswasher !!!)3. Usefull even with toddlers who are not always comfortable with meat.	
- 1	I love the design, idea, and feel of this cup BUT.....it leaks like crazy!! My son 1 & 1/2 loves drinking out of a straw so when i found this I was excited to get it and it work for one day then the next day the fluid just keep leaking out of the straw even if the cup is sitting on the table. We found out that the air builds up and then it pushes the liquid out so you have to constantly release the air pressure in the straw and it's a pain to keep checking the cup to make sure it's not leaking so as we all know messy cups and not fun to keep cleaning up after! I would not recommend this cup!	
- 1	I tried to use this for my almost 4 yr old who isn't potty trained at night yet.She's 35 lbs and the leg openings cut into her legs so bad that it left terrible red marks. I felt horrible for her. The underpants leaked all over her bed. It was so wet, it was as if I just put her in regular underwear.Oh well, the search continues. I wanted to be more earth friendly and try these, but back to disposable night time pull ups until I find something worth while.I was also irritated that upon returning these, I was only refunded half of the cost + paid for my own shipping both ways! ARG!	
1. 	My 16 month old loves this toy. And I can see it growing with her for a while since the neighbor kids (8 and 10) love it too. High quality and the small size was fine for my taller than average child.	
- 1	maybe these  do work for some women, but these were more painful than my regular flanges... i'm sending these back!	
1. 	These wipes hold up well during use and with washing. I dampen the wipe or the baby and use it to wipe down messy poo, or just a clean swipe if it was just pee. Soft enough for baby, but great at wiping down mess too. Once used I just throw it in the same bag as the dirty diaper. Highly recommend it.	
1. 	This is the only bottle/nipple our breastfed baby would take expressed breastmilk in.  She flat out refused all others.  We use these Blue nipples now that my daughter is older (thicker plastic), but used the clear Natural nurser nipples when she was younger and the product still worked and didn't leak.	
- 1	I bought this to make and store my baby's food. The first time I used the tray, it ripped in 3 places.	
- 1	I was given this as a gift and I am sorry to add to the other one star reviews that it is a completely useless product. With no constant 'on' setting, all it does is wake baby when it switches off, totally defeating the purpose of having the machine in the first place.Also I have had problems with shorting as well, leaving me to believe that this product is not well made and wouldn't last even if I had used it more than a dozen times.	
1. 	It was a little bit of work to put this together, but definitely not the hardest piece of furniture that I have ever put together. We are still using this now that my son is 9 months old. I put some baskets in the cubby holes and that works great to store diapers and many other things.	
1. 	I got sleeping sacks from Carter's and from another brand but they weren't half as good as this one. Plenty of room for your LO to move her legs. Comfy and warm. I love it.What I love the most though, is the inverted zipper. Instead of going from the bottom up, it goes from chin to bottom. This prevents you from accidentally catching the baby's chin with the zipper.	
- 1	This cup is very hard to clean and it leaks. I have a standard straw cleaning brush and I can't fit it down this straw. It's a great concept but not executed well.	
1. 	My six month granddaughter loves this teething toy. She can easily hold it and its twisting movement makes it more interesting for her. It also has different surfaces on it which she seems to like for her gums	
1. 	I loved these bibs! easy to put on the baby, super easy to wash with a sponge and it holds the food that spills perfectly! i highly recommend these! I have a 7 month old that is starting her first foods and wants to touch everything, so food spills everywhere. At least these keep most food from getting to her clothes as it drops into the support. Loved them!	
1. 	My 13-month-old daughter loves to rip bibs secured with velcro right off.  These, will certainly stay on and they are easy to wash.  However, it's not super easy to fit wiggling arms through the arms (which are a bit long on my daughter who is in the 50th percentile for height and 10th for weight).  Overall, we like these when we really want to make sure her outfit will stay neat and clean.  Otherwise, it's not really worth the effort.	
- 1	Folks, I am NOT kidding! A local TV channel 3 affiliate here in Ohio ran a story the other day about a couple that had one of these that greatly malfunctioned.  The new mom interviewed said that the product started emitting a burning smell, and when she looked down at it, she couldn't believe her eyes... the plastic around where the power cord plugs in was completely melted!  Then to add insult to injury, they claimed that Evenflo would take a while to send them back their refund.  Perhaps this was a 'fluke', but I felt obligated to tell all of you about this.  My wife is expecting our first child in August, and we will be looking at breast pumps as well.  But not Evenflo.	
- 1	I wouldn't recommend these unless you have a much older baby or need to add a lot of cereal to bottles.	
- 1	For the most part, this monitor is fine.  It's small and unobtrusive, it's cute and functional.  HOWEVER there is a critical flaw that will prevent me from ever actually using it: as soon as I plugged the transmitter in (the part that goes in the baby's room) I could hear a loud, very high pitched sound.  I know if that sound was in **MY** room when **I** was trying to sleep, it would drive me absolutely nuts.  There's no way I'm going to have it on in baby's room--I don't want to bother her and if she doesn't sleep soundly, then neither will I.Disclaimer: my ears hear high sounds much better than most everyone I know.  There's a good chance you will plug your monitor in and not hear a thing.  I suspect the manufacturer has no idea it is even there.  It is also possible that mine is a defect and the others don't do this.  HOWEVER, it is important to note that almost across the board, young children hear higher sounds than adults (because as you age, high pitched sounds are the first to go).  This means that just because you don't hear anything doesn't mean your baby won't.  Just something to think about...	
1. 	These are by far the best bibs I have bought. I love the bumkins bibs. They wash up nice and hold up great. The only negative is if your child pulls at their bibs, they might be able to pull off this kind of bib since it is attached by velcro.	
1. 	Because it's cotton, material breathes better than the fleece counterpart. We bought this for our infant to wear in the winter since we keep our house very warm. And our lil one is one sweaty baby. One star deducted since after washing and drying, the zipper wrinkles up and does not lay flat.	
- 1	I purchased this video monitor for a friend- we opened it up at the party, and it never worked!  I was so embarrassed. The monitor did not recognize the video feed at all.  If you're spending this much on a video monitor, I would recommend any of the Summer monitors.  They may be pricier, but at least they work.	
1. 	The idea of travelling solo with an infant/toddler is no fun. It scares me. Especially if I'm going overseas where access to a target/babies r us is not as easyThis made life easy. It's toss/go so I don't feel badly if we forget it on the plane/restaurant/taxi. I can reuse it! The lids are interchangeable so i can make short sippy cups (great when my son was an infant) and use the tall ones to hold snacks and formula. Now that he's a toddler we'll be using the large sippy cups.I'm travelling abroad again with him and ordered 2 sets of these to take with us. The idea of loosing his woody sippy would be earth shattering so not taking any risks! The pieces are great to throw into my diaper bag and use it at restaurants. The spons/forks will be useless for my 27mon old so that's the only downer to the kit now. They were great when he was an infant.I don't know about you - but some restaurants don't have child proof utensils/cups/plates/bowls so this will allow my kiddo to eat w/o us having to fork over extra money for broken dishes!For the price of this set - it's a bargain! Great deal, great product.	
- 1	I bought this after reading all the nice reviews on this, however I hate this product after buying it cz the lid sucks! It is impossible to remove the lid. I literally hurt my fingers opening it or spill formula out. I assumed I need to rotate the lid to move from one compartment to the other, but the lid does not rotate at all! I am very disappointment and am already browsing for a better formula dispenser now!	
1. 	he LOVED it...however, as soon as he started getting teeth he made marks in the wood and paint started to chip off. not as durable as i thought it would be.	
1. 	We are very happy with this tub.  It worked well for a few months.  It was great for transition from infant tub to the big tub.  Its nice quality and when you squeeze the duck bill it quacks!  Our baby girl loves it! : )	
- 1	I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already.  However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones.  My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore.  The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.	
- 1	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible.  My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise.  Our baby slept through the night since day one...it was the monitor that kept us up.  I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers...it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it. This monitor is not worth the money.	
1. 	solo viertes un poco de agua en este esterilizador, introduces los teteros y lo metes al microondas y listooo, ya estan excelente para darle la leche al bebe....	
1. 	These plugs work perfectly well, and they fit my sockets very snugly.  I think the people who complained they fit too loosely probably had older sockets or something - there is no way my baby could pry them out.  My husband barely can when he does the vacuuming :  The only downside was that one package was not quite enough to cover all the outlets in my house - I was about 4 plugs short.  But at this price, buying another box wasn't a big deal.  They are a very unobtrusive opaque clear plastic, so they should match with any color electrical plate.	
- 1	I've had this for several months and have tried everything to keep it secure to the shower wall.  It won't suction and the adhesive won't hold it up either.  BIG WASTE OF MONEY.  Plus, the awkward shape makes it impossible to set it down anywhere...it just falls.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  It's much easier to just store bath toys in a little dish that can easily set down near the tub than this awkward whale design.	
1. 	Not only is this Sleep Sheep super soft the sound is great!!  Volume is easily adjusted and gets pretty loud even tho the speaker is inside the sheep.  I really like the different timers you can set but for our little budndle of joy I wish it were longer. Regardless our 4mo old sleeps so much better with a little sound and we use the Rain and Ocean regularly.  This is a must buy for light sleepers since it really does a great job of hiding outside noise from cars and neighbors and even if your baby sleeps like a rock this Sleep Sheep is a great for calming down those fussy moments !!! &#60;3	
1. 	I have had this diaper pail for about 2 1/2 years, I recieved it at my first sons baby shower. I had actually registered for the Diaper Genie, and was dissapointed when I got this one. After knowing MANY moms who have the genie, I am so happy someone purchased me this one instead! It holds a ton of diapers and pull-ups! My 4 month olds diapers dont stink too much yet, but this pail will handle the job! Honestly, I think I onlyo had a stinky nursery when I over stuffed the bags, didnt clean the PAIL, and didnt keep deoderant circles in it. I find it unnessesary to dump the #2 into the toilet first, this pail handles the job as it is. It is very easy to dump in a diaper one handed, and the refils last months, litteraly! I just bought refils a few days ago, my other ones I had since my second son came home from the hospital, four months ago! My 2 1/2 year old can not figure out how to open this though (thank goodness!) and he is not potty trained, but will be soon! This tackels all odors and refils really arent that expensive. I love it, and my house guests are amazed that I actually change diapers in my house, not one whiff!	
- 1	Yes, I hate it.  The suction cup doesn't stick.  The toy doesn't stay in the base.  The (loud) music plays at the slightest vibration.But my children love/loved it.  I got rid of the suction cup base and try to move carefully around the toy when it's put away.I'll get rid of it as soon as they forget it's there.Bottom line:  Run.  Run far away.NOTE:  Apparently, there's a new version of this toy.  Mine is two years old.  I obviously have the old one.  The new one might be much better, though the incessant music is one of the things my kids love about it, so this toy without the music is not really this toy anymore.	
- 1	The idea is great. The design is cute. We used it for few first weeks when baby was born as soon as we started to bath her. And then this turtle broke. Thanks God by that time I was already able to measure if water is right by my hand.	
1. 	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	
1. 	This seat seems very comfortable for my little girl to ride in. Like the Decathlon Odyssey, it reclines very well for rear facing (we haven't used it forward facing yet) and is also very padded for her comfort. The print is so adorable and super soft. I love that Britax has the hugs system because not once have I had to untwist those darn harness straps like in her infant seat. This seat is also a breeze to install. This is definitely one I recommend!!! 5+ stars!!!!	
- 1	My child could care less about these little rattles. The socks, I'm afraid, can't be called socks. I dont know whose feet they are made to fit, but they can't fit my newborn! They have no stretch to them. And she was only 7 pounds when I purchased these! Cute idea though.	
- 1	I bought of a set of these and use these regularly. Three of the four lids had flaps that broke off. Fortunately, only one flap per lid has snapped off so I'm still able to seal the containers relatively well, but I shouldn't have to deal with broken lids at all!	
- 1	What the photo does not show is the packaging--that clearly labels the ice packs as for &#34;adult use&#34;. I don't really expect my kindergartener to try to take a bite out of it, but given the mixed reviews regarding durability, I am not confident about trusting her judgement in how to handle it should the bag break and leak. Frustrated that the information given in the description was so kid focused when clearly, from the packaging, Green Sprouts isn't comfortable saying it is okay for kids' lunchboxes.	
1. 	Not sure how much cleaning it does, but my daughter chews on it and I rub it back and forth on her teeth and gums to get her used to a toothbrush.  Great for the price.	
1. 	Very cute toy.  My 5 month old daughter and 15 month old niece both love it.  The music is cute and not too annoying!	
1. 	We bought this dresser a year ago for our daughter's nursery. I easily assembled it while my husband was at work. It looks great and the color is beautiful!	
1. 	Purchased for my 9 month old grandson - he loves these spoons! The spoon bowl is nice and shallow which makes it easier to use, and the handle is fun to chew on as well!	
1. 	We purchased this bottle warmer for travel use. We have the full sized Dr. Brown bottle warmer but it's too big to carry along on short trips and vacations.PROS:Inexpensive but not cheap. It's hard to find a functional bottle warmer in this price.Sized perfectly for travel. Great to use in hotels and or if you'll be staying with relatives.It will accommodate wide neck bottles. We had no problem warming Dr. Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and Similac's odd shaped bottles.Heats up fast. Average warming time for an 8 oz bottle with 5 oz formula is around 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes depending if it's room temperature or chilled.CONS:Outside of bottles gets really hot to touch. Be careful in lifting your bottles with your bare hands.No built in water reservoir. Water has to be measured and poured with every use.Warmer needs a cool down period of at least 10 minutes with every use. It is not designed to warm multiple bottles.	
1. 	We have a lot of rattles in our house and the is by far my twins favorite.  In addition, their ocupational therapist uses this for developmental tool.  I would recommend as a must have for any parent.	
1. 	This is a great stroller!  It is so light weight and makes turning in narrow store isles so easy.  One fold system makes it so nice to take out of trunk and out into trunk.  I am going to miss the stroller when she reaches the 20lb weight limit and I can't use it anymore.  I just love it!!!	
- 1	Love aden & anais bibs and blankets, but this contraption is just horrible.  For a swaddle, it needs to have the option to be adjustable and made tighter.  This one just has a snap.  Most babies can break out of this swaddle and the newborn size is HUGE.  Don't waste your money on this.  Try the Halo sleep sack or the Summer Swaddle me.	
1. 	They are cute, semi-soft and perfect size for little hands. They also make a nice sound while propelling themselves! My 14 months old likes them very much, and I think he will play more and more with them!	
1. 	These finger guards are simple to use and very effective. I highly recommend this product for anyone with a toddler or infant on the go!	
1. 	I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while	
1. 	Easy to clean, secure when the lid is on. Great for travel. Flow is also great - my son loves to drink his milk from this sippy cup. Only complaint - not super easy to clean the holes unless you have a special cleaner, but I dont think too much - just put it in the dishwasher :)	
1. 	I have primarily used these travel bibs until I recently tried Bibsters.  I quickly switched back.  I like the crumb pocket design.  It holds well and catches food.  The neck closure has positives and negatives.  It is a sticky seal.  As long as you press it together well, it holds well.  My daughters pull on them, but quickly stop when they can't rip them off.  The problem is they have long hair and no matter how hard we try, we end up pulling their hair.  We put the bibs on in front (under their chins,) then twist the bib around.  After they eat, we rip the bib to remove on the side, rather than trying to open the seal.  This has reduced the hair pulling, but we cannot seem to keep it from happening completely.  Overall these are my favorites.  We have not had any issue with food leaking through the bib.	
1. 	This placemat has been a great purchase!  I purchased it for use when we take our 9 month old out and it has been well received!  Not only does it cover the table, it catches some of the food items my son drops.  This is quite handy and an unexpected benefit.  Love it and so does my son.  He runs his hand over it, feeling all of the textures.	
- 1	They don't seem to stick very well.  Also, once they did start to come off, I noticed it was leaving that sticky residue behind on my coffee table.	
1. 	this was a baby shower gift, my friend still uses this after 1 year. great investment, it was sturdy and the colors were bright.	
- 1	If you are using this as a trainer cup, to move your child to the sippy, do not buy. The spout is too small. I like the THINK BABY bottle much more. I wish they would have made the spout larger.	
1. 	If I had to freeze breastmilk, this was great because I didn't have to put a lot of plastic containers in the freezer (we could use them to feed the baby instead).  They were easy to dispose of if they outdated (there is a place to label them with the date).  I usually put 3 of them in a freezer bag as a double layer of protection against leaks and freezer burn.  None ever leaked for me.  They thaw easier and faster than in hard plastic or glass containers, too.  Very convenient.	
1. 	I would have given it 5 stars but it has some stitching in the middle of the pocket, (I guess to hold it up), and it doesn't seem to catch as much food as our other bibs.  I love the waterproof feature but it does take a little longer to dry than our nonwaterproof ones.  I guess you have to choose the features you need for each meal.  I like the sleeves because it makes it harder for our 15 month old to pull it off.  Overall I like it better than my other bibs.	
1. 	We used this for our great room shelf to protect our 17 month old daughter from pulling the shelf of DVDs over. It looks a bit cheap but does the job.	
1. 	We travel a lot, so we were looking for an inflatable tub that would be durable and long-lasting.  It's been in use for about a month now, traveling to three different cities, and so far, we love it.  It's fairly easy to inflate (especially if you have a pump).  There's two sections that you have to blow up separately.  The inside of the tub where the baby sits has nice ridged lining to keep the baby from slipping.  It's also really handy to prop up our 4-month old daughter against the back of the tub so that we don't have to keep her head lifted up the entire time we're bathing her.  After bath time, we simply hang this up on our shower wall to dry, and it can conveniently stay there until the next bathtime.  Compared to a standard bathtub, this inflatable tub is just safer and more convenient.  We use it now even when we don't travel.  The quacker in beak of the duck is a nice feature, but it's a bit difficult to actually find the thing and get it to work (my 4 year-old niece couldn't do it).  But that's a minor flaw compared to the overall greatness of this tub.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
- 1	Even though these helped with pain, I couldn't wear them because the pressure made me leak so much. They've been sitting in a drawer for months. I was really disappointed	
- 1	Mine fell apart after 2 washes. It was nice at first, other than the fabric was see through. With babies you need things to withstand multiple Washings. Don't waste your money.	
- 1	I like the flannel wipes that are not too thick for diaper wipes. These were great at first, but after a couple of months I noticed the colored thread around the edging was starting to unravel. I was willing to overlook this, though. Recently I'm seeing that they're starting to tear on the edges and the fabric is thinning significantly. The bumgenius wipes we have been using for just as long (10 months) are holding up so much better. I know what I'll be replacing these with.	
1. 	I absolutely love these fresh food feeders. They can be used when baby is still too small for food but may have started teething. You can put an ice cube or a frozen cube of breast milk or formula inside of them and let a teething baby chew on it. And it's great for fruits, veggies, pretty much any food that you can fit inside of it! We continued to use one with my son after he had gotten a few teeth and it didn't tear or wear out. They can be a little messy, but then feeding a baby anything gets messy, no matter what you do. I always recommend these to friends and I'm on my second set with my second baby.	
1. 	Great find! Had no problems with the straps. Small enough to take anywhere! Used at a stadium seating event, the beach, park, home etc.	
- 1	We wanted to get a second camera for our existing monitor, but turned out that the model has been discontinued, so we had to look for a new monitor with two cameras. I was looking at Motorola, but didn't want to overpay for the functions I thought I won't use (tilt/pan, room temp), so I decided to go with this simpler and cheaper monitor.Here is the quick summary:pros: the video quality is goodcons: sound quality is HORRIBLE. Even with the sound turned on to the max you can barely hear that your child is crying if you have TV or music turned on, or if you're in the kitchen and have running water. It also has a lot of static noise in the background which makes it really hard to hear what's going on in the nursery.. If you're monitoring a younger baby, it's OK, but my older one likes to talk a lot before falling asleep and after waking up, and I can't understand what she is saying, even when I listen very careful.If you have a few cameras, the monitor won't automatically switch between them when the noise is detected. Right now I have my kids sleeping in separate rooms and I need to constantly manually switch between cameras to check on them.The monitor is very light, in fact it's so ridiculously light that it's own cord drags it down from my nightstand!Camera's cord is very short.I kinda regret now that I decided to save money and went with this option. I wish I could tilt the camera, since we took off the crib rail and my baby gets out of the bed and starts wondering around the room.	
1. 	I bought one of these potties for my 18 month old and it is fantastic!  I just bought another one to use in the other bathroom.  It doesn't move around like the other potty seats she has used.  Would definitely recommend!	
- 1	It is soft and cosy, but- gets cold on ends (full od water)- heavy and full of water after bath, impossible to wash it, so I need to drag it to the washing mashing each time- better for dipper sink	
1. 	I love this product.  I put it in my baby's bassinet and it keeps him right in the middle of the bassinet.  Plus it's a little softer than than the thin cushion my bassinet came with.	
- 1	This mirror is nice and big but installation was a joke. None of the 4 installation methods worked in my minivan so I had to rig it up with zip ties.	
1. 	My newborn squirmed and cried bloody murder during her sponge baths so you can imagine how nervous I was to immerse her in water for her first real bath. I needn't have worried. The shape of the infant side kept her comfortably cradled and even when she squirmed she stayed in place, allowing me to focus on getting her squeaky clean. (No need for two sets of hands). When she fouled the water, I used the drain to quickly empty the tub and then refill it before continuing with the bath. Since there is a toddler side I will be able to use this tub for quite some time before she transitions to the bathtub. Also the lack of slings or other cloth pieces eliminates concerns about the tub being fully clean and sanitary. My mother saw the tub and scoffed why would anyone buy a tub when they could just wash the baby in the sink. Then she saw how easy and effortless bath time was and she was sold. My newborn actually likes getting a bath now, hence I now enjoy bathing her. It's worth every penny.Things to know:1) The tub is big. It can't easily be tucked away somewhere out of sight.2) The shape of the tub requires maneuvering to get all of the water out while draining since all areas do not have direct access to the drain.	
1. 	These snack cups are AWESOME! I can put all sorts of small snack items (dried fruit, crackers, cookies, etc) in here, and my toddler can't get the lid off to make a mess. He can get his hand in all the way to the bottom to get the last few pieces (a problem I've had with other snack containers). Yes, if you have small crumbs and your child turns the cup upside down and shakes, you might have a little mess. However, it wasn't that big of a problem for me - just make sure you have fresh, whole pieces of your snack.	
- 1	Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked. At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one. After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!! WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately. It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!	
1. 	The gate is great and works perfectly! Go ahead and buy a set of longer screws or anchors to install with the gate. We have two of these, and ended up having to do that to both of them after they came out of the wall when opening!	
- 1	I was quite disappointed when I opened the package to see that the wheels are very durty and have a lot of scratched on them. What's more, there were some human hairs sticky on them. I don't know if it is a used one or what? I'm still considering to return it.	
- 1	These little musical instruments are simply not worth it.  They are cheap, they don't make much sound and honestly were a waste of money.  They are not infant or toddler friendly either.	
- 1	This bassinet is useful for a newborn, as we could take our baby from room to room, but I wish the mattress was sturdier. You can see the dent in our baby's head makes daily. What's worse is that when the bassinet basket is placed on the stand, as in the pictures, the mattress and frame dip in the middle. It's built w/o a sturdy bottom so that it can be converted into a seat for older babies and is a major construction flaw, in my opinion. It helps to place the bassinet basket on a flat surface like the couch or floor, but then we can't wheel it it around.	
1. 	we purchased to keep at grandmas that lives out of state but we visit often! kids love it! compact easy fold to store!	
- 1	I don't know why I was so excited to get this. I guess because I hate that my dish rack gets cluttered up with tons of bottles everyday. I wash the bottles and food containers at the end of the day, so this this is pretty useless for me. It barely fit 3 nipples and 2 seals. Also if you have short fat bottles like the tommee tippee it just looks weird on there, like it was meant for thinner bottles. I also wish that this would plug in. The fan on here is also to noisy. It sounds like it's going to break.While yes, it may dry your bottles faster, if you like to wash 3 at a time, there is way to many things I just don't like about this. It's been packed away after using for just a day.	
1. 	It is for my baby,and it is fit for our baby, maybe i will buy more and more.I like it.	
1. 	I got this playpen in the multi, because at the time it was the cheapest, and I really didn't care. Now, it is a little garish, but at the same time I actually really like it-it's bright, sturdy, and is about  1 1/2 in. taller and 3 in. longer than my Graco pack and play. I like how the ends are solid, sometimes my 11 month old isn't exactly crazy about being in the playpen, but if she sees me walk away, it gets worse. The solid ends allow me to sit in the same room, but out of sight, which lets my daughter play by herself longer. I gave it 5 stars, because I have yet to find any flaws with it. Granted, it isn't as elegant? as my pack and play, but as already stated, that wasn't important to me. So far, it is sturdy, sets up quickly and easily, and I like that it comes with a storage bag, which as yet I haven't tried, but since that is what it came in, I know that it fits. The pocket on one end is a good place to store the bag. I have been very satisfied with this purchase, and I would buy it again. Oh, and the picture shows it having the ends taller and curved, but they aren't, all 4 sides are the same height.Update:I have used the storage bag twice, and it is very easy to get in the bag, and the handles make it easy to carry-I'm liking it better than my Pack and Play!	
- 1	We had to get some of these for the bottles.Like: 1) Removable handles, 2) BPA FreeDislike: 1) Ridiculously expensive, 2) Fidgety extra parts that do nothing except require cleaning and slow you down when you try to fill it. 3) LEAKS! - No valve except the hole in the cup spout. 4) No valve except in the cup spout. Our daughter chewed on one and the hole got a LOT bigger and leaks like crazy now - you can buy replacements for $7 for a pair.My wife bought a bunch of these and matching bottles in the big BPA scare last year. Now there are MANY better and much cheaper options. I recommend anyone investigate those first	
1. 	this is the best 'stacker' i could find that was safe (bpa free) for my baby to put in his mouth.  i first gave them to him around 6 months old and he LOVED them! they are fun to stack (and knock over!), to put other toys inside, to play in the bathtub (a few of the cups have draining holes in the bottom), and to play in the sand. they are very durable too!	
- 1	I bought this & the greenish circle rattle by Sassy as well.  I thought it was a good toy until I noticed mold growing inside of the clear ball!  I yanked it out of my baby's hand - who was biting it.  I did handwash it from time to time (not in the dishwasher) since it's plastic.  I wish Sassy's quality control is better.  I would've exchanged for another, but I also noticed that my little one sometimes would hit her own head with the ball by accident when she waves her hands around while holding the toy.  So I returned it.	
1. 	Overall I love this mobile.  The music is great quality, although i wish it had an even lower volume setting.  the remote works great and what i love the most is that the box can be set to activate the music manually, or that the music can only be activated by the remote.  my daughter loves the animals and it is really very stimulating in color design and motion.  the reason i took one star away is that on each arm there are 3 shapes that slide around, making too much sound for my daughter.  it startled her every time when she was about to fall asleep, so i took a rubberband and fixed it around the shapes so they wouldn't slide anymore.  since then, it works like a charm.  i have not had any technical problems with it so far, 3 weeks of use, so i keep my fingers crossed.over all it's a very nice mobile, and having two kids, i've been through quite a few, still haven't found the perfect one, but this is the closest i've found to perfect.	
1. 	We use this on all of our outings with our 18 month old.  I love the no spill an ease of use for my little one.	
- 1	I got this sponge bath thing hoping to replace the bulky hard blue bathtub but turns out that this thing is just awkward for newborns. I put this in my kitchen sink (a large one) and put nice warm water just filled up enough to be comfortable. I used it with my newborn (less than a month old) and the water got cold ultra fast, the sponge took forever to dry, was heavy and the incline was weird for my newborn. I think I will try it again when he gets a little older but for little tiny babies,....not so much. It's sitting in storage.	
- 1	I'm sure it would be fine if all you want is to let your child sit in the carseat with a damp bathing suit... however, if accident protection is what you're after, this is useless. I have a Britax, and my daughter's first accident in her car seat leaked right through, wetting the cover underneath and the middle seatbelt material. I ended up having to remove the cover to wash it, which is exactly the hassle I was trying to avoid in the first place. Very irritating. I just ordered the Kiddopotamus Deluxe instead. Wish me luck. ;)	
1. 	The only toilet lock I could find that works with toilet seats that are not flat however, my 2-year-old has opened it when she pulls hard enough.	
1. 	I've seen these before, but never really gave them much thought. When I took my 15 month old son to the doctor for his latest check-up, they had a similar version of this in the office...he was absolutely enthralled with it. Since we had to go to Wal-mart afterwards, I figured I'd check to see if they sold something similar...that's where I found this (much cheaper I might add).For such a simple toy, my son just loves it. He's sitting in the middle of the living room playing with it as I type this. His favorite is the bead coaster on top, but he also really likes the abacus on the side. I absolutely recommend this toy (or even something similar if this particular one doesn't interest you). Even when he gets tired of it and moves on to something else, he always comes back to this cube. I'm VERY happy with this purchase.	
- 1	This was great, until we put it in the dishwasher.  It says top shelf dishwasher safe, but after running it through the the temperature sticker started coming off and the top 'cap' no longer held in place.  One of the benefits of this over a bowl is that the lid keeps the bottle being warmed from floating out of the water.  This helps the bottle warm faster since all of the milk is submerged.  We tried contacting Firt Years to get the top replaced and were told they were not able to and to return it to the store.  Surprised at the hassle and the warmer now serves limited purpose.	
- 1	Tried these a few years back and hated them. I thought they were a pain, hard to clean, and just overall a bad idea. With twins, its much easier to just cut fruits up in small bite size pieces and let them use their hand and eye coordination to try picking them up off high chair tray.	
1. 	I absolutely love this stuff. It keeps our daughter perfectly clean while having absolutely no negative effects on her skin. We have a routine of bath-time every night before feeding and sleeping, and this cleanser makes bath time fun every time. It rinses away super-easily, with absolutely no effort involved. This is important, because our daughter has a lot of baby rolls with folds in her neck and arms and legs. It smells a bit strong, but the smell is from the natural ingredients they use, it's not an added fragrance. And once my daughter is rinsed, there's no residual smell at all. I'm so happy we found this cleanser.	
1. 	This pad can be used for anything! I use one under my sheets in the area my son likes to spit up on, under him during &quot;let's give that touschi some air&quot; time, and as a take along for diaper changes...no one's going to tell you but they secretly don't want you to change your baby on their bed or sofa! Go figure.Also, unlike their cousin the 'Quilted Crib Mattress Pad' it doesn't pill up enough to care.	
1. 	This seat is exactly what I wanted. It's pretty durable and I feel comfortable with my son sitting on it. I think you have to remain realistic in your expectations when you are buying a potty seat that holds a child, yet folds small enough to put in your purse. The grip on the bottom is great, the handles are great, and it lips over the edge on the toilet enough that it protects hands from touching the toilet. I think it fits better on oblong toilets, which is what most public toilets are. If there is any down side, it would be the open part on the front...don't expect a splash guard. You will have to help a little boy point things down into the toilet. I don't find it to be a problem. The hole is not as big as a standard potty seat, so it might take a little assistance adjusting for what your child needs to do in the potty. It folds dirty side in and comes with a giant ziplock bag so you don't contaminate your purse. I keep a mini Lysol with me to spray it until I get home. I'm very very pleased with this purchase!	
- 1	Firstly Amazon sent me what seems to be aused productAside from that, there really are no controls on this. Just one button. So you can really change speeds to vary the consistency very much. Also I realized that for making batches of baby food, its better to use a full size blender that makes a batch that can last a week or more. This thing is tiny!	
- 1	I tried to wear this as much as possible but it rides up and interfered with breastfeeding. I'm disappointed to have wasted the cash on this. It might work for some women but I'm 5'8 but a bit short waisted. Nothing extreme of course but maybe that's why it rode up on me and I had to take it off to nurse each time...which can be annoying when you've got a newborn who is constantly eating. You definitely couldn't wear it out unless under a bulky sweatshirt. Not comfortable but I wouldn't have minded that if I could have nursed with it. So I don't know if it really works since I couldn't wear it consistently enough to say.	
1. 	I opened this bed up to assemble it and noticed right away that the Oak finish on one part was defective, it looked like there was excess finish that dried on there from the company.The reason why I'm still giving this bed 5 stars is because this company is amazingly fantastic, I called them up and explained the defect and they are sending replacement parts, no questions asked and no hassle.I still set this bed up in the meantime, it is extremely easy to assemble, looks fantastic despite that one area and I highly recommend this toddler bed!I really honestly believe that my bed being defective with the finish is not the norm.	
1. 	The lift out laundry bag is a great idea. The only problem - one washing and the hooks of the bag shredded - then, after only 5 months of use, the seam split open. I sewed the seam but you can't do anything short of replacing the hooks (they're fabric). Still, at 19.99, I didn't expect perfection. It looks good and the bag, as I said, is very handy.	
1. 	I have had other baby carriers with my two older children and this one is definitely my favorite. It was easy to use and felt very sturdy. Unfortunately, my son didn't like being in it, but he's not much of a snuggler so I'm guessing it is his personality and not the carrier that is the issue. :) I'd recommend this item to other parents.	
1. 	I think it's cute. The dial controls the sound very well. I like the several options of noises although the whale one is just weird. I love that there are two timer lengths. It hooks on our crib easily. I would buy this as a gift.

- 1	OK, this thing took about 7 minutes to assemble and did not require the instructions. It's that easy. The problem - unlike many other walkers, the wheels are small and have little clearance. When on a carpet, they just don't move that well.  On a hard floor, they're perfect. The baby can hardly move on the carpet, and the slightest threshold stops the walker in it's tracks.It has height adjustments (the accordion looking supports) that double as the bouncer. Only not that well. A real bouncer works much better.  This also leans forward when bouncing and moves around.  Tried it once as a bouncer and never again.  Yea, it has a cute factor.  If you're not going to use this on carpets, and don't plan on using the bouncer feature, then it's OK.Quality - So so.  The windshield pops off easily, and the entire thing feels pretty flimsy.  NOT worth the money - at all!	
- 1	This pillow must be designed for women with very short torsos.  I find that if I try to curl it around me, it feels like it is attacking me.  The pregnant woman shown in the photo fits neatly into the inner curve but I wonder if she is holding the top in place, because when I tried to use it that manner it would curl under my neck.The cover is scratchy,  you really cannot put your face on it.  So you will need to add the cost of a cover to this if you are going to use it for sleeping.I breastfed two kids, and used a U shaped pillow at times. I can see that this might be better for breastfeeding, since you can get a double &#8220;height&#8221; by wrapping it around yourself.  However, it is a fight to get it into that position, and you cannot just get up easily with it wrapped around you.It is much harder than a regular pillow and also thinner than it looks in the photo.  I also washed the slip cover to see if that would soften it up, but it did not. And getting the slipcover back on was a monumental struggle, like wrestling a reluctant snake into a tight jacket.  It actually reminded me of a topology problem and took almost 20 minutes to accomplish.  This means if you use it to prop up your baby and he/she spits up on it you will have to face trying to get the clean cover back on.Back to my full length body pillow, this one is just physically too hard, too scratchy and fights me too much.	
1. 	used this for my son once it got cold, kept him warm and swaddled all night. love it. much better than tying up blankets	
1. 	This has the look and feel as the more expensive security blanket brand My Blankee. Its excellent quality, and will surely be a part of our family for years.	
- 1	I loved these at first but started to realize that the Velcro digs into my son causing red rashes also the Velcro no longer holds very well. There constantly falling off after a few months of use.  I only use these when all my others are dirty. Sad cause they started out great.	
1. 	If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day (maybe 2 or 3) this is a great pump. I didn't know how to use it at first but after calling Medela's customer support line I was able to use it easily. I didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout the day (Your hands would hurt).But other than that I think is a great pump for the price.	
1. 	This playyard was a great investment for us. I do not understand how a one year old was moving it around... Our kid never cried in it and she loved pulling up on it and cruising. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, sounds like nothing will ever please them!	
- 1	My daughter is 3 months and weighs about 14 punds.  But she is tall and thin.  She is too small for it and doesnt like to slumped over.  Maybe it will work better when she has head control?	
1. 	I was hesitant to buy this item because of its mixed reviews, but we are on a budget and it seemed like the best value of all the changing tables I researched.When I first opened the packaging, I was overwhelmed by all of the pieces...I usually enjoy putting things like this together, but this item did take a lot of time and patience! The directions aren't entirely clear either, so I had to go back and re-do a few steps. My husband was out of town, but I was too anxious to wait for his help, so I assembled it by myself (at 7 months preggo!) It didn't feel sturdy at first and I was about to think that all of my hard work had been for nothing, but once I nailed on the backing, it stopped wiggling and moving back and forth.Overall, I think it's a beautiful piece and I'm very pleased with the way it looks in our nursery. I still have 7 weeks to go before Baby is here, but I'm certain it will be sturdy enough for her into her toddler years. If you don't mind spending a little time and elbow grease putting it together, it's worth it!	
- 1	My husband is incredibly adept at putting the hardest stuff together, and while it only took him 2 hours to build this dresser, there are a million teeny, tiny parts to use. I would not suggest this item to anyone who sucks at putting together things, like I am.It's a really pretty dresser/change station, and matches our crib but the drawers are not solid wood, they are made of flimsy particle board. Boo on that. The wood itself is also pretty chip as there are dings and scratches in it just from shipping.I wouldn't have been disappointed looking at and maybe buying something else. There was one piece that was broken so we have to call and get that replaced. The changing table part doesn't fit a standard changing pad so that kind of sucks too.PROS- It looks prettyCONS- Cheap material, broken parts, hard to put together, changing table top is small.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	
- 1	I bought this after reading several reviews noting how good this product is for babies with reflux. I used it for a while, but honestly my baby did not seem too comfortable in it. For one, she did not like the motion, so I just used it as a stationary sleeping place for her. Everytime she moved, I'd hear the plastic parts of the glider making noise. Even worse, she would try to wiggle herself out of it, so the rocking noise would go on for most of the night!The seat is really just a fabric sling, without much padding to it, so it wasn't very cozy. It has become an expensive cat bed, unfortunately.I'd recommend the Leachco Podster instead if you have a reflux baby. It provides a softer sleeping spot and enough elevation to help with the reflux.	
- 1	Even though these helped with pain, I couldn't wear them because the pressure made me leak so much. They've been sitting in a drawer for months. I was really disappointed	
- 1	How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??!  This pillow reeks with fumes, I think from both the plastic packaging and the foam in the pillow itself.  Please do not buy this pillow for use near your baby.	
- 1	My 7-month daughter doesn't like this teether.  It is too hard, she just has no interest in it.  I tried to put it into her mouth, then she just refused. Wasting money :&lt;	
1. 	We love this chair (we also had the infant package)We received it as a gift and have used it since our daughter was 5 months old...she will be 2 in 2 weeks...it is the perfect size for her, and our room.  She now has full access to the chair, and can get on and off herself for mealtime.  It was very easy to put together, and has a multitude of adjustments in the seat and footrest to grow with baby, it is very durable...seemingly knick proof, easy to clean...there are a few nooks and crannies which get a little crumb traffic, but easy to get with a vacuum hose.  The cusions also wash and wear beautifully.  In conclusion, we highly reccomend this chair, the only drawback is the hefty pricetag, but a chair to last through childhood.	
1. 	We bought Playtex bottles for the first 2 kids, and just in time for the new baby, we received this set free from Amazon. My wife is a Family Nurse Practitioner and she considers this type of bottles the best for our kids. The main reason? When the baby drinks her milk out of the bottle, pressure builds up inside. With regular bottles, it is very easy for the silicone/plastic nipple to contract so it makes up for the milk that was taken out. That in turn makes it hard for the baby to continue drinking. One solution would be to constantly turn the regular bottle or just take it out and pull the nipple out once in a while. With this Playtex set, you do not have to worry about it. It is very convenient and the nipple does not get stuck to the bottle. The only potential downside is having more pieces to clean - as each bottle has 2 extra pieces to help with the pressure flow on the bottom. This is definitely recommended. For kids 1-year and older, we prefer thePlaytex 3 Pack BPA Free Ventaire Crystal Clear Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce, as they have a smaller diameter and easier to hold.	
- 1	I am so upset about this product!! It mixes very well BUT and its a BIG BUT!!!....I noticed that the plastic was shredding along the shaft and probably getting into the baby's formula! God only knows if and how much my baby has ingested the plastic shreds. Its very fine shreds so you wont notice it unless you really look. Its from the friction of the shaft twisting against the top hole. Bad design....doesnt matter if this thing is BPA free when the plastic shreds off!!!	
1. 	So easy to use and works well.  Not bulky, easy to install, soft and comfortable.  Works with our Britax B-Agile.  7 month old enjoyed it from the get go.  Versatile.  We've used it in 50 degree to 30 degree weather.  We can cover our daughter up almost completely and add a hat so that she's very toasty, but she can pull her hands out or tuck them in depending on her comfort.  We fold up the stroller with this attached.	
- 1	Sent it back. Didn't work for me at all. Baby couldn't suck milk. Not a good product at all. Thankful that Amazon returns are easy.	
1. 	If you want to nurse discretely, this is the way to go. It has a adjustable neckline that allows you to see baby as s/he nurses, a build in burp cloth at the edges and provides adequate coverage.	
1. 	You can't imagine how wonderfully comfortable this design & quality of its contents. I ordered for daughter, 1st preg @ 18 wks. She loves it so she insisted I try it. Was worth the cost & wait.Was supportive all around yet cushion was like sleeping on marshmallow, not lumpy, didn't crush/flatten.  Want to buy more as gifts for senior parents (both back & neck injuries never recovered pain free) and for 2 sons who work 7 days wk, quality of sleep should improve.Neck & head pillow sections felt perfect, front & back, thigh, hip, leg support same. Suggest pregnant women order early, 1st trimester to help with extreme fatigue.  Covering wasn't scratchy & didn't feel seam. Will order pillowcase now that we've tried.These would be great for slumber party! Could have fallen asleep right away, hope to buy 1 for me too.	
1. 	With previous children who hated sleeping on their backs, I used an old boppy to cuddle around them, but that only worked until they could wiggle around too much for it to be safe. Now I see this style, which is a great idea. One thing I noticed- most people complained about there being no washable cover. Walmart offers one that does say it has one, so you might want to check that one out too. I think it comes in Jungle print.	
- 1	In the exhausting frenzy of buying baby stuff, sifting through reviews, shopping for price and receiving advice whether requested or not, this is one purchase I wish I took a little more time with.It folds up super easy and packs up well. I like that you can have the sleeping level higher for smaller babies. The assembly was as easy as can be expected. Like all of these types of items it's all about going slow and not jumping ahead in steps. The construction seems fine and I expect it to hold up for a long time.I like a lot of things about this item, but there is one flaw that is a daily irritant that is not present on other models I have seen in the stores since getting this one. The changing table is not level when the baby is placed on it. The design has it cantilevered out over the main surface, but it sags and slants considerably with any weight. This means the baby rolls inward. I tried several ways to address this and have found the easiest solution is rolling a hand towel up and putting it between the corner of the changing table and the top bar on the play yard. This works fine, but it falls out frequently and is only necessary due to a bad design. Others I have seen have the changing table supported much better.It is not a safety hazard, the build quality is sound, the ease of breaking it down is probably as good as any, but this one design flaw is enough of a disappointment I would not buy this model again. I can't recommend it unless you are not planning to use the changing table.	
1. 	The Sleep Sheep is now a necessity for sleep at our house.  The soothing sounds that the sheep produces effectively elliminates the noises that would potentially wake our baby allowing us to carry on normal routine household tasks while our baby sleeps.	
1. 	We love this. Although it is a bit slow (about 15 minutes), it is very valuable when traveling.We bought this when on a roadtrip and have had no regrets.	
1. 	Like a lot of previous reviewers, we started out with a more conventional high chair. I'd wanted to try a hook on chair before, but when you are a new mom and there are all of these images of standard high chairs everywhere it's difficult to consider other options.I bought the Chicco Caddy and brought it home. It was easy to attach to our table, and comfortable for our 2 month old. He really seems to enjoy sitting at the table, and being a part of the family when we eat. It's very handy to put him in while I do work in the kitchen as well.Can we talk about what a huge space saver this is? My gosh! It folds up and can be tucked away in a cabinet. Ta-da! I can't understand why anyone would go with a standard high chair!We have taken the Chicco Caddy with us multiple times to friends' homes and restaurants as well. It is very easily portable and a cinch to attach to most any table. There is no unfamiliar high chair to wrangle our son into, and he has his own comfortable spot in a new place.One issue I had initially was that there is a space between the table and the edge of the Chicco Caddy. Food will fall through that space, and get all over the fabric edge of the Caddy. Minimal clean up, but still kind of an annoyance. I purchased a Summer Infant Tiny Diner, and have found that to resolve the issue perfectly. It functions as a little placemat and over laps the space between the table and the Caddy. The food trough catches a great deal of what would normally end up in our son's lap.The two products work beautifully together, so I recommend getting a Tiny Diner to go with your Chicco Caddy.**Update** Our son is now 13 months old and pretty feisty. He has plenty of room to move in the Caddy and will use it if not strapped in securely! Some users have complained about cleaning difficulty and I sympathize. The first two times I laundered it, I had a difficult time getting the fabric separated from the frame, and then reassembling. I think a learning curve coupled with the fabric softening a bit has made it much easier to disassemble and assemble. A year after the initial purchase I am still happy with this product. We use it 2-3 times a day, and it travels with us often.Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Green	
1. 	In terms of absorption these are the best pads I have tried (out of 3 different brands), but they could use some contouring and if you wear them in a thin bra plan on layering up your shirts unless your advertising that your breasts leak.	
1. 	My husband and I loved this when it was warm outside.  When it was chilly, we stopped using it.  Not really sure if it was worth having still. We used the backpack a lot more and for more months.	
- 1	These aren't round. they have a straight sewn edge at the top so they don't fit as nicely inside the cover and they bend inward instead of stay rounded. stuck with it now.	
1. 	Medela is always great! Price is little bit high but it is worth it! I would recommend it to everybody!	
1. 	So far, for our newborn to two months journey, this tub has worked great. We have used it with sling only, which is great to have, washable and easy to put/remove.No leaks, great purchase - fits our standard kitchen sink nicely	
- 1	I have a couple of sets and the lids aren't interchangeable. They are hard to get on tight. I just don't trust them. Gladware seems to be better and a lot cheaper.	
1. 	Bought this for the price and quantity. It's works great. It's very low profile so it's hardly noticeable. It's somewhat difficult to remove first few times but it become a bit easier after that.	
1. 	I love that I can see him while nursing, which is the big advantage of this product over any type of blanket.  It makes it easier for latching on and adjusting him when needed.  Plus this nursing cover is pretty big so you get great coverage.  I would highly recommend this product.	
- 1	This is one of those baby purchases that you make and regret afterwards.  My baby didn't take to it at all. She will not hold on to it and she's 6.5 mo old.  Total waste of money	
1. 	At five months old, this is one of my son's very favorite toys and it has been for about the last two months. Every time he gets bored, we find a new way to play with it.Besides the obvious ways to use this toy, we have also:- arranged the keyboard perpendicular to the floor so that he can use it in his bouncy seat- taken off the legs entirely so that he can sit in our lap and play with it (he likes to sit, but can't on his own yet)- taken off the legs and used it on the floor for tummy time (his current favorite)There are also three musical levels (infant, sitter, and toddler) and two musical types for six different settings. We mix them up for variety. Some of them are more annoying than others, but none are two bad considering how much enjoyment he gets out of this toy.Highly recommended!	
1. 	This product works so well on my baby/toddler's sensitive skin.  It also smells SO good!  The light, sweet scent stays in his hair for a full 24 hours.  A little goes a long way with this product, and lasts for months, (even though I bathe my son every night.) I love it, and plan to use this product on my son, (and my next child!) for a very long time!	
- 1	So apparently, the new ones don't have arms, which is a plus. But I have the old kind that does have arms, so that's what I'm reviewing.First of all, the highchair feels very cheap. I'm not quick to say that about things, but with this, it's true. The tray is a pain to get off and put on. I thought I'd use this as a booster, but I can't, because the arms don't let it slide under the table. The only plus is that the fabric is easy to take off and wash, and it's held up very well.I'm about to get my son an actual booster seat, so I will be storing this at my dad's house for when we visit. Honestly, with the next baby, I will probably just get a regular high chair.	
- 1	I should have known it wasn't going to work when I opened the package and it had velcro as the main fastening method. I followed the instructions and put both wedges put on my double pane window. If you are a 3 year old, you probably won't be able to force it open but with any little bit of strength and shove, it comes right off the velcro. I wish I could return it but I threw away all the packaging. Maybe I can use it for my little girl's playhouse to keep its window secure. I just went to Home Depot and bought one of those hand screw metal locks for $2 and it's 100% better than this crap.	
- 1	This comes in two pieces: the tray and the bottom piece that attaches to the Bumbo seat.  I don't care what anyone says - the tray does not attach to the bottom half of this product!  There is NO give in the plastic, so attachment is nearly impossible.  Trust me, we tried!  It looked good in theory, but since the snap doesn't work, I wasn't comfortable using this.  I bet you can get away with jamming the tray on and it probably won't pop off the bottom piece of plastic, but I wouldn't risk it, especially if you have a wiggly baby.I had to return it.  I was sorry to do so because my baby likes sitting in her Bumbo and wants to have toys.  I had hoped the tray would mean less time picking up toys from the floor and having to wash them off.  Oh well! *sigh*	
- 1	I thought this would be a good idea to use since my son loves to walk on his own, but I just couldn't get the nerve up to put it on him. The strap looked as if it was too ruff and would cause redness on his wrist.	
- 1	The squares of velcro sewn on the inside of the diaper's back have pointy sharp plastic edges that almost immediately curl up and poke the baby's lower back.  I've found the same outcome on other velcro diapers.  It is a shame they can't redesign this part of the diaper cause otherwise this is a solid product.I too find snaps infinitely preferable to velcro.  Fuzzi Bunz and Knickernappies have given us the best performance.Your mileage may vary!  The performance of cloth diapers varies not only on their inherent quality but also on how well a particular diaper fits your kid's body shape.  We had leaks, terrible leaks, with Knickernappies until one day, they didn't leak anymore.  our conclusion:  the child grew into just the size and shape that was perfect for that diaper.	
- 1	You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.	
1. 	Last pregnancy I ordered the &#34;Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Leachco-Belly-Contoured-Pillow-Ivory/dp/B0002E7DIQ/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1390183256&sr;=1-2) since I thought having a symmetrical pillow would be easier. It was pretty comfortable, but even on my king size bed, it took up a ton of room. It was hot, and I felt like there was this giant divider between me and my husband. I also felt like the top of it dug into my shoulder - and I was never quite sure where to put my bottom arm (I'm a terrible side sleeper. Hence the need for the pillow.) It also seemed to lose &#34;fluff&#34; by the end of a few months.This time I decided to go with the &#34;Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow&#34; - and I'm hooked! I haven't used it long enough to see how the &#34;fluff factor&#34; works out, but my concerns about not having a &#34;symmetrical pillow&#34; have been alleviated. It's super easy to use, intuitive, and takes up so much less space. I love the support, it's isn't hot like the other pillow - and it allows me to snuggle with my husband if he's on the right side - and added perk!I feel way less 'isolated' in bed with this pillow. Would definitely recommend.	
- 1	I bought this for my 8 month old but it is extremely narrow. She can barely fit when she is all the way on the backrest without feeling too crowded. Also the table doesn t easily fix so the only position I can make it stay it's the maximum so the baby is even more crowded. I wouldn t recommended this product	
- 1	We use the Munchkin nursery projector and sound system for our baby every night all night long. We are planning on going on a trip, so I purchased this (thankfully well in advance) to make it easier for travel for $9.99 at a retail store (plus my 20% off coupon i spent $8 on it). I put batteries in the first night (the heart beat noise which we use was different from the one in the munchkin system - i thought all heartbeats noises would be universal) and it lasted through the night, but when i went to turn it on the next day for nap it wouldn't turn on. The next night I put a fresh set of batteries in it & this time I made it through one night of sleeping (11 hours) and two nap (1 hour each) before the batteries were done. As much as i was hoping this would be helpful on vacation if i have to pack a fresh set of batteries for each night and a few extra sets for the day naps, between the space and the weight i might as well just take the one my baby is used to. I was very disappointed with how quickly it used up batteries. I could have gotten my baby used to different noises, and like a lot of the other features it had, and loved the price, but i will go broke buying batteries for this thing!	
- 1	I wanted to like this because I'm all about my baby having a clean nose, but the rounded tips make it hard to see what I'm getting at in his nose. The rounded tips are a safety feature; I understand, but I just can't seem to work around them. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe my baby's nostrils are too small; he's currently 6-months-old, but I've been trying to use this since he was a newborn. Anyway, it still sits in his little hygiene bag, but I don't use it at all. Instead, I either just use my pinky or theBaby Vac Nasal Aspirator 2012 Modelaspirator (with saline) to get those boogers out.	
1. 	We bought this gate to block off a large section of space right before the beginning of the staircase. For the price it works great. It was very flimsy at first, but we followed the other reviews and bolted it on two sides in the middle to steady it. We have had no problems with it & it holds up to our daughter standing and shaking on it! Definitely recommend. The best large-area gate I have seen at this price.	
- 1	Since it arrived, this chair has had a problem with squeaking. I read about that problem on another review of this, but since so many people rated it with 4&5 stars I went ahead and purchased it. Besides just squeaking, it has other major issues. The hardware (nuts & bolts) fall off with rocking. I have tightened them myself as tight as I possibly can with the appropriate tools, and so has my husband. After about 20-30 days they fall off again. Those parts are small enough for a baby to swallow and I routinely find them on the floor in the baby's room.This chair is just poorly made as far as the squeaking (which is loud and wakes the baby during rocking), and with parts falling off of it.I did not want to pay postage to return this chair.It's only positive points are that it is comfortable as far as padding and the side pockets are nice.I am 5'10 and 160lbs, so I doubt my weight is breaking the chair or making it squeak.The squeaking can temporarily be stopped with WD-40, but I must apply it every 3-4 days otherwise the squeak comes back.I am highly disappointed with the overall quality of the chair we received.	
- 1	This product did not stop or even slow the flow of milk from my wife. It soaked through and leaked within 10-20 minutes. She tried it two times and then threw them away. Not worth the cost. Since I was buying for my wife and had no idea which pad would work, I also got the &#34;Charlie Banana Nursing Pads&#34; and they were much, much better and well worth the slight cost increase!	
1. 	I gave it 5 stars because it does exactly what it's supposed to and performed as promised--it's super-easy to swaddle the baby nice and tight in here and the velcro holds as it should.But we can't use it anymore because it is HOT in there!  We keep the house cool at night and certainly weren't putting any covers on him or anything, but our son was alomst roasting.  However, we live in Florida, so it's never actually cold outside.  I'm guessing that this would be great in household trying to keep heating costs down during a Minnesota winter or something.Just beware: if it's not cold in your house, you'll have a very hot sweaty baby after a few hours sleeping in the microfleece version, even if he's wearing only a diaper in there.  Might want to get the cotton instead.	
1. 	It took me a while before I was using formula and the dr brown bottles will leak if you are trying to shake the formula in the bottles. However, these caps are perfect! Just screw one on and shake the bottle to mix the formula. No mess, no leaks.	
- 1	&#34;Fits most faucets&#34;... but this did not fit ours. Its cute, but we won't be able to use it. Too bad, its the only faucet protector to fit our baby's rubber ducky themed bathroom.	
- 1	I should have listened to the other review. The tray is way to far and my baby has to pull himself to get whatever's on it	
1. 	I bought this set for my two year old, so we could work on matching and begin introducing colors and textures.  He loves these cards, and they really have helped him learn both his colors as well as some additional vocabulary.  Fitting the two pieces together makes it a little more interactive for him than plain flash cards or matching games.  While this is not an everyday toy, it does keep him fascinated for some time when we pull it out. I also like that some of the cards use textures and patterns, as these concepts are more difficult to introduce to a toddler. I have a six month old and she already enjoys looking at the pictures while he works-I look forward to her turn to match!	
1. 	This has saved us many a sleepless or fussy day/nights. Our baby loved to be swaddled in this and we've given as a gift to about 5 of our friends. Some babies don't like to have their hands tied down so consider that before you purchase but our baby was Houdini and seemed to always want her hands in the bundle. This was the only one she was unable to get out of.	
- 1	I bought this diaper and two different brands for comparison. This is my least favorite. The sewn-in insert does not go all the way up the front so it would work ok for a girl but my little boy, even when pointed down, has had this diaper leak all over him. I never leave diapers on for more than two hours, but this diaper doesn't last that long. It's best if you turn it inside out when washing it, otherwise you'll never get the smell out. I am not sure how you are supposed to strip this diaper once a month since you are not supposed to strip the covers. I do not recommend this all-in-one diaper. I suggest buying pocket diapers.	
- 1	We bought this for our second child in hopes we could move off bottles faster. Tried it at 4 months and flow was entirely too fast. Tried again at 6 months and flow is still too fast for her. Since this is meant for beginning drinkers the flow should be regulated like a slow flow nipple.	
- 1	I got this as a gift for someone and I was embarrassed to give it.  The frame is cheap and the material for the prints isn't great either.  I found a similar product at the discovery store that was way better.  It is not worth the money.	
- 1	My daughter has the tiniest nose you have ever seen, but this aspirator tip is so small there is no suction at all. it can't create any kind of a seal at the infant's nasal opening (nurses will say don't put it up the baby's nostrils). I threw it in the garbage. You are better off with the one they give away at the hospital. Save your money on this product.	
- 1	I'm very disappointed in these sheets. They fit nice and snug and are very soft for baby until I washed them in lukewarm water and tumble dried them. Now they won't fit my mini crib mattress AT ALL. useless. Waste of money.  I have a few more I got as gifts so next time I'll wash them in cold and line dry so maybe I can get more than one use.	
1. 	These bottles are great to use when traveling because you don't have to pack a bunch of bottles, just slip the drop in pouches in the diaper bag, with 1 bottle and several nipples and go!  However,  to use them everyday would cost more than washing bottles, and it is something else that ends up in the landfill.The refills are roughly $8.00 for 100 which is an expense you don't incur with regular wash and use bottles.  Just a thought.The insert collapses as the baby drinks, so there is less air in the bottle for the baby to swallow.	
1. 	We didn't use bottles much early on - I breastfed exclusively for 13 1/2 months because early attempts with pumping and bottles were a dismal failure - so we ended up using these bottles late in the game and can't really say if or how these would work with a newborn.  But we did try a few bottles... here's what we hated and why we love these.We tried the classic Playtex nursers with the bag. They were OK but the bag part seems wasteful and you still end up with a bunch of parts to wash so what is the point? Also the classic Playtex nipples just seem weird to me. We had some success with the orthodontic one but nothing but problems with the flat and round tops ones that are supposed to pop out when baby latches on.We tried Avent and HATED those. They leak around the neckband and even the number 1 newborn nipple flowed MUCH too fast for my baby. Only tried these because they came with my Avent pump which I also hated.  Then a maybe even bigger problem with the Avent is, the nipple can be pushed down inside the bottle...  all the way down inside, so it actually detaches from the ring.  At that point your child is free to dump milk all over himself or whatever else he pleases.We started to use these around the time I really wanted to get my baby to sleep through the night, around 10-11 months I guess. I would have my husband go in with a bottle of water or milk instead of me going in to nurse. Now I use them if he needs a night time milk bottle, which is pretty rare, or if it is day time and I can't find a clean sippy cup or he is, for whatever reason, demanding a bottle.  These bottles are really great. There are very few parts to wash and the parts there are wash easily. We have had no problems with leaks. My baby is able to drink smoothly from the bottle because of how well it is vented. I love the angled aspect of the bottle, makes it easier to hold the baby semi-upright and still tilt the bottle to get all the milk out.Curious toddlers cannot dislodge the nipple.And... the colors are pretty. :-)If we have another baby, we will definately use these from the beginning (assuming I have better pumping success...)Make sure to get the NATURAL SHAPE bottles/nipples, not the regular VentAire.	
1. 	So far these are the best I have found. Though they do have one downfall. After weeks or so of abuse from 4 boys ranging  from 1-5 they eventually start to leak. I do wash them in the dishwasher and my kids are in no way easy on them. But they leak proof for a while which is the best yet. We have tried over 10 different brands and so far these are passing. I would give them a 5 star rating except that I cannot find anywhere to buy just lids!!! The cups are insulated and so cute. We have all of the different themes... boy related anyways... no princess stuff here!	
1. 	This is great for on the go!  And your tray is always clean!	
- 1	I wasn't expecting much for the price and you get what little you pay for. I do like the fact that there is a little memo section on each page to write something in for each picture. But I am mainly disappointed with the fact that theb a b y on the cover was glued on crooked, so it makes it look even more cheap. Not worth paying the shipping to return it though.	
1. 	I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier.	
- 1	Not a fan of these. They're very rough and give my baby redness, so we're stuck with 175 liners we don't know what to do with. Would have preferred if like other companies they sold them as 100, so I could have decided and saved money. They do the job they're supposed to do but at the cost of hurting my little one's bum, so no go.	
1. 	I was very nervous about nursing in public and this nursing cover really helps out. Its much cooler than a blanket and it covers me and the baby enough to be comfortable. The wire around the top really helps to view your baby continuously. I would just suggest you try to use it at home once in a while so your baby will get used to it and not have a fit when he/she is in public with this cover over him. Plus, you'll get so many compliments on how nice and modern it is!	
1. 	This bib does exactly what I wanted it to. Keeps all the food my 1 year old drops off her pants, it all falls right into the little pouch. It doesn't seem to bother her that it's plastic (FYI: It's not a hard plastic). She fought it a little at first but got used to it very quickly. super easy to wash clean too! This bib has really lightened my laundry load :)	
- 1	i purchsed this thinking that it can be a good transition to the crib as its flat. i found it much smaller then expeted and my 4 months old coudnt fit in it.i ordered borwn but the color was army green, it not rocking properly and the baby hates.	
1. 	My son has had acid reflux since he was a few days old, and after dealing with 2 months of severe spitting up I finally saw an ad in a magazine and bought these bottles.  What a lifesaver they have been!  Within days, he was spitting up less and had less gas too.  It was such a noticeable difference that it had to be the bottles.  I could tell using Dr. Brown's that my son wasn't taking in as much air as he was with the Avent bottles we had been using.  I do suggest, however, that you read carefully and follow the directions included with these bottles.  For example, if you are going to put them in a bottle warmer, you MUST take the nipple off first or the liquid becomes piping hot and even explodes through the top.  Other than that, they are very easy to care for.  I thought cleaning them was no more difficult than any other bottles...the extra steps are worth it to me.	
- 1	We got it and returned it. There is no enough space in there and it is not efficient. We ended up getting munchkin plastic organizer shelf which could store much more and it doesn't need precious counter space.	
- 1	I bought this for public toilets for my daughters potty training. It turns out it doesn't remain steady, so as soon as I tried to sit my daughter on the toilet with this it moved and defeat the purpose of using it.	
1. 	They are as I expected and described. Not much more to say about a product that holds snacks for kids.	
- 1	This carrier is awful. I bought it before I knew what kind of carrier was safe for baby I put him in it and he started crying instantly. It is very uncomfortable for the parent as well, and I'm assuming for the baby. It is a &#34;crotch dangler&#34;. Awful..if you're going to baby wear, invest in something that will be comfortable for you AND baby. Cheaper is NOT better. Please don't buy this!!! I won't even give mine away in fear someone will use it and hurt the baby or themselves.	
1. 	I bought this for my baby boy 4 years ago and the blanket/fitted sheet still look like new, even after all the washings. I loved the colors and patterns, it's what attracted me to this bedding set. It's so adorable..I'm expecting a little girl now and if they had this in pink I would so get it for my baby girl, but sadly they don't! Very good quality even after 4 years! =)	
1. 	I don't know what I would have done without these bugs.  They kept my daughter entertained for hours while she was in her infant carseat.  Now that she is in the larger carseat I have found other places to attach them because they are her favorite travelling toy.  This is one toy that I will be saving for her memory box!	
- 1	I purchased a similar crib sheet at a local store a while back and decided to get another sheet (from who I thought was made by the same company), but this one is not the same quality. The seams don't line up with the mattress so it doesn't fit properly and several seams actually lay several inches over onto the mattress itself, making it look very awkward. It's soft, but very thin. I don't expect it to last long and have only been using it as a back-up sheet when the others are in the wash.	
- 1	This is not as easy to bathe a baby in as it claims. Until your baby can hold up his head it's almost impossible to keep his face from falling into the water - not good! It's very narrow and my 2 month old hates being put in it as he is crammed in with his feet either folded up under his butt or pretzeled into a fetal position. It's almost impossible to clean everywhere you need to because you just can't get in there. Rinsing is not an option unless you suspend him over the bucket and have someone else use the sink squirter, which will kill your back.I can't understand why there are so many positive reviews for this thing. In short it's just ridiculous. Save yourself the $40 bucks (really? for a glorified mop bucket? Sheesh!) and get something like theFisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tubthat you can recline your baby in until they can sit up by themselves. A much better deal at $15 dollars.	
1. 	We used a Stork Craft crib and dresser in our nursery and turned to them again for our son's &#34;big boy&#34; room. These sets are well wrapped and arrive safely, and are relatively easy to put together (maybe not quite as nice as IKEA). We definitely used screwdrivers and drills, not the included allen wrench. :) Overall it looks nice, but I'm disappointed that the finish of the various pieces doesn't match very well. (One drawer front, for example, is noticeably lighter than the others, and a few others had flaws in the finish that were clearly not due to shipping.) The drawers feel a little loose when you open and close them with one hand, as if they're not quite set on the rails well. (Obviously this could be user error when putting it together as well, but we didn't have the same problem with the other Stork Craft dresser.) Finally, the wall-mount (critical for a toddler's room) doesn't appear to be very sturdy and could potentially damage the wall. The high back and wide sides of the dresser top look great but prevent the use of after-market wall mounts that need to attach flush to a side.Still, it's a nice-looking piece of furniture and a great value.	
1. 	This came in the mail pretty quick to me which was great. I ordered this for storing my breast milk that I will be pumping at work. Its a nice size but I wouldn't think it could hold as much as it says it does. But since I'm just going to be storing milk storage bags in there I'm not worried about it. It comes with a reusable icepack but I'll probably be adding another one in there that way it will be colder in there. But other than that it seems to be a good bag so far.	
1. 	Way easier than wrapping a baby in a blanket.  However, there is research out there that swaddling reduces a baby's rooting reflex so I'm not sure I'll use these on a future baby.	
1. 	This was recommended by a friend, so I brought this to the hospital and switched baby out of the hospital's swaddle into this one.  It's amazing how soon after tucking in that last piece, the baby went from fussy to calm!After one month, we still use this swaddle every night.  I ended up buying another in case one was dirty, because we cannot have bedtime without this.I own this in the beige with green trim, and the giraffe print.  Maybe it's because the giraffe print requires more dye to get its design, but I tend to use the beige one more because it feels softer and stretchier.	
1. 	just the perfect thing to  help tiny cloggy noses. my lil one screams at the site of it but it works!	
1. 	Durable and easy to clean, this is just what i was looking for. If your babe is a climber, be careful because it doesnt' secure to the chair	
- 1	Avent bottles have more BPA than any other leading brand. BPA free brands include Born Free, Nurture Pure, MAM, Green to Grow, Baby Life and Adrini.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)	
- 1	I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed!  It never made it to the changing table.  You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed.  Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it.	
1. 	My wife and I purchased this in preparation for the arrival of our son.  We knew that we needed something to protect the seat when we install his car seat so this set was the solution.  Thus far, it's done the job.	
- 1	I bought a few Avent bottles when I was at a grocery store and had to have a bottle RIGHT then and this was all they had.  I was not disappointed in the quality of the bottle, but I was not overly impressed.  I did not notice a change in my son's spitting up using these bottles, either.The downside of using the Avent system is that, once you commit, you're really committed - the bottles and bottle parts do not fit standard bottles and parts.  I now have a wide variety of bottles and bottle parts, and the Avent bottles sit largely unused because I cannot mix and match the parts.  Who has time to search for the right parts when their baby is hungry and crying?	
- 1	Pros:1. Very soft, good for baby's teething. My baby loves to chew it :)Cons:1. Price is on the high side2. The item got an odd smell with it3. Color faded pretty fast4. Bits can be chewed off by baby, probably swallowed by baby too!	
1. 	We are now using this tub for our 2nd baby and I absolutely love it!  For the first 2-3 weeks the baby is home we put the tub in our kitchen sink (large, single basin) and used the &#34;sling&#34; to carefully wash the baby and avoid getting the belly button & umbilical cord wet.  The sling does this well because the baby sits in the water but is not submerged.  Once the umbilical cord falls out and the baby is a little more steady, I remove the sling and use the &#34;newborn&#34; side of the tub.  You definitely have to stay right with the baby because they can tip to the side of slide down when not being held due to limited head control.  However, I think it gives the baby more water coverage which they seem to like and find soothing before bedtime.  As the baby gets bigger, I move this to the bathtub instead of the sink which allows for more splashing & playtime.2 features I really like, in addition to the newborn sling.1) The drain hole is very convenient for quickly letting water out.2) The storage area at the end is great for holding soap, wash cloth, etc.I am so glad we opted for this tub.  It's held up really well & I highly recommend.	
1. 	I love this pump!  I used to have an Avent manual pump, but switched to this Medela pump because it is made from a plastic that is less likely to leach any dangerous chemicals.  It is compatable with most breastmilk storage bottles, including Evenflo glass baby bottles.  I pump straight into the glass bottles so the milk has less exposure to plastic.  The shield is very comfortable and made from a softer material than the Avent.  This pump also has a feature for lighter pumping during milk letdown.  I much prefer manual pumping to electric, and this Medela pump seems to be sturdy and well made.  Don't waste your money on an electric pump or a more expensive manual pump...this one is all you need!	
1. 	My child loves this toy so if it is good for them it is definitely worth 5 stars. On amazon the price is right as well.	
1. 	It is exactly what we were looking for!  It is always good to have back up so you have it when you need it!	
- 1	I am well aware of all the hype surrounding bumpers and I respectfully disagree.These &#34; breathable&#34; ones are super flimsy and didn't even fit our crib- they were loose and bulky- yes we have a standard crib. Also once you witness your baby hitting their head on these- you'll go right back to the regular bumpers! Just monitor your baby and they will be fine.	
- 1	I liked this at first. I admit I bought it because it was cheap. I did tons of research on baby carriers. I wanted something that did front carry (facing in and facing out) and back carry. I added the Beco Baby Gemini to my Amazon baby registry, but no one bought it. So try to save money, I bought this thinking it would be comparable. It is not.I've only used it as front carry, facing in. You have to wait until your baby has head/neck control before you can switch him/her to facing out. My baby has been at that point for a while now, but I barely use the Infantino Flip because it is painful to me and seems uncomfortable to my daughter. The padding near the top clip actually rubs/digs into her cheek. If I make the straps on that clip looser, she seems insecure. After wearing it for 10 minutes, my shoulder is killing me. The padding leaves a lot to be desired.I found I could easily put this on though; clip the back piece then dive into the carrier (put your head in, then put each arm in). It was much faster than the Moby Wrap a friend gave me. It beats lugging the carseat into stores. My baby plus my carseat (Graco snug ride 35) is just too heavy now that she's getting older (and she's only 14 lbs).I broke down and bought the Beco Baby Gemini. I tried a Ergo Baby (original) on in the baby box store. The straps on it were amazing, but I really want to be able to have the option to wear my baby facing outward (the Ergo baby carriers do not allow for this). I can always bring her back facing inward if she is overwhelmed, tired, wants to nurse, etc.You really do get what you pay for. If you don't plan on babywearing, or don't plan on baby wearing very long, this will do. If you want to wear your baby often, spend the money on something better; don't waste it on this.	
- 1	Ordered this for my bottle-refusing 3 month old. It was exactly like the Tomee Tippee bottles she was already refusing. There is nothing special about this bottle. I'm sure it's fine, but I feel it's overpriced.	
- 1	My newborn couldn't get enough of this. He would stare at it and it really looked like water. When he started sitting up he was able to push the button himself to turn it on. As any baby does, he would also pull on it and when I found it in his crib, I took it away. Turns out the latch does not hold well with any pressure. Even the pressure a 5 month old can apply. This is great until your baby can reach it.	
1. 	We got this for when we're traveling in hotels and didn't want to pay excessive nightly charges for cots that are old, rusted out, and sometimes unavailable. This is exactly what we were expecting and are very happy with our purchase.This accommodated our 2.5 year old who is 36' tall and 35 lbs with plenty more room to spare.I would have given this 5 stars if there was more padding, but it was VERY easy to put a extra blanket under the liner/sheet (that's included) for extra cushion.	
- 1	The air dry clay is impossible to work with.  No matter what I did (warmed it, kneaded it etc.) it was wrinkly.  It was also impossible to get the clay to spread out evenly and neatly into the spaces with the little wooden dowel they included.I have also been buying plain wooden frames and putting sculpey in them, and while it's not any easier, it's a lot cheaper and the results look a lot better.In the picture part of this frame, there is plastic instead of glass, and mine was scratched.  So much for a treasured keepsake!	
1. 	Love them. Catches so much, keeps chairs and floors cleaner. Use them at home a lot but absolutely when we go out. Easy to wash and have also put them on top rack in dishwasher. If wanted, child can remove bib.	
- 1	Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it.Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.	
1. 	These are great sturdy bottles!! I wish I got this set in the first place (rather than regular medela bottles)	
1. 	This is the perfect transport option while a baby is in the larger carriage type car seats. A large basket to carry diaper bag and any extras. Instead of breaking your back and carrying the baby and carseat everywhere use this lightweight transport option. It's my favorite stroller for the first year.	
- 1	Highly disappointed that most of the stickers did not stay on the wall. Some did, most didn't. Our walls aren't extremely textured either...so I would suggest going with a different product.	
1. 	This gate was easy to install in our banister posts, the gate itself seems very solidly built, and it operates pretty smoothly, so I'm happy with it.My only complaint is that the little plastic &#34;catch&#34; that locks the gate shut is very shallow, so if you pull up fairly strongly, it will pop open. I'm not sure if a toddler could generate the force needed, but it may be possible. It's only a slight concern for me, though. I think it will work fine, and tweaking the screws might provide a little more hold.Side note: I noticed other reviewers saying that the included screws were junky, so I used my own &#34;gold finish&#34; screws, and have had no problems.Recommended, just test the &#34;catch&#34; and make sure it's holding to your satisfaction.	
1. 	I ordered two (2) set of bottles (two 4oz bottles and two 8oz bottles), each set came with one natural flow cleaning brush in them. So I really didnt need to buy these separately it seems. However, the more the merrier I suppose.... haven't had my baby as yet, so i have not actually used it but it looks okay so far	
1. 	We bought this when our baby was just an infant since his room shares a wall with our tv room. It is extremely easy and intuitive to use. We mainly use it on the ocean setting which is plenty loud. I do not need to turn it up all the way to watch tv in the next room. It will also drown out the shower, the toilet (also next to his room), loading the dishwasher, and moderate talking. It will not drown out our dyson, the doorbell, or the dog barking. However, some of the other options are quieter (I.e. the heart beat and rain are much quieter). The ocean sound is very realistic and has much better sound quality than the competitors version at my mom's house. I like that I can leave it on all night or have it automatically turn off after an hour. We usually use it plugged in but have found the battery option invaluable for traveling. In fact, my husband and I like it so much for traveling we take it even without the baby! It drowns out all those weird noises in hotel rooms. Downsides for us, it doesn't really have as many options as they make it sound like- there are only like six main sounds and then extra sounds that go over the top of those sounds. But do you really want a random bell tolling or bird squawking to wake up baby?! Finally, we have used this three times a day (2 naps and bedtime) for two plus years without a single problem! We are buying a second one for the next kid!	
- 1	My daughter is three months, and we had been using this as a nightlight.  Last week it just stopped working. It was great for late night feedings and diaper changes.  She was just starting to become mesmerized by the changing colors when it stopped working. Too bad, I really liked it.	
- 1	After solely breastfeeding my baby for 3 months, my husband and I wanted to be able to go out and have him babysat. In order to do so we had to get him to take a bottle, after many tries and fails, we finally found a nipple he would take, and unfortunately this one wasn't it. He just kept spitting it out and wanted nothing to do with it!	
- 1	Does not fit my son's head and he always rips it off the minute I try to put it on.  Also, with all his hair it doesn't help at all.	
- 1	As I mentioned in the review of the Infant Optics monitor - these cords are the most cheaply made part of the system.  I have had to repair (re-wire) or replace (buying this product) multiples of this cord over a 2 year duration.I would recommend finding an alternative from a different manufacturer if you need a replacement to the original power adapters from the monitor kit.	
- 1	We ordered this product because it is so hard to find black nursery furniture that is a reasonable price. We planned to use this as a dresser and changing table. Basically you get what you pay for, this item is made of processed wood/particle board so it is not the best quality. I knew this before I ordered it so I'm not giving it a bad review for that. My husband and I are not pleased with the dresser because it has a million pieces to it and the company put the wrong screws into the package. It is frustrating when you begin putting this dresser together only to discover part way through that they gave you the wrong screws. We tried to call the company but they were closed. Ultimately we can wait to get a hold of the company and I am sure they would send us the correct screws, but we don't really have time to wait. It is just a hassle to not have all the parts you need for the item. So now we have to try to find screws that will fit from a local hardware store. If we cannot find them we will have to wait for the company to send us the correct screws. I am sure the dresser will be sufficient once it is done but basically I am giving it a bad review because it is a hassle.UPDATE: After finding screws that worked and getting it put together I would NOT recommend this dresser. The wood is very cheap and cracked in a few different spots when tightening screws. We are not idiots and didn't screw them too tight, the wood just would not hold up. Also, we purchased the hutch (top part) for this dresser, it was actually better than this piece, but be aware that the top and bottom part do not match up perfectly. You can't really tell with the naked eye though. Once the hutch is on you cannot used the dresser as a changing table, as we would have liked to. It cuts a few inches off so therefore unless you have a very short changing pad it will not fit.	
- 1	They're not very soft. Also, they pilled up in the wash. I didn't like the idea of trying to wipe my baby's bum with pilly cloths. Now I use them as wash cloths in the bathroom.	
- 1	My toddler is very active and able to open and close objects very easily. She is comfortable with sippy cups but my wife insisted on using glass so we purchased the whole set of life factory bottles only to be dissapointed. The concept of tightening or loosening the cap for the flow does not work for us, my daughter would just unscrew it open and spill it if I did not tighten it all the way causing the flow to be non-existent.	
- 1	I have had this for 7 months now.I thought I could deal with this model.  Then self-feeding entered the picture...Here's the skinny on it: you can only put the removable pink tray in the dishwasher. You can't throw the rest of the tray in because of the metal screws -- and the fact it fills with water (desperate -- I did that too and it took a day to drain/dry).  If you are thinking you can just by a fabric cover and throw over it, think again. The main seating parts/fabric are riveted onto the frame. This prevents you from cleaning it. No matter how hard I tried to wipe it down, the straps had mashed food ground it after every meal.I finally got so frustrated I took it apart (literally cutting it off the frame).  I threw all the parts in the washer.  I was going to purchase industrial velcro to put the pieces back, but, realized by the time I did that I could put the money towards a nicer model.  I ended up purchasing an Eddie Bauer model for just over $100. which I can t-totally wipe clean and/or wash.The pros - it really folds up nicely.  When clean it looks very pretty.	
1. 	We just got leather installed in our new Prius after seeing what the car seat did in my suv, I made sure to get these. So far, so good. Also there is a little pocket to store stuff. Would recommend.	
- 1	You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.	
1. 	This pacifier chain is adorable and we get lots of questions about it. I love that it's also safe for my baby to chew on when he decided the chain is more interesting than the pacifier attached to it. Great product!	
- 1	This company is local and I wanted to love this cup but it leaks right out of the box. Baby didn't have to squeeze, shake or bang the cup - she just tipped it to drink and her front was all wet!	
1. 	These are very cute! There is a whole collection of them so it makes a cute little gift to add to a baby shower gift or get a few and use them as decorations. They float well. My little one loves them in her tub. I never really used it to check temperature as I just do that with my hands.	
- 1	The baby really didn't play with it at all. I'm hoping he will grow into it, but he's 8 months now and he still doesn't use it, even if I play it for him.	
1. 	I wouldn't use on an 8+ month old (or so), because it really isn't that good for a sitter upper who isn't very good at safely climbing off things, and worse for an active toddler trying to climb on everything.It was very nice before then, because it laid back nicely and reclined nicely, and it looked comfortable for a little baby, and later less reclined for an emerging sitter.  It was also good for training him to drink a bottle by himself, and he seemed very comfortable in it.I used it one day with my 16 month old, when he was very sick and just wanted to recline and relax in front of the TV.  The next day, he was once again trying to climb up the back of it, and I had to put it back away.  Not that a toddler wants to sit around in a chair anyway.	
- 1	this tub leaks - i had to put it in my bath tub to use it, which really hurt my back and made me nervous when taking my daughter out of the tub and trying to stand up.  couldnt use it on a kitchen counter unless i wanted everything to get wet.doesnt open and close very easily -  i gave myself more than one bruise (due to pinched skin) when trying to open and close it.  also, by the time your child can sit up in this might as well put them in the big tub..my daughter slipped and slid all over when we tried to sit her up.too short - by the time she was 4 months, she was too long for this tub and would kick the sides.i had regisered for the eurotub, but rec'd this.  preferred the euortub by far!	
1. 	This is a great little pump. I have the pump in style as well, but sometimes if I just needed to pump off excess breastmilk I didn't feel like hauling out the whole thing and plugging it in so I would grab this and it worked great! I love being able to just throw it in a diaper bag or, if I'm out with some friends without the baby, into a large purse so I can stay out longer than I would if I had to go home when my breasts got too full.I don't think I would want to use it as my only pump since I do pump often even though I am a SAHM, and if I were a working mother pumping while at work this CERTAINLY would not suffice, but it does the trick as a handy little stand in!	
- 1	My son is a little rough on things, so keep that in mind.  It was a great concept, until my son figured out how to pull it out, and then broke it.  The plastic did crack very quickly while still in the holder, as it is flimsy.  Additionally, he could pull it down in front, and reach over it.  So - they probably need to try again.	
1. 	Can I just say this: Do yourself a favor and don't purchase a diaper bin that requires special liners or bags. You'll save a ton of money by just using regular garbage bags.I've had two of these diaper pails (one couldn't fit during our move so we left it behind). I got the first as a baby shower gift and only used it for about 2 months, whereas the second one I've used for almost two years.The lid is designed to stay open when you push the button, but at this point we did something to mess up the mechanism and now it falls closed and won't stay up. Not a huge issue, but I could see how that could be a problem when you don't have a free hand while changing a particularly messy diaper.The smell is contained fairly well with this pail. After a few days, it does start to get stinky but hey, at that point it should be changed, right? I don't expect anything to contain the smell of dirty diapers for long periods of time, even a diaper pail.The lid has a little container built in to put the little arm and hammer scent diffusers. Our first pail came with them, the second did not. I didn't find them highly effective. I've heard people sprinkle baking soda at the bottom of the pail to diffuse the smell, I've never tried it or really needed it. I find the occasional spritz of Febreeze keeps everything smelling fresh.I would love if this item has a foot-lever for hands-free use. I'm sure there are others out there, but I didn't want to spend more money on a garbage can (and let's face it, anything associated with children doubles in price). Overall, this does the job and has never caused me any issues.	
1. 	Great bib for drooling baby! My little guy soaks the bib but because of the middle part his clothes stay dry and I only need to change for another bib, not the whole outfit. I let them air dry instead of in the dryer since a friend said hers got ruined after drying in the dryer.	
- 1	First off, I love the Tilty cups and so does my 8 month old. However, these lids just don't work very well. I'm not sure if they are intended to go over the original sippy lid or replace it, but either way doesn't make sense. If they replace the lid, you have to find a place for the sippy lid to go while you travel, which is a pain. Plus then they have the awkward sippy top sticking out still. If it goes over the sippy lid, it doesn't seal at all and pops off all the time. Either way, the little tab is perfect for getting caught on things and pulling off. This sort of works to just keep the sippy spout clean, but serves no purpose as far as containing liquid if you want to put the sippy in a diaper bag. I really hope they would redesign this lid!	
1. 	Genius.  This is great if you use several bottles a day and need to dry more than just the bottles.  Once you figure out where everything goes, this is a space saver and keeps bottle parts organized.	
1. 	This is fantastic!  It easily straps to any kitchen chair.  It also folds flat and you can throw it in the car when you travel.  The tray washes off easily too.  My only complaint is the tray liner has become really loose and my seven month old can pull it up off the tray.  I no longer use it for that reason.	
- 1	I was a little bit disappointed when I opened the package and seen they were covered in dirt and grass. Maybe the 5 year old Chinese worker was using them to keep his sippy cup warm while they packaged retail goods outside one fall day.	
- 1	I don't think this is sturdy enough to leave up in the bathroom for a toddler.  My son is 28 pounds and I could just see him stepping on to this wrong and the whole thing slipping over and crashing.  Not what I want on ceramic tile with giant porcelain things to bash his head on.  I donated it.	
1. 	I only wish you could order this with different sizes of shields from the start instead of paying extra if you need anything besides medium. If you have trouble with this, shield size makes a huge difference.	
- 1	This product is not spill proof as it claims, it leaks all over the place if tipped over when opened and closed.  Also, it is hard to suck the liquid out.	
- 1	Updated review:I wrote a glowing review of this earlier, below. I am going to leave it, because it was very helpful for nursing. However, I later discovered that it is made of polyurathane which disintegrates over time, breaking down into small particles. The neurotoxin toluene offgases from polyurathane. The manufacturers list some of the hazards of polyurathane on material safety data sheets - they include: possible cardiac arrhythmias, breathlessness, chest discomfort, irritation of mucous membranes, headache, coughing, asthma-like allergic reaction, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, nausea, blurred vision, and reduced pulmonary function. So, even though it worked well, I changed my review to one star because it just isn't worth exposing my little baby to toxic chemicals when he is so young. I ordered the The Nesting Pillow - Organic Nursing Pillow with Washable Slip Cover. I know, I know, it is insanely expensive and not an option for many families. But I wish I would have known ahead of time and I would have found some sort of other option.Old review:I found this to be amazingly helpful with breast feeding. Somehow the boppy has never been at all helpful for me. One of the slight downsides to the Brest Friend (aside from the unfortunate name) is that it is somewhat of a hassle to get on and off, but it is worth it with the help in positioning and making breastfeeding easier. It is not meant to replace positioning your baby with your hands and holding on to him or her while they are feeding (another reviewer wrote that she thought the baby might fall off of this - of course, you should hold on to your baby while he or she is on it). This helps in terms your arms not getting tired, and for first-time moms who are learning how to breast feed it is particularly helpful in the transition during the first few weeks. I strongly recommend this to any new mom who will be breastfeeding.	
1. 	I sent TWO packs of these plus a pack of the boy's bibs to my granddaughter to cover everything she has in her closet.  They help keep her dry and mom out of the laundry room.  Great colors that compliment all of her outfits.  Great purchase and I would gladly do it again.	
1. 	This is the BEST swing ever! My baby is now 4 months and has used this swing since she was born. She still loves it. Not only does it entertain her, but she will fall asleep in a matter of minutes when she's in it! We also use it for her to sleep in at night when she's stuffed up. It allows her to sleep on a slight incline and it cradles her. She loves it and the incline helps her to breath better! It is a life saver! I would have 2 of them if I could afford it. (One on each level of our house!) I advise anyone interested in this swing to buy it!! without hesitation! It's worth the money!!	
- 1	When I bought this I LOVED IT! Smooth plastic, easy to read display and it is very nice to look at. After 4 months it started giving  me the wrong readings. So I call customer service and they DO NOTHING! Even though I filled out the warranty! UNREAL! So now I have a busted scale! FAO Schwarz is a HORRIBLE COMPANY to deal with!BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND!	
1. 	A friend of mine recommended this warmer to me and so I bought it and it did us good. It maintains the warmth and moisture for long. The moisture pad would dry out but you should soak it each time you refill the wipes, if not before.	
1. 	This is a simple review for a simply great product.  This rail was easy to put together, sturdy, and dropping the side was easy for me to do while pregnant, but hard enough for our 2 year old not to master.  We had trouble finding a rail that worked in bunk beds, but this one beat the competition hands down!	
- 1	very lightweight and cheaply made. granted the video isn't so bad,however the audio is so low it defeats the point of having a monitor. I've since returned this. I bought the Graco True Focus Digital Video Monitor  instead. it's not perfect but definitely better.	
1. 	This works well with the contour changing pad.  It fits a little snugly, so the corners of the pad don't exactly stay as pointy as they were when it was new, but it works very well.  It works even better if you cut the straps off the changing pad.  You're right there with baby, anyway.	
- 1	do not buy this potty chair simply for the bells and whistles  they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time.  I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes, my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on.  The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys, but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in.  I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front, rather than underneath, it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out.  There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat.  If I had to do it all again, I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too!	
1. 	A favorite in our house!	
1. 	I really enjoy this product. It's very convinient and keeps my diaper bag organized. However, I would recommend to have the dirty clothes bag to have a plastic lining on the inside - that would save a significant amount of time when it comes to having to wash it in the washing machine versus quickly cleaning it out and sanitizing it.	
- 1	We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys. We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes, which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time, and its too cold or too hot, which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in. At 3AM, this is just too much trouble. Also, it lacks a countdown timer, a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time, and doesn't have a water reservoir. The Dr. Browns is much better, and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns, First Years and Playtex bottles.	
- 1	I was very excited to buy this item for my 4 1/2 month old baby. He love to kick his feet so I thought this would be great. However the volume on it is terrible. Even with the volume on the second noise  spot I can barly hear it unless I get real close to it. It was a waste of my money.	
- 1	My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad.	
1. 	I purchased a different monitor and ..., ended up exchanging and puchasing this monitor.  The clairty is so good and it's as if my baby is in the same room.  The price is also unbeatable.  I highly recommend this monitor.	
1. 	I LOVE THESE BAGS! I USE TO BUY THE ARM AND HAMMER BAG WHICH SMELL AMAZING BUT THEY ARE PRICEY. AFTER A WHILE, I REALIZED THAT I NEED MORE OF THESE BAGS. I FOUND THESE AND I'VE BEEN USING THEM EVER SINCE! THEY SMELL LIKE BABY POWDER. SCENT IS STRONG WHICH I THINK IS WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE. I LEAVE THE BOX OPEN IN BABY'S ROOM BUT DONT SMELL IT UNTIL I ACTUALLY OPEN THE BAG TO PUT IN THE DIRTY DIAPER! IT IS A REALLY GOOD AND NEEDED PRODUCT! PRICE IS GOOD BECAUSE ONE BOX LASTS A LONG TIME!	
1. 	My daughter would sit in this Exersaucer ALL DAY if I would let her!!  Especially now that she's crawling, it is so handy to occupy her when I need her to be safe for a few minutes.I should add, though, that I got this as a gift and I doubt I would actually have paid full price for it.	
- 1	Not big enough to swaddle with, so if that is what you're buying them for - go for something larger, they're also not very thick like you would expect from flannel.	
1. 	These have been around for a long time, and it's because they're the best. We have several different kinds of sippy cups, but these are the most dependable and the easiest. Definitely a favorite in our household.	
1. 	I like Gerber products. My son uses Gerber bottles so I have to buy gerber nipples. Fast flow works great  for my 30 months-old son.	
- 1	This thing stinks. The on off switch never worked so we always had to plug and unplug it. Plus you can easily over heat your bottles in this. We did like the cooler on the back for travel but overall this thing stinks	
1. 	Playtex Original Nurser Newborn Gift Set (Assorted Colors)is a great way to get started with introducing your baby to the bottle, especially if you are nursing. However, as your baby gets older, you will need bottles that hold more. This package of bottles is the perfect complement to the newborn package.The reason is that first of all, they're larger. Obviously, as your baby grows, you will need to feed him/her more, and these bottles make it really convenient because they're larger. They're also more sturdy than the newborn bottles, so you don't have to worry about them being easily damaged and causing accidents.If you buy the nursers, definitely buy these as an accessory. Then you'll have all the bottles you need.	
- 1	I had read the reviews about how short it is and I still bought it.  Wrong move, womp womp.  I don't like that you have to get your arm placed PERFECTLY in order for it to do it's job.  My husband hates it because he doesn't carry it on his arm and has to take it off every time he wants to pick up the car seat.  If the baby is sleeping when he wants to take the cushion off, baby will wake up for sure because of the loud velcro.	
- 1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.	
1. 	I bought this for my 7 month old baby to distract him and help him wind down when he's being fussy before bedtime. The colors are vivid and soothing, and it's the perfect amount of light to help him see a little without being so bright that he can't fall asleep. We put the turtle up on his dresser and the stars cover his whole ceiling. I love that it turns itself off after a while so the light doesn't bother him while he sleeps. I hope this lasts him a long time because I can see him enjoying it when he's older as well.Update: I just figured out that if you hit the on button twice in a row, the light automatically changes colors every few seconds! So pretty! I really love this thing.	
1. 	We used this to make bathtime easier on us when we transitioned my son to the big tub from the infant bath. When he's laying down it's SO much easier to shampoo his hair without getting soap in his eyes and to clean his bottom. Definitely not a product that lasts forever. I would plan on buying a new one every month or two for sanitary reasons but we were able to get it almost 100% dry just by squeezing it out and it air dried the rest of the way. This sponge is bigger than other bath sponges on the market too.	
- 1	This is awful. The small holes around the caterpillar and plastic circle that goes around the ball makes the holes underneath very small. It was truly upsetting to have to jump out of the shower because my screaming 9 month old had her finger stuck in one of the holes. I threw it in the trash.	
- 1	I am a professional nanny of about 10 years and I have come to view swaddling as one of the best baby care tricks you can ever use. I have NEVER dealt with a baby that did not sleep better when swaddled. There have been many babies who strongly fought the swaddling process if they were not used to it but after a few times it worked like a charm to keep them alseep. I have cared for dozens of babies including several sets of twins and triplets and truly, I could not have survived if I could not swaddle. Many parents told me that their baby did not like to be swaddled because they would always get out of the blanket within a few minutes. I always tell them that just because the baby gets out does not mean that they dont like it. You just have to find the right products to help keep the baby wrapped up tight. I have found that the Swaddle me does not do the job very well for most babies, but the Miracle Blanket really does! I love the miracle blanket, I have only found one baby who could get himself out of it and he usually only removed one arm so it did not wake him up. It is pricey but very very worth it! The Miracle Blanket will change the way your baby sleeps for the better so it is worth the money. The Swaddle me just cant get the job done, or at least not as well so I never recommend it to any parent.	
1. 	So adorable and cute. The way it moves and is flexible is great for babies. I would recommend this. Baby enjoys it.	
1. 	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	We use this mobile in the car seat and also attach it to the middle of our Tiny Love play gym on occasion (have never used the clip, just the velcro - works great).Baby loves to watch it, keeps him entertained (nice that it has two sides for something different).4 stars because motor is a bit loud, but hardly noticeable with other background noise.	
- 1	I wouldn't recommend these unless you have a much older baby or need to add a lot of cereal to bottles.	
- 1	This thing is crap. I have tried it many times and it just is not accurate at all. I can put it the same place the same way and it says different readings. I had one before that did work for a while then it just quit but this one came not working accurately. I know how to use it I have worked in a hospital where they have the expensive hospital grade artery thermometers but this one really just is not accurate. Rather go for the old fashioned kind then this waste of money.	
- 1	If you are looking for cloth diapers, educate yourself somewhere like on the Green Mountain Diapers website. The prefolds they sell do work well, and absorb more than disposables do. These prefolds, on the other hand, hardly absorb anything, when it comes to baby pee. They do a really good job, though, with spit up.	
1. 	My baby and I just LOVE IT!!!! It is so easy to bath her now and SO MUCH FUN! I started bathing her everyday in this bathtub and it is just awesome. She plays with her toys and has tons of fun. The side where her head rests is lifted so she can safely lay down and relax. After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended)	
- 1	This stupid (not inexpensive) monitor just stopped working after a couple weeks of use. We only just began using it regularly when our infant moved into her own room and out of the blue, as we are about to go to bed, the sound just stops working.Now thanks to Motorola we have no working monitor overnight.	
1. 	I've been using this gate for a couple of months now and it has been a great product. We used it first to create a barrier in the living room and now that my son is walking, we separated it into 3 pieces (1 to block electronics) and 2 other sets to block access to the kitchen when we are cooking.  Great product overall	
- 1	Having read the other reviews, I feel the need to clarify a couple of things. Honestly, when I read 7 or 8 reviews that all use the same cheesy language (wireless freedom! crystal clear sound!), written within a few days of each other, and all giving a product 5 stars, I get really skeptical really fast about how genuine those reviews may - or may NOT - be. For the record, I bought the Samsung Secured at a Target in Orlando, while on vacation, after my Sony Baby Call spent an unfortunate evening with an electrical storm. I am evaluating the Samsung based on previous use with a Baby Call, Summer Secure Sleep, Safety First Glow & Grow, and Safety First Crystal Clear.1) Wireless is both a half-truth and not really an advantage over anything. Why? Because most baby monitors on the market right now have the exact same DECT wireless technology. This monitor works on a battery, which needs to be plugged in regularly to charge. Yes, you can unplug it and walk around the house during the day, but if you are going to use it at night, you will need to plug it in or run the risk of it dying while you are fast asleep. The piece that goes in your child's room is not wireless. Every basic monitor available right now functions this way.2) Sound quality is not the only aspect of a baby monitor that matters. This is easily the quietest monitor that I have tried thus far. What is the point of decent sound quality, if you can't actually HEAR it over the dishwasher, shower, or other children? Despite the glowing reviews, I found that my child still sounds far away over this monitor. There isn't much true interference, but there is a buzz that is constant no matter where I try to use it (including our hotel on vacation, our home, and my mother's house). I also find it annoying that the receiver takes a good 10-15 seconds to pair with the transmitter, every time you turn it on. Meaning I don't ever have instant sound. Not cool, Samsung.3) The cost. Seriously? It's a standard monitor, with no advanced functions or video capability, and yet it is 2-3x the cost of comparable units. Why the ridiculous price tag???On top of those issues, I find that the green lights on this monitor are VERY bright. I have to turn it to face away from me at night, or the lights will keep me from sleeping. Not a very pleasant discovery for a sleep-deprived mother of young children. Especially given that the already too-quiet monitor is even more difficult to hear when facing away.Bottom line: There is no ACTUAL advantage of this monitor over any other I have tried, and in fact, it falls short of my experience with the Baby Call. Given the inflated price tag, in the end, you really are just paying for the name. Do yourself a favor and try a Sony Baby Call first. You will see a number of reviews (including mine) that mention interference, but in the case of the Sony, you can (in most cases) simply adjust the channel (as opposed to the Samsung, which only gets so loud). The sound quality really IS great, and oh yeah - the Baby Call is HALF the price.	
1. 	You need them if you pump for a few months. THis is the key to loss of suction that people notice when using the pump.	
1. 	I purchased this for my son and loved it. This model when I purchased it came in two pieces which you insert into the cover which is waterproof. Mine had no zippers, just a hole on the back to allow for the pieces to slide into. I used it with my first son from birth and he slept great. I also used half of it in our bassinet under the sheet with positioners ont he side to prevent rolling and he rarely spit up or had problems digestive problems while sleeping. I thought my son had outgrown it and gave it to a relative, but I'm buying two more, one for my son, and the other for our second baby due this July.	
1. 	This nursing pillow is very functional.  It is not too soft, so it provides good support for the baby. I didn't even need the additional boost pillow, but it was good to know that I had options. He still uses it as a pillow when watching Sesame Street. It has come in very handy on many occasions.	
- 1	I totally understand that crib mattresses need to be firm in order to be safe, but seriously, this thing is much harder than is necessary to be considered safe.  We purchased the Nook pebble mattress for my 1st born (which I LOVE,) but during my 2nd pregnancy when we found out we were having twins, I went hunting for more affordable options.  We decided on the Colgate Classica I based on the review in the Baby Bargains book. I wish I would have spent just a little more $$ or maybe just tested a few more mattresses out before buying 2 of these concrete slabs. The girls refuse to sleep on these.  My son just transitioned into a twin bed, so we gave one of the girls his Nook mattress, but now I've got to look for a mattress topper for the other baby.On a positive note, this mattress is constructed well and is super light which makes for changing the sheets very easy.	
- 1	I bought these after great deliberation and scrutiny. Well, they disappoint. The lid is very tricky to ensure it is closed.I bought a pack of 12 4oz mason jars from Walmart for $7.98. I love them, their glass	
1. 	Solved my problems of finding blankets to cover my newborn in the car seat.  I have a Graco SnugRide car seat and this just went on to the car seat with a elastic band.  It is a wonderful product.  A little costly, but I plan to buy the fleece cover for the warmer months. This cover is so snuggly.  She falls asleep in the car seat!  No more blankets needed.	
1. 	I thought the bags would be small based on the image...but they are a nice size and really are very helpful in keeping our diaper bag organized.  It makes it very easy to quickly located what we need to grab in a pinch.  I washed one of the bags and I can tell from that that this product may not last for a long period of time.  Regardless of that it is still worth it for as long as they may last.	
1. 	These are great bottles. I used them from day one until 6 months old. The only reason I don't use them anymore is my daughter is interested in holding her own bottle sometimes now and plastic is easier for her to hang onto because it's lighter. I love the glass bottles though because they keep the milk cool longer, important when pumping at work and using one of those little coolers. And they heat the milk up faster when placed in a warm water bath. They're very sturdy - I've dropped them several times and they haven't cracked or chipped. These come with nipples and the covers. I highly recommend these.	
1. 	I got this smock for my two year old who likes to play with water in the kitchen sink. I was sick of changing her clothes after sink time and so I bought this smock. It goes on easily over her clothes and has worked to protect her from getting wet. She is picky about clothes but she likes the pocket and she seems to like the bright colors. It has worked for us.	
- 1	My 5 month old is still swaddled, and oddly enough, she seems too small for it (we even own a size small). The sides that are to be wrapped around the belly/arms are too long, so the velcro barely even works. The left side (that wraps around first) pretty much tucks all the way underneath her back, and the right side (that wraps around second) wraps all the way around to her back, only leaving maybe an inch of velcro contact. Needless to say, it isn't secure enough to keep my little one from working her way out of the swaddle. She also gets her hands up and out of the bottom of the swaddle wrap, causing it to bunch up around her face, neck, which she then ends up chewing on and waking herself up.I bought mine from Target, on clearance in June/July 2011. Maybe that is why? It is a small, cotton, pink swaddle. She is 25 inches long and she fits ok length wise, but to wrap her tightly at all, it's waaaay to big for her. Seems strange to make a swaddle so loose since the purpose of a swaddle is to be tight.Also, mine does not have any velcro fasteners on the bottom like the other commentators. Not sure why but ours are apparently different.	
1. 	I agree that this product is grossly overpriced for what it is.  These are just plastic pieces that snap onto the legs of the Co-Sleeper bassinet to raise it higher.  But, they do the trick.  The directions state that you are not supposed to use these extensions without securing the bassinet to your bed.  Otherwise, the bassinet would not be stable at all.  But when it is attached to the bed, it is very stable.  I had to raise my bassinet 4 inches so I used two of these for each leg.  I love the bassinet now that it is at the same level as my bed.  I can so easily see and reach my baby at night.  I think these should be at least half the price that they are, but I wanted to get the part that actually went with the co-sleeper rather than parts from another manufacturer.	
1. 	Easy to use!	
1. 	I bought this bath to use with my infant when he was about 8 or 9 weeks old. Prior to that, we were holding him (making bathing a two person job -- one to hold the baby in the bath and one to wash him). He got too heavy for me to hold the entire time while bathing him and I needed a way to wash him by myself when my husband was at work. This seat works very well. I put the seat inside a small plastic baby bath tub and fill the water about half way (so that when I put him in the water level doesn't rise too high on him). I think this bath is better for a baby that's a bit older (I wouldn't have used this with him when he was a tiny newborn). It was perfect for my son at 8 or 9 weeks because he could recline and have a nice soak while I washed him without needing a second set of hands. He's 13 weeks old now and loves sitting in it and kicking his legs. Once he's able to sit up independently, we'll just let him sit in the baby bath tub without this seat.	
1. 	I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.  I couldn't be happier;	
- 1	I registered for this product and received it at my baby shower.  I thought it would be wonderful.  I was wrong.  My daughter who was 8 pounds 11 ounces at birth would slide down the Inclined to Sleep positioner.  In fact, a few times I would go in to check on her and her head would be in between the two foam sides.  SCARY!  This started happening after about 3 weeks of age.  Until this age she was fine with it...but by 3 weeks...she was wiggling and moving too much to use the pillow part.  I am thankful that nothing happened to her when she sild down the pillow.  Because of this safety issue I would never reccommend this product to anyone.  It's not worth the risk.	
1. 	I will never, ever go back to regular baby bottles.  And if you try these, I'd bet dollars to donuts that you won't either.  Yes, there will be less gas and fewer spitups, but that's not the biggest advantage in my opinion.Get the Playtex dropins and you'll be off getting manicures and reading your favorite gossip magazine.  Ok, maybe not, but you will be amazed at how much time you recapture when you don't have to wash bottles.  The only thing you need to wash is the nipples, and those really don't take nearly the same effort as bottles, and they don't sit with spoiling milk in them either, as bottles do if you don't wash them right away.  I've got a few more than a day's worth of bottles, and a quick sterilization every evening gets all the nipples clean and ready for the next day.  No bottles piling up in the sink.  Thanks for my life back and for the extra time I have with my daughter.	
1. 	This is a genius product, we always have one of those right on top of our changing pad (we still use a changing pad cover of course) and we also use it on the go when we change our baby outside. This disposable pad saved us lots of trouble in those times when accidents happen, it is just does not let anything go through it so the underlying changing pad remains clean, just finish the change and throw this paper away. We keep using the disposable paper until it gets dirty and only then do we throw it away, so that we do not use too many of them, but when an accident happens at 3 in the morning these are a saver!	
1. 	This bib is absolutely adorable and covers my daughter's entire top half, which is nice when you want to protect clothing from messy, cloth staining foods!I like the velcro closing in the back and the pocket in the front really does end up catching dropped food. Great buy!	
1. 	These extensions are sturdy, and they work quite well. They do not come apart too easily, which ensures that the co-sleeper is stable. However, they come apart well enough to not be a hassle. I actually have the dark brown co-sleeper. Therefore, I do not know if the color perfectly matches the toffee colored co-sleeper. I could not find the extensions that match mine. The color difference is very noticeable.	
1. 	Actually is better than the automatic one, plus, you can take it anywhere with you.ah....Great Price too. Absolutely recommend it.	
1. 	Kid gets to have a tumbler like mom and dad.  Great playtex quality and design.  Love this.  Will grow with my child and will be using for a long time since the design is not babyish.	
- 1	I purchased this Nuby nipple replacement for a bottle that I never used. I'm not sure if it works but assume it works just fine.	
1. 	This covers most of my baby and is easy to rinse off in the sink. I like that it ties rather than has velcro--velcro tends to irritate my baby's neck. The fabric is light and not too stiff, but still repels liquids. The elastic is a bit too tight at the wrists, however (though this does prevent food from sliding down his arms).	
- 1	Waste of money. Flimsy, falls out constantly, loose, blocks shelving on both sides of stove.Falls out constantly!!!! JUNK! Do not waste your money!	
1. 	We use this in tandem with the Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Graphite and we LOVE it.  Easy to clean, provides a clean surface to eat off of, and easy to carry along.  With the Inglesina chair, the handles keep the sides of the place mat down which is KEY.  Without the chair my son would just pull the mat and throw it on the floor and it would be useless.  The suction cups don't really do anything, but in tandem they are FANTASTIC.	
1. 	Once I found these they became the only bibs we put on our son.  They are great.  Really attractive, durable, and great at keeping his clothes dry.  On the drooliest days we do need to change one out for a dry one eventually, but they do a great job for quite some time.  I've bought three packs so far.	
- 1	As soon as I took this sea turtle out of the box in late 2010, I noticed that some of the paint of one of the animals and on its shell was scratched off.  But I had high expectations of this product & really wanted to like it as much as I thought I would, so I kept it.There are good aspects of this night light.  It does work extremely well as a night light and it will grow with my daughter, who has been using it since she was a little under six months old.  She enjoys the colors, stars, the different animals lighting up, and playing with the turtle & its buttons.  I will enjoy using it as a teaching tool about endangered animals as she grows along with the story & adoption certificate.  I like that it has three projecting color choices & it can be placed easily around a room.  The turtle is soft, plush, & wipes clean well with vinegar & baking soda.However -- the story is not that great, it is a battery drain & the cover isn't easy to get off or put back on, and the paint has continued to chip making me worry about its ingredients & safety for my child.  My biggest problem is with the stars.  The constellations on the single colors aren't accurate, and while the third color creates a pretty blue-green turtle shell, it actually casts the other two projection colors onto the wall together -- so the result is an incredibly disconcerting & messy-looking double projection containing two moons & two sets of the same stars right next to & overlapping each other.  Recently it has started intermittently failing, well before the expected 3,000 hours of use that Cloud B says it will last.  As an amateur astronomer with one of my parents since I wasn't much older than my now almost 2-year-old, 2 stars with quality concerns at this high a price gets 2 stars from me.I'd also like to know what a portion of proceeds actually means (5%? 25%?) and to which international conservation organization it is going.  So much charity donations to corporations are marketing gimmicks to get consumers to buy an item; vague information given to the buyer makes that a more likely scenario.I do not like this as much as I thought I would.  I should have listened to the other reviews as well as my friends & purchased the regular turtle instead.	
- 1	I bought a size large and they did nothing :( My almost 3 yr. old is petite,but she wears 3t in everything except jeans she is more like a 2t. These are gigantic and I think she could wear them when she is 6 lol. I pray by then she is not peeing at bedtime any longer ;) I would suggest getting one size smaller than you think you need. They do seem like a great buy had I gotten the right size though.	
1. 	This is a wonderful must-have.  I was given this as a shower gift and it has been a lifesaver.  We use it anytime we need to heat up a bottle, day or night.  We prefer to use it instead of heating the bottle in the microwave, but sometimes the bottles get too hot, and that is probably because we may have put a little too much water in the measuring tube.  But most of the time, they are just right.  We simply pour the water into the warmer unit, put in a bottle, and while we are changing her diaper, the bottle is heating.  By the time we are done changing her diaper, the bottle is ready.  We just keep the warmer in her room for convenience.  In the beginning we used, the cooler, but we kept forgetting to put the ice pack back in the freezer after she'd taken the 2nd bottle, so now we just use it for the warmer and it has truly worked out really good for us.	
- 1	I wish I'd more closely read the reviews for this sheet - it is very very cute and I eagerly washed and dried it according to the instructions and decided to put it on my Graco Pack n Play right away to welcome our newborn home. Unfortunately the sheet did not even come close to fitting. How sad. I'm returning.	
- 1	Not sure what I was expecting, but this is literally like a dog leash.  No stretch or elastic.  Just a nylon cord with a loop for your wrist at one end.  My main complaint is the other end--it takes some work to make a workable loop with the fastener.  Just slipping it over my child's wrist won't work, so I wanted to use it around a belt loop, but it was just too tricky to make it happen.  Very, very basic.	
1. 	Gets the job done. I can store 1-2 diapers, the wipes case, hand sanitizer bottle, and diaper cream with no trouble. I recently took it on an airplane trip. It was way easier to take this little kit than a huge diaper bag to the cramped plane bathroom. My husband likes how compact it is too.	
1. 	this system is working great, it  attaches to my pump and stores easily.  Its a great way for my husband help with feeding and the nipples it comes with helps avoid confusion.  I highly recomend it if your breast feedinf.	
- 1	I can see the word &#34;HOT&#34; on the bottom of the ducky no matter if it's in cold water, hot water, or not in any water at all.	
- 1	More my fault than anything, but the molding on the edge of our crib didn't work with this clamp.  I had a hard time finding one that did!	
- 1	it was smaller then i thought and i just wanted it to project the stars and not play lullabies but it dose both at the same time	
1. 	This is a wonderful wooden brush/comb set.  Besides being an attactive set, it also works very well.  The bristles are soft.  Our munchkin was born with ALOT of hair and has enjoyed having his head brushed since the beginning.  Highly recommend this set.	
- 1	After using these cups for about 2 months with our 11 month son we discovered they are not completely coming clean. The nipple is designed with four long indentations that run the length of it and come to a dead end at the tip of the nipple spout. Those indentations will slowly accumulate debris from milk and the dishwasher. After noticing that the indentations were not coming clean I had to soak them for a long time to soften the deposits and then spend forever with a bottle brush to clean it out. You may be thinking that I should have just used the bottle brush all along and this would not have happened. However, even with a standard bottle brush or a straw brush the deepest part of the indentations is very hard, almost imposable to reach. Even if I had been hand washing these after every use over time there would still be an accumulation. I hate to think how long it took me to notice this huge design flaw and how many other parents will use these without ever realizing that the nipples are not completely clean! I would not recommend purchasing this product. I am now tossing all of these cups and purchasing new cups. If you are in the market for a cup I would recommend:NUK Trendline Silicone Spout Learner CupThis cup has a far superior design and comes with handles.	
- 1	Lacking on the quality /longevity of the product.  It works great for a few weeks, but after repetitive use, the plastic strap begins to crack - eventually splitting and falling off, making the product useless.  This happened on two separate units (one in reach of the child and one out of reach of the child).  Luckily, it's a set of 6, so I had replacements handy.  But, I would not buy these again.	
- 1	I give it two stars because it is pretty cute, and not bad quality.  I tried several times putting my baby in this and it never resulted in a good night's sleep.  Swaddling worked better because she was unable to kick her feet around.  Being able to move her legs around just frustrated her because she couldn't get it off.  So, I never really got to use this.  Maybe other moms will have better luck...	
- 1	It worked well for a few weeks then the adhesive wore off and quit sticking.  Now it is just a crappy piece of plastic.	
1. 	This backup is wonderful.  It fits me 5' 10 and it fits grandpa 6' 5.  The stand makes getting the baby on and off easy.  Baby could not be more comfortable riding in this.	
1. 	this pillow is cheaper and more functional than the boppy! my son loved this pillow and the sling was really helpful	
1. 	This potty stays in our minivan for all trips short and long.  It is highly functional, fits my daughter perfectly (she is 2 1/2yrs old and weighs 29lbs).  I started with placing a plastic grocery bag in the bucket part, along with her unused diapers (since she is fully potty trained now), inside the potty.  This makes all waste fully disposable without having to do any cleanup.  Works like a charm.	
- 1	Wish I would have listened to the reviews... this mattress pad cover is far too narrow/ small to fit either of our Pack N' Plays... disappointed.	
1. 	we use it every night, actually my son does. He is able to brush his own teeth and does a really good job with this brush. He was biting and eating the bristles on conventional brushes but he can't do that with the silicone. I also feel like this is easier to clean which I love.	
1. 	Both of my babies used these blankets and they loved it! My daughter was sleeping through the night by one month old, and my son at a month and a half old. I don't think that would have happened had it not been for these blankets. These successfully keep little sweet wiggly arms securely tucked in the swaddle, and prevents the startle reflex that is the major culprit for waking a sleeping baby.  The first time I used one, I was a little put off as it felt like I was putting my child into a straight jacket, but once she was all swaddled up she got this content look on her sweet little face and BAM! Out like a light. Our nights were never the same again (in a good way). This is definitely a newborn blanket. As they get older and more active the appeal of being swaddled so securely fades, but boy when they are newborns, they love this! My children stopped using them around 4 months old which is when I switched them to a sleep sack. I highly recommend these blankets to anyone with a newborn baby!	
- 1	This toy is cute and my kids loved it.  However, it quit working 1-2 months after receiving it. The kids always took care of it and played gently with it.  Good idea and fun, but poorly made.	
- 1	Well, to be honest, I had a love-hate relationship with this glider. I loved how comfy and suggly it was. But I hated how my head could not rest on the back (I'm 5'4) when seated with a semi good posture, and only could when I was scrunched kinda low or snuggly with my legs bent in the seat.But the reason I disliked it the most was because of the horrible creaks and clicks the gliding mechanism would make when I tried to rock/glide. I even found a metal piece that had fallen off the mechanism. And to make it worse, the noises inhibited the process of trying to get my baby to fall asleep...I honestly was trying to forget the negative aspects, but the thought of nursing my second child in this chair made me contact Amazon for a refund. I'm very thankful that they have such a good return policy!!!	
- 1	Having tried several brands of breastmilk storage bags over the last 9 months while breastfeeding my daughter, I have been the more disappointed with the First Years brand.  I purchased them because they were more economical than other brands, such as Medela and Lansinoh.  However, I have learned that the old adage applies - you really do get what you pay for.  The First Years bags have consistently sprung leaks in the bottom while milk is being defrosted.  This had led to a significant number of ounces of painstakingly-gathered pumped milk being literally thrown away after it has leaked all over my refrigerator.  Additionally, as other reviews have noted, the bag size is much smaller than other brands (particularly compared to Lansinoh), which means that they hold much less milk per bag.  Since they do not freeze flat like Lansinoh bags, it also means more precious freezer space is taken up storing this brand.  The reason I have given the bags two stars instead of one is that not every bag I purchased leaked.  However, the ratio of leaking bags to non-leaking bags was unacceptable to merit a higher review, especially considering that I have had no leaks in any of the other brands of bags I have purchased in much larger quantities (e.g., Medela and Lansinoh).  I purchased one box and only one box of First Years storage bags for a reason, and I would not recommend that anyone else do so unless you have a tolerance for playing Russian roulette regarding whether or not your bags will leak and waste your milk.	
- 1	I thought this idea seemed great since my hands would be full once our baby arrived, but it did not work for us. We bought this for use in a doorway, but the foot pedal stuck out so that we never would have been able to close the door. The opening for this gate was also very narrow. We returned this for the North State Industries easy close gate, which we love.	
1. 	I love this product, my little one HATES the carseat but this keeps him occupied.  He loves looking at the red and black characters on the mobile.	
1. 	I have liked this tub.  The no-slide grips on the tub keep your kiddo in place well.  I also used a hand towel placed along the back of the newborn back slant to give even more 'grip-a-bility' when she was tiny.I have also used this tub as a 'holder' for her (empty of course) as a good place to set her down with a few toys.  She can't quite sit up by herself yet, but likes being upright.  This tub gives her enough support so that she can balance on her own.I have liked First Years products - I have the bottle warmer and drying rack too.	
1. 	simple seat for my daughter to take a bath in.  She is 4 months old and outgrew the small bath that we were using.  We wanted something that could be placed in the tub and still make sure she remained safe.  After about 5 or 6 baths we are very happy with it.  The quality could be a little better and it would be nice if it would be a little larger for longer use in the future but for the price I can't complain too much.	
1. 	At first the seam was a bit tight but after about a week of using it I got used to it and the seam loosened up a bit.  It's amazing to not have to move your pillows every time you roll over.  I've had this since about 6 mos. pregnant and had tried lots of other pillows before that (snoogle, boppy, etc) and this is the WINNER.  I could NOT sleep without it!  I sleep soundly with the exception of having to get up and go to the bathroom.  I crave this pillow now.  I had to go away for a few nights and had a sub-standard boppy with me and suffered the whole time!  It is a large pillow but I have no issues with someone else in the bed (California King) and sleeping comfortably with it.  It's amazing for my back and hips.  I highly recommend you try this FIRST because it has all the components of a perfect pregnancy pillow.	
- 1	nipples leak ugh... but it if your gonna just use the bottle only. the bottle is large so its good for hungry babies	
1. 	This swing is an absolute lifesaver and it was worth every penny I spent on it. From the moment we brought our son home from the hospital he has enjoyed this swing. We keep it in the side to side motion mode (though you can choose front to back as well) and he will literally stay happy and occupied for hours--this includes the time he spends sleeping in the swing. When he turned about 6 weeks old, he really started to enjoy the lights, sounds and circling fish. Now at 8 weeks, he talks at the fish all the time! It is fun to watch, and on a more economic point, for as much as we use the swing, it does not seem to drain the batteries as much as we thought it might.Honestly, as a brand new mother, if there is one baby product that I could not live without, it would be this swing.Be forewarned, it does take up a lot of space, but if you can make the room, it is worth the sacrifice.	
1. 	We decided to decorate our daughter's nursery in ladybugs and this is the perfect touch!  Not only is a good size and very cute but the light it projects and the constellations are great.  Way better than a typical nightlight that would be plugged into the wall.  This is battery operated so you can put it wherever you need and it puts off the perfect amount of light.	
1. 	I've had this diaper pail for 3 years now, and it's been through 2 kids (both in diapers for 18 months of that!).  I love this diaper pail! My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!	
1. 	This is a really great kit full of all the 1st aid things you need.  I especially love the tweezers and ice pack because with little ones, those are things you need as much as bandages and ointment.  I also love that it comes in a really cute case and has stickers inside.  It helps with frightened little ones to have a fun bag, fun bandaids and stickers.  and for the price, it is really a great kit to have on hand.  I'm a nanny, so I got this to keep in my car for when we go on outings.	
- 1	Very disappointed in this product. Not only is it bulky, cumbersome and heavy, but it smells like a chemical power plant. The mattress is bonded to MDF board, which it says is California compliant for formaldehyde, but that's not easing my concerns. MDF should never come near my child. &#34;Toxic chemicals are one of the major health risks of MDF. The chemical of most concern is formaldehyde, which can aggravate asthma and other lung conditions, irritate mucous membranes, and cause contact dermatitis. Studies on formaldehyde also suggest that it is a likely carcinogen, and it should be generally avoided.&#34; I bought a Baby Bjorn portable crib, which I will use as a playpen, and it didn't smell like anything at all. Very pleasant materials and easy to use. This is so stinky that I would be afraid to have my baby even in the same room with it. I could feel my throat close up. And no, I'm not one of those crazy people that thinks everything will kill us, I'm just a concerned parent who does their research. Get MDF out of babies' products.	
- 1	I bought these because they are washable and the box said they are 100% cotton.  However, while prepping them for first use, they just about RUINED my very expensive Rowenta iron. Why, you ask? Why would the cotton setting NOT work on a cotton breast pad? Because the brainiacs who made them decided to use some sort of nylon-based serger thread on the edging! I started to iron the first one, and my iron began sticking to the pad. I peeled it off the iron, and there, in a perfect circle, were little melted remnant marks from the thread. It is not even polyester thread, which tolerates a VERY high heat (i.e., cotton) setting from an iron.I am so incredibly disappointed. I really wanted to use these because they are cotton. So, off to the drawing board, I will just have to sew my own. And in case you are wondering why I would iron them, they come out of the wash very wrinkly (whether you air dry or put in the dryer; I washed them twice for prepping and did both drying methods). One of my girlfriends said she had tried them and they were very noticeable under her shirt because of the wrinkling, thus, my plan was to iron them smooth after each wash.If you don't mind wrinkles, or are planning on using a padded nursing bra, then I suppose these would work for you... But if you are like me, and prefer no padding in your bra, then I would give these a pass.	
1. 	This diaper pail is great! I read a few other reviews and would like to comment based on them.Our son will be 5 months old this week. He was exclusively breastfed, then had formula added to his diet, and now also eats jarred foods. Regardless of what he eats and what his output is, as long as you close the diaper the way you should, this pail holds in odors just as well as any other diaper disposal system does.I personally think the design is ingenious! The liner sets in the top of the pail and you pull it through to the bottom and make a knot in the bottom. To dispose of the diapers, you just step on a pedal. The top lifts up, you drop the diaper, and it falls through the flaps. When it's full, you open the door on the front and cut the liner off (there is a liner-cutter in the door). You are totally in control of how much liner you use and therefore don't have to waste or have a huge portion of liner that is unfilled. Then you just tie a new knot and pull the liner down to fill the pail, and you're ready to start again! The system comes with one liner refill, and refills are sold 3 to a pack (I see them all the time at my Babies 'R' Us, and my Babies 'R' Us almost never has anything in stock!). We are on the first refill in the first pack. We had bought 2 packs of refills when we got the system, and I seriously wonder if we will ever need to purchase another one...or if we'll even use all of what we bought!One reviewer stated that the system should tell you when the bag is about to run out because you could be tossing your diaper into the pail w/out a liner. I'm really not sure how that would ever happen, as you are the one who has to open the side of the pail to remove the full bag and pull down the new liner. If you go to pull down the liner and it you hit the end of the refill...well, it's like saying you don't know when your paper towel roll comes to an end. You pull and there is no more.Someone also commented on the flaps, and how the diapers don't fall through. I disagree with that. Regardless of my son's age, as long as he urinated more than once in his diaper and there was any kind of weight to it at all, it would fall through. Only if it was completely dry would it not fall through. And even then, if you just take your foot off the pedal and let the top fall down, it would push it through anyway. The one area I do agree with that person in, though, is that when the pail starts filling up, if you really want to maximize the liner and not change it right away, you DO have to push down on the top diaper to get it to go down far enough for the flaps to close again. But I have never touched another dirty diaper doing this, and I think that it's still worth not having to reach down and lift and push and twist, like you do with the Diaper Genie.There were also comments on refilling the liner. No, it is not as simple as dropping a bag in, like you would a regular trash can. But it most certainly is not complicated. There is a drawing that shows you how to do it, and once it's done, you won't be doing it again for months. Also, when you change the liner, it is SO easy to take the top pieces apart to clean them. I think it's very easy to keep this system clean & sanitary.All that said, if you're looking for the easiest possible route to dispose of dirty diapers, use your regular garbabe can and take the trash out frequently! If you're looking for a disposal system so you don't have to worry about constantly getting dirty diapers out of your house, I'd really have to say this one is the way to go!	
- 1	this is pretty much garbage.  we had used this for two weeks when the light went out and the beeping stopped-but it still heated the bottles. now it inconsistently heats bottles, which also wouldn't be so bad except that it has a feature that keeps you from turning it on again so it doesn't over heat. it is supposed to be for three minutes according to the manual but it is for anywhere from 3 to 8 minutes.  so here is the common scenario-the baby starts to fuss because he is hungry.  you put the bottle in the warmer, checking it often because there is no light or beeping to indicate it is done.  you check the bottle and it is still cold.  baby starts to cry. you add water to the warmer, alas it turned off.  now you have to wait for it to be restartable.  baby starts to scream.  still waiting, up to 8 minutes.  now you have to restart the warmer and wait another few minutes for the bottle to warm up.  it takes almost as long to heat the bottle as it does to feed him. we are just boiling water now and our son is only 2 months old.it also over heated his pacifiers and made them smell like burnt rubber (sterilization bags never do this).	
- 1	My daughter began using the MAM pacis in the hospital. A few weeks went by and I realized she had thrush. I also realized we had a bad case of breastfeeding thrush. It continued regardless of how often I boiled them, I used Gentian Violet, Nystatin, Grapefruit seed extract, vinegar rinses, low carb diet, I stopped wearing a bra, I made sure we were clean and dry, you name it. It continued for four months. I made sure to try to squeeze the nipple and shake all the water out, but as soon as my baby started to use it I could see little droplets of moisture forming inside the nipple, in a warm environment that makes bacteria and yeast grow. It made breastfeeding extremely difficult for us and around four months my daughter was able to go longer periods without the binky, and can you guess what happened? Our thrush started to drastically clear up, and we eventually stopped using them all together. Now I am happy to say she doesn't really want anything to do with her binkies and we have been free of any yeast infections for five months. My advice to you, don't make the same mistake I did and use these horrible pacifiers!!! Try the pacifiers that are one piece without an enclosed nipple for proper sterilization and air flow. The design of these is just a breeding ground for yeast!! The only real perk to these is that they are cute.	
1. 	Sound machine AND adorable stuffed animal in one? Win-win. I love that the sound machine is removable for travel, because the sheep is pretty big. I don't use it all the time, and didn't even get it until my daughter was 3 and 1/2 months old, but it helps when she's worked up and fussy around bedtime (overstimulated would probably be the technical term). I imagine it would have helped her fall back asleep after eating in the middle of the night back when she was still doing that. I like giving baby gifts that are cute and practical, and this definitely fits the bill.	
1. 	I bought these for use on a camping trip and ended up reusing most of them despite my intent to use them as disposables. Now I keep a few extras in the car, diaper bag, etc. for when I inevitably forget a regular spoon.They're the perfect size for little mouths and great to swap in when someone wants to just teethe on the spoon instead of eating. (My other spoons have metal handles.)Also, the handles are easier for ME to hold than the flat metal ones - the contours give me a better grip.We're starting to try to get her to feed herself and I'm offering her these and the toddler-sized take-and-toss spoons to use. So far? Messy but fun. ;)	
- 1	We bought this for a 10 day trip with our four month old daughter.  It did fold up and fit in my carry-on suitcase as advertised but it did not really work well for bathing her.  I tried it three times in three different sinks but it never seemed to fit properly.  It only ended up holding a small amount of water so she got cold and uncomfortable (but not very clean).  It was easier to just sponge bath her, in which case we did not need to buy this kind of expensive tub.	
1. 	I love this! I was hesitant to buy too since the sheet is expensive and hardly a sheet at all. But once I used it, it made changing the crib in the middle of the night speedy, letting baby and ME get back to sleep quicker.First off, it is soft to lay on, absorbant and waterproof. If baby's diaper leaks it only gets on this sheet. You can take the sheet off easily by just removing the snaps attached around your crib slats. We have our crib matress dressed in an additional regular crib sheet underneath with a cheap matress pad below it. This allows us to make it thru the night without having to make a full crib linen change--- at least until morning.I will certainly buy this as my gift to all my friends baby showers!	
- 1	I wish the fabric was soft its hard and has a rough feel to it, I have inserted a super soft kiddopotamus insert and my son likes the seat much better now.Very disappointed that the top speed is so slow. My son isnt into the super slow speeds of this seat.The toy bar hangs way to low, its about 5 inches from my sons face, so we dont use it at all.Im upset I spent so much money for something that it hard, moves so slow & toys are to close to his face to useFYI about the speed: My son was 9 lbs 8 oz at birth and currently 14 lbs 4 oz at 8 weeks old and it has always moved to slow	
1. 	I like the overall look of this travel diaper bag. It's only great for short trips or doctor's visits because it doesn't hold that many diapers. But it's easy to travel with, especially when you are already holding a million things in your hands, arms and maybe legs too!Warning: the red baby wipe travel case that came with the product dyed my baby wipes red! I have no idea why, but good thing I have so many of those wipe travel cases I just replaced it with another one. Problem solved.	
- 1	I wanted to like this tray since it got such good reviews.  It was pricey for what you get but I thought I would try it.  I had a hard time removing the frozen food without letting the container partially though.  This was not an ideal solution for me.  I prefer the Baby Sprout containers.	
1. 	Love this potty. No messy parts to clean. Rubber feet grab the floor to prevent slipping when the kid sits down. Large bowl with lip for boys is a  nice feature, no more flippy to fish out of the potty bowl. Can't say enough great things about this potty! Buy it already!	
1. 	I love this product!! It makes a huge difference in how the changing room smells. I have seen negative reviews on this product, but I would guess that they haven't mastered how to use it. It is a little tricky. It would be nice if it held a few more diapers, and the cutting and changing of the refills is a little tricky, but I love it just the same. The sausage idea is great because it contains the smell when you open it to put another diaper in there. My 5 mo old laughs everytime she sees her father change it. He loves to go on about the poo-poo sausages that she is so talented at making...lol (Daddies are weird) When you get one make sure you read the directions twice	
- 1	And I wasn't all that impressed with it. It seemed like it could tip too easily and I didn't like that you have to buy all of the accessories separately. This is already an expensive stroller and it should come with some of those bells and whistles.	
- 1	I ordered 6 of those, each different color, for my baby which will be born in April, will use it but this one came with a broken snap at the top- so not to happy about it , will try to fix it, color is nice thought	
- 1	I can't really comment on the product itself as I never got to use it, but I do highly recommend not to buy from Dorel Juvenile Group.  After waiting for over two weeks for the delivery, I gave up and went to a nearby store and bought another walker.  It never occured to me that Dorel Juvenile Group may not accept returns (I did not see anything indicating this at the time of the purchase).  We had sort of a fight over email, and they finally agreed to accept the return, but guess what?  It's been three months now since I sent the item back to them, and they never returned the money.  When I contacted them, they claimed they never received it...	
- 1	I bought this toy for my 10 month old niece as a gift, but decided to buy one for my 23 month old son so that he could have a nice soft ball to throw around the house (he's got a good arm). The ball is nice and soft (even though the little jingler inside can be felt if the ball is thrown hard enough), it's great for learning to catch, and my son likes to fling it around by the tags. However, my son decided to carry the ball around in his mouth like the doggies do, and one of the tags actually cut his little tongue! Even made him bleed! I am PISSED that something being advertised as soft and comforting could do this. I touched the tags afterwards and they are actually quite sharp in the creased area... had to warn my sister about letting my niece put this in her mouth. Boo on you, Taggies.	
1. 	These are durable, and hold up well in the dishwasher.  My son loves straw cups, and he really loves that these have MM on them!	
1. 	These are my baby's all-time favorite spoons. They are wide enough to pick up quite a bit of food and get it in his mouth without (too much) mess, and soft enough on his cheeks and gums. The low, wide base of the bowl makes it very difficult to tip over. Totally worth it the price.	
1. 	We have had our son in Halo sleepsacks ever since we stopped swaddling him. They are great! We've had cotton, velboa and this fleece one. The fleece is warm and moderately thick, but I think the velboa is the softest and thickest Halo sleepsack. It's difficult to tell whether the fleece or the velboa is warmer. I wish the sleepsacks were more widely available in the larger sizes. We're going to keep my son in them as long as we can. He moves around too much in his sleep to use an actual blanket. Seriously, he's rolling all over the place all night.The one thing I think these sleepsacks are missing is a snap tab that would cover the zipper. We've actually talked about sewing one on because our son has become very interested in unzipping his sleepsack to the point where it has kept him awake trying to unzip. Our nephew went through a similar stage when he was obsessed with the sleepsack zipper so I'm thinking it might be a common thing. I understand that you wouldn't need the snap for really young babies, but it might be good for toddler sizes.Overall, we love these and will continue to put our son in them until he'll no longer fit!	
1. 	Our baby was swaddled for sleep up until she was 6-months-old and started rolling over onto her stomach while swaddled.  We tried putting her in footie pajamas for sleep, but she seemed a bit restless during the night.  It was too drastic of a change from the swaddle she'd become comfortable with.  We tried this Halo SleepSack (on top of the pajamas), and she settled right down to sleep.  The SleepSack gives her the cosy comfort of a swaddle with the freedom to roll over without any safety issues.  Now we use a SleepSack every night.  We prefer the standard fabric (rather than the fleece variety).  Living in Houston, the Halo fleece fabric is too heavy and warm, even in winter.This particular design of dots is not our favorite Halo design, but it works just the same as the cuter designs.	
1. 	My son was 7 months old when he started roaming our living room trying to find things to get into. We immediatley needed something to contain him in for short periods of time when we are cooking, going to the restroom ect. He likes being in his playard for short periods of time, 30 minutes tops. After 30 minutes he wants to pull up on the gate and try to escape. He only weighs 17lbs and the gate gives a little but doesn't seem like it's possible for it to fall because of the way its assembled. It seems sturdy. I put mine as a rectangle as that is how our living room made the most sense, the octagon looks like kids would enjoy it also. I did not have to order the extensions although I thought I would. If you are tight on space and you munchkin is into everything like mine was then this playyard is a must have for being able to take your eyes off your little one for two minutes at a time. I filled it with toys and non toxic foam mats and he was good to go. It's tall enough where even when he is able to stand up there's no way he can get out of there on his own.	
1. 	I do not own a Graco car seat (I have a Chicco travel system with infant carrier and stroller), but I swear by this product.  I use the SnugRider with my Chicco infant carrier; it doesn't snap in, but it fits in firmly and in the 5 months that I have used this product (multiple uses per week), I have never had any issues with the seat not feeling secure.  While travel systems are great, the strollers are big and heavy.  And with a newborn baby that is too tiny to sit in the actual stroller, there is no need to lug around the travel system stroller.  This is the perfect solution.  The SnugRider folds up great for easy portability, plus it is incredibly lightweight.  I had to travel across the country when my child was 8 weeks old.  I travelled with the infant carrier and this stroller.  I visited multiple tourist attractions and theme parks with this product and my infant carrier.  I was able to fit 2 diaper bags, the baby, and multiple bags of souvenirs in the basket.  I highly recommend this product!	
- 1	I didn't like these at all. They never stayed in place. WeeBlocks stayed in place much better. These are too light weight and too small. A waste of money even though you love the prints.	
1. 	These are the best bibs ever. We have a variety of types of bibs that we were given at baby showers and these are the best by far. They don't get grimy like the other ones. It helps tremendously to be able to put the bibs in the wash.The only con may be if your child tries to yank their bib off on their own - velcro tab may not do much for you then. That said, my 19 month old yanks his bib off at the end of meals but it takes a LOT of effort.If I had a list of &#34;must have&#34; baby items for every mother these bibs would be on it!	
- 1	I bought one of these before my son was born.  He never liked it because he liked his hands and arms up by his face and this doesn't allow for that. It was a waste of money for us but I will keep it in case the next one might like it.	
1. 	This is used for manually adjustable seats mainly. Also used on places like planes. Bought it to replace the one I had lost. It holds the seatbelt position so it cannot loosen up or come undone, and your child (or whatever is in your carseat) will be safe.	
1. 	My one year old loves these!  We have been searching for a way for her to enjoy her snacks while on the move since she is now walking.  These hold in the snack even if she shakes them up and down! I do wish the colors were all the same price, instead of a cheaper price for various colors, so that way she could have a more girly cup, but its no biggie! I would definitely recommend this to all my mommy and daddy friends!	
- 1	I would love this if it worked longer than a week! I dont have the time or want to spend the extra $ to keep replacing it with batteries. It needs to have a shut off button(I purchased a less fancy looking one that does the exact same thing at BuyBuy Baby(r). and that one had a shut of button, I have had it months and it works wonderful and I haven't needed to replace the batteries yet.)	
- 1	We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children. We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time. Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child. I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice. My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool. He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?) inside. Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough. If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.	
- 1	I too really wanted to like this chair, but it just isn't that functional, user friendly or well made. The problems with design that bother me are the way the seat belt goes through the infant insert and leaves this big holes perfectly placed for all of her food to accumulate beneath the seat. Then the seat is attached via some weak velcro, which is only getting weaker since you have to remove the seat after every meal to clean out the accumulated food. The tray has too much give or slide in it, ever after it has been 'locked' into position, and the 'clear protectant' tape that is suppose to keep the tray from getting chewed up when sliding in and out of the locking mechanism is already wearing off and the tray is showing wear from being slide in the locking part. Plus, you have to have two hands to release the locking mechanism when taking the tray off, which is lame when you are holding the baby and trying to get her in the chair for dinner. It is scratching and chipping off finish also, which I expected and don't care too much about, but overall we are disappointed. Did I mention that we have only been using it for about 2 months. Lame. If I didn't live in Alaska and there were better looking alternatives with more functionality, I'd return it. I am pretty much keeping it because from what I saw, it was the safest bet for something that coordinated with our dining room set and was wood. Pretty much form over function, and expensive at that.	
- 1	This is a good product if you plan on leaving on the whitenoise all night or want a very expensive night light.  However the auto on feature leaves something to be desired.  We now mostly use this as a nightlight and just occasionally use the projector.Pros:*Nice nightlight with a cool color*Projection can help keep a child's interest*Multiple projections are interesting.Cons:*Auto on turns the device immediately to the sound level you had it at when turned off at the slightest sound.  This can mean a small murmur by a child or a passing car results in a sound and louder noise and light int he room.  Wakes me up and can disrupt the child.	
1. 	Meh, I was hoping for some great USA made products when I bought these for homemade baby food but I'm a bit disappointed.  The white plastic is flecked with black spots (I'm hoping against hope it isn't little gnats or something - that's what they look like) and two of the four lids are nearly impossible to seal.  They do the job and it is nice to be able to stack them in the freezer, they just aren't as great as I had anticipated.	
- 1	I thought it would work when I looked at the stroller and the height of the holes, but my daughter can't even reach the top of it to get food out. I am not sure it will ever work, but I am going to keep it to find out. The quality looks good and the way it fits into the holes seems like a great idea. Just wish I could actually use it.	
1. 	Does what it is supposed to.  Basic and easy too use and little ones can't figure it out.	
1. 	From the first bath until four months later, this bath tub has been amazing! The sling is perfect and adjustable. The drain is perfectly placed to allow the water to leave while we rinse him with fresh water. It fits in the sink perfectly. Our little guy is very comfortable in it. He's not ready to leave the sling yet, but we are sure the tub will serve him well when he does. The only MINOR complaint I would have is with regards to the placement of the head. It is on the side of where the faucet is on the sink. I have to be very careful not to let the faucet touch the baby. If they had put the place for the head on the other side, the bath tub could not have been more perfect!	
1. 	We have several receiving blankets for our 10-day-old son, but this is our favorite. It's big and soft and works well for swaddling or just for cuddling. We also love that it's organic. Highly recommended.	
1. 	I am still a little nervous about feeding in public and this helps. I know I'm not going to drop it and expose myself and it also helps keep him from getting distracted. I recommend it for anyone who wants to bf in public.	
1. 	Very practical, not as bulky as a regular double, good looking, seems sturdy. It is of course bulkier than a single, but fit well in the trunk of a Nissan Rouge along with a pack and play and four large bags. Easy to fold, the storage basket could be better but that was easily fixed with the joovy parent organizer. I found the canopy small when assembling it, but the rotating feature actually makes it very useful. We bought it for a trip to Disneyland with a one year old and a three year old, both kids seemed confortable and both were able to nap in the reclining seat (it reclines just a bit, but enough for them apparently), and my three year old boy loved having choices and being able to easily hop on and off. I didn't find it too heavy or difficult to push, and i'm rather small (5 ft 1, 110 pounds). My almost six year old niece also enjoyed the bench when she got tired.	
- 1	I registered for this tub because I thought it is very cool and so multi-functional.After the baby was born and passed his stage of dry bath, I found this tub is not very easy to use.  My husband and I coudln't solve the leaking issue.  It also difficult for me to expand or close the tub.The sling is not very good, either.I tried to use this tub for 3 times and returned it.  I got Sure Comfort Deluxe instead.  I think Sure Comfort Deluxe is a much better choice for new born.  It is very easy to put over my sink.  The green net comes with the tub is easy to use.	
- 1	this termomether is consistently inaccurate. it overstates the temperature and takes a long time to adjust when there is a change in temperature. before realizing I should not trust it, I kept my baby's room way too cold. I now use it only as a night light. Save your money and don't risk giving your baby pneumonia.	
1. 	I have other AVENT products so I thought I would try this one as well. I was not really expecting this would be great pads, but for this affordable price, this is just good enough for me.	
1. 	my 9 month old son love these cups, the quality is very good and the colors are beautiful, he plays with these everyday.	
- 1	The first negative is that this potty is cheaply made in China using low grade plastic. Ours came with cracks already in the plastic where the two halves join. Not enough to ruin the potty, but enough to suggest it won't last long and wasn't made with quality in mind.By far the worst thing about this, however, is the extremely poor design choice to join the two halves (the colored top and white bottom piece) with the seam open UPWARDS. (Look closely at the piectures and you'll see what I mean.) Think about it: you've got a potty made for kids who are just learning to use one, and you design it so that any liquid that spills on the outside will get trapped in a tiny seam that you can't separate? Brilliant. The two halves aren't designed to come apart to clean it. Good luck getting urine completely out of this unless your kid is some sort of urinary genius that never has a miss. You'll need to spray it down in the bathtub to get everything out of the joint between the two plastic parts. We've had two other pottys, and neither was so poorly designed as to have that problem. I recommend the Baby Bjorn, the potty we used with our first-born, but pretty much any other company you choose will probably sell a better one than this. The Bjorn, for example, is made with a one base piece, and no parts have difficult to clean crevices.I'd think you would have to try hard to screw up the engineering of a piece of plastic to pee in, and yet Prince Lionheart has managed to. Royally.	
- 1	I have leather headrests in my car and this product slipped all over the place. It never stayed put while driving. I also hated the installation design and directions. You can only loop it around one way (over/under) and it is just slippery on the leather.  There isn't a way to stabilize this mirror. I returned it and am trying one by britax back seat mirror that has way more features and costs the same on amazon.	
- 1	I purchased this tray advised by a friend as we needed more freezer containers than the ones purchased for my Baby Brezza Prima (Baby Brezza trays are spacious and we have a small freezer). We used it for two weeks and were very pleased but then the silicone broke on one side! Now I have 3 cubes I cannot use.We decided to purchase the Mumi & Bibi starter trays rather than replace this one. More expensive, yes, but worth it- they take up little space and the cubes come out with a push of the finger!We contacted our friend about her trays and she said she has used them for both her kids, so maybe we just got a faulty one.	
- 1	Its material is thin. The attach part neck area isn't smooth. I put couple napkin to cover it so she won't feel if when she lays on it. This product doesn't give good neck support for newborn	
- 1	Would have rated it higher if:1. They were pre-folded smaller...I can fold them up myself but they just get smushed in my bag, when they're already creased from packaging they tend to retain the original shape better.2. The two teenie adhesive stickers on it are awful! Might as well just make one big strip. I couldn't even find them, they're just two small stickers that don't serve much point. I wanted them to replace &#34;PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.)&#34; which are no longer available (THOSE were fabulous).So...it'll do the job, but they're still crummy.	
1. 	This has been a lifesaver!!! It can sterilize 5 small bottles & nipples 5 minutes at a time!!! Just add the correct amount of water, pop it in the microwave, and go!!! It's saved me so much time and hassle... At first, I didn't think that I wanted to spend the money on a sterilizer when I thought I could boil them myself for free, but this has more than paid for itself in it's first 3 weeks of use... A definate must have for new moms!!!	
- 1	I was hesitant to give this to her because of the strong plastic smell and it wasn't made in the usa. I washed it with hot water and soap, trying to keep my finger over the air hole so soap wouldn't get in it.  Within 5 minutes of giving it to my 4 month old, she had a rash on her face.  The dog also took it from her thinking it was for him.  After two hours the red skin irritation is gone but I wont be giving it back to her.  I think my golden retriever just got a new toy.	
1. 	This nursing cover is really pretty and makes nursing in public seem less daunting. It's easy to use and not so heavyweight as to make it hot for baby.	
1. 	Love this. I dont' have to keep washing the crib sheet. This makes it easier to keep my baby's bed clean.	
1. 	If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!!	
- 1	We bought this seat elsewhere about five months ago. Until today (when it needed to be taken apart for cleaning) we were happy with this seat. Today my son vomited numerous times in a couple of minutes. Our first baby car seat was a Chicco infant seat that he grew out of and he vomited once in that seat and I was easily able to take it apart, wash it and put it back together. No so with this Recaro seat.  You can't take the fabric off the piece that goes up and down (the combined back and head rest) and taking off the rest of the fabric around that piece was a nightmare. The vomit was EVERYWHERE, under the seat, in the ridiculous cheap foam pads under his bottom and against his back (today I realized those foam pads were weirdly discolored before he got sick). The instructions also say to hand wash where our old seat was machine wash and hang dry.  I actually had to hose the seat off to get it clean and had to hose off the back portion (that slides up and down to provide cushion for the sides of his head) because that wouldn't come off. I could go on but you get the idea. It's sitting in the garage still drying four hours later.Thankfully we live in a warm climate (Texas) and I was able to hose it down - had we been in a cold weather state I can't imagine how I could have cleaned that seat.  After that incident today I wish we had bought a different seat.Fingers crossed I'll be able to get the cover back on the seat when the foam pads by his head eventually (?) dry.	
1. 	My 10 months old baby has now been using this one every night for the past 2 months, and probably still will for a while :)Very practical, it still allows her to roll over and sit easily in her crib. We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!	
- 1	Even after watching the videos online, we couldn't figure out how our newborn son's legs were supposed to fit into this. So we waited a few weeks and tried again, once he was a little bigger and didn't require the booster cushion. The bottom of the insert has a confusing strap that doesn't seal the bottom of the insert. You can't put the baby's feet in the bottom, because they slip through the holes on either side of the strap. You can't put their feet outside when they're still tiny, because they're not big enough to straddle you yet. So we had to wait until our son was big enough that he didn't need the insert, and we basically never used it.	
- 1	When they say plush, I was thinking as plush as the velour on a Zutano changing pad cover.This is NOT PLUSH! This is very thin and the color isn't as vibrant,it's more of a faded green.I bought theZutano Owls Velour Changing Pad Coverfrom Amazon as well and this is nowhere near the plushness of the latter.Daughter's amused by the monkey print and readily lies down on the changing pad so I take it she likes it and that's about the only redeeming quality of this item	
1. 	The paci seems nice.  Shaped more like a bulb and less like the orthodontic ones.  My little one refused to use this paci, but he is very particular when it comes to these.	
1. 	The flaw isn't a safety issue but both myself and my nextdoor neighbor had the same thing occur. The motor for the fish mobile started making horrendous noises and just stopped working. For both of us this happened within 3 months of owning the swing. If it had just happened to me I would have thought it was a fluke. Other than this flaw - we loved the swing because of it's ability to swing two ways. One other gripe - why the heck don't they offer an AC/DC power input for these things. We literally went through 4 batteries a week (but my daughter had horrible acid reflux and would not sleep ANY other way but in this swing for a few months so it was worth it to us at the time.).	
1. 	made of good quality rubber; no way to test, but should be very environment friendly! our little girl loves it so much and it is always the no. 1 choice for her in the bath. It is cute, fun to play with. Hope I had one in my childhood... also you can try Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys , these are funny and make both more enjoyable for your baby.	
- 1	Wow I really, really wanted to like this toy for my 4 month old daughter. She has giraffes on the bedding in her room and she loves to look at them and babble so I though this toy would be the perfect extension of that, but after taking it out of the box, Sophie is going right back. First of all the quality is really dog- toy like. It smells!! And the paint was already rubbing off. I don't care if it is food-safe paint, I still don't want my child ingesting it.Also the squeaker is a dog- magnet. We have a big Siberian Husky that we are super diligent about supervising around our daughter. I certainly don't want to give her a toy that is going to bring the dog running every single time she squeezes it. This is our preference- But a good advise to other dog- cautious families.	
- 1	My baby was pretty fine until I got this bottles recommended but her doctor.The day after I use it was the first day she started having colics. It might not be related but I feel it is. i am back to Dr browns	
1. 	These little outlet plugs have been around forever. This particular brand is great, they are tight in the outlets so baby cannot pull them out. Sometimes even hard for me to get out.. which is good because I wouldn't want baby to accidentally get them out. Plenty of plugs for the whole house, and clear so your walls dont look tacky..	
1. 	This is an amazing product, instead of using a Qtip I can use this and not stretch my little baby's nose out.  And for my toddler as gross as this may sound, I can use some saline and then reach in a grab those toddler size &#34;boogies.&#34;	
1. 	Our son loves this!!  He really started liking it around 2 months, with the lights at the top.  He would just keep looking at them, and, as he's gotten older, he continues to love it.  It was great for when he was first learning to reach - there's a little monkey who's tail curves around a small loop, and, that's when I noticed he was learning to reach for things - he was determined to get the monkey!  Now, and 5 1/2 months, he pulls down the monkey within the first minute of setting him under, but, he still loves it, although is starting to outgrow it a bit, as he now rolls over on his belly, and ends up kicking at the long bars that hold it together, but, even given that, it still holds up amazingly well.	
- 1	We encountered midew problems only while using this pail liner, it leaks, and is also the smell does not come out of the material.We got one a few years ago and some one gave us another one (both brand new) last year from our new baby, both times we have had the same issues.Planet Wise is way better.	
- 1	I got this for our LO because the baby gym was one of the items from our registry/shower that we didn't receive. I figured he would not really need anything special until he can grab at them, etc at first so this would be fine. I was wrong, the hippo is cute and my LO does like to stare at the hanging animals but it a piece of junk, the bar falls over forward and if I was not sitting there watching him it would hit my LO in the head! It is nice that it all zippers into itself but overall I would say to take the $20 and put it towards one of the $50 play mats like the tiny love mat or the FP rain forest one that seem to be safer and have great reviews.	
- 1	This was not meant for a car window. Maybe would work better in a truck or SUV. I had to angle this and it really didn't work all that well anyway. I just didn't have time to return it so I had to make due. It finally fell apart the other day and I gave it and tossed it in the trash. I'll try again soon.	
1. 	I like these bags better than the Green N Pack biodegradable ones. Unlike Green N Pack, these ones come pre-separated and contain poo smells better. The trade-off is that these bags aren't eco-friendly, but they work so much better. I will buy these ones again after I've used all of my Green N Pack bags.	
- 1	Bought two of these but they just didn't work.  Can't get them to stick to either the highchair trays or to granite counter tops reliably.  Tried slightly wet, completely dry, tried cleaning the surface and the suction before use....  Nothing worked.  Sometimes they wouldn't stick at all...  Other times they'd stick to the countertop but not hold in place well enough to twist the bowl on...  Or I'd get the bowl halfway on then it would detach and then I couldn't get the bowl separated from the suction.  So now we just use the bowls as bowls and pick them up off the floor when they're thrown...  Just like we do with the 2 dollar bowls.	
- 1	All children are different, and for me this was a complete waste of money.  My son didn't play with them when he was 1, and we brought them out later.  He still didn't.  Several times more...he's still completely disinterested.  I think it might be because he had soft squishy squirters first and these hard toys didn't interest him.  They also turn upside down all the time, which is annoying.You never know what your child will like!	
1. 	I like this a lot when I need to warm baby's bottles (I am not using Avent bottles but it works fine). It heats the milk evenly and to the same temperature as long as you follow the directions.But there should be a timer, or the light should turn off only when this is warm. The directions are way too complex for a mum and a crying baby. Be more simple!	
1. 	Love this duck tub, my son likes to play in it and fits well, he's 8 months but almost reaches the other side of the tub which is ok. Easy to drain and easy to blow up and deflate when needed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a transition tub.	
1. 	it does the job, my daughter is discourage from playing with the railing since we installed this mesh&#8230;. not the best looking product but there is nothing else available in the market.	
- 1	Many moms swear by amber teething necklaces. I purchased this one out of desperation. My infant son was constantly fussy for no apparent reason, so I tried the teething necklace. I guess teething wasn't his issue at that time, because it made no difference. It also annoyed him. When he was older and I was sure he really was teething, he hated the necklace and wouldn't even let me put it on him--neck, ankle, wrist, anywhere. Eventually I gave the necklace away to a neighbor.It is well made. The clasp and the beads all seemed secure. No problems with quality.	
- 1	The suction on this always gives up so my baby whips it across the room  Its colorful but I wish they made it sturdier	
- 1	I bought this set at Buy Buy Baby in a pinch. I had been sending the small Pyrex glass bowl/blue lids to daycare and they were starting to chip. I wanted a set that was safe so I bought this as well as the Innate lid/bowl combo at the store.Overall I am not pleased with the price/design of the ThinkBaby product.ConsLike other reviews, the words scrape offI think the cup will be useless and I won't be using the spoon and forkthe plastic over the stainless bowl makes for extra pieces to wash and store since you don't want mold between themthe bowls are bulky and I am sure they will leak if I were to put a thin liquid in themyou can't microwave them so I must send items to eat cold otherwise daycare will just transfer the food into a plastic bowl which defeats the purpose hereWith that said, I really do like the rectangle piece with the latch lid. I also really really love the Innate bowl. It is a stainless container with a silicon lid that turns into a silicon bowl. Daycare is happy to transfer the food into the bowl and can microwave the puree/or pasta I send without the issue of leaching plastics and chemicals.Had I designed the set, I would have made them rectangle and added one w/ a two compartment option. There are plenty of times that I want to pack two small purees/items for daycare and must put a stainless ramekin inside the cereal bowl to separate the items. I am going to buy LunchBots next. Smaller container with less spots and it has the two compartment option.	
- 1	I have a love and hate relationship with Aden Anais... When I originally got the muslin blankets, I wasnt quite sure what to use them for at first... living in the midwest with frigid temps, I didnt think I could use these lighteweight blankets but after a few months, I ended up using them for everything, burp cloth, blankies, etc. My baby loved them so much that I bought her the loveys and the dream blankets... so then I decided to upgrade to these.. boy was I disappointed. Yes, they are soft but they are so much thinner and fragile than the originals which makes them useless. The fabric is also so delicate that they are easy to snag. For my intended purpose these blankets just didnt cut it. I am sticking to my beloved original muslns.	
1. 	This bib is AMAZING.When my baby started solids, a bunch of our regular cloth bibs were stained with carrots and peas, and broccoli, and mango. You get it.At first I didn't want to spend 12 bucks on one single bib... When you could buy a package of 10 cloth bibs for 5 dollars. But after ruining half of our bibs, I placed my order and God was I happy!It's wonderful, you can just wipe it or rinse it and you're done!The bottom pocket is awesome. It catches food and you can even use it as a bowl lol.We've been using this bib daily for over a year and I love it. We have the green one and color is still the same as when we first got it.My baby is now 17 months and still fits him great.	
- 1	Our spout has the knob for the shower closer to the wall instead of the end of the spout, so this was completely useless.  It's a bummer because the whale is cute and serves a good purpose.  Maybe I missed it in the description somewhere, oh well.	
1. 	It is just what I needed to organize my changer table.  Be aware that this product is not for a crib or a changer dresser or table top.  Also the edge of the changer table needs to be less than an inch for it to fit properly.	
1. 	This carrier far outshines the Snugli I tried first.  The Baby Bjorn is much more lightweight and better designed.  You can load baby in easily and there are no buckles in the back to worry about.  Adjustments are easy to make, both for your comfort and baby's.  My five month old daughter loves it for facing out when she's awake and alert, and when she gets sleepy I can quickly turn her facing in and she usually goes to sleep.  I went flying with her and they searched us everywhere, usually making me take her out of the carrier.  It was easily done, even with one hand holding other items.  A wonderful product.	
- 1	I had bought this for my son when he was a few months old.  We lived in an apartment complex on the second floor, so it was crazy to drag him and teh stroller down stairs.  I had bought this to make our daily walk to the mailboxes easy.  It worked great at first.  When he turned 4 months old I had problems.  I was packing the car to go on a trip with him in it.  IT was TOO tight around his stomach that he spit up in teh back of our SUV.  With him in it I couldn't even put two fingers between him and the carrier.  Never used it since	
- 1	I gave it to him when he was 1 month.... he did not even notice it. Tried again every month. Finally he noticed it when he was 4 months and was annoyed by it. At six months, he rips it out and throws it away. :(	
1. 	I was so hoping this would work with the drop ins bottles so I could pump right into the drop ins, but no.  It was a waste of money for me but I'm sure a dandy product.	
1. 	These blocks are well made and beautiful.  They're a nice size for my 8 month old to be able to grab and play with.  They're a very simple toy but they can be used in so many ways.  I think I have as much fun with them as my daughter!	
- 1	This was cracked in the back when we got it so we sent it back and got our money back.	
- 1	I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat.  The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit.  First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes.  Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard.  In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me.  I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter.  I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well.  My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work.	
1. 	This was perfect for newborn grandchild. Daughter was very pleased getting this as a gift.  Made baby bathing safer and less stressful for everyone.	
- 1	I got these liners because they were less expensive than others and had great reviews. Seriously, the people reviewing these haven't tried other brands. I love, love, love the Bummis and Bumkins liners. Compared to those two brands, the imse vimse feel like sandpaper. I put a few on the changing table so my husband would used them. When I asked him why he hadn't been using them, he said, Oh, I thought those were dryer sheets. Thats what they feel like, stiff, ichy dryer sheets. The Bummis and Bumkins brand are soooooo soft. All three serve their purpose, but I wouldn't want the Imse's on my butt! Bummis are my fave because they are on a roll, if you don't care about it being in a roll, the Bumkins are perfect. They all seem too big, so I just tear them in half and get twice as many!	
- 1	The KidCo Safeway gate works well with crawling babies but if you have an older child, 26 or taller, beware. Two long, rudimentary bolts extend out past the gate, top and bottom, to secure it to the wall or railing. The top bolt is directly in the path of a child's head and they can run into it if the gate is accidentally left open. It is not-self closing like other models.We installed it yesterday and it's coming down today. No way I'm leaving this up with 2 bolts sticking out and a four year-old in the house.For a safer alternative with rounded edges, that can't be climbed and can be mounted for stairs, consider theThe First Years Everywhere Gate.	
- 1	Pros- NoneCons-It is really a very thin strap. I got green color and it is so YUCK!!!. it was that birght shiny green color. They are so thin that they slide down. I returned them the very next day.JUST DONT BUY IT.	
- 1	Bought this for storage and washing of bottle items.  In my cleaning, it's been completely useless.  I couldn't store or wash Dr. Brown bottles in it, which is the type of bottle I have.  I opted to simply wash bottles by hand and sterilize in the microwave.  If you have smaller/wider bottles, this may be a better option for you.	
- 1	We ordered this wanting to use it with out preemie once he was discharged from the NICU and thinking it'd give us more peace of mind at home.What a mistake- despite reading the instructions and watching a video online, it still went off randomly at all hours.Plus having the monitor clipped to his diaper snugly left our little guy with skin chaffing which must have been uncomfortable for him.We returned this.	
- 1	This bag doesn't seem to be up to the quality you would expect from Ju-Ju-Be. The item also arrived with what looked like oil spots and a dirt mark under one of the front pocket flaps. I wonder if this is a factory second or a returned item that is being resold, but advertised as new? Also - there were two changing pads and I think it was only supposed to come with one .. neither of them had any kind of padding. Overall, very disappointed in the condition and quality. Thankful for Amazon's return policy as this bag went back the same day!	
1. 	If I could I would give this product 4.5 stars because it really only has a couple of minor things to take away from it. We bought this monitor before our second child was born, after discovering with our first how tricky it is to figure out if your baby really needs you to come in the room or not. Many times I would hear my son crying and not knowing what the problem is, sneak into his room- only to find he had fallen back asleep and then heard me come in and woken up again. Very frustrating at 3am. There was also the constant worry as a new parent whether or not he was ok- didn't have his leg through the bars or something else going on.This monitor is awesome and has come in SO handy for us, especially since we live downstairs and the nursery is upstairs. With a click of the button on top I can turn the screen on and see her sleeping peacefully. Or if she is crying I can click on it to see if she is crying in her sleep (crying but not moving), or really awake (squirming, eyes open). I can also tell if she has spit up, wedged herself into the corner of the crib, etc. Then I can run upstairs to help her instead of wondering what the problem is and whether I should risk waking her fully by going in her room. Not to mention she looks so cute when she is sleeping and I get to see her all the time. :)Things I like:Portability- battery lasts forever and recharges every night while we have it plugged in.Volume control- Very sensitive. I can make it loud or extremely soft.Screen size- Seems just right. The smaller one would have been a little hard to work with I think.Clarity of soundThings that I wish were better:Sometimes the video and sound flicker with some interference. Mainly in my kitchen for some reason. Or when I am using the cordless phone right next to it.The video can sometimes be a bit grainy, but most of the time we get a good picture.The camera could be little more adjustable. It goes in most directions but is tricky to adjust if you have it mounted on the wall instead of the crib.That's all I can think of. By the way, we also have the angel care movement sensor monitor, which sounds an alarm if it does not detect movement (breathing) for 20 seconds or more. In conjunction with the video monitor we joke that our daughter is under surveillance- but I love the peace of mind and convenience of both monitors...	
1. 	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.	
- 1	I sent these back, because I was looking for something flexible. The description was misleading & said they were flexible, but these are a thin hard plastic- only slightly flexible. It looks like the description has been corrected now. Silicone would have been nicer. These were also quite small, so they wouldn't be good for use with a toddler. They probably would be better for spoon fed babies.	
1. 	I bought the full baby cage and this addon and have used it since my son was just learning to move around.  Now, instead of caging him in I cage in the non-baby-proofed parts of my living room and it still works great.  The colors are friendly and the activity panel is fun. The keyboard is just the right height for a non-mobile baby to kick.	
- 1	These monitors were priced reasonably, but I would have rather paid more if that meant better quality.  My husband and I have to sleep with the monitor in our bed because it seems to be much less static if a person is close to it.  If we touch it, the static seems to decrease.  I do like the two monitors and that it can clip on your hip if you are moving around, but I find the static extremely annoying and disturbing.  Many other reviewers say that it may be their area.  Where is a monitor that will work in anyone's area??	
1. 	Good size,very durable,easy to clean but it's good to buy at least one change pad cover.The only thing I don't like is that the smaller sides of the pad slope down towards the edges so the baby hates to lie down with his head lower than rest of the body.	
- 1	I was looking for the bottles and the connectors to go with my Medela breast pump. However, the description did not make it clear that the pump connectors and shields are one piece. I thought it had the connectors that allowed you to change out the shield size. I wound up returning this item.	
- 1	I bought this product, but ended up returning it because I couldn't see how it would ever stay clean. There is no separate cover, so you have to actually wash the pillow itself. The pillow does break up into 3 sections, which makes that possible, though difficult. I bought a $20 body pillow with a washable case instead.	
1. 	I am not sure what all the complaints are about. The color is great and exactly as I expected. The dimensions are given online and the size of the dresser and drawers are also exactly as I expected. I think the quality is great, especially for the price. My husband (who is in NO way mechanically inclined)put it together in about an hour and half and said it was pretty easy. I love this dresser in my sons room and it matches his crib from Graco. I would recommend this dresser in a heartbeat.	
- 1	I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.  So easy to operate with very little clean up.  Recently I came across some reviews about the coating in the water reservoir flaking off.  As a result I LOOKED for it during my last meal prep and sure enough, I saw tiny little silver flakes.  It almost looks like oily water but under good lighting you can see the silver bits.  I rinsed it out 5 times and still see the flakes.  I'm very concerned as I just spent $100 on this machine.  Unlike the other parent who wants to know what the coating is chemically made up of, I don't really care. I don't think it's acceptable to have ANY coating come off whether it's 'safe' or not. I have no intention of using this anymore.	
- 1	Cute on the outside but the inside is just plain clear filmsy pages like a normal cheap photo album you get at a drug store. From the photo is seemed it might be more plush inside like pages from a true baby's book.I bought two as gifts to fill with pics and give as baby shower gifts to a close friend and family member. But now will have to rethink since the album isn't as nice as I was expecting.	
- 1	these cups are terrible.  They are heavy and extremely bulky.  Very difficult for our toddler to handle.  Don't like them at all!	
1. 	My daughter used this blanket until she was 3-months and started to fight the swaddle so much that she could no longer sleep in it.  Up until 3-months it worked great.  I didn't start using it until she was at least a month old and it made a huge difference in her sleep right away.  I would definitely recommend this to new parents and suggest that they swaddle from day 1.	
- 1	The decision to purchase this product was based on two things: 1) the reputable brand name and 2) the contoured shape of the breastpad. Upon receipt of the product, I was pleased. The pads were extremely soft and the size is nice (slightly larger than some disposables). However, they are THICK. Definitely not a discreet item here! And after even just one wash, the pads lost their shape and were bulky, making it even more noticable under clothing. After each wash I had to reshape them and lay them out to dry. I also think these move out of place more often than other breastpads I've tried. This is the only breastpad that has failed me during the day, leaving me with a huge wet spot on my shirt. I certainly would not purchase this product again.	
1. 	The lift out laundry bag is a great idea. The only problem - one washing and the hooks of the bag shredded - then, after only 5 months of use, the seam split open. I sewed the seam but you can't do anything short of replacing the hooks (they're fabric). Still, at 19.99, I didn't expect perfection. It looks good and the bag, as I said, is very handy.	
- 1	I purchased this item to go on the back window of my Nissan Versa, a very small car.  My husband try to put it up but the suction cups won't stay and, when it stretches to fit, will not cover the back window, which defeats the purpose.  Thank you to Amazon for refunding us on this purchase.  I am constantly impressed with your impeccable customer service.	
- 1	My two year old chewed these straws flat the first time she used the cups. If the straws were slightly heavier they would probably be fine but these didn't last more than a couple of uses each.	
1. 	Our little one loves this toy and plays with it over and over again, starting at 4 months and still now (6.5 months).  I'm sure he doesn't grasp the concept of it yet, but the lights and music hold his interest.	
- 1	Though this product worked perfectly for about a week, after that it became the bane of my existence.  At risk of sounding repetitive, the thing leaks.  It leaks when just sitting on the table.  It leaks if full or if only half filled.  It leaks even if you check it for leaks at the sink, see that nothing is dripping, and then hand it to your toddler.  Guaranteed, 5 minutes later, it's going to leak.  It leaks from the straw, it leaks from the threads (despite being threaded correctly) and I'm convinced it leaks from its very pores.There's quite a few other one star reviews telling exactly what happens (there's some kind of pressure buildup happening inside, no matter what liquid is in it, that causes the liquid to come back up out of the straw and drip everywhere) and there's even a video.  Watch that, and then avoid this cup like the plague. Really.	
- 1	While the sheet serves its purpose, it's rough material and I am concerned it may irritate my son's sensitive skin. I'll give it a few more washes to see if it softens up a bit. Very low priced so I guess I get what I paid for.	
- 1	I like the the tilt idea and that the cup is simple and lightweight.But it didn't come with travel lid, so for first months  couldn't take it outside the house (I just saw I can buy it separately). Also my 15 months old son loves water (like every child) and when I give him a cup he will spill water on the coffee table and play with it-spilling all over and than drink directly from the table. He figured it out immediately that there is constant spill when cup is upside down. Other sippy cups with the soft spout or some straws let kid drink with the suction only and there is no leakage. I have a better experience with Nuk and Avent cups and Thermos Funtainer bottle.I will keep them for later. Looks like the cup is better for older kids.	
- 1	This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!! My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!! Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully! She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!) she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!! If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support! IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!! It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!! Should've gone with this from the beginning.....	
1. 	I myself didn't purchase this but it was on my registry.  I'm going to keep it short but sweet.  Easy to use, easy to clean, I'm in control which makes it more comfortable and it's a great price (same with accessories).  I highly recommend this product.	
1. 	This fits perfectly over the changing pad, and it has the slits so the belt can fit through it correctly	
1. 	This is worth it. I haven't seen a baby who didn't love this. This will buy you enough time to take a shower (hang it in the doorway so you can supervise) or dinner with your family. Alternate this with an exersaucer for a nice change of pace.	
- 1	So we had a jumper than hung from the door jam and my 4 month old just loves it. However, she can get overactive in it and actually hit her head on the side of the door post in one of her excited twirls. So I thought this would be a good replacement as the seat twists to explore different toys.  Now, my daughter is in the 95% percentile in height and her toes just barely hit the ground which added to the fact that once seated, her weight is too much (15.5 lbs) to propel the seat around to explore new toys.  The toys are kinda lame and only a few of them even entertain her.  I dont know how they get away with charging so much. It seems to be 3 times the price I should have paid.	
1. 	I bought this rocker because my daughter didn't like the swing that we had. She's only two months old, but she likes this chair. This is the only place I can set her while she naps. Since it vibrates, I can set her in it, and she doesn't wake up right away like she does when I set her in her bed. I leave her in it with the kickstand up while she's napping, but she also likes being rocked in it.My two year-old also likes the chair. It seems pretty sturdy because he weighs 30 lbs, and he climbs all over it without hurting it. One downside is that it didn't come with any sort of infant headrest. We took the cushion out of an old carseat to keep her little head from flopping while she's in the chair.	
1. 	love these brushes. they're a perfect to the blue inserts that go in dr. brown's bottles. clean very well. good price for the 4 pack. would recommend to anyone whos using dr.browns bottles.	
- 1	This chair is small. I'm an average sized female and yet this chair is small. It is not comfy and quality is poor. The bearings squeak when rocking. We have had to use WD40 multiple times. Will be returning. Waste of money.	
- 1	This thing made us crazy. Usually Nuby products are well-made and reliable. This one leaked everywhere, no matter how carefully we secured the lid and handles, and no matter how often we cleaned it, it smelled like sour milk. Even after being run through the dishwasher on the sterilize setting. I threw it out about three weeks after I got it, because Nuby makes much better sippy cups and bottles for less expense.	
1. 	But of course, there will come a time when you spot your baby open the lid and spill the contents all over the floor.  :)	
- 1	I bought this stroller when our son was 1 month old and used it not even for 5 months and also occasionally. I found this stroller to be a piece of junk!! The back bends like a letter C and our son who is not even 6 months yet was so uncomfortable that I had to buy another stroller Peg Perego Aria and am so glad I did because it is much lighter than chicco and much sturdier. Peg Perego also has a bigger basket. In the end, I returned the Chicco, the customer service at BabiesRUs was so great that they gave us a store credit. Beware!!! The chicco stroller at the beginning seems to be great but after a while as the child gets older and heavier, the flimsy back bends!!! Don't waste your time and money on this stroller!!!	
- 1	I use an electric double pump and returned to work a few weeks ago. I bought this manual hand pump in case i was traveling or somewhere and couldn't use my electric pump. The first time I used it was after a wedding and it seemed to work fine. It was very efficient and I was impressed with how much milk I got considering it was manual. The pump was a bit loud but it worked. However, I used it again the other day and my experience was not so great. I forgot a part to my electric pump at home and remembered i had this one in my car. I decided to use it instead of driving home to get my parts. I figured it would take longer to pump but would still be effective. Unfortunately it was very painful and i had to stop pumping. I usually pump 3 times at work and could only do one regular length and one really short time. I'm still sore and raw the next day and its painful when my son nurses. I'm disappointed. It was the first time it actually hurt to pump. The pain I'm feeling is not worth using this pump again. Next time I'll drive home to get my parts!	
1. 	I've been using sleepsacks on my daughter since she was born. She's now two years old and still sleeps with one! I love it because I can rest easy knowing she's always covered. It's also awesome because when your kid is wearing one of these, they can't reach their pants/diaper and take them off! I have so many friends who complain that their kid is constantly taking off their diapers during the naps and I don't have that problem! The zipper is at the bottom of the sack, so she doesn't know how to unzip it (she's two and STILL hasn't figured it out!) I love these and I will use them with all my kids!	
1. 	Sturdy for my big baby! Comes with a thin changing pad that I think works great (little one is only on the pad for 20 seconds). Have used it daily for 8 months and still holds up very well even with a 22lb baby trying to climb, chew, and jump off of it.	
1. 	we got this stroller free at Toys R US for spending over $70 in the store.  I've seen this promotional offer before - I think they offer it pretty frequently in their coupon catalogs.We do have a sturdier Graco Travel system and it truly is the cadillac of strollers, but the only problem with it is how heavy it is.  Graco advertises how easy it is to open and close with one hand, but neglects to mention how you're supposed to haul the thing out of the car with one hand.  So, I'd been looking for a lighter umbrella stroller that I can easily pull out when I'm alone with my baby.  Plus, we're going on vacation soon and I didn't want to chance losing our big stroller in the airport.  So, we found this offer and jumped at it.  We figured, even if we hated it, at least it would last us for our trip.Well, I haven't had the stroller long, but already I love it.  It is surprisingly sturdy (for a free gift).  The canvas is durable but not scratchy.  The stroller is lightweight, easy to lift AND to open/close with one hand.I would never give up my Graco stroller - it's better for longer outings because it has the recline feature and really is more roomy, durable and comfortable (and has storage for diaper bags, etc).  But this is a great item to have as a back up.Wish it had an overhead canopy, but you can't have everything...I'm on the lookout for the next time T.R.U sends out another coupon so that I can pick one up for my mom.	
1. 	Our little guy has reflux, and he needs so sleep elevated. The problem arises when it comes to how to safely elevate him in his crib. If you put something under the mattress, yes he'll be elevated, but he'll also slide down the mattress at night, because the entire mattress is at an angle. We got one of these; problem solved. This thing goes under the sheet, so no fear of entrapment, etc, only his top half is elevated, so he doesn't slide, and he's happy as a clam. I'm not sure what all the reviews about it being in two pieces, and having a zipper are about, because the one I got is in one long piece, the width of a standard crib mattress. Maybe an older model came in two pieces, I don't know. Mine isn't like that. Anyway, if your little one has reflux, or needs to be elevated for some other reason, this is a really good way to do it.	
1. 	Love our Bundleme. We are currently using it with the Baby Jogger, City Mini Stroller and it's been a lifesaver during cold and windy days. It does not fit perfectly, but it's a 'universal' item and the best thing that I have found after thoroughly researching online. I have washed it a couple of times and it washes up well. The 'sprout' (limegreen) is a fun color. Too bad Baby Jogger does not have an accessory like the Bundleme designed for their strollers.	
1. 	We're at the phase where we start to wenture out without diapers. Instead, I take this seat in the bag. It's flimsy, yes, but I'm there to provide some back support as well. I would not use it every day at home, but it has allowed us to have some freedom while keepin up with her PT progress, and so far, we've never had a bad experience with it. At 28lbs, though, my daughter is probably putting less stress than a bigger kid.	
1. 	I recently purchased 4 Haba toys for my 9 month old.  He seemed interested in Ballino the first day, but hasn't spent much time with it since.  His favorite is Trix which he plays with for a long time, taking it around the house, banging it on furniture and, of course, chewing on it.  He also really likes Flapsi because there are interesting things to look at, it makes a neat sound when he flaps it and he likes chewing on the head and tail.  He doesn't spend much time at all with Haba's Triangle, but obviously every child will have different preferences.  I am still very happy to have tried them all and hope that he will go through different stages when he will find them all interesting.  Right now he is mostly interested in inspecting EVERYTHING in the house which is why I purchased more toys!  But I think I'm just going to have to let him explore awhile!	
- 1	The product itself is good, so I hate to give it a less than stellar star rating but I want to advise this mattress doesn't fit the graco pack n play on the go portable crib like I had seen noted in some reviews. Maybe if you're fine with sticking a towel in between the gap you could get away with it, but it's about 2 inches too short width and length. I went with a little larger dream on me product. As I stated earlier, still a good product just didn't work for my graco portable crib like advertised.	
1. 	Nice, I like how I can write on them with a dry erase marker.  However, they don't work too well on my gerber bottles. I put a piece of Saran wrap on before the cap and that solves the problem.	
- 1	I returned an earlier order because of erroneous information about sizing.  But I received a Thirsties prefold recently to try out.  The dense, heavy fabric - almost twice as heavy as a 100% cotton prefold - takes forever to dry.  It has a strange design in which double layers wrap around in a cylindrical shape, and it's too short unless you use it as an insert (but, then why call it a prefold?).  This isn't a true prefold.  It's one giant 2-layered sheet wrapped around itself and sewn closed in an infinite loop, so it's essentially 4 layers when laid flat.  It stains easily, and bleach doesn't even remove it.  However, if you have plenty of sunshine, the sunlight will gradually fade the stains.  It becomes stiff when wet - like cardboard; so it's not comfortable for baby.  Whichever way you fold it or use it, the combined 4 layers is too thick and stiff.  It's not organic, and the hemp is chemically processed.	
1. 	I ordered this for my almost 2 year daughter and it is gorgeous. Much better looking than in the picture.It is sturdy and putting it together was pretty easy. The hardest part was aligning the slats into the holes on both rails at the same time by myself. If I had waited and had somebody help it would've been a cinch. Otherwise it was super easy and didn't take long at all.The crib mattress fit perfectly, nice and snug. The weight limit is 50lbs but I have sat/lain on it and it held up fine although I wouldn't make a habit of it since I am 100lbs over the limit!I would definitely buy this bed again, it looks beautiful in her room.	
1. 	I searched high and low for a shopping cart cover for my daughter. She is just under 6 months old and isn't quite sitting up on her own. I asked a lot of friends and family about their covers and what they liked and didn't like. I read numerous reviews on here and I was hesitant to order this cover because the of the negative reviews regarding its size. I took this to Wal-mart and got a big size cart (in my area they are all large).  I put it in the seating area and my oh my it fit perfectly! It covered everything! I just can't say enough good things about this cover! I have no idea what those negative reviews are talking about. It is very cute, soft and feels like it will easy to clean. I love the toy hooks too. Just so many great things, possibly one of my favorite baby products I've bought so far.	
1. 	This is a great starter kit. It comes with plenty of bottles and extra nipples. Prior to these we used Dr Brown bottles. Everyone we knew used those and raved about the Dr Brown bottles. I thought they were great but they were tedious to clean. It had a bunch of parts and little nooks and crannies to clean. These playtex were a lot easier and faster to clean and gave me great results. Babies fussiness did not change and it was like we never took him out of the Dr Brown bottles. The way the bottle is shaped is great too. It makes it easier holding the bottle too. Overall I think these are great bottles compared to the Dr Brown ones.	
- 1	The price on these were quite reasonable, so I figured I would give them a try.  The first month or so that we used these bottles they worked great - so we ordered a ton of them.  Shortly after we started to have a terrible time with them leaking, despite the &#34;SmartClose&#34; feature.  They would leak in between the nipple and the nipple ring.  After we stopped using them I noticed that my infant's gas dramatically decreased after we stopped using these.  We never used the &#34;EasyMix&#34; mixing paddles, either, since they were just more parts to clean.We ended up switching back to the Playtex Ventaire bottles from our first child and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	I have an espresso wooden rectangular coffee table.  I bought two sets of these and they are working perfectly!  They come with 3M adhesive tape and attach securely.  For some reason, even when I measure and lay out the tape carefully the strips always were cut a little too short so I had to cut a few filler pieces for the spaces between some of the corners and the edging.  I applied the edge guard on both the top of the table and the lower table that sits close to the ground.My little one was making us so nervous from hitting her head on this thing before so now we don't have to sit there with our hands over the corners when she plays around it!  I know she will fall and bump her head from time to time but I think this could help prevent a serious accident.  When I googled some babyproofing options for coffee tables I read a lot of stories about some really gory coffee table accidents so I do think this is worth it even if they aren't the most attractive thing in the world!	
- 1	The idea and design of this swing is great. The function is not. Our baby is 13 lbs and the swing does not work well even on the highest speed. If she kicked or moved, the swing stopped and we had to give it a push to restart the swinging motion. The motor was very loud also. We returned it. Too bad because we liked the colors, size and the ability to plug into a wall outlet instead of using batteries.	
1. 	I bought this pillow because I didn't want to shell out the money for a boppy.  This pillow is wonderful!!  I use it everytime I breastfeed.  I also use it to keep the baby in place, just like in the picture.  This particular pillow does not come with a removable cover. They sell covers separately. If it gets dirty, you have to wash the whole thing, or spot clean it. This is a great nursing pillow for the price!!	
- 1	I had the original diaper champ with my first child, and boy do I wish I could find one of those!  In my opinon, this is one of those instances where the original is FAR superior to the 'new and improved' version.Pros - it's still nice to be able to use a regular trash bag instead of having to buy a specialized bag.Cons - Whew!  It's no longer odor-free!  Yes, having the diapers go through the channel with the lid on top helps, but when they created the new design they lost that 'lock' the old version had that prevented odors from coming back up through the channel.  This one also does not hold as many diapers as the old version did.  This one is supposed to hold up to 30 diapers, and 30 is a stretch.  Although with the odor issue, it's best to change out the bags 2-3 times a week, so the limit on diapers isn't such a bad thing.Bottom line - if you can find an original version, GET IT!!  It worked flawlessly for me for two years, no odor, no mess, very easy to use.  If all you can find is the 'Deluxe'.... try out a different brand.	
1. 	I was really struggling taking my 2 month old out in the cold. Bundle her up in a coat and hat, blankets, etc. Then we would get to the car, where the heat is on and she would be sweating. I love the Bundle Me. It is easy to install and keeps my daughter toasty warm. It is easy to pull back once we get in the car, so she is not sweating in the heat.	
- 1	I tried it on my umbrella stroller and the cover looked hideous. It looked like I was pushing a big, grey, box. The fit was very poor and there wasn't much ventilation.Unable to refund this junk since I removed the blue film on the plastic panels.Waste of 50$	
1. 	I just received this item as a baby shower gift, so my review is somewhate limited since I haven't actually used it yet! Nonetheless, a few things I noted. First, the way in which the hanging toys are attached to the activity bar is different than what is pictured. They do not go through loops that hang down from the bar, but rather velcro onto it. That's fine, except the velcro is backwards, in my opinion, for the cow. Or, the cow needs to have a face on both sides! The way it attaches, the baby looks at the back of it's blank white head! The cow should be for the baby, not the parents to look at! Also, the vibration is really, really loud -- at least without a baby sitting in the seat. I assume the baby's body muffles the sound, since no one else noted this in their review. On the positive side, it was simple to assemble and you can use it up to 40 lbs!	
1. 	I make my own baby food and I got both the freezer trays and the travel dish, so that I can pack food for my little guy to take to daycare.  It worked out great.  The food fits from the freezer trays right into this dish, so every night I popped them out of the trays and into the travel dish and put them in the refrigerator.  They defrosted overnight and my little one had food for daycare the next day.  Having the spoon right there was great too.	
- 1	I'm sure that some people like reusable bags, depends on how green you want to go but I just don't feel like I can get this clean enough to feel comfortable about using over and over again. The instructions say that you can put in the dishwasher or machine washable. I wouldn't want to put this in the clothes washer and it's hard to place in the dishwasher and keep it open and in place without it getting blown around the dishwasher by the water spray.To me these are like reusing a straw or plastic sandwich bag. Just get a new one. There are other places to save money on and other things make more of an impact in the landfill than how many times that I might use a plastic sandwich bag.	
1. 	Great nail clippers. They are very sharp, which is great when trying to go fast with a fussy baby or annoyed 6 year old.	
- 1	This thing annoys me so much.  I came on Amazon to find a different brand.  The velcro is incredibly weak.  I can not fill the thing up with diapers b/c it can't handle the weight.  It is very sloppy looking.  It's made of fabric and sags all over.  This thing looks nothing like the picture.  I do not recommend.

- 1	I managed to get it open once, used it, then found it difficult to open to refill.  I asked a couple of other people and none of them could open it easier.I'm going to leave this one and go buy anotherMunchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary; I had one of these before and it worked perfectly and easily for 2 years, first for formula and then for small snacks.  It was easy to open to refill but didn't open unintentionally.	
1. 	I loved my Graco high chairs in the black and white damask pattern because they were really cute.  BUT, I have twins and so I had two of them, cramming up my breakfast nook.  They take up a tremendous amount of space.  And, although they clean up beautifully, it takes some time to do so (you have to wash & dry the fabric covers, then scrub down the whole frame) .  These Healthy care Deluxe Boosters take care of both of those issues!  I now have a ton of room in my breakfast area and spend a tenth of the time cleaning them!  That means more time doing the stuff I want to do like play with my kiddos!!	
- 1	It doesn't fit how you would expect it to. The bottoms a Velcro strap that wraps around near the wheel but the top doesn't wrap around anything. You have to fold the canopy to secure it and that's not even secure at all. Maybe I'm putting it on wrong?	
- 1	Don't recommend this product -- very expensive, basic umbrella stroller.  While it is lightweight, the canopy is a joke -- way too small to provide sun protection for my granddaughter and it doesn't recline at all.  There are a lot of better strollers out there. Keep looking!!!	
1. 	I love this changing table. This changing table has lots of space for keeping babies things handy.  You can put everything you need like diapers, rash ointment, powder, wipes tee shirts ,burp cloths on one of the shelves and still have room for a few toys. It has ample room to change and dress the baby without any problems.  You may want to get a thicker changing pad though. I have never had a problem with this and I used it for two kids.	
1. 	I use these as well as the avent disposables. Never tried any other brand as I'm satisfied with these. Maybe I don't let down a lot but I've never had a leaking issue. My bras are mostly padded so they're not noticeable and even when I wear the non padded nursing bras they are still not visible. Love the included machine bag.	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
- 1	The car seat is designed for small cars and as such the angle is too upright and uncomfortable for our baby. Wish we had picked out a normal size car seat -- now we are stuck with this car seat until our son grows out of it.	
1. 	We have these on two of our outlets that are used quite often and I wish we had purchased these for most of our outlets instead of those plastic outlet covers that are nearly impossible to remove. We don't have any issues with ours closing and it is easy to slide when I need to plug something in.	
- 1	They don't really fit to your breast, so when I wear them under a thin tank top or bra you can see the edges.	
1. 	I was given some of these at the hospital when I delivered my baby as we were having major latch issues.  They worked so well that now we are exclusively breast feeding and no longer need to pump and use the bottle two weeks later, or one of those annoying nipple shields.  My only problem was that if I didn't wear them e.g. at night as Medela suggests then the nipples would get flat again, so I purchased an extra set and wear them all the time.  Wearing them 24/7 did cause some irritation initially but breast milk solves everything, and I make sure to air the area out after every feeding and keep them clean and now this is not a problem.  I hope with longer use I won't have to wear them all the time.  I also find that as long as I don't wear anything low cut then nobody would know I was wearing them, I am not on the huge side so I don't know if that makes a difference.  As an additional bonus they are a built in catch for leaking milk.ETA: at 6 weeks pp I no longer need to wear the shells so much, they have done their job and now I am wearing them for maybe 8 hours per day. Still love them!	
1. 	We bought this dresser a year ago for our daughter's nursery. I easily assembled it while my husband was at work. It looks great and the color is beautiful!	
- 1	I read the previous reviews on these pacifiers and bought a dozen of them.  Word of advice- don't.My son will NOT use them.  In fact, he hates them.  He only likes the MAM pacifiers.	
1. 	Very easy to use and blend up baby's food. Put vegis in, add some water, mix. It's that simple. Sometimes some of the bigger pieces won't blend as well, I just run a spatula through the blended stuff and either blend again or just pick those big chunks out and throw them down the sink. So glad I didn't spend 3x as much on the baby bullet, there was no need for that, it's just a brand name that people flock to. Save some money and but this one!	
1. 	I can't say enough about these wearable blankets. My little guy is 19 months, and he rolls around all night. Regular blankets don't stay on so these are perfect. He wears these fleece ones in winter with a fleece onesie underneath.	
- 1	I returned two of these Summer walk thru gates. (one was the extra tall but same gate). There is very little plastic on these gates but for some odd reason one of them is the hinge at the top! I can honestly say that this gate was used normally with no abuse. After the first two, I returned to the store but there was little else in my price range and not much selection so - for a third time I purchased the same gate! And I am sad to tell you the plastic hinge at the top broke again. Summer would have a fantastic product if only this one piece was improved. Very disappointed.	
- 1	i usually like the life factory company products but i do not like the sippy cup top on this on. its really hard to suck water out of it. my 3yr old can't, my 10 month old can't and can't either. i also emailed the company and they didnt help with the problem either.	
1. 	I have used this product for two weeks now with my 2.5 month old son.  We love the fact that it has a 45 minute timer on it, we've never used the 25 minute setting in all honesty.  I wish there were more options for timing settings above 45 minutes or maybe a remote control option so we could turn it back on if need be.I haven't tried any of the other sounds on my little guy, because he seems to love the simple white noise option.  It doesn't have any sort of beat mixed into it, in case you are wondering, it's simply a static-y noise.Originally I was using this too loud and my son would wake up when it shut off.  Now I keep the volume lower so it lulls him to sleep, but he doesn't get jolted awake when it shuts off.I've taken the sound machine itself out of the giraffe and we're using the giraffe as a toy right now.  The sound machine is pretty small and will fit into a tight space if need be.Good purchase in my opinion.  Now, my son is swaddled, in his sling, and with the addition of the white noise he sleeps for 10 hours straight every night!	
1. 	i was surprised to read all those negative reviews regarding this tub.  i had two different tubs before, and i got this one when my daughter was 5 months old, she's now one year old and still uses it.  granted, i never tried to fold it since those few inches don't seem to make much of a difference storagewise, so i don't know if its difficult to do.  i've had absolutetly no leaks with this tub, and the suction cups still work great.  the bathring works great, and can be moved out of the way when baby is old enough to sit alone.  although i still use the bathring so my daughter cant stand up all the time.  it's been 7  months with this tub, and nothing ever broke, or got worn.  i think this tub is great!!!	
1. 	Keep the bottle from leaking, seriously.  We still use the bottles/caps 3 years later to store milk for cereal for lunches, pack granola, etc.  They seal well, are well made and hold up for years.	
1. 	My son had quite a bit of colic and gas when he was first born.  We tried all the other bottles and had settled down with the Avent which were okay.  However, my Mom spoke to a friend who had had similiar problems with her baby and she recommended the Dr. Brown's.  We purchased some and we were impressed.  After two days he was less gassy and actually slept through the night.  I would highly recomeend these bottles.	
1. 	When we were potty training our daughter, my friend told me that the toilet trainer that goes on toilet might be better to use over the one that sits on the ground because if they get too used to the one on the ground, they may be scared to go on the toilet since it's higher up.  So we bought this one and even if they are still too small, you don't have to worry about them falling into the toilet because of the way it's made.  My son is 11 months and he can sit on the toilet on this and we don't worry about him falling in.  He may try to get off but we just sit there too and bring toys or things for him to do while he sits there and then he doesn't try to climb off.	
1. 	These work better than any deodorizer I've seen.  Pleasant natural smell, nothing nasty but enough to cover up any lingering smell that does seep out of a diaper pail.  Very happy!	
1. 	I've had these bibs for years and have used them since my oldest was 6 months. She is over 3yo now. The bibs are still completely functional and easy to clean. Two bibs + two kids + three years + still working like new = great investment! Definitely worth the cost!! Love them, buy them and you won't regret it!	
1. 	Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together. He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through! The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily. We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!! It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it. It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too! The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me. It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.	
1. 	So easy to use and works well.  Not bulky, easy to install, soft and comfortable.  Works with our Britax B-Agile.  7 month old enjoyed it from the get go.  Versatile.  We've used it in 50 degree to 30 degree weather.  We can cover our daughter up almost completely and add a hat so that she's very toasty, but she can pull her hands out or tuck them in depending on her comfort.  We fold up the stroller with this attached.	
1. 	I have this pump & it is heaven sent! My daughter was airlifted to a hospital an hour away after she was born & this pump saved me! It was comfortable to use, convienent to have & has a great little ice chest area. I stayed at the Ronald McDonald House for a while & it was great to have in the middle of the night - all I had tro do was oump & put the milk a3way right there. In the morning the milk was cold & I would bring it over. The bad is stylish & has room for everything you need.	
1. 	This pillow is great!  We use it every day.  It's a versatile pillow...can be used for tummy time and it aids if you are nursing, but mainly we use it as a seat/back rest.  My daughter is 3 months old and we just strap her in and she can sit upright.  It allows us to interact with her without having to hold her 24/7 and gives your arms a break!  My daughter takes naps on it all the time and I don't have to worry that she might fall out of it because the velcro straps keep her very snug and secure.  This pillow has been a godsend for the times that my daughter isn't interested in her toys and doesn't want to be held, but still wants attention and to be near us.	
1. 	I live in a townhouse that has 3 levels and I can't keep a diaper genie on each floor.  These bags really do the job.  They are scented just fine and lock in smell. They are perfect for traveling especially to someone's home.  By carrying these in your diaper bag, they won't even know you disposed of a diaper in their home. They could be priced a little better and come in a container instead of a box.	
1. 	I bought this for my father-in-law who watches my son during the day. He's been pretty happy with it. As with other brands, it would be nice if it were a bit longer. Most changing pads are meant for smaller children. My little guy is just now 2 and is 36.5&#34; tall, so his head and body won't fit on this at once.	
- 1	I purchased these along with several other types of sippy cups because a friend told me it would take a while to find one that he would like.  The name is a little misleading...I thought soft meant the spout would be squishy...more like a bottle, but it's really quite rigid.  I will reserve complete judgement of these cups because I figure I'll give them another go when he's a little older, but definitely not a good cup to start out with.  If you're looking for a good first sippy, my son really likes the NUK Learner cup with the silicone spout.  We used the NUK bottles so this was an almost seamless transition.  Infact they use the same bottle and just add handles and a differnt shaped nipple.  Highly recommend those!	
- 1	i ordered Britax foot muff for my 8 months old since winter is coming. This nicely fits in britax b-agile stroller and has agood material (looks great). Only, yet big, issue is it is so small. My daughter fits in here right now. Now it is fall here. When it is winter, i doubt she can use it. It is far shorter than its stroller. Even now it is difficult to zip if she is wearing a shoe. Just wondering why britax make it little longer and roomy. Or it should put product size. It is surely not one size product.	
1. 	As an old school grandma I was not sure any baby would ever sleep comfortably on his back without a cuddly blanket and stuffed toys. Well, they do, and do so safely with this great design.  Out baby is quite happy in this wearable blanket, part of his bedtime routine and he is content. Stays covered all night, fabric is soft, zips away from face with zipper stop cover. Price is good, shipping is faster than direct order from Halo.Have compared to other brands (mostly European) and like these best.	
1. 	I ordered these for my Dr. Browns bottles and they are great for them... I was pleasantly surprised to find they are univesal for my Medela and Gerber bottles as well.	
- 1	We were very hopeful when we got this that it would substitute for the way car rides relax our baby.  It did not.  A few things...First, the fabric was not what I was expecting...feels cheap for some reason compared to other fisher price things we have gotten.Second, the motion does not soothe our daughter.  This is subjective - - we realize all children are different, and also that in the future it may soothe her even though it has not yet in the month plus we have had it.Third, it does not hold a baby like a car seat does...between the fabric quality and the seat itself, it is just not snuggly enough if that makes sense.  I feel like our daughter sleeps well in her Chicco car seat...she is snuggled in and cozy.  This does not have that effect.Overall, save your $ - our swing and bouncy worked much better then this.	
1. 	I reviewed this for the basic Fisher Price Healthy Care instead of here for the Deluxe, so you can read that review for more details.It's great and I would recommend to anyone looking for an alternative to a stand alone high chair!	
1. 	I love this. Saved me. Take it with me to work and pump 2-3 times, get about 8-10 oz all together. Pump for 10 min each time. Easy to clean. I also have Pump in Style and cannot get nothing. Went to lactation consultant 4 times and finally took this out of despair and it worked!	
1. 	I bought this for my 8 months old daughter after she had been using the BabyBjorn potty for a month or so. I realised that it wasn't much fun cleaning the potty so decided to give this toilet seat a go and it's been working great for us. My daughter is happy seating on it, it's small enough for her and it's very easy to install, put on and take off.	
1. 	These bibs are really inexpensive and have a waterproof liner.  The bibs are absorbant and they can keep my baby's clothes from getting soaked.  They won't last all day - I still have to change her bibs pretty often.  But I can go a lot longer between bib changes with these bibs compared to regular bibs. They are about as absorbant as some Carter's waterproof bibs that I have.  My baby is a little droll machine and I am on here to buy antoher package of these bibs.	
1. 	I was hesitant to use any type of breast shield as the information that I had been given said that they would cause a decrease in milk supply or nipple confusion for my baby.So, for the first few weeks of breastfeeding I suffered.I cried, bled, and my husband practically begged me to stop, as he couldn't stand to see me in so much pain.As a last resort before quitting breastfeeding I went to target and bought this shield after much research.  I decided that it was at least worth trying and if my milk supply decreased, it would at least be better to have some milk rather than be forced to use formula.I wish I would have known how much it would have helped since day 1.  Once I used the shield, I could finally stand to give a full feeding without using a painkiller.  The cracks in my nipples finally had a chance to heal!  Within a week or so, my nipples were healed using combination of lanolin and APNO cream (which also works miracles).  After a few weeks and fully healed nipples, I weaned myself off of the nipple shield and since then have been exclusively breastfeeding without having to once resort to formula or bottle feeding.Without the shield I don't think it would have been possible to properly heal the cracks in my nipples, which at one point bleed so bad and caused me to get infectious mastitis and have to take antibiotics.  I wish it were more common to recommend them especially in the beginning when the babies mouths are smaller and less likely to get a full latch.  I found my milk supply was not at all affected and actually seemed to go better for me as I was more likely to do more frequent feedings on both sides with the shield.UPDATE:At my son's last health check, he was 4 months and 18 lbs 12 oz and 26.5.  He has been consistently in the 95th percentile for height and weight (based on WHO charts for breastfed babies) since the third week (when I started using the shield), so this is a testament that I had no decrease in milk supply.  I also have been able to pump a small supply for emergencies.  Before the shield, he had lost more than 10% of his bodyweight at birth and they recommended at both the hospital and doctors office to supplement using formula.  I DID NOT do this, and stuck with breast only, and with the help of this shield, have continued to exclusively breastfeed throughout.Good luck to everyone and stick with it!	
1. 	We are very happy with this booster seat.  Started training our baby girl to sit at the table with us when she was about four months old and she took to this very well.  We had to prop her up a bit with some rolled up towels on the sides, since she likes to lean over and watch our dog underneath her.  The trays pop right off after feedings and we just run them under hot water with some soap or use wipes and they're like new.  Same with the seat.  Only thing that's hard to clean are the white straps, but not a big deal.	
1. 	It is exactly what we were looking for!  It is always good to have back up so you have it when you need it!	
1. 	This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.	
- 1	I know this product is marketed as &#34;lightweight knit,&#34; but I didn't expect it to be as paper thin as it really is.  There isn't a chance of this offering any sort of warmth for my kiddo.  I was supremely disappointed in this buy as I've been a loyal HALO customer and, with the exception of this item, have always been impressed by their quality.  This item was not up to HALO's standards; I'd recommend looking at other HALO products if you are looking for an item that will offer warmth and/or security to your little one.	
- 1	I have been using this stroller for a year as a full time nanny/baby planner, and I have never liked it. Here's why:- Short handles: I'm 5' 7 and I hate hunching over this thing.- Short seat: He was too tall for this stroller before turning two! And since the minimum age is 6mo, we got 1.5 years out of it. That's pathetic for a stroller- Skinny seat: no winter coats here - especially after baby turns one.- Small, practically inaccessible basket: hard to get to, and holds very littleI could go on...	
- 1	We have owned two of the $200 Summer video monitors in our son's almost 4 year old life and when the sound started going on the 2nd of those monitors as it did the first, I thought surely there's a competing product out there that's priced better. So I bought this one based on the mostly positive reviews. Meh. People are clearly only impressed with this one if they haven't ever owned the other. I myself wouldn't use this Infant Optics monitor with an infant. The video quality is too inferior. You would not be able to see details such as the chest going up and down when you want to check the baby's breathing in the night, either out of general nightly paranoia that new parents have or because the baby has a cold or if a child has asthma, whatever. On the Summer monitor you can see that. The Infant Optics picture is really digitalized looking, not finely detailed. It's ok for our 4 yo because all I need to see is if he's in his bed or about to fall out of it as he can sometimes do. I keep the sound on constantly because I don't want any issues with not hearing him call for me. The camera that's placed in the baby's room - nobody has mentioned this and I can't fathom why - it is lit up all bright like a freaking UFO. It's crazy. It lights up the room enough to almost serve as a night light. There are several bright bright red lights around the eye of the camera and a blue or green light on top that bounces off the ceiling illuminating the room. (I covered up the top light and it helped; on the Summer monitor it had one bright green light and I always covered that one too.) To people with new babies, or parents of a child who really struggles to fall asleep, your child may lay there and stare at the red lights, not fall asleep. And there's no way you could do something like we did with the Summer monitor, which was place the camera inside the crib just a foot away from our swaddled newborn so we could see him so close up we could monitor his breathing all night very easily both by sight and sound. If you put this camera inside the crib your baby would not sleep a wink all night long. I'm really glad I saved our old faulty Summer monitor because I don't have a huge amount of confidence this one will last very long, based on how flimsy it feels. But that's an impression not an actual experience with its reliability. Will check in later in that regard. Still, another reviewer said they wished they'd just sprung for the Summer monitor again and that's how I feel too in comparing the two products.Update: I am returning this monitor. I'm done. I was already not happy with the quality of the sound and last night what I suspected would happen did happen -- my son woke and called for me and I didn't hear it at first because the sound was so quiet, muffled and distorted. He's saying Mom but all I could hear was a weird sound that reminded me of recordings of whales singing underwater. It's ridiculous. In fact I think Amazon should investigate the legitimacy of the 5-star reviews of this product because I can't imagine any parent really finds this sound quality acceptable.	
1. 	I love the bumkins bibs, they are easy to wash, catch most of the dropped food in the pocket, and are cute.  This bib is great for keeping our son's shirt and sleeves clean, but it is always a fight to get it on him.  Our little guys just doesn't have the patience to put his arms through it, he just wants his food.  As a consequence, we don't use it very often.	
- 1	Yes, it is light weight and folds up compactly but everything else about it I hate.  I am 5'4&#34; and still kick the back wheels often, the red safety lock does not snap easily, in fact, it broke in less than a month of using.  The brakes (front or back) do not lock well.  The canopy got lopsided at one point after it folded up.  It does not recline (I know it says it does, but it really just unzipping the back of the seat).  And the buckle is difficult to click and lock in.  I also have a Bob Revolution for hikes on trails and in parks, and love it.  But we live in San Francisco so I need something light and easy to get around town with my little guy.  I am returning this one, and going to suck it up and spend double of the money to buy an Uppababy G-luxe for everyday use, and we will see how that one is going to go...	
- 1	These are affordable, compared to the 100% cotton and bamboo ones that I had, so I thought I would try them out. They are terrible. Water just rolls off of them, and they don't clean very well. They also seem rough compared to the natural fiber ones. They don't do much when dry, and when you wet them, the water beads up on them and makes a mess. Don't bother.	
- 1	Great to be used as a teething solution - put ice cubes in the net and let baby chew and sucks on it. But as far as using it for fruit - everything stains the white net. Every time I put a banana in it, I had to throw a net away because there was no way of me washing out all the mess out. I tried numerous time by hand and in a dishwasher..... I think this is a great idea, but it just doesn't work all that well.	
1. 	Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.	
1. 	This is a great all purpose blanket.  It is large enough that all three of us can comforatbly lay on it.  It is also nice that is has the waterproof fabric on both sides so it is very easy to clean.  The folding is super quick with the soft plastic guide so that even my husband can do it neatly.  We use this mat everyday outside and it still looks great.  Perfect for the park, beach, or even at amusement parks to stake out your place.	
1. 	These are great - I am so glad I found them. I even own the pumpin' pals large and xtra large and I still will reach for these sheilds instead. I get a great output of milk with these vs pumpin' pals decreased my output (I have read that it takes a week to notice an increase though?). Anyways, these work great - no pain and are easy to use.	
1. 	These are great because they are waterproof, don't stain easily, and are easy to get on and off.  I love the colors and I love that they are plain bibs.  They are fairly absorbent.  The only thing that is bad is that my dryer tends to melt the inside layer and then they are misshapen and I have to throw them away.  Not dryer safe on high heat!I have two sets and they are my favorites.	
- 1	Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his equipment being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).	
1. 	Stays on, easy to clean and quick to dry.  Will buy another.  Great gift as well.Fun prints to choose from.	
1. 	I used these in the first year of my daughters life to store expressed breast milk.  I have the Avent pump (which I LOVE) so with the adapter I could pump right into these, very convenient. I had a lot of milk stored in my freezer I really appreciated how nicely they stacked and that they didn't take much room.  I never had problems with spilling.  As a disclaimer to that, I will say that I didn't transport milk daily and that I rarely filled the cups completely.I appreciate them even more now that I'm done pumping.  While bottles and plastic bags are either causing clutter in my cupboards or have been thrown out, these are still frequently used.  They're a perfect size for on the go toddler snacks.  I also use them to store sides for my husband and I when we take lunches to go or to store small amounts of leftovers (usually headed for my toddlers lunch the next day).Overall, these are a good choice for milk storage based on their potential long-term usefulness!	
1. 	We purchased to have this as a &#34;to go&#34; spoon, and it ended up being a favorite spoon.  Best for ages 6mo-10mo, after that they bite too much and want more substantial spoon.	
- 1	I bought this after reading all the nice reviews on this, however I hate this product after buying it cz the lid sucks! It is impossible to remove the lid. I literally hurt my fingers opening it or spill formula out. I assumed I need to rotate the lid to move from one compartment to the other, but the lid does not rotate at all! I am very disappointment and am already browsing for a better formula dispenser now!	
1. 	These are thoughtfully designed. Our 14 month old uses them easily for snacking on cheerios. He loves to hold the container by its handles. Yes, sometimes he drops a few cheerios, but this still prevents a ton of mess. They are BPA free and seem very sturdy and safe. The munchkin packaging (not the shipping packaging, but the packaging on the actual snack catcher) was a pain.	
1. 	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the what does the world look like story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  I highly recommend this to every parent! It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!	
- 1	I purchased 4 Dr. Brown's Natural Flow glass bottle systems because my husband and I don't want to expose our little girl to toxins in plastic bottles which diffuse into breast milk.  Dr. Brown's glass bottle solves the plastic bottle problem but introduce another with the off-gassing vent assembly insert that yields the natural flow.When the bottles arrived I was happy with the glass bottle, but the chemical smell was overwhelming. The source of the smell was the neoprene-like insert to be installed inside the bottle. The neoprene gives off a strong chemical smell that would be in direct contact with my baby's milk and diffuse into the milk. (Remember from chemistry, diffusion is the process of things moving from high concentrations to low concentrations.)Concerned, my husband called the Dr. Brown's company and spoke to the director of operations, a chemical engineer. He would not confirm or deny that chemicals in the neoprene would diffuse into the milk and tried to reassure us by saying that the material was food grade and FDA-approved. We are not reassured. The plastic bottles with BPA are still being used as FDA-approved containers. Just because it is food grade or FDA-approved does not mean it is toxin-free.Be careful of greenwashing - the selective display of a virtuous attribute of a product meant to impart goodness on the whole thing. Please add a thread if you find a bottle system that doesn't smell like a plastics factory - we are still looking and our baby will be born in December.	
1. 	We bought this play yard--and the two-panel extension kit--in 2010.  We are still using it in 2012!  Mind you, we only used it once as a play yard for our twin toddlers.  It isn't big enough for them outside, and as soon as the novelty wore off all I got was whining.  Moreover, had we tried it again I'm sure they would have figured out in minutes how to just pick the thing up and crawl under.What we used it for is babyproofing, in about a thousand different configurations.  We originally divided our open kitchen/dining room in half, which allowed us to totally block off the front half of the house from the kids.  Then, when we opened up this part of the house, we used it to block off certain areas (kitty litter/cat food area, trash can/broom area, treadmill area).  We also took four of the panels with us on vacation--used two to block the TV and the other two to seal off the deck steps.  We've taken a panel to my mother-in-law's house to tie it to her stair banisters.  And we've used two panels to seal off the steps for our own deck, making an outdoor playpen out of the deck all of last summer.I highly recommend buying several sets of theKwiktwist Giant Twist Tie 2-Pack- Redso you can attach these to table legs, banisters, or any other furniture.  (We've even put a few screws in the walls and tied them in place.  You can  also of course use any other type of tie-line or fabric to tie these in place.)I can't imagine anyone--except maybe a family with a completely uninquisitive, mellow, obedient child (does such a thing exist?)--being sorry they made this purchase.	
1. 	LOVE this potty - it's so easy and comfortable for our son to sit on. Picked this one up after starting out with a Fisher Price potty that didn't have a splash guard (stupid me!), which was frustrating for everyone involved (trying to tell/help a 2-year old to point it down... yeah, right) - as soon as our son tried this one out for the first time, his motivation level skyrocketed and he quickly became excited about peeing in the potty, instead of dreading it. The design and height are perfect, and the seat is easy to remove and empty (so much better than the ones where you have to slide the potty part out to empty it). Best potty ever!	
- 1	Not sure why there are so many good reviews, this blanket is not soft at all!!!  In fact, it's feels quite scratchy.  I gave it 2 stars for at least it's a decent size blanket.	
- 1	I should have got the pull up but right after birth I put it on and yes, I was still a bit chunky but the zipper popped off instantly which for this expensive girdle I would have thought it would have held up better. The material does seem good quality but for me, it was money down the drain.	
- 1	It's a beautiful car seat, but as soon as you place a child in it you see that the leg strap is under his bottom.  And my son is only 31 lb right now, about 3 foot high. so we're not talking giant here.  We did not buy it.  We looked at Evenflo Maestro and Britax Frontier... And we bought Britax.  May be the difference in quality between the 2 is not the same as the difference in price, but we just could not resist.Do not buy a car seat based on reviews only.  Go to the Babies R Us and try!	
1. 	I loved this. I don't covering up while nursing but if you have to this is the Cover to get. At least you can see the baby and don't have to worry about cloth covering them completely. The wire rim is awesome it however isn't very pliable. I do wish it had some sort of strap to tie it around that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I would recommend this to anyone who is breastfeeding.  It is the best one on the market as far as I am concerned.	
1. 	I travel for work, and bring these with me on  my trips. No problem getting thru TSA, and very easy to use. Without these, pumping on the go would be much more challenging.	
- 1	This product is a mess! It was a pain to fill, it leaked everywhere. So irritated! Would not recommend! Blah	
1. 	We use this gate to block baby from going into the kitchen.  But the primary entrance/exit to our house is via the kitchen, so we needed something easy to open with your hands full.  Voila, the hands-free gate!  It is great, you can open and close it with your foot and knee just like the other reviews state.  We had to buy 2 extensions, one on each side of the gate to cover the opening to our kitchen.  They work great, we have had no problems.  I have two complaints, but they do not outweigh how much I like this gate:  First, the gate was difficult to install.  There was one part that wouldn't fit properly, my husband had to bend something with pliers to get it to fit on.  Caused about 10 minutes of extreme aggravation, haha.  Second, the pedal is so noisy when you push down on it!  I need to try some WD-40 to see if that will help, I honestly haven't tried that yet.  But still, we really like this gate and the noise problem doesn't change that fact!  Baby hangs all over it and I don't see how she would ever be strong enough to press down on the pedal herself and open it, you really do need to press hard!	
- 1	Even out of the package there was barely a scent, these fresheners do nothing to freshen up my baby's nursery.	
- 1	This frame is very nice but the picture opening is (best guess) only 2x2.  It's tiny!  The entire frame itself isn't even the size of a 4x6 picture.  It's completely my fault for not realizing the dimensions were the entire frame, but Amazon was great about refunding me.	
1. 	Several weeks ago I left a 2 star review for these bottles due to the cost of always having to buy liners with twins...as you can see I have since changed my mind and deleted that review. Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners. I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls. You can use different brands of bags for these as well.	
- 1	This 5 oz bottle came with a size 2 nipple which was way too fast of a flow for my breastfed son. Much better bottles out there.	
- 1	This is one of my favorite baby purchases.  It keeps the wipes nice and warm and it's easy to maintain.  I rinse the pillow when I get to the bottom of my wipe supply.  Depending on the brand of wipes I use, some of them don't pop-up through the opening, but it's easily fixed.  The Huggies brand wipes seem to work best, as they are connected to each other with perforations and not just stacked together.  This is a great gift idea for someone that is expecting or for yourself!!!1/17/14 Update- Well after using this product for 14 months, it has brought on a concern.  A week ago, I noticed the light on the front was not working.  When I investigated the cord, I discovered that the metal piece that attaches to the warmer, was corroded.  I immediately unplugged the cord from the wall, and also found that the inside of the warmer was cold.  This scares me because it could have caused a fire.  I am not in the market for a new warmer, as it's winter and cold wipes are not enjoyable for my son.  I have contacted Prince Lionheart and hope to have an answer from them soon.	
1. 	Was really messy but with some coconut oil and baby wipes we were able to remove all the ink.  We did the footprints while baby was very sleepy which I would recommend and they turned out great.  It does take 2 people to get a good print, one to hold the baby and the foot, and another person to press the ink on the foot, and then the foot onto the paper.  We tried to do handprints but baby has a really strong grasp reflex so they didn't turn out as we hoped, but that is no fault of this kit.	
1. 	We were given this co-sleeper by a friend and absolutely love it.  The baby is close by and it makes night time feedings go much smoother.	
- 1	The Baby Kicks Joey Bunz Premium inserts are much better than the Thirsties hemp inserts: the Joey Bunz dry in half the time, they're contoured, they're softer, and they're organic. I had to either put the Thirsties through the drier twice or hand them to dry after an hour in the drier. I don't recommend the Thirsties.	
1. 	I received this for a baby shower gift and was very excited.  As keeping out odors it works great, and keeps our 60 lb. dog out of the diapers.  Although I'm only giving it 4 stars because they could do a better job at letting you know when the flim is going to run out, or give you an estimate amount of diapers you will get with one fill.  You always have to keep one on hand in case you run out, kind of like diapers.  Plus I think they could make them in fun colors or something I think they are kind of ugly, so we purchased a diaper genie cover through kids line.  It's a cloth cover that matches our barnyard bedset.  As long as you read the instructions and follow them to the tee you should get along fine!	
- 1	I love the older version of this cup that doesn't change color but could not find it in store so I got this one. First wash on the top rack of the dishwasher and it melted. A very poorly manufactured product.	
1. 	I don't leak very much by my standards but these are definitely useful at giving me peace of mind. I bought two packs so I'd have enough for the work week. They're visible through your shirt if you have a thin bra and skin tight shirt but I don't wear hooker clothes and I usually wear a cardigan so its not a problem for me.	
1. 	We have a four-month-old daughter who has been using Playtex VentAire standard bottles for the past month with notable success.  They have worked nicely for the following reasons:1. The bottles did not cause the dreaded nipple confusion when transitioning between the bottle at daycare and breastfeeding when baby is with mom.2. Although it does have a lot of pieces, the fact that the bottle disassembles completely makes it easy to thoroughly clean and disinfect its various parts.The bottles have presented one challenge:1. Replacement parts - like extra slow flow nipples - can be hard to find.  Nipples wear out, and wanting extras to have on hand, I ended up buying extra bottles instead because it was nearly impossible to find the slow flow variety (and it was cheaper to buy extra bottles from Amazon than to pay the exorbitant shipping from the two sources who sold the nipples separately).UPDATE (3/2012): As my daughter has reached her first birthday, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding. We have also used Playtex Drop-Ins. This is how the two compare:1. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).2. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). (In both cases, this refers to the slow flow nipple variety for each bottle.)2. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider.	
- 1	I bought this cup after reading all of the great reviews. I should have listened to the few negative reviews about how difficult it is to suck from. I tried this cup, and I could not get any liquid out without sucking really hard! No way could a toddler get anything out of this cup. Threw it in the trash.We now use the OXO Tot straw cup and it is perfect!	
1. 	This was exactly as promised in the advertisement, one piece.  I found that I couldn't use as easily with my pumping bustier, but it does deliver a more air-tight system compared to those that pull apart.	
1. 	If this little piece gets lost, or don't think of the trauma of it coming out of our sterilization bag and going down the drain...your pump won't work without it.  And the membranes do wear out if you take them apart to truly clean your pump.  It is a great investment.	
1. 	I like this brush as it doesn't spray water all over me when I take it out after scrubbing my Medela bottles, which I found was an issue with other brushes I tried and the small opening of the bottles.  The bristles are very soft though and you sometimes have to scrub quite hard to get the last of the breast milk grease out of there, especially if the bottles haven't been soaked long before cleaning.  However I would rather put a bit of effort into scrubbing than get a face full of dish water at 3am which is why I am giving it four stars.  Another thing I don't like too much about this brush is that it doesn't come with a separate nipple brush, the end of the brush is shaped to be able to scrub inside the nipple but when I am cleaning my pump it just doesn't work and I end up using the nipple brush from another bottle brush I own as that can actually get into some of the smaller parts of the pump.  We have been using the brush for over two months now and it has stood up to some pretty heavy use.	
- 1	I really wanted some velvet baby hangers, and these were a great bargain!  Unfortunately, they seemed very cheap.  I returned them because they were starting to shed the &#34;velvet&#34; material the first day I got them.  Disappointing.	
- 1	Difficult if not impossible to fit on spout, has no hole for shower pull. The paint was also already wearing off ontop the hippos head, like it might have already been used?	
1. 	I really like this carrier. I'm on the east coast and my baby was born in late fall so it got cold quick so I haven't used it outdoors yet. But even within the apartment building - checking mail, taking out trash, doing laundry, it comes in handy. I also use it at home while cleaning or getting things done. My son enjoys it. Haven't used it front facing yet.	
1. 	This toy inspires me. I messed with it constantly when my son was an infant and too young to understand how to add and subtract instruments from the full orchestra sound. Now he gets the full functionality of the toy. It lasts for years, offering various entertainments to various ages of kids. Classical music is awesome for babies and little ones, so we love this. Warning, it's very heavy. Don't put it in your backpack when traveling to grandma's (we learned this lesson). The rubberized bumpers on the corners are fantastic for safety. We're never giving away this adorable musical toy.	
1. 	I don'[t want to offend anyone, but I had to laugh at the reviews criticizing this product for only working well the first time.  Do we not understand the meaning of 'TAKE N TOSS'?  They're meant to use one time, and then toss.  They go everywhere with my Daughter and I.  I love they're disposable so I don't have to lug around a dirty sippy all day.  They're cheap enough I bought sets to get through the summer.  I'd highly recommend these.	
- 1	I ordered this to transition my baby from a bottle to a zippy cup...needless to say this one did not do or work very well! The handles are too close together and my child can't grasp it and drink at the same time...it would be better if the handles were more far apart. Also, my little girl did not like the nubby nipples. I guess they were too big for her and she just didn't like it. Going to try another brand!	
1. 	I wanted a snap-n-go type stroller for our Chicco Keyfit carseat.  This worked perfectly.  I found the stroller to be well-made and easy to steer.  It was easy to open one-handed (while holding a baby or carseat) and has a spacious basket that was pretty easy to access, even if baby was in the stroller.  We were very happy with this stroller and glad to find one that worked well with the Chicco Keyfit.	
- 1	I love the concept, too bad the product wasn't very durable.  Unfortunately, my tray cracked after two weeks of use.  I moved on to silicone and haven't looked back since.	
- 1	The description states that this is compatible with all the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmers, but if you notice the pictures they have posted only show it with a generic wipes box or just holding the diapers.  This is because the wipe warmers are considerably larger and do not actually fit flush in them.  There are two small groves in the Prince Lionheart Wipe warmer that allows it to be forced onto it, but the wipe warmer hangs over the edge.The main reason I purchased this diaper depot to hang on the side was to hold the wipe warmer and diapers and save space on the changing table, but I don't think this one is going work.  The wipe warmer looks like it would just take a bump to send it tumbling and not very secure on the diaper depot.  If you are just using plain wipes without the warmer, it would probably be alright.  I primarily bought it to go along with the Prince Lionheart wipe warmer, so I'm left pretty disappointed.&#34;Compatible&#34; and actually fitting seems to be two different things....	
1. 	Using this for my toddler (2yo) in his bathroom. Have not noticed any difference between this product and cheaper step stools. It is sturdy, nice-looking and serves the purpose - even though for some people it makes sense to buy a cheaper one.	
1. 	I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).	
1. 	I bought this rocker because my daughter didn't like the swing that we had. She's only two months old, but she likes this chair. This is the only place I can set her while she naps. Since it vibrates, I can set her in it, and she doesn't wake up right away like she does when I set her in her bed. I leave her in it with the kickstand up while she's napping, but she also likes being rocked in it.My two year-old also likes the chair. It seems pretty sturdy because he weighs 30 lbs, and he climbs all over it without hurting it. One downside is that it didn't come with any sort of infant headrest. We took the cushion out of an old carseat to keep her little head from flopping while she's in the chair.	
- 1	Very dissatisfied with this monitor. When it works, the picture, zoom, and sound are fine - both in night vision and daytime - and it's a relief for new parents like us to be able to see our sleeping baby. HOWEVER, the system itself is of very poor quality. We have been through two of these monitors now. The first one just stopped working in the middle of the night. The second no longer holds a charge, even though the battery indicator says it's full.  When plugged in, the charging indicator light sometimes says its charging, sometimes not. The monitor often blinks randomly over to &#34;out of range&#34; and beeps before eventually coming back. Using the antenna seems to make no difference for reception or range. We never use the VOX option because we can't be sure whether the baby is quiet or the monitor has stopped working again. Having such an unreliable monitor eliminates much of the peace of mind a monitor is supposed to provide. Buy another model until Samsung works out their quality issues.	
1. 	Purchased this crib for our first baby in June 2010.  The baby will be here in September, so we haven't had a chance to try it out yet, however, the first impressions are very good.  The crib is sturdy, took us about 30 mins to set it up and it was very easy.  Does not require any special tools, and as long as you follow the directions it is very easy.  The crib is a lighter color than what is portrayed in the picture (it is not much honey), but I'm okay with that.  Also we bought a Sealy mattress with this and it fit perfectly within the safe guidelines.  The rails also are close together, and fit the safety guidelines set by the AAP. It seems very easy to convert to a toddler bed.  We didn't buy the rails for the full size bed because it seems a long time from now, however, I'm thinking that you don't have to buy the 100$ rails from DaVinci to get this working.  I think that any kind of full size rail should work because you're working with a headboard and a footboard...but that's just my opinion - I haven't done any research in it. Looks like a very safe crib though...I guess time will tell how sturdy it is. :)Will try go get an update when the baby is here.Added Feb 2011:  We've had the crib for 4 months now.  It is still sturdy and works great, no problems with it.  The only thing I don't like is that the crib is really deep and because I'm short I have to bend to get the baby there and sometimes he will wake up.  I'm 5.3 and definitely need some height adjustment in order to get him in his crib peacefully.  I'm sure this won't be a problem soon when he can sit up on his own.	
- 1	For some reason they do not contain the order like they use to.  It stinks up the room and it is not even that full.  Not to mention the fumes you get when you drop your diaper in it.  We had to buy a freshner for the room.  We use to buy these at babies r us, so I am not sure if the ones coming from amazon are made differently.  My next purchase will be from BRU and then I will update this if I do notice a difference.	
- 1	&#34;Fits most faucets&#34;... but this did not fit ours. Its cute, but we won't be able to use it. Too bad, its the only faucet protector to fit our baby's rubber ducky themed bathroom.	
1. 	I originally used the Avent hand pump, but I realized after 2 months that I had to get an electric pump because my hand hurt and it took too long to pump.  I absolutely love this pump.  I accidentally sat on one of the tubes and it caused a piece to break off of the plug, but it still keeps suction and I haven't had to replace it.  I will with the next baby though.  It's relatively quiet for an electric pump too.  The bag is cute and discreet so I never feel awkward carrying it.  I would recommend buying the steam cleaning bags too -- they'll save you a lot of time.  I really think that this pump made it possible for me to return to work and continue to nurse.  Well worth the money, especially if you plan to have another baby in the future.  Don't forget to buy the car adapter as well!	
- 1	No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I haven't tried any other body pillows, so I can't compare, but it seems to help. Early in my first trimester, I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night. I still have some, but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help. I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow, so it isn't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case. Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing, but I'm not sure how it could be improved -  it's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off, but would probably be uncomfortable or wouldn't completely cover the pillow.Edit: I liked this pillow at first, but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat. Washing it didn't plump it up enough. I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug. Save your money	
1. 	Love these! They are easy to clean and are so much more comfortable and effective than the soft ones. I'll never go back.	
1. 	I wanted this tub because of the sling feature.  With our first daughter, we had a bath sling we used, but it was free-standing, so we had to put it in the tub.  (It didn't fit in our sink.)  This bathtub really answered our prayers.  I can put the whole thing in the bathtub so my girls can take a bath together, or, I can set it up next to my kitchen sink and fill it with water.  (It doesn't fit inside my sink.)  It is simple to drain - if I am using this on the counter, I just slide the tub over so the drain is over the sink, and let the water drain out.  The only bad think about it is that it's so bulky - but you're just not going to be able to get one that's not like that.  Maybe someone will invent one that folds in half!	
1. 	These bibs are great!  My son is a super drooler and these have done a great job holding up to the test.  Colors look great and the price is great also.	
- 1	Babies have different tastes so when my sister returned to work (and post grad school) we had quite a few brands to choose from and we bought a few.This bottle was one of them. We loved that there was a formula mixer included. I've not seen that feature in a while. That was the end of the pros with this bottle.When it's shaken the formula leaks into the bottle cap and after a while it leaks out of the bottle's cap and it got all over my hands and I'd only made a 2 oz bottle to test it out. Not good. We are always on the go so the bottles we use have to work well when we're out. A bottle that leaks this bad isn't going to make it into the diaper bag. Also the cap comes off way too easy.I would've liked to try the formula cap but cannot find them anywhere but the internet and I'm not willing to pay shipping just to try it perhaps that cap will not leak.I do like playtex's drop ins bottle as the cap doesn't leak.	
1. 	I just started potty training my two year old son and I found the Thomas potty seat to be a great incentive. The seat is cushioned so it's nice and comfortable and it fits nicely on most seats. It's also compact enough to fit in the diaper bag if you want to take it on the go. For boys, it does come with a splash guard. The padded part of the seat lifts up and it gets inserted between the plastic and padding. It stays in place most of the time, but it is easy to misplace. I would have preferred it to be permanently attached, but aside from that I am happy with this purchase.	
1. 	This thing is amazing!  The first seat we tried was a hard plastic one, and my son would sit for a few minutes, then say 'mommy, booty hurt.'  This one has never caused a problem.  We have no problem with urine spraying out, and have used the top part on the toilet as well. If only it could fold up and go in my diaper bag, I would never need anything else!We did get the flip-down seat for our toilet, but my son prefers this one.  He's only just turned two, so I'm sure in time he'll graduate to the bigger one:http://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-86CP-000-NextStep-Non-Tarnish/dp/B003IKONT8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=home-garden&qid;=1300941595&sr;=8-1	
- 1	I feel like my son has trouble getting the water out of the spout.So I use this cup without the top on it, and he gets more.Better off getting a normal cup, in my opinion..	
- 1	I loved these at first but started to realize that the Velcro digs into my son causing red rashes also the Velcro no longer holds very well. There constantly falling off after a few months of use.  I only use these when all my others are dirty. Sad cause they started out great.	
- 1	The first negative is that this potty is cheaply made in China using low grade plastic. Ours came with cracks already in the plastic where the two halves join. Not enough to ruin the potty, but enough to suggest it won't last long and wasn't made with quality in mind.By far the worst thing about this, however, is the extremely poor design choice to join the two halves (the colored top and white bottom piece) with the seam open UPWARDS. (Look closely at the piectures and you'll see what I mean.) Think about it: you've got a potty made for kids who are just learning to use one, and you design it so that any liquid that spills on the outside will get trapped in a tiny seam that you can't separate? Brilliant. The two halves aren't designed to come apart to clean it. Good luck getting urine completely out of this unless your kid is some sort of urinary genius that never has a miss. You'll need to spray it down in the bathtub to get everything out of the joint between the two plastic parts. We've had two other pottys, and neither was so poorly designed as to have that problem. I recommend the Baby Bjorn, the potty we used with our first-born, but pretty much any other company you choose will probably sell a better one than this. The Bjorn, for example, is made with a one base piece, and no parts have difficult to clean crevices.I'd think you would have to try hard to screw up the engineering of a piece of plastic to pee in, and yet Prince Lionheart has managed to. Royally.	
- 1	This is a COMPLETE waste of money.  I'm at 31 weeks and cannot here my child's heartbeat AT ALL.  A few times we thought was that it, and no it was not.  Not only does this device not work but also when you can actually hear some kind of noise, it gets interrupted by very loud static.  The only thing decent was the price I thought until I realized I'm donating $25 to GRACO.  I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY this product, it is a complete waste of money.  It's really disappointing when you are looking foward to sharing your baby's heartbeat with everyone and all you hear is static.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would've.	
- 1	This is a MUCH smaller seat than most I have seen out there for toddlers.  There is no back to the seat, and no straps so it really is a booster seat only.  However my three-year-old daughter, who is average size, barely fits in and it actually HATES it because it is so small.  For the price, you're much better getting a baby-to-toddler seat with tray and straps than this one.  It'll probably work if you have a very small child and small chairs, but my average-sized dining table and chairs are too big for it.	
1. 	A friend recommended this blanket to me before my baby was born. I didn't use them right away. One day I remembered I had them and started to use them. They are awesome. I don't swaddle my baby the exact way as the instruction suggest, I modified it a little and it works great. If she is not swaddled, she doesn't sleep for a long time, she wakes up with her own movements. She is now two months.I enjoy this product.	
1. 	I read a lot of reviews on bibs and was hoping to find a bib that would fit my 3 month old who was teething and soaking his clothes.  I wanted something that was waterproof, solid color, and would wash well.  These fit the bill!  They are a perfect size for 3-12 mo.  I've seen them on other babies who are in the 9-12 mo range and they fit well, but they're starting to get on the too small size, especially if you're feeding them in this bib.  I'd recommend this bib for drooling and spit up, but not large enough for the messes they make while eating.  They don't make a crinkle noise like some water proof bibs and they wash really well and hold up.  So far we've used these for 3 months and they still look great.	
- 1	This is useful and sturdy. BUT I purchased this particular organizer because of the basket (second self up) shown in the picture. My order arrived without the basket.If I had known the basket is not included I would have purchased one of the other cheaper options.	
1. 	Easy to track feeding, playtime, changes, naps etc.  Very helpful when nursing and even when you move on to a bottle. I work F/T so it's great to come home and peruse his day (feeding schedule, play time)  as a secondary account after talking to nanny. Would highly recommend for those Type-A personas.	
1. 	I love this because i can take it anywhere and have somewhere for baby to sleep. I comes with me when i go clean homes and I love that I can set My baby anywhere without having to put it together like the pak n play that we have. Doesn't take up very much room in our tiny bedroom. It seems very sturdy still after 3 moths of everyday use. I would recommend getting 2 sets of sheets for it.	
- 1	Although my child thoroughly enjoyed this product, I believe it's probably safe to assume it contains BPA.  Also when my child punctured it, I called the company, and I was told they couldn't help me. They wouldn't even send me a repair patch. My baby didn't even have teeth and he punctured it.  On that note, I tossed it in the trash.  I really thought it wouldve lasted longer.	
1. 	This pillow is a godsend for pregnant women.  It supports just about every part of the body that needs it and it's SO COMFORTABLE!The only complaint I have is that it takes up a lot of room so hubby doesn't have much room left in the bed!	
1. 	I bought this for my 4-month old son. He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it. The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra. The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long. We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!	
1. 	It worked until i put it in dishwasher. just surface wash it. if you squeeze the nipple while washing, the water gets in and there is no way to get it out.	
1. 	I was a little hesitant about getting this but I am really glad I did! My little girl (2) is terrified of those huge public bathroom seats and cries every time! I wasn't sure how this seat would work on them but I am grateful that they do! Make sure the seat is positioned on the BACK of the toilet for support. It seems to be of pretty good construction and materials and my girl loves that it's padded! It comes with a carrying case which my daughter now calls her potty purse and is happy to go to the bathroom. That is a big breakthrough during the potty training stage! Would recommend, and even if it doesn't last more than 6 months at a time I will still buy another. It's cheaper than pull ups and now that she uses the public bathrooms we can go out in normal big girl underwear!	
1. 	this is a good brush the bristles are stiff enough and spread out enough to do a good job, the bottom has a smaller piece for cleaning nipples.	
1. 	I have an older Peg perego Pliko P3. I lost the cup holder that came with the stroller ages ago. I was looking for a cup holder that can hang off the side since the P3 doesn't have a horizontal handle bar. This cup holder is excellent.It was a little difficult to figure out how to attach it on to the stroller, but once I figured it out it was no problem. It is very sturdy and will not slip even if I have a full drink inside. I like that it can hold a larger cup. I get iced venti coffees all the time and they fit beautifully in this cup holder.	
- 1	We got this backpack as a gift because we love to hike. Unfortunatley neither my husband or I could ever get it adjusted correctly for comfort. My son never seemed very comfortable in it either. We are 5' 7 and 5' 10 with average builds, so I assumed it would fit us. In addion to that, the frame makes it bulky and hard to bring places. It takes up almost as much room as a stroller in my car. This would be fine if it were comfortable, but it's just not. I was bummed because I would love to have a comfortable hiking pack, but this has been sitting in our garage taking up space. We took it hiking a few times and it kills our shoulders, the frame comes up really high around DS so he can barely see out and seems smooshed. I just purchased the Ergo and it is a million times more comfortable for a toddler. DS seems to love it, and I can wear it for much longer than this frame carrier. Plus it is cloth so it folds up small and can be brought along anywhere, even in the bottom of the stroller in case he wants to be held. I would pass on this product in favor of a better one or an Ergo for the same price.	
- 1	My daughter has pulled off, yes off, one of the hanging objects. It didn't hold her attention for more than 5 minutes. The beams went flat rather quickly and she now uses them to climb over. I would not recommend this product to anyone.	
- 1	I don't think I leak all that much, it's mostly just during the let-down while nursing. I soaked right through these in just a few hours. They don't seem to hold very much liquid, and what it does catch stays in one spot. It doesn't distribute the liquid through the whole pad, so your nipple ends up staying fairly moist for a while. I gave it two stars instead of one because they are super soft, fairly invisible under clothing, and inexpensive.	
1. 	These are the best inventions for breastfeeding moms!When I first started breastfeeding, milk would leak like crazy on the other side I always thought it would have been nice if someone design something to catch the leak so the milk doesn't go to waste. Then I found these and they work amazingly! I remember I was able to save 1 oz of milk during 1 feeding session.When I am engorged in pain at night, say 4am, and my baby didn't wake up to feed, I no longer have to go wide awake and wonder if I should get up and pump. (and that is not an easy decision because I'd hear my baby cry every time AFTER I finished pumping!) Nowadays I would get up and put these shells in and go back to sleep. Milk would leak out from my nipples and give me some relieve so I can continue to sleep. The only problem is because the plastic doesn't mold perfectly over your breasts, milk would sometimes leak out on the edges/sides instead of letting the cup catch it. I'd try to lay in a position that milk won't leak out on the edges. But even if it leaks, these are still lifesaver because at least I won't be in pain anymore and am able to get some rest until my baby cries.I wish I knew about these when I was still pregnant - I dealt with crazy engorgement pain when my milk first came in. I was crying when calling the lactation hotlines. Back then I was in so much pain and was so sleep deprived that I could not process any advice. I wonder what it would have been like if I had these shells back then!Overall I highly recommend this product!	
- 1	I bought these because of the price, but it doesnt worth it, the product dont stick to the corner of the desk very well, keeps falling apart, and my baby is only 10 months old but strong enough to pull it down, I had to tape it to the desk and doesnt look neat.	
- 1	We try and use a regular cup as much as possible with our 14 month old - but sometimes you just need to give them a drink in a cup that won't spill. So, we keep these for those times when we are out and about.  I own 5 of the Nuk Learner cups- and I've now had to replace the nipples on all of them. I'm about to go buy replacement nipple #6 and #7, as my daughter has bitten through the top, sometimes getting small pieces of the silicone in her mouth!  Nothing she could choke on, but still not good for her.  I wish they made these in a hard version that fit on the cup for once the child was ready to transition off the soft spout.  Until then, I'll keep buying replacement spouts - which is costing a fortune.	
1. 	We have bought three of these toilet trainers (one for each bathroom).  My daughter loves them and it gives her the perfect amount of comfort and support during potty training.  Cannot recommend these enough!!!!!	
1. 	Bought for my baby when he turned 10 months and started feeding himself and making a royal mess everywhere.  He hated his old standard plastic high chair (graco, typical type) from day 1.  He now seems MUCH more comfortable in this Boon Flair, and it's so easy to clean (over and over and over and over), very few nooks and crannies to gunk up, and it works easily into our small kitchen lives, and he is able to sit more upright like a real chair and it fits right up to our table.  He's much more a part of our family meals now than when he was in the monstrous plastic graco we had before.  Before buying the Boon Flair I did briefly consider the Stokke because I liked the idea of pulling my kid straight up to the table-- however Stokke is WAY more $ and online videos of kids tipping themselves over freaked me and that was the end of that.  But it turns out that this Boon Flair chair works great, in my book, to get my kid right up to the table -- the adjustable height makes it easy to either position him to fit with the table, with or without his tray.  I also love the ease of washing, drip drying, and storing the much smaller tray and tray liners.  Some people don't like the small size, I totally love it vs. the monstrous plastic graco tray we had before.One note on the sleek modern design, too, because I was nervous about this element because I am not a real modern design person at all, and we have kind of a country kitchen with copper and gold tones and a bunch of plants and a 1980s style cheesy wooden dining set...but I feel this modern style high chair is just a nice clean look, in general, it blends in fine and it looks WAY better then the classic plastic monstrosity we had before.Here are my few minor annoyances, every product has some and I find it helpful to read other people's reviews that list the bad along with the good so I can sort out what the dealbreakers for me would be.  None of these, for me, are a big deal obviously since I gave this product 5 stars, but in an ideal world, these elements would be better:  1) the lap belt clip closure sort of jams up right where the tray/t-bar all come together with baby's belly, so I feel like I have to manuever it around to get it comfie for my guy, plus its so snugged up at that particular point it's nearly impossible to unsnap the tray liner off the base tray while baby is in the chair too.  2) the pneumatic adjustment still takes a bit of manual force to get it up/down.  Nothing herculean, but I did think it would only take a light tap to the orange button to adjust, and that is not the case. 3) the tray removal mechanism is a little bit of a thing to get the hang of, and I still have to think about what I'm doing to get it to latch/unlatch 4) the base tray (which is NOT dishwasher safe, although I personally don't care about that) has some open spaces related to the latch mechanism -- this just means that after washing it you need to fully turn it on end and drain it so you don't accidentally dump dishwater all over your baby when you put the tray over him next time.There are a few baby products that I have felt have been worth every penny -- My Ergo, babyjogger city elite stroller, fuzzibunz perfect size diapers, and this high chair!  5 stars :)	
1. 	The membranes arrived slightly curled as if they'd been stored in a hot warehouse for quite sometime. I ran them under some pretty hot water and flattened them on a towel. No harm no fowl so far. Some of them do rip if I'm not careful pulling them off the yellow valve, but I think that's me trying to be quick (and thus too rough) more than anything. I make sure to have quite a few of these on hand at all times, just in case.	
1. 	I love this product!  With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.  Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.  No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!	
1. 	These do just what they're supposed to: they fully close the Dr Browns bottles to be air tight. They're great for when I use the larger Dr Browns bottles for milk storage in the fridge. I also plan to use them to keep bottles fully closed when traveling. I'd highly recommend them.	
1. 	our son loves sticking the forms on the wall of the bathtub.  and they stay in place for quite some time!  When he was little he also chewed them and they still worked. the colors did not fade after almost a year of use.  and he still enjoys them (very few toys have captured his attention for such a long time)	
1. 	I LOVE this blanket and everytime someone sees it, they ask me about it.  I keep it in the car and we use it all the time.  Washing is fairly easy.  I put it in the machine but then air dry it as I don't think it would stand up to the dryer.  Great item!	
- 1	I used one of those &#34;free--just pay shipping&#34; promo codes before I was pregnant. When I had my baby and tried to stuff him in this sling, I realized that it was way way way too small. I looked at the packaging again to see if I was totally off on my measurements that I provided to figure out the size I needed...nope! My measurements were spot on. Seriously, I can barely fit my 8 pound baby between myself and the fabric, and when he is in there, he seemed so squished.	
- 1	These aren't round. they have a straight sewn edge at the top so they don't fit as nicely inside the cover and they bend inward instead of stay rounded. stuck with it now.	
- 1	The actual item is fine. It is well made but doesn't fit on the handles of an umbrella stroller. It would only fit if the handles were horizontal, not angled. My complaint is strictly on the description of the item which didn't advise this design issue. Alternately, it would take only a small design change to accommodate different angles of handle (like a grommet that would allow it to spin relative to the velcro straps).  I gave it away.	
1. 	My toddler son loves this elephant, and it's working very well.  We have the kind of faucet that does not have the pull knob at the end, and it fits perfectly.  It would not work on a faucet with a pull knob, though.  It's bigger than I expected and maybe a little embarrassing if your kiddie bathroom is also your guest bathroom, but it serves its purpose well.	
- 1	Maybe it is incredibly soothing to teething babies...I don't know. I was talked into spending a ridiculous amount of money for what looks and sounds like a dog toy. I wouldn't have even minded the price if it was something that my baby just couldn't resist. Unfortunately, no matter how much I encouraged her to play with this thing, she just wasn't interested in the least. She would much rather chew on my silicone cell phone cover. Maybe that's not the most constructive thing for her to chew on, but it has definitely provided her more relief and entertainment than Sophie ever has.	
1. 	I love this bag.  Have not had any problems with zippers, it frees up my hands and it sits comfortable on the shoulder.  My husband likes it too, as it is not too childish.  It has lots of space, for extra set of clothes, 6 or so diapers, blanket, burp cloth, bottles, bib, etc.  We also have the larger messenger style for longer trips, it is great too.	
- 1	My daughter is 3 months old, and this doesn't work well for her. I have it spaces as far apart as it will go, and it's too small to safely fit her head, yet just fits inside the carseat. I thought I would like this a lot more. I think the side pieces are too stuffed for it to be helpful.	
- 1	This crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib. It stuck on well enough, and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too, but the plastic has a sticky feel to it (even the upright side that isn't supposed to stick to anything). I noticed when putting the baby in the crib, her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it. I ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine. I'd recommend the cloth tie-on rail guards over this one.	
1. 	sturdy, good quality, nice design. Buyer be aware that it is kind of short, not tall enough for my 3-yr to watch her hands in the bathroom sink, , but good for getting on the toilet to potty.	
- 1	Mine broke the first week I had it. (One of the inner flap's spring broke.) It does not contain odors very well.However, I do like the foot pedal for opening and it does hold a lot of diapers. I feel like I would have been better off with a regular trash can with a lid though.	
- 1	Everybody I know loves these, but I hate them. They aren't very stretchy. They are hard to get fastened to the diaper correctly. I switched to old fashioned &#34;safety pins&#34; instead. Maybe I wasn't using them correctly? Like I said, I'm the only one I know who doesn't like these so I'm sure it's a good product, but not for everyone (or at least me). Lol	
1. 	I don't know why but i felt compelled to write another review about these bottles. I cannot say enough... except what are you people complaining about ??? These bottles are not expensive when compared to buying stupid refill liners and trying a bunch of different bottles, and can you really put a price on a happy baby ? They are not hard to clean unless possibly you are letting the used bottles sit around to dry up and get yucky. They do not leak if you use them right and follow the instructions included. I rotate 6 bottles, keeping them washed and filled with formula (in the fridge of course), when baby is hungry i simply take one out and remove all parts and warm it up, which is not hard to do, then replace parts, feed baby, and rinse the  bottle out and fill sink with hot soapy water, drop all parts in.. let soak, then rinse and put to dry on drying rack. What is so hard about that ? (do boil the parts prior to first use and then about every 2 weeks or so) I don't even know where the little brush is that came with my bottles, don't need it. And I have inspected them afterwards, they are clean. and I should say that i usually use the ready to feed formula, I hate having to mix the powder. But the times that I do use the powder i just mix in separate container and pour into the Dr. Brown's.  So what you can't shake the bottle, you can swish it, you really shouldn't shake any bottle anyway, that's where the bubbles come from. I have used these bottles for 4 months, Katie is 4 1/2 mos. old. She had terrible colic for the first 2 weeks of her life, she would scream and ball up in pain from 11 pm to 5 am every nite  until I tried Dr. Browns. (I had used Avent and VentAire first, what junk.. also everyone kept telling me to try Soy or one of those special colic formulas, which are expensive, but I still use Similac Advance b/c the Dr. Browns bottles work) The FIRST day I used Dr. Brown's she slept all nite, I still didn't sleep though but that is just because I stared at her all nite in amazement !  I have NEVER had one of these bottles leak at all. I just don't get what all the complaining is about, I would do whatever it took to make my baby happy. If your baby doesn't have colic or get gas then maybe you don't need these. However, I am such a fan that with my next baby I will use these, I will not wait to see if the baby has colic or not. Another plus is that these bottles are designed to help with ear problems too. I really cannot say enough good about them, i have used both the standard, and the wide-neck, both are great in doing what they are designed to do but i (and baby) prefer the wide neck ones. I suggest skipping the purchase of the 4 oz bottle and go straight to the 8 oz, baby grows out of 4 oz size quickly, you can put 4 oz in an 8 oz bottle but cannot put 8oz in a 4 oz bottle, you know what i mean ?  PLEASE take it from someone who knows.. try these bottles, you won't be sorry.. baby's tummy will thank you.	
1. 	Whoever invented sleepsacks is obviously a parent.  It's a genius way to give babies an extra level of warmth without the danger of a blanket in the crib.  Our girls know that putting the sack on at night signals that it's time for sleep which is even better.Bonus, when they get a little older and are starting to climb, it's much harder for them to climb out of the crib with the sack on.  :)	
1. 	We have been using Playtex sippies for about four years now, for two children and they are by and large the best of all that we've tried.There are other attractive models out there, but they tip over easily (what marketing genius thought a narrower at the bottom than at the top design was a good idea!) and don't last. The plastic that they are made out of is hard and it eventually cracks-- dropped or from dishwasher wear.The Playtex models (either insulated or not) stay upright (most of the time LOL) and are easily cleaned by hand or in a dishwasher.(Hand tested on vacation and at nana's.)The only thing that we have done to maintain them is to replace the valve thingies as they will start to age after a year or so and leak despite what other reviewers have said. These replacement valves are cheap though and no problem to find.As to insulation, they insulate to a limited extent but don't expect to have your milk stay good for more than an hour or so in a hot environment. (Tested in Florida, Texas, and Virginia.)Five Stars. The best that we have used and we have tested just about everything on the market.	
- 1	I LOVE MY UPPA BABY VISTA!  I HATE this cup holder, it was so expensive for what it is, the chain links are flimsy at best, and as per other reviewers it does, in fact, fall off all the time.  Shopping with this thing is embarrassing, having such a nice stroller it is embarrassing when you are walking into things and it comes off spilling your hot coffee all over the stroller, your clothes and at times, merchandise that I DO NOT want to pay for!  What an awful design surprising from a company that creates the most useful stroller I have found (after much research I might add!)This flimsy accessory is a huge rip off, do NOT fall for it, I think I might sell mine and get another  brand that fits on any stroller, a friend of mine has one and her's works perfectly.  By the way the whole issue with the chains allowing the drinks to move along bumpy roads is a lie.  It does no such thing.  Even walking of a smooth side walk, the coffee will spill as you walk across the side walk seam lines that attach each block together.  It is the most poorly designed cup holder.	
1. 	I bought these when I started my son on solid food so that I could store and feed out of the same bowl and it does just that.  Works perfectly for what I need them for.	
1. 	These are my babies preferred bottles. He has GERD and these don't bother him. We tried the regular size but when he was younger it created some bad habits for when he nursed.these wide nipples keeping him latching correctly. The down side is there are 6 pieces per bottle, the upside is that they're easy to clean thoroughly	
- 1	This mirror is great in theory but not in practice. The A shape that the mirror opens into does not stay, and it ends up folding flat. When it's flat, it's at the wrong angle for Baby to look in and see themselves.	
- 1	I returned an earlier order because of erroneous information about sizing.  But I received a Thirsties prefold recently to try out.  The dense, heavy fabric - almost twice as heavy as a 100% cotton prefold - takes forever to dry.  It has a strange design in which double layers wrap around in a cylindrical shape, and it's too short unless you use it as an insert (but, then why call it a prefold?).  This isn't a true prefold.  It's one giant 2-layered sheet wrapped around itself and sewn closed in an infinite loop, so it's essentially 4 layers when laid flat.  It stains easily, and bleach doesn't even remove it.  However, if you have plenty of sunshine, the sunlight will gradually fade the stains.  It becomes stiff when wet - like cardboard; so it's not comfortable for baby.  Whichever way you fold it or use it, the combined 4 layers is too thick and stiff.  It's not organic, and the hemp is chemically processed.	
1. 	Really love this bundleme. The color is beautiful, and fit our red stroller very good. It helps me very much, after i got this, I can take my baby out everyday in the winter. Useful and good item.	
1. 	My baby use this product everyday! I very liked this product. It very good for baby! So I will tell my friends to use this product. Thank you very much!	
- 1	These folding seats are horrible! At first I thought it was the greatest thing until I found the actual greatest thing! While this does fold nice and small, the open front is a joke. My daughter sprayed out constantly on her clothing! Public toilets are open front too, so there was NOTHING to stop the pee. It was just a hassle having to change her clothes all the time. The only thing I could do to stop her from peeing out was to hold her legs straight out and lean her forward. Really? As if potty training wasn't difficult enough! There were also several times that it pinched her little hiney when she sat down because of the hinges in the middle of the seat! This made her afraid of it which we all know is a VERY BAD THING.I found a different potty which I actually bought to keep in the car. Now I use that one instead of this folding seat for my second child. The Kalencom Potette plus potty is WAY BETTER. It has no hinges on the seat so it never pinches, and it has a built in guard to keep them from peeing on their clothes. While it is slightly larger, I would much rather carry that one around since it is so much easier to use and comfy for my child. It comes with a bag that you can keep flushible wipes and training pants in as well. Get that one!	
- 1	On the first one I received only one of the two clips made a clicking sound when inserted into the buckle and you had to push *really* hard to get the clips in.  So I called Britax and they sent me a replacement buckle and on the replacement buckle, neither one of the clips made a clicking noise when inserted into the buckle and again I had to push really hard to get them the buckle and I am not convinced they are really locked in - guess you wouldn't really know until an accident happened.  Well, I am not taking the chance, so back it goes.  When I called Britax about the second buckle - they told me it was normal for there not to be a clicking noise when the clips go into the buckle.  Yeah right, I'm not waiting for an accident to find out whether the clip is really locked into the buckle or not!	
1. 	The Avent brand of bottles is an outstanding product.  For those experiencing leaks, it is simply because the bottles are an interlocking system and must be screwed on properly.  I have had no problems using these bottles, and yes I have experienced an occasional leak which I notice while I'm shaking the bottle because I have not screwed the cap on properly.  These are well worth the price paid.  I have tried both Dr. Brown's and Playtex VentAire and find the Avent products to be superior to both of these.  Highly recommended by this mom!Update March 06:  one more great feature about the Avent bottles -- they sell a sippy cap that can replace the nipple, so your investment goes into toddlerhood with no need to buy additional sippy cups!  They are leakproof, and come in a 2 pack just as the replacement nipples do.  I have found them in Toys R Us, since my local Babies R Us does not carry them.  Still a great product in my book!	
1. 	Does a great job of not spilling and keep a good flow of milk/water into our toddler's mouth. We've had other cups that he would take too much at once and end up overflowing out of his mouth but these work great. It only spills when it is really full and left horinzontal, and a little bit comes out of the regular opening. Great price.	
1. 	I've noticed that the negative reviews on this potty focus on how small it is. Yes, it IS small. It would be too small for most kids beyond the age of 3 and any bigger/tall  toddlers. If you are in that category you'd want to look at one of the larger Bjorn potties.HOWEVER, if you are ECing a baby or working on potty training with a younger/smaller toddler, this potty is great. Their feet will touch the ground and it's easy for them to sit on. For myself I love the simple, one-piece design. This makes it really easy to carry to different areas of the house, in the car, and it seems less tempting to be used as a hat. We have used 3 different potties over the years with our children and this is my favorite. The back has a knotch cut out for easy carrying. Really great little potty.	
1. 	This potty chair is awesome! I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter.  I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's Potty book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the Potty book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words potty, poop, and pee. She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her Potty book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.	
- 1	I recieved this as a gift at one of my baby showers. I thought it was going to be great, but it is a big old mess. There are way to many folds and pockets, took me 5 minutes just to get it onto the cart. And the folds into a handy compact. Yea right, I'm not sure a genius could fold this thing back up into the little carrying case it claims to fold into. It is very cute, but not very user friendly.	
- 1	I purchased this one some months ago before my baby was born and it cost me $70 aprox. I see now it is much more expensive (almost $100!!)Honestly I think the theme is beautiful and all but for being Hello Kitty (I've worked with this license in my country) the materials are not good enough!! It is most polyester than anything, the fabric is not nice, looks bad quality and is stiff. Would it had been 100% cotton things would be completely different. I don't think the material makes justice to this beautiful character and theme... Only if you are a great fan of Hello Kitty it might be ok to buy this but other than that I wouldn't recommend this set at all, worse for the price... I don't think it's worth it. I decorated my baby's room with the entire collection and everything looks so cute but the fabric is so bad I feel sorry I didn't choose something else on Amazon.Hope Sanrio takes note of this and choose another licensee to manufacture these stuff, and supervise the material is good enough for a baby. I myself wouldn't sleep in such a stiff material! :(	
1. 	So glad to have an extra car seat base for our second vehicle. Easy to install and fits our SnugRide Classic. Exactly as expected.	
1. 	Finally switched my 14-month-old to these (after using the NUK silicone spouts with regular bottles to ease transition) and I LOVE them! Did a lot of research on which sippy cups to get and these do not disappoint. I can throw one in my purse without worrying--NO LEAKS! It does take some determination for my kid to get the liquid out, but she eventually figured it out and now has no trouble. Same goes for grasping. Just took a day or two. Did I mention no leaks?? Highly recommended!!	
- 1	i had got this product excitedly ordering from here but when we started using the color shade started peeling off and my son..use to chew on that .it was unacceptable n we somehow cudnt return the product.neways i wiidnt suggest anybody to buy this product which claims ORGANIC but cannot deal with basic problems.	
- 1	Smells Horrible - Rubber smell is overwhelming even after washing it.  We got this thinking it was going to be similar to the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, sold on Amazon, but it s not. It is thicker, more rubbery sounding (squish squish) and tastes and smells horrible.  We are going to buy more of the Natursutten Natural Rubber Teether Toy Star, Amber, it has a vanilla smell and is all natural rubber as well, much softer in texture and makes no squishing sounds.	
1. 	This item was probably the best money my husband and I spent on our daughter. Before this, she would fall asleep but flail her arms and wake herself up. Soon after my husband had learned how to do an extremely effective swaddle with just a normal blanket, not knowing these existed. Come to find out this just made life so much easier in order to avoid suffocation hazard. Our daughter was also able to get her arms out, particularly once she got older, but they always went over the wings, not under, so it wasn't a suffocation hazard. Basically, if you Velcro it extremely, and do it such that it is low, you should be fine. It's important to remember that you're trying to pin their arms to their sides, which means you can put the wing part pretty low, and it will make it harder for them to escape, and more likely that went they do, they escape with their arms above the wings.This had such a huge impact on my daughter's sleep. Now that she's 4 months she doesn't seem to need it anymore because she gotten too strong for it regardless of the size we puts her in. Most importantly this product allowed us to ensure that she continued sleeping for 8 hours/night while we got our rest. Highly recommended.	
- 1	This was a total waste of money - nothing fits in it and it is terrible to clean when you do find something to fit into it. I would definetly NOT recommend putting food in it. For now I have the toothbrush handle in it so we don't lose the tooth brush but that is about all it is good for. The opening is not much bigger than a quarter so look around before you buy it and see if you have anything small enough to slip into it. The clip does not stay clipped either - the slightest tug and it comes off the shirt or bib, pointless because then both items are on the floor needing washing. Wish I had not bothered - total waste of money.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this cover, especially since it was more expensive than most...Pros:- Nice fabric- well made- holds up well with washing- love that it can be used over high chairsCon:- It doesn't fit over most shopping carts (ex. Target, Costco).  When I was sold the product, I was told it would fit, even the costco double carts. We pretty much use it as a high chair cover only now.I recommend going with a different brand.	
1. 	I love these things and couldn't do it without them! It's great to pump, freeze and feed from the same Drop-In liner! No transfering the milk!To save money, just buy two kits so you'll have two pump adapters. When you get home at night, carefully slide the rings off the Drop-In and place the collected milk into a Playtex bottle. Screw on the nipple and cap and it's ready for the sitter the next day and you can wash and reuse the collection kits!I just discovered that Playtex will send you an adapter which allows you to pump using your AVENT PUMP directly into a Playtex Bottle or One-Step Kit! I own a Playtex Embrace Pump, but I also have an Avent Isis manual  pump. I noticed on the box of the One-Step Kits that you can get a free adapter if you call them, so I did and they mailed me one! I just wanted to let others out there who use the Playtex bottles, like I do, but also like the Avent pumps, know that they have this option!	
1. 	I bought this mobile for our little girl to hang over her changing table.  I wanted something that didn't require batteries, but something that would require her attention and help develop her senses.She absolutely loves this mobile.  From the time I hung it up, at around 7-8 weeks, she was mesmerized by it, and now at 12 weeks she giggles and talks to the flowers.  She loves it when you spin it around for her and will happily coo at it while being changed.  It's great for parent/baby interaction together.I wish I would have thought to hang something like this over my son's changing table when he was younger.I will say that the only drawback is that it doesn't have a hook to hang it, so you have to find a way to secure it to the ceiling.  Right now, I have it thumbtacked up there, which is working fine, but once she gets older and is able to reach it, I'll have to hang it more securely.	
- 1	My daughter is three months, and we had been using this as a nightlight.  Last week it just stopped working. It was great for late night feedings and diaper changes.  She was just starting to become mesmerized by the changing colors when it stopped working. Too bad, I really liked it.	
- 1	The plastic is a little flimsy and few of the lids broke a little not allowing them to seal properly.  I liked the idea...but unless you are making baby food every few days you would need like 5 of these...and then would have no space in your freezer.  I make baby food and freeze in ice cube trays...then transfer them into ziploc bags.  I only use these if I run out of ice cube trays.  For their purpose they are okay, but are really an unnecessary product.	
- 1	This cover is super soft and I thought I would love it.  I wanted to love it.  I washed it and lanolized it, put it on my 10 pound baby overnight with a flat and a Hemp Babies Little Weeds and it leaked.  I tried a snappied prefold during the day and it leaked.  I re-washed and re-lanolized it and tried it again overnight with a Kissaluvs hemp fitted and a Joey Bunz premium insert and it leaked.  WTH?  My son is now 14 pounds and sleeps about 9-10 hours and I was looking for a non-synthetic overnight solution.  We are currently using pocket diapers.This is sooooo soft and looks sooooo cozy, and I really wish it worked for us.  I also liked that it fits a larger weight range than most of the wool covers.  But I can only use it for maybe two hours during the day before it leaks, usually not even that long.  I am going to try Disana, even though they require more prep.  Waste of money.	
- 1	I rate this low because it should come with the product and it's cheap material...  Overall, the install went well and it does hold.  If you are handy, you could easily pick this up at the hardware store.  I would also state that this should be painted.  Why would they sell such a beautiful gate with ugly connectors...	
1. 	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.	
1. 	I personally love the gummi rail. I bought it 3 years ago and put it on my daughter's crib. It stayed put and protected her crib. When my son was born he used the same crib. He was a chewer. He destroyed everywhere that did not have the gummi rail. He is now 1 1/2 years old and only one part of the rail is starting to come up in the middle. But seeing as it lasted 3 years, for me, it was definitely worth it and I will be buying a second one to fit an entire crib after our third is born.	
1. 	My son loves to play dino world just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.	
1. 	baby like it a lot. she like to watch herself in the mirror, and also like the monkey with long tail.	
1. 	I ordered two pack. One of them was an open item but the sheet looks fine and doesn't seem like have been used. I'm okay with that because i bought them for less than $4!	
1. 	It's stylish! That's all we carry when we're out. But I wish the pad is a bit longer. At 6 month, my baby's bum is now at the edge of the pad, so I don't know how much longer we could use it. It would be better if the plastic wipes container has a dispensing slot like those in the wipes's tub. But overall, we're very happy with it.	
1. 	Started using these for our kids 3 years ago, and still it's all we use. Our kids each started using them at around 10 months...  the tops they can't (or don't) pull off and they are easy to wash. Colors are great too!	
1. 	My baby loves the change pad. He loves having his diaper changed and as soon as I place him on the pad, he starts getting hyper and happy. It's soft enough and I like the straps in case I need to grab something near by (don't leave baby strapped by himself though).	
1. 	Having selected this chair based on the reviews here I felt I should give my own. This was for my first child, now 3 and we bought this over a year ago. He is fully potty trained now and still uses this seat and I think he'll be using it for a while to come. It cleans and disinfects very easily and still looks brand new. He's very comfortable in it and its a very very good fit. It was a year ago, and it still is. For the novice parent of boys, it doesn't matter how high they make the splash guard, boys need to point it down. That took some learning on my part. We have the Bjorn that fits over the potty too, but we've hardly used it. He and we love this one way too much and its so much easier for him to use the potty on his own.	
1. 	These are by far the best bibs I have bought. I love the bumkins bibs. They wash up nice and hold up great. The only negative is if your child pulls at their bibs, they might be able to pull off this kind of bib since it is attached by velcro.	
- 1	The distortion of this 'mirror' is really a drag (it's a mirror laminate on a plastic backing of course, due to safety issues with real glass hanging over baby's head in a moving car). Like looking into a funhouse mirror from the back seat.	
1. 	These seem to be working. I started using them a month prior to my due date in preparation for breast feeding. I haven't had the baby yet, so I will find out once she's here if they did what they're supposed to!	
1. 	FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB. UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM.. SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH IT	
- 1	This is not BPA free and is made in China.  Not safe to teethe on.It is also so loud and obnoxious.  You cant even put this away without waking the baby!Its crinkle sound is obnoxious and overstimulating.  There are softer crinkle toys out there.This was not for us.  Returning.	
1. 	My daughter is small for her age, so we have to use a smaller, cloth bib under this one to catch the mess between the bib and her neck.  I haven't had any issues with the pocket not catching food that slides down the bib.  It washes very well and has withstood many washings without showing any signs of deterioration.	
1. 	This potty chair is awesome! I have had this chair for about two weeks. I bought it for my sixteen-month-old daughter.  I also purchased Leslie Patricelli's Potty book in the same Amazon order. When the box arrived, I took it into my daughter's room (I had already cut through the tape) and we opened it together. She was so excited. We took this right into the bathroom, so she could see. I put the chair in our bathroom across from the toilet and the Potty book is on a stand next to her potty chair. She immediately sat down on it and opened her book.I didn't intend to start potty training her until after the holidays. I have been trying to get her to say the words potty, poop, and pee. She hasn't said any of those words yet. However, she is starting to comprehend the words. She loves sitting on this chair and reading her Potty book. On an even better note, she has peed twice in the past two days, while sitting on her potty chair! I was so impressed!About the chair:It's so perfectly simple! It is just the base and the bowl that the poop and pee go into. The bowl has a fairly high and wide splash guard, but it's not so big that it is difficult for her to sit and get situated. So far nothing has splashed onto the floor. The design of the bowl keeps things from sliding down the sides when you empty it into the toilet. The bowl doesn't have anything to lock it into place, so be sure to teach your child not to play with it from the very beginning. As the description notes, the design is ergonomical and stable. The chair is high, wide, and well-curved. It would be difficult to tip over.On the (barely) downside. The seat is hard plastic and doesn't seem comfy. However, my daughter doesn't seem to mind. It would also be nice if there was a way of locking the bowl into the base so that curious children don't try to take the bowl out.	
- 1	This cream is pretty sensitive stuff, good for a baby that has no serious diaper rash, and good for a mama with an aversion  to chemicals. It reminds me a bit of burt's bees lip gloss. We have switched full time to A&D. Its cheaper, I don't have to order it online, and it actually works better. We use the kind without Zinc Oxide. It still is not as pure & natural as this stuff, but this really is protective & preventative, not healing. Our baby has really sensitive skin and it did not irritate her. She has eczema and everything. A&D didn't irritate her either. I have not noticed a difference with A&D on my cloth diapers. If it gets gooky though, (has not over several months) I will just do a vinegar rinse and -voila-. I bought this because I was worried about waxy things on the diaper.	
- 1	I thought it would be THE solution for my kids when we are traveling long distances so they can sleep comfortably... Unfortunately, they both don't like it because their head is stuck between the two big bananas. Maybe for older kids, I don't know...	
- 1	We love the lifefactory bottles!  Our daughter loves them so much it is hard to wean her away from them so we bought the super expensive caps to convert them to sippy cups.  She is used to other types of sippy cups so the transition should not be a problem but these caps are almost useless.  Both caps came with the hard plastic caps and a silicon insert.  The instructions say to loosen the cap on the bottle to adjust the flow.  The issue that we have is that when the caps are on as tight as possible, the flow is zero.  We tried as hard as we could to suck water out of this bottle with the caps fully tightened and could not get a drop and neither could our daughter.  We then loosened it up a bit and we could all get water out of the bottle but it leaks all over the place beneath edges of the collar on the cap when just tilted slightly.  When you take the gasket out, the flow is so good that it isn't much of a sippy cup.On the positive side, the caps that come with the bottles fit perfectly on them.  We haven't had an issue with them breaking but then again we haven't had much use of them either.On the whole we are really disappointed with these caps.  We continue to be very impressed with the bottles and wouldn't trade them for anything.  So we really assumed that Lifefactory would come through with a good product for their caps and they didn't at least not for our purposes.	
- 1	i purchased 4 of these diapers and was excited because of their trimness and colors. They worked great for the 1st 2-6 times, but after a half dozen times, they all leaked like crazy. NOt from the leg opening, or around seams, they simply soaked right through! I have diapers that have been used for 15 months, several times per week, that still don't leak. Unacceptable.	
1. 	This is by far the best bib I have ever bought! Originally I only added to my order so I could get free shipping, but it turned out to be the best bib purchase I have ever made! Before this bib we were using plastic/fabric bibs and over time they get smelly and dingy, this bib is SO much easier to clean, never gets an odor to it, and it catches everything because they pouch always stays open unlike fabric bibs! You will not be disappointed! It is also harder for children to rip off during meal time unlike the ones with velcro. My son is now 2.5 years old and has just started learning how to take it off. He could take off the velcro bibs around a year old! So this is definitely an improvement! I cannot say enough good things about this bib, I recommend it to every one I know.	
- 1	This just did not do the trick for me. I'm 5'2&#34;, so I thought the mini snoogle would be better for me. I really didn't like anything about it. The top part is uncomfortable to use as a pillow, which is one way it is shown for usage. I have tried bending it all sorts of different ways, and just none are comfortable. It doesn't contour to my body well at all. I wound up getting a regular body pillow and am happier with that.	
- 1	The size of this mirorr is perfect...but it won't stay in place.  The suction cup works fine, just the little ball (pivot joint...there are two) are really floppy.  Everytime I hit even the slightest bump (going into the driveway) the mirror repositions itself. It is very irritating.  I even added tape to the ball that comes out of the socket that is part of the arm (not by the mirror itself)...and it has held up well...but the other little ball is really floppy too.  There is no way to fix it.  I have debated using super glue...but once I do that it will be stuck in whatever position I put it and if I need to ever change it to another side or so it will be a pain and be useless.UPDATE: i have added silicone around the ball joint that attaches to the actual mirror and it doesn't move at all.  Of course I had to have it in position to do this.  But once my daughter is in a front facing carseat and I am able to use it with the visor clip, I will need to buy a new mirror since mine is permantly stuck in 1 position. Bummer.  I was really hoping it would work out well.  It currently does not w/ my modifications, but won't later.	
1. 	would NEVER buy any other bottle but these. I have 12 of them. they were great. I have some of the more $$ ones and those leaked. Not playtex wide ventAire. THey were excelent. great if you are breastfeeding (wide nipple only). I realized that you can never have too many bottles with my boy!!! :)	
- 1	I had gotten these bags to use with a rented Medela Lactina while my preemie was in the hospital. If you are pumping for a NICU baby, nurses do not like to handle the bags to transfer the milk into the volu-feeders/small hospital bottles (if you're lucky enough even to be in a breastfeeding-friendly hospital). Nurses are still handling a bodily fluid and it's extra steps for them if you're not the one handling all of the feedings. Also, the bags do not stand up on their own, which is frustrating if you're truly pumping straight into the bag. Like other reviewers, I found that the top tab tore poorly also. They are good for fast backup if you have no other sterile reusable milk storage container, but I ended up using theMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 12 Pack of 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061long-term and was very happy with them.	
- 1	I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!	
- 1	I was really excited to get this in because we had similar items with several of our other children and never used icky restaurant high chairs.  This one is awful! The pad is held on by three loose pieces of elastic on the top, leaving the pad to flop around.  There is a rounded part bulging out all around the outer edge on the inside of the seat back, pushing the child's head forward if the child is small.  The three-point restraint is utterly useless, as the straps loosen up with any kind of movement and they aren't secure at all.  The restraint system will certainly not hold a wiggly child in.  The tray is a very tight fit and difficult to put on. I paid six dollars extra just to get it in pink instead of tan, what is the reason for it to be so much more on such a cheap item?  We have had many high chairs and booster seats through raising seven children, but this is truly one of the worst baby items I've ever purchased.  I find myself wondering who tested this product and said it was of good enough quality to be sold. My husband took one look at it and said, Send it back!	
- 1	These spoons are thin and flimsy and very small. I like the fact they are American made and safe, but they are just too small and lightweight, so I replaced them with the Green Toys spoons and forks, which I also reviewed.	
1. 	My son loves a sleepsack, but some of them are so heavy.  This one is so cute and is super light.  I'm a big fan.  It's the favorite.	
- 1	Let me start by saying that I own several Skip Hop products. I've loved them all. So I was excited to use these as stocking stuffers for my 18 month old who is really getting into feeding himself. The chunky design is great for little hands! But the quality is atrocious! We handwash all the kiddo plates and utensils, and the paint came off in the first wash! I was certain it was a fluke with the dog set, so I opened the panda set. Same thing! After reading other reviews, I see this is not isolated. I am terribly disappointed in Skip Hop, and expect better. I cannot recommend the purchase of these and am baffled by the higher star ratings shown here. I can see that many are from people who haven't actually used them yet, only ordered them.	
1. 	As the mother of six grown children, I realize the importance of a playpen when babies start to explore their environment...we can't watch them every moment. I am now a grandmother who babysits for my daughter. I ordered this to use at my own home, and have had such a good experience with it that I ordered a second one for her to use at her house. The color is vibrant for lots of visual stimulation. The playpen is also a good size. Take it from this grandmother that this is definitely the best. 5 stars*****	
1. 	I use it as a stool and it's nice. won't slip on any surface. But I guess it will be hard to clean the top.	
- 1	I was very excited to buy this item for my 4 1/2 month old baby. He love to kick his feet so I thought this would be great. However the volume on it is terrible. Even with the volume on the second noise  spot I can barly hear it unless I get real close to it. It was a waste of my money.	
1. 	My only complaint I have I about this bottle warmer is that it takes 2 cycles most times to get the bottle to the proper temperature. I am not sure if my fridge is just set to a colder setting than most or what, but I was warming pumped breastmilk and I have had to do it 2 cycles almost every single time because otherwise it's still too cold and my infant son does not want to drink it. The problem with this is that if he is upset and crying and I am not home to nurse him, my husband has to try to calm a fussy baby while attempting to warm up a bottle for him. As per instructions, I *have tried filling it up to 10 instead of 7 and it really didnt help any.	
- 1	Filling them is hard. To shut it a lot spills out you must put not that much to be able to shut it. I so wasted my money.	
1. 	This is so much better than the first gate I bought from Target. (Avoid the Summer 07060C).Pros:- Sturdy- Well made- Super-tall- Two exensions in the box for multiple-wdiths.- It automatically closes.Cons:- Product price- Target's shipping chargeBe sure to see the photos under customer images.	
1. 	I get the question all the time: &#34;wow, I've never seen one that looks that comfy! Where did you get it?&#34;This is great for most shopping carts. I say most because there are some where the fit isn't quite right, but hey, we adjust and go with it. The main issue with fit is that sometimes the cover doesn't reach all the way to where I hold the cart so he can still get his hands on grub when it's not stretched out over it.I loved it when he was really little (e.g., 6 months) because the side pillows would help to keep him propped up and in the center of the seat. I still love it because it's comfortable and it has pockets in the back for anything you need (e.g., water bottle, pacifier, toys, shopping list, etc.) and it folds up with a velcro strap for easy carrying. A great product!!	
- 1	Even after watching the videos online, we couldn't figure out how our newborn son's legs were supposed to fit into this. So we waited a few weeks and tried again, once he was a little bigger and didn't require the booster cushion. The bottom of the insert has a confusing strap that doesn't seal the bottom of the insert. You can't put the baby's feet in the bottom, because they slip through the holes on either side of the strap. You can't put their feet outside when they're still tiny, because they're not big enough to straddle you yet. So we had to wait until our son was big enough that he didn't need the insert, and we basically never used it.	
- 1	When we first got this wipes warmer we were mostly pleased with it. Our only complaint was that you had to add water to the bottom pad every time that you changed to a new packet of wipes.Fast forward 8 months later and it became a pain to close the lid completely as it would pop back open. That meant that the one wipe that would be at the top would be hard and dry by the time of the next diaper change. Multiply that to about 6 changes a day, that meant I was loosing 6 wipes a day or 180 a month. Not acceptable!Then by the time our baby was 16 months old the wipes warmer stopped working completely. We tried several outlets, and the light would still be on as if it was working but it would not warm the wipes anymore! This while we were in the middle of this crazy Polar Vortex winter with so many days of record low temperatures and many snow storms that I lost count.I was hoping this warmer would last us for a longer time than 16 months. So We DO NOT recommend it to anyone and would try our luck with a different brand next time around.	
1. 	My 13 month old son LOVES his bath letter and numbers. He loves them so much that he wants to carry them around the house chewing on them.  And the best part is they are VERY durable!  He has 16 teeth already and doesn't rip them to shreds like other things he chews on.  We had to order a second set of these because we had some plumbing issues and these got ruined.  He's getting his second set for Christmas! :o)	
1. 	This was a great alternative to just draping a blanket over babies & bundling them up!  Didn't have to worry about blanket falling or re-draping!  Didn't have to put extra layers on babies just to take them out again!  Timesaver - which was really important to me as a new mother of twins!	
- 1	I am in the process of returning this pump after 2 months of use (Dec 2012 - Jan 2013).  Too many times the milk is sucked up in the tube, and even spills because it is not letting down into the bottle - very annoying.  Not convenient for travelling either, as it has too many parts to walk with and the tube should be longer (the Deluxe Single pump is most convenient for travel purposes - just get a good brand battery).The motor's hum is tolerable but could be quieter (horribly loud on the single deluxe).  Very disappointed in the infamous Medela brand on this item.  I have to pump a lot for my preemie baby so I rented the Symphony and it works great with a low hum! (just not portable).  Currently checking out the knapsack one to see if I should buy it...	
- 1	I was excited to get this ball for my 5 m/o twins thinking this would be easy for them to grab and hold. when I rec'd it from Amazon I found the plastic not only very soft and scratchable but also that it was peeling in one area and seems poorly made.  I am returning and not getting a replacement b/c I dont want my boys trying to chew this.  I also agree with another reviewer (which I wish I had read before  I ordered) that the interior side of the plastic is flat so the sharp edge may not be good for baby fingers that like to grab and shake things (which mine do). It is a good idea but not well made.	
- 1	These things are hit-or-miss, and we missed with this one. I can't say if it's the particular model or what, but of the two times we tried, it didn't stay on.	
1. 	These travel caps are great, I usually fill up all of my son's bottles with filtered water at the beginning of the day and cap them, leaving the other assembled accessories next to them for a quick bottle prep.  These are the only caps that will tightly seal the bottle, I've used the medela caps on those bottles and every single time I am mixing formula in the bottle they leak.  These caps are made for the dr. brown's bottles so definitely get them, if you like to secure the bottles with liquid or make formula in them.  This way you can ensure no leaks.	
1. 	The nipple is one that got rave reviews.  It is not difficult for a baby to drink from the nipple which is a good and reasonable size.I like the way the bottles come in sections which make clean up jobs easier.  You don't have residual feedings left in these bottles for that very reason.The angled shape make it easy for whoever is holding the bottle.  The weight is more or less evenly distributed and leakage, if any is minimal.  This also results in less gas and burping and a cleaner feeding time all around.	
1. 	We bought this swing for our son when he was 2 months old.  He has loved it ever since.  It puts him to sleep when mommy has something to get done, he will look at himself in the mirror, he loves the music, and he watches his Baby Einstein videos while in it.  It has served so many purposes.  You will love it.  Don't wait to get it though, you'll be sorry.  It also easy to fold up and move from room to room and up and down steps.	
1. 	This gate looks really nice compared to other baby gates I've used (I have the black one), was easy to install (we're using it pressure-mounted) and is easy enough to open for an adult but hard for a small child. I love that it's tall, as I don't need to bend down uncomfortably when I'm holding my eight-month-old. I ended up buying a second gate for another spot in my house. Buy this -- you won't be disappointed.	
1. 	This product really works well for my 10 month old. It keeps her snacks inside without spilling out everywhere. She was a little confused on how to get her hand in and pull the snacks out, but once she realized there was food in it she caught on real quick. I'm satisfied with this purchase.	
1. 	I almost put this on my Amazon baby registry but didn't because a friend was going to let me borrow her regular Pack 'N Play when my twins were born.  I never got around to getting it from her, and my husband and I brought our twins home with nowhere to put them on our main level (their room is upstairs).  The idea of dragging them up and down the stairs all day sounded horrible, so we literally ordered this the day we came home from the hospital and paid for rush delivery.  It was completely worth the price!  The twins are 6 weeks old now, and I can't imagine not having this.  It's really sturdy and the twins sleep just fine in it between meals.  We haven't had to pack it up to take anywhere yet, but I'm sure we'll be using it for a really long time.	
- 1	That's pretty much it.  I was really excited to get this for my 3 year old but the magnet is so weak it doesn't pick up or hold on to the fish at all.  Very disappointing.	
1. 	My daughter is a big time drooler and cannot be without a bib, ever.  Regular bibs allowed her clothes to get soaked in drool in a matter of minutes.  These bibs are great at keep her clothes dry and fewer changes are a big bonus as she hates having her clothes changed.	
1. 	We have 3 training potties and this is our favorite.  The seat is a little more spacious, while still having a small enough center to be supportive for small toddlers, but enough space to sit comfortably as they grow.  The splash guard is great for boys when used on an adult toilet!  And the handles make it feel very secure on the adult toilet for our tiny 2-yr old.  Having it work as a step stool is terrific for washing hands after using the potty.  The height is great - not too short.  Occasionally you need to clean under the cushion seat, or wipe up around removable bowl, but for the convenience of the multi-functions of this potty it is so worth it.  We recommend this potty to all our friends getting ready to potty train!	
1. 	Bought as a back up cover, it's plush, not very thick, but does the job and is soft. My son has never complained.	
- 1	While being adorable, and fitting our MAM pacifiers, this paci plushie does not do the job.  I thought would be a great idea for my 6 month old son, but the paci plushie just doesn't stay in his mouth.  He has a hard time keeping it in because it's just too light.  I wish it had a little more weight in order to anchor the pacifier in his mouth.  So in the end, it just didn't get used.	
- 1	Positives:- fast and accurate delivery- hands free pumping that you do not need additional accessories for- does adjust to any size, so you can make it as tight or loose as you want- provides good support during pumping (i.e. no sagging breasts)Negatives:- difficult to get pump flange through the opening (especially a problem if you have sensitive / hurt nipples - yikes!)- if you sit back at all (I sit in a recliner at home, not laying back, but I am slightly leaned back), then the bra does not let the flanges angle down so that the milk flows properly - I had to hold the flanges down the entire time during pumping, didn't feel so great- difficult to get on - I don't like the zipper design AT ALL!- thick seams (where you can adjust the bra on the back) are not comfortable, they rub and hurtOverall review:I really liked the idea of having a single pumping system.  Sometimes I forget to pack/wear my Pump Ease system and I get to work without a way to pump handsfree.  That being said, my Pump Ease system is very comfortable and easy to use - the only negative is that it is not as supportive (breasts sag somewhat since it is essentially a tube top with flange openings) and that I have to wear it in addition to my bra.That being said, I wouldn't purchase the Simple Wishes again; as a matter of fact, I have this in my pump bag in case I forget my Pump Ease - I am hopeful that I won't need to use it!	
- 1	First of all, I hate pumping. It's the bane of my existence. The insurance company sent an Ameda pump and flanges that are a bit too small. I went online in search of slightly larger flanges and found these.If you need to use medium, you need to stick the medium flange into the large flange. This is two extra flanges to wash per pump (annoying). This also means the medium flange will fall out onto the floor 75% of the time you use the blasted things (blood bloodcurdling annoying).	
1. 	I couldn't tell you if this is the reason my son's head is round in the back (smile).  But I can certainly say that this is excellent for keeping the baby's head in a straight and comfortable position, specially when they are newborns and they spend a lot of time in their carrier, bouncy chairs or swings.  This is not intended for use while sleeping in their crib.I would not recommend using this product in lieu of the standard car seat headrest while transporting the baby in a car.  After-market headrests that have not been crashed-tested could cause serious injury in the event of a collision.	
- 1	I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them.  They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly.  I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours.  They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work.  My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts.They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public.I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up.  This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic.	
1. 	Set up takes less than a minute and great as a portable playard. The toys on the sides are a lot of fun for baby. The colors are bright and cheerful. My 6 month old loves it. A little heavy to carry (I'm 5'2) but still highly, highly recommended!	
- 1	I did not realize looking at the image that the mat is clear.  It is very thin & not what I expected.  I am looking for a mat to go under my high chairs that will move with the high chairs without scratching my floor.  This mat does not satisfy that need.  The high chair easily slides on the mat, while the mat remains in the same place on the floor.  There is no cloth backing on the back to protect my floor from the feet of my high chairs.  I am returning them.	
- 1	I bought a MOBY wrap first.  After a few days I was tired of wrestling with 15 feet of fabric and then it was hot!!  This BB is so handy!  It will fit in the diaper bag and it is easy to put on like a purse and the baby fits right in.  It is also easy to get the baby to sleep and then remove and put in bed or swing.  This is much easier than lugging a car carrier everywhere (they're so heavy!).  This way you can leave the car seat in the car and just pop the baby in this sling to get groceries or go to the Dr. etc.  And if you don't like people to touch your baby all the time this is the way to go, they look but don't touch.	
- 1	The ear muffs only work if the baby's head does not rest on anything.  While holding or nursing my three-month old son, the ear muffs would move around and scrunch up his ears.  Perhaps they would work better on a six month plus child?  But they did look very cute.  Would not buy again.	
- 1	I know that these are just meant to wick away moisture from my daughter's bottom, but they are still MUCH thinner than I expected. Now that I have washed them several times, they are covered in lint; Sometimes to the point that they are bunched up after a wash. Point being, they don't keep the moisture away from my daughter's bottom and you may as well just cut up a piece of fleece from the store or an old fleece blanket you have laying around.	
- 1	I had five different bouncy seats with my twins and this was not my favorite. It was okay but took up so much room. You can get a smaller FP one with a light up activity bar with music for the same price. I would recommend the lighter smaller FP monkey seat.	
- 1	Bebe Dubon Bottle and Nipple Brush with Sponge Tip, Colors May Vary. It's really bad quality. Head and tail breaks after a few times using. Not recommend.	
1. 	I was happy to see that this is actually a Medela item in its original packaging. I was unable to find a replacement ice pack for my 5 year old pump in style model until I found this one. This was exactly what I needed!	
- 1	I can't believe how much this shrunk once it was washed!  It never made it to the changing table.  You would think the makers of this would know that every item that is going to touch a baby is going to be washed.  Therefore, have the material be pre-shrunk before marketing it.	
- 1	i am on my 4th baby so i have gone through and tried a ton of baby gates. this was by far the worst i have ever purchased. crappy tack welds with air bubbles and rough edges would probably break in a week or two or slice a fast moving hand. i tried putting this gate up using the extensions provided...wobbly and would not 'pressure mount' to the wall. i tried tightening it up more to where it wouldnt be pushed over by my 2 yr old, but then that would be too much pressure and could NOT open the door. do NOT buy this gate. there are better wide gates.	
1. 	Just received this item and it is exactly as described. Love the opening so I can look down at my little one. Although not expecting until Oct 2013 I am looking forward to using this. not sure if the size is too small but it looks good.	
- 1	I used these bottles for expressed breast milk to give my husband a chance to feed our baby. The bottles do not leak, like I have read in the other reviews. But, I used the #1 nipple which takes my daughter 45 minutes to finish and she constantly falls asleep during feeding. The #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after she was done even though she was burped several times during feeding. I switched to Dr. Brown's bottles which eliminated the gas problem all together.	
1. 	We went through several brands of bibs before settling on the Bumkins brand  These are far and away the best. Where we had issues with the others of developing some pretty bad stink, these ones are super easy to wash and clean and take a ton of wear and tear, coming out victorious.  Bib 1 - toddler 0.	
- 1	I wanted to like this bottle but using it was a nightmare. It leaked all over the place, from every seam, no matter what position it was in. I thought I was going crazy. Who would make a bottle this poor in quality and at this high cost per piece? I asked my iron man of a husband (6'4 and a professional firefighter) to tighten all parts to make sure I wasn't going weak and it still leaked everywhere. My mom tried it too, but formula dribbled horribly, even with the warming cap still on the bottom. Once its off, just go ahead and get your mop out. Geez Louise. We never actually fed our newborn son with the bottle, so I cannot even comment on his acceptance or rejection of the nipple. I would give it ZERO stars if that were a rating option. Very disappointing, especially at this price.	
1. 	PRO:  I feel confident that my child will not be able to remove theseCON: We have a hard time removing these when we need to use the outlets. It definitely takes two hands to push the top button and squeeze the sides at the same time.	
1. 	Actually, thank goodness for my mom, who bought this for us. She thought it had better features than the Baby Papasan, which we registered for (and someone else gave us). She was right. My 3 month old son does not like the papasan at all, but LOVES the massage bouncer. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. It's one of the few places he would sleep during the first several weeks. It's nice that the music, vibrator, and massage feature all have separate controls - so you can have one or all on at the same time. It also has a reset button to start the massage and music back up after the auto shutoff. The handle is great for carrying baby from room to room.A definite MUST-HAVE product!!	
1. 	I like the Bumkins bibs with the sleeves that tie in the back better, but my hubby prefers to use these. These bibs velcro in the back, and the baby can rip it off pretty easy, which defeats the point. I wish these ones tied, then I'd give it 5 stars.	
- 1	The spoon itself is a bit big for my 18 month. He puts it in his mouth and most of the food slides to the back of the spoon then falls off.	
- 1	We have made liberal use of suction cup toys like this for our children. We understand that you need to make sure that the surface is clean and smooth and that the suction cup is fully rinsed before trying to stick it down each time. Even with those precautions, sometimes they stay down; sometimes they don't.I bought this toy because we had something similar that I bought 8 years ago for my first child. I really didn't want something with a light in it, but didn't have a choice. My 6 month old will put this in his mouth while he sits at the table with us and it generally gets covered with food or drool. He couldn't care less about the light, which is motion activated.There is a little hole in the light-up ball that allows water (and who knows what else?) inside. Washing it means having to keep your finger over the hole and hope that you can rinse it fast enough. If food gets inside that hole, you are out of luck.I can't figure out why anyone would make a suction cup toy (presumably for use at a high chair, around food) that cannot be easily washed.	
- 1	My son did not like these also the netting came apart. They are also hard to open.	
1. 	I use this with my now 9 week old daughter and really like it. I was able to fit it in my kitchen sink and use it easily, before the cord fell off for sponge baths, because you let it absorb the water and they lay on it. We were given a baby bath and I tried using that a few times but I have to say, all I need is this sponge. She is so comfortable on it, unlike the other baby bathtub, with a sling insert. This is easy to use, makes her the most happy during bath time, and is easy to dry. For now its all we need.	
- 1	I like the idea of what this product is trying to do. It honestly didn't work for me though. The straps needed to be shorter. It didn't hold my boobs up, only caused them to sag too low and loose suction. This will work if your nipple and areola are low, but if not then it may not work for you. I gave this 2 stars only because I like the idea of it cause it honestly didn't work for me at all.	
- 1	Horrible!!! It ripped at the seams the first time i tried to use it. Disappointing!Manito sun shade is perfect tho...	
1. 	I really love that it turns itself off after 10 minutes! Saves batteries. My 1 year old loves to stare at the stars when I put him in bed for the night. It's not in his crib or anything where he can reach it though.	
1. 	Great child safety product, easy to install, not noticeable behind furniture.  Great price for the great product you get. Would recommend to any one even bought some for family.	
1. 	We got one of these for my older daughters and I love the whole thing. The infant body support converts into a very good head support for older children, it's low to the seat so I can get them in and out easier with  other car seats and I can fit 2 Radians and a Graco Snugride 32 in the back of our little 2 door Sunfire.	
1. 	I have no idea how people survived without the Skip Hop diaper changing bag!  Large enough to accommodate various surfaces (and babies) yet compact enough to fit in many purses.  Perfect when we're out - I often grab it out of the diaper bag and hand off to by husband to do a change!  Fits a generous amount of wipes and diapers and is quite durable.  I've been using mine on a daily basis for 10 months and it doesn't look any different from the day I opened it.  Great value for how often you will use this product!	
- 1	This crib is awful.  The only good thing about it is that it is so small and lightweight.  Here is why I hate it1. It is so hard to set up.  You have to shove these tight bungee cord things into the legs each time.  It takes two peole at least a half hour and leaves you sweating.  Not cool when you have a screaming baby in a hotel room at midnight!2.  The matress is uncomfortable and my baby hated it.  It is so thin!3.  It is hard to take down and you can't stuff it back into that little bag correctly.4.  The bag it comes in is cheap, mine tore after two uses.If you want something almost as small and light but 10000 times better go for the baby born travel crib!	
1. 	It comes with an ice pack but i found that the Medela 4 bottle ice pack works better and fits your cooler perfectly- Then you have cold around both sides and not just on the bottom, like with the ice pack it comes with.Its a good design and clips to almost anything. Its good not just for bottles, but as an upright lunchbox.	
1. 	I can't say enough about this play matt; it's great quality. We got ours already used three years ago, my son loved it, now my daughter; it's been through 3 or 4 kids and it still looks like new. The toys are engaging and moveable the lights and butterflys are what makes it so great for younger babies and I love that it has a low setting for volume and 'nature sounds' for when you cant take anymore toy music and the shake option to save battery life.	
1. 	Very soft and comfortable for baby. Has held up well despite countless washes! Def buy 2 so one is always ready to replace the dirty one.	
- 1	I bought one of these about 2 years ago for my first child and the quality was much better. The fabric was softer (think cotton vs. nylon), felt more padded, and it featured a soft, non-slip grip on the handle. The AIR version existed when I bought the first one, but I didn't see much difference between the two...Now, 2 years later I purchased this exact model for baby #2 and was very disappointed. The fabric (while attractive looking) is not very soft, feels cheap, and there is no grip on the handle. To get these features now, you HAVE to buy the AIR version... which, if you shop around, you can find for only about $40 more. It's definitely worth the extra money IMO. My daughter was in her onboard35 until 14 months, and having a soft fabric that baby will want to sleep on, and a soft handle that makes the carrier comfortable to hold, was a must-have for me.	
- 1	I dont really like this item because of the stopper inside. The piece that's supposed to allow liquid through when your child sucks on the cup is too firm and my 1 year old cannot get anything to come out. Sure its spill proof..... because you can't even suck the liquid out of this cup. Never fear.... your never gonna spill any liquid with this cup, cause you can't get it out!!!!	
- 1	What I like about it: The straw closes and the lid goes on securely.What I strongly dislike: A robot must have designed the cup because no person who actually used it would have thought it was a good idea to make the bottom like it is.  First off, the straw doesn't fully reach the bottom of the container, so there's always going to be liquid that will be left over with this issue.  Second, the straw end is in the middle of the cup so unless it's filled up at least 2/3, the rest of the liquid will be difficult to get to if you tip it even slightly.  Third, and the biggest design flaw, the bottom points up in the middle so there is ALWAYS 2 ounces of liquid that is simply unreachable because it sits like a ring around the short straw.  Fourth, I don't know how it happened but it did - mold grew inside of the straw after not using it for a few days. It must not fully dry on it's own.	
- 1	The suction cup is worthless, it's not just that the baby can over come it, it simply doesn't stick to anything.  The spoon and fork are okay, good size for little hands.	
1. 	~*Waterproof, wind resistant, made for its matching Bjorn carrier in City Black, what more could they offer for an already perfectly complete harnest set?*~	
- 1	I've never had a problem cutting my baby's nails with other nail clippers but I thought the magnifying glass would make it easier. I actually cut her finger trying to use the magnifying glass. It's difficult to use and pretty useless. I won't be using it again.	
1. 	I ordered this product because it was advertised to have a built-in splash shield, which many don't. I specifically researched and looked for one with that for my little girl. It says it has one and the picture shows it. However, the actual product does not have one. I opened the package, thinking it might be inside the wrapping,but no, it wasn't. Now, I'm out $15 and still have to look for another one.Two days later: I am adding this note on and raising my rating from one star to four stars. After I wrote the above review, amazon contacted me within 24 hours and offered me a refund, even if I wanted to keep the item. I was so surprised by the generosity of that offer. Amazon once again has proved itself excellent in customer satisfaction and really checked the reviews to see if they could make the situation better. I really appreciate that and love amazon all the more for it. Thank you, amazon.	
1. 	Boy do I love this product!  Easy to get on and super easy to open and shut.  Hard for guests- we have already had 2 ripped off the toilet and broken by guests too shy to ask how to open the toilet.  Our newest one has instructions written on it (by me) and the plastic piece on the lid has plenty of room to write these!	
- 1	Quality of this is not as good as I expected.  After using it just for 6 weeks, the sponge in the front of the brush started tearing off. However I like the small nipple brush that comes along with it.	
- 1	The purpose of a baby monitor is to free you up for household chores while still allowing you to know that junior is safe and sound. Audio does this nicely. Video only works if you sit there and watch it (which defeats the purpose of freeing you up for chores), and if it has audio, as this one does, then why even HAVE video?? Video is an unnecessary expense, because just what is there to SEE inside a baby's crib anyway? There shouldn't be anything dangerous in there anyway!!!! Save the $ and get an audio. As someone else pointed out, reception isn't always good on this model either.  Video monitors are a ploy to get well-meaning parents, eager to protect their children (if you don't get this, you're an irresponsible parent!), to spend more money. Look at the price tag on this compared to a simple audio.  Sell yours on ebay, spend ten bucks for a good audio monitor, and put the rest in baby's college fund where you'll get much more use out of it.	
1. 	we had the sleep sheep with our first and now the Gentle Giraffe with our second.  I think that this is cuter than the sheep.  Sounds are great - like it shuts off after 20 or 40 minutes.  Not too loud.  Great size.	
- 1	We have the Fisher-Price snug a monkey bouncer and absolutely love it and so does our little one. We purchased this to keep at our relatives house, but it's not even remotely the same. The size, shape, height, volume, everything is just... different. We ended up returning this and found another bouncer that is the same version that we have at our house.	
- 1	We use Nuk's bottles in this house. Until recently, though, i used theMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basketto run the bottle caps, collars, and nipples through the dishwasher. They fit pretty badly, so when i saw that Nuk had their own version out, i bought it.That was a mistake.This thing is made of soft, flimsy plastic. The expanding rack sections slip out of their tracks more easily than they slide out. The whole thing bends and twists instead of having any stability whatsoever. The top section for nipples doesn't have a hinged base, but rather a loose piece of plastic, so you have to do slight gymnastics to load it and close it without everything falling out of alignment.And strangest of all, nuk bottle components don't fit very well. The slots on the lid are too close together for the relatively large nipple bases. You can fit one cap and two collars in each of the expanding sections, and even with those sections extended out as far as they can go, there's space for 2.5 more caps in between. So, fully loading this, you can have:12 nipples, kinda overlapping and crammed together (6 if you want them all to have elbow room)4 caps8 collarsThat math just doesn't work.About the only GOOD part of this is that the bottom section is short enough that caps can't flip over and end the dishwasher cycle full of gritty dirty water.I've switched back to the munchkin dishwasher basket, because at least i can load it without swearing.	
- 1	The picture of this gate makes it seem as if it would be easy to get by it using one hand to open and close it.  Not true.  We are very disappointed.  You can't step over it and you can't open it with one hand with a baby in your arms.  It is only good for an opening that you don't need to get past easily.  But if you put it at the top of your stairs and you're trying to get down the stairs with a child in one arm and one free arm, it is useless.  I do not recommend it and can't figure out why it got such good ratings.	
1. 	I really like this potty and I'm glad we purchased it.  The seat seems to be comfortable and the handles are nice to have.  I love that the seat can be put on a regular toilet.  The one thing that I don't like is the fact that it seems to be a bit cheap in the way it is put together.  the blue seat part comes apart from the white frame that it is in fairly easily.  Hasn't been an issue yet at all but I just don't like it.  I do like the fact that it can be a stool as well.  All around, I like this potty a lot.  Just seems to be cheaply put together.	
1. 	At first I thought this tub was ridiculously big, but my son loves it! I think it's so clever that you can have the baby in a lying down or sitting up position, depending on which way you put him in--this product is very durable and made to last until your child outgrows it! We even bought a second one for our summer house, because I can't imagine giving him a bath without it. My son is 9 1/2 months old and can sit up perfectly, but still prefers to lounge in it lying down. I put it on my kitchen island and bath him that way, so I don't kill my back in the bathroom. I also like that it's all plastic, no mesh or rubber mats that can mildew--it has a bump in the middle to keep the baby from sliding.	
1. 	I just love carrying the baby around in my Baby Bjorn. It soothes the baby when he sleeps. I can take him out in cold weather and feel his body heat against my sweater while covering him under my coat.	
1. 	They are more than just wipes for us.  We use them as washcloths and handkerchiefs too.  They are super soft and have held up really well through almost 100 washes so far.	
- 1	Our 10 month does not like it at all. She prefers Razbaby RaZberry Teether(from 3 mo till now it's her fav.)Maybe later she will use this weird teether. I like the description of the product and unusual shape that's why I give it 2 stars. Btw I bought it for $15 on amazon.	
- 1	I purchased this mat because we had moved our 10 month old out of his baby tub and I wanted something to keep him from sliding around in the bath tub.  I also liked that there were frogs on it and I knew he'd like to see them through the water.  It took over a week for it to finally lay flat and actually suction to our bath tub (it had been rolled up in a box for so long).  But now 3 times this week my son has slipped sitting on that mat and hit his head.  I've been watching him every time and he doesn't do anything to cause him to slip, just starts to move to get a toy and slips and hits his head.  I'm extremely disappointed with this product.	
1. 	I loved this carrier until my daughter was about 15-18 pounds. After that it was way to heavy for extended period of times. When she was small it was perfect we could go for walks, get errands completed around the house, or just hang out outside with it on. I tried it at the store and at the mall, but after a while my back started hurting. My daughter was actually pretty comfortable in it. My husband wore it a few times to and he said it was comfortable.Con-When My daughter could be placed fron forward the top of the carrier rubbed on her face and would not bend down, so that was a pain.	
1. 	I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for.  I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it.  I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up).  However, this advertised as no tip over which is another reason I bought it.  I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere.  Other than that, so far it's good.	
- 1	I checked the online reviews of this product before spending the money on it. I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle. I have since returned the Snoogle. I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable. The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me. I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me. I prefer the regular body pillows and find much more comfort using them-for a lot less money.	
1. 	I love this bag.  Have not had any problems with zippers, it frees up my hands and it sits comfortable on the shoulder.  My husband likes it too, as it is not too childish.  It has lots of space, for extra set of clothes, 6 or so diapers, blanket, burp cloth, bottles, bib, etc.  We also have the larger messenger style for longer trips, it is great too.	
1. 	So my baby was very frustrated when she was in that awkward &#34;I don't want to lay down but I don't have the physical capacity to sit up yet&#34; phase. It's the phase I hit after 4 glasses of wine. She hit it at 3 months. I brought this with us everywhere we traveled, my dad found it hilarious, called it a baby container. This nest propped her up and gave me a break, she loved sitting in it I would haul it into the bathroom and I could take a shower. A shower! Thank you Galt, my husband thanks you as well. I was getting pretty desperate. And stinky.  Once she got the knack of sitting up and crawling I stopped relying on it so heavily. But, still a nice spot for her to relax when she first wakes up, she's 9 months now and she likes to look at the animals and recline in it. It looks so cozy, I want one in my size. It's bright, colorful, very high quality fabric. This is a very well made and amazing product, those Germans, they know how to make nice things.	
- 1	I bought this bra hoping I could wear it under my clothes while at work, pump and continue to work - not so much. I didn't try any other pumping bras and I guess I didn't realize how bulky they would be, but no way could you wear this thing under any outfit, except for a heavy sweater. The option of taking it to work and putting it on before every pumping is a complete waste of time, it takes longer to put it on than it does to just open my regular bra, pump and slightly cover up with the shirt I was wearing. I wish I hadn't bought this bra it is just too impractical.	
1. 	Yes, these things work. NO baby can get them off.  Thing is, if your outlets aren't 100% sturdy (i.e.. loose sockets), you adults will have a tough time too (because of how tightly they stick).  Your best bet is to alternate: use these in your baby's primary play area and choose a more user-friendly model for the places you plug in most. (The simple ones without the release buttons.)  This works for us.	
- 1	Now that my son moves a lot, the insert moves too and the adhesives end up sticking to his skin and irritating it. He's also had diaper rash which he doesn't get with Seventh Generation disposables.	
- 1	Kinda useless ..... the whole head part is silicone (no bristles) that surprised me ... and its TINY! I was expecting something much larger but its half the size of my hand .... Baby enjoyed throwing it around the room and everynow and then took a half hearted attempt at sucking/chewing on it.  We got some other toothbrushes for her which actually have bristles and we can actually use to brush her teeth and she enjoys	
- 1	This is great for the first 30-60 days with a new baby, but good for the garbage after that.  It gets moldy fast, and a larger baby will flip right out.  I would say it's likely there is something better, but for the price it's good.	
1. 	If you want a soft-hanging organizer, this is the best you'll get. It does tip forward a bit, as any hanging fabric organizer will, but it has compensated for that with pocketed shelves (as opposed to open shelves like on theDex Products Ultimate Baby Organizerwhere everything slides right off). I use this Munchkin organizer with thePrince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmerand it fits great right on top in a very convenient place. It fits everything I need in the organizer, whereas with theDex OrganizerI had to use an extra TV table tray to handle the overflow. The pocketed diaper middle section is great! It actually holds the diapers in! It's tricky to restock it, but the fact that the diapers do not tip out more than makes up for it! If you want something sturdier, you'll have to go with hard plastic, because you won't find a better fabric organizer.	
- 1	These cute nylon buckets are really cheap!  The straps are already tearing after a couple weeks.  They tilt over easily and the fabric is really thin.  I give this set 2 stars, barely, for at least holding stuff as promised... they won't last and I do not recommend them.  Cheap and cheaply made.	
- 1	We bought this video monitor, set it up in our infant's room before she was born.  It worked great initially.  After our daughter was born, we turned it on and the video display was grey- only a shadow of an image day and night.  Because it worked initially, we got rid of the packaging, so can't return.  Thank goodness the sound is good- we will use for that- a very expensive audio monitor...	
1. 	We love this gate for our house.  Our daycare provider recommended it to us and we've been very please with it.  It works well mounted or unmounted and it's so nice that it swings on it's hinge when mounted.  We also like that it doesn't have bars for our son to use to pull up on.	
1. 	My brother and his family are a very green family!  They loved this gift.  They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!  My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's green test!  YAY!  I recommend this gift!	
- 1	The image of these block make you think they are more three dimensional then they really are. They are hard to grab for my 5 month old, and are quite boring. They are just pictures for the most part with one teether toy. The black swirls are just a picture. They have nothing to hang them with, so they are just three plain blocks. I have purchased far more better blocks that my daughter can acually learn and play with then these. A waste of money. Dont buy!	
1. 	We put this in our daughters room and it will hold about 20 small stuffed animals. It is not very large and it would not work for very large or heavier stuffed animals or dolls. Overall a great product to keep the floor cleaned up in her room........would buy again.	
1. 	Being a stay-at-home Mom, I don't need to pump frequently, but when I do pump, this item is terrific!  Easy to use.  I'm able to pump a 4 oz. bottle in 5 minutes.  I suggest using it without the let down massage cushion.  It works better for me without it.  Easy to clean and case makes storage easy.	
- 1	This is not a horrible product.  Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies, and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.They will leak, but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication.  The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean.  Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand.  There are just so many parts!Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.Two stars.  You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles.  But otherwise give it a pass.	
- 1	These are ok but quality didn't impress me and not that absorbent. I end up using cloth diapers as burp rags most of the time. And FYI. If you are a first time mom, you need like 20 burp rags or cloth diapers to use as such.	
1. 	I wish I had known about this before I bought a vibrating bouncy seat. My son, large at birth, outgrew his first bouncy seat at 3 months. I got this one and it is the only one you need. I have a long boy and at 9 month he still fits in it comfortably, though I removed the overhead toys. The conversion to a rocking chair is super easy. Took no time to put together. These items have limited lifespans, but this particular one has a longer life than others because of the rocking chair option.	
1. 	My barely 2 year old figured out how to open this on his first try. However, we keep it way up at the top of the door so he can't reach it. It's very quick and easy to open, and my toddler can no longer open the door for strangers.	
- 1	This stopped working correctly, shortly after I got it.  When I try to use the ocean or white noise sounds, the machine shuts off after just a few seconds (even after putting in new batteries.)  Also, it no longer starts up in the same mode that was last used, like it used to do when I first got it.I'm unable to return it, because the person who got it for my baby shower bought it ahead of time, so now it's past the window of time where I'm able to return it.Loved it for the short period of time that it actually worked.:(	
1. 	I do enjoy this, as it enhances the organization of baby's closet. I just didn't realize that I'd probably be putting most of baby's clothes in the dresser at first...so there's not much in the closet to actually organize. I have also since seen some pretty neat do-it-yourself ideas to achieve the same goal that you could come up with.As for the actual product, it comes with 5 hanging tags and then a bunch of label stickers to stick on them. (The labels being: Newborn, 3 month, 6 month, etc...up to 24 month.) So even though there's only 5 tags, you can put a new sticker over top of the old one as baby grows. The tags are also reversible and can be labeled on each side.	
1. 	keeps all the diapers, lotions and creams organized. it doesnt move around and its sturdy. bought the wipes warmer to go on top. so worth it :)	
- 1	In the hospital, when i started having some nipple tenderness due to establishing breastfeeding, the nurses gave me some of these. They swore up down and sideways that they'd be the best thing ever. Apparently they work wonders for most women.For me, not so much. While the cool sensation when i first put them on was quite nice, it only lasted a few seconds. Beyond that, their only use was as shields to protect me from my own shirt, and quite frankly, there are much cheaper ways to do that than with this product.I'm a little baffled reading some of the other reviews from women who claim that these pads stuck on so firmly that they were painful to remove, or that they left a gooey residue. I had the opposite problem - they fell off too easily. No residue, no nothing. I had to hold them on with my hands any time i moved around, otherwise they'd fall off. (I was warned by the nurses to absolutely not combine use of these pads with any cream, that doing so would cause the gel on the pads to come off. Also, i wasn't cracked or bleeding. The combination of these pads with either nipple creams or blood might cause the problems i didn't have.)For me, ultimately, these pads were a waste of time. Using plain oldLanolin, andNursing Padsto protect my breasts from my shirt, worked far better.	
- 1	The size is too small. Also it's not really flannel,but cotton flannel which is much thinner than I expected. It might work better as burping cloths.	
- 1	This product is a waste of money.  I bought this because my daughter hated tummy time and I thought it would help her enjoy being on her tummy more.  If your baby doesn't like being on her tummy, this product will not make any difference.  Save your money and just use a blanket and yourself to motivate your little one to  enjoy being on her tummy, because this product does not help!!	
- 1	The detergent was good at cleaning and keeping diapers stink-free, but a few days after we started using it, my daughter broke out in a nasty rash that would not go away. I had to put her in a disposable and wash all of the diapers and covers multiple times in regular detergent to clear up the rash.	
- 1	I decided to splurge on my second son's mattress. I bought my first son a regular mattress without considering the materials and off-gassing, etc. this seems to be a nice mattress but it is very heavy and doesn't quite fit well in my pottery barn Kendall crib. I always have to jam the corners down and the mattress seems to be slightly too big for the crib. The mattress also seems to slope down from the middle to the sides and my newborn (less than a week old) somehow rolled down to the crib side when swaddled.  I would not buy this mattress again.	
1. 	In my opinion they aren't any better or worse than any other outlet covers I have bought. They go in snug, so I like that and they are easy for adults to get out and use. I would buy them again. They are a good price and they arrived on time.	
1. 	Looks good, feels fine and baby seems to like it. I see no reason in spending 4x as much money for the others when this one does the job just fine. I keep mine in my car for short pop-in situations that make taking the car seat to bulky. Takes no time to put it on, once you initially adjust the straps to what feels good, and no time to take it off. Putting baby in has even gotten easier (I had one 9yrs ago) now with the dual side entry buckles. I have no strap or back issues.**JMO - Adjust the straps so that baby sits as high up as possible. The baby should not hang (I hate to see people wearing their babies too low) then there's no issue with baby's legs hitting yours; unless of course your baby just has long legs :-)I recommend this carrier, over the more pricey ones.Oh yeah, the pocket in front came in very handy.	
1. 	This sleep sack came and I was shocked at how large it was get a size down for sure!! Our son wont be able to use this for months but it is soft and cute!	
- 1	I do NOT like this tub!!!!!  It gets 2 points for cute, but -3 for having NO drain, being TOO slippery, and too short on the inside.  The duck tub is better, we got this car tub to replace a holey duck. I didn't realize it didn't come with a drain, which is really fantastic if your baby/toddler pulls a maneuver that causes a need for emptying the tub quickly for safety reasons.  I feel it's a potential safety risk, more than other tubs.  What a disappointment, it's otherwise really cute and the pockets are fun.  It's also a lot harder to inflate than the duck tub.	
- 1	I bought these hoping to switch away from disposables but the second I leaked, it went directly through the pad to my shirt. No absorbancy at all. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	Easy to use, Easy to clean, Easy to store. Best one I have seen or used. I have bought a few for friends in the last couple of years. The padding on the sides helps wondeful for tired little ones or learning to sit up little ones.	
- 1	Our daughter is in the 90th percentile for height and can't touch the ground at 4 months. The spinning seat doesn't spin. It must be turned manually by the parent so kids can't choose their favorite toy. The overhead bar holds two toys that are out of reach. Including a teether that the baby wouldn't be able to reach to their mouth until they're about three years old. The bounce pad is stiff, and doesn't bounce. Basically it was a really cute design with the best intentions of being fun but it appears nobody tested the prototypes when they came back from China. This is something I see again and again. Doesn't anyone test the final product before shipping any more? Now I have to break it down, box it up, and shell out the extra 50 for the gawdawful Evenflo saucer that's festooned with a zillion tacky widgets.	
- 1	What I received was NOT a Medela plug!! The sticker on the package said Medela, but that is not what I received. It wasn't even what was in the picture. Thankfully I was able to call Medela and they replaced it for FREE with the proper adapter. Not only was it not what it said it made my pump work at half power!!	
- 1	it might be because I have a short torso or because I can't sit fully straight up while nursing but it's really not user friendly. To save your precious milk I'd suggest getting the Avent's breast shields. It's smaller but it fits in your nursing bra while you feed. Don't get this though if you leak ounces per feeding	
- 1	I have no idea why it got such positive reviews. It's just a long long piece of elastic cloth (like 8 ft by 2 1/2 ft), which I could have easily stitched myself. It's not something where you can put a baby in right away and be on the go.  Each wrap session takes like 5 minutes and if it becomes loose or undone, you have to unwrap to rewrap it with both hands (and the baby might fall out while you're doing this).	
- 1	I hate these snack cups.  The lid pops off (spilling snacks everywhere) every time the container is dropped...  I appreciate the concept - it's nice to have a lid attached so that crumbs don't get everywhere and it's easy for my 15 month old to hold and get snacks himself.  However, these are pricier than other options and the lid constantly comes off - totally defeating the purpose of having a snack cup with a lid in the first place.	
1. 	The bottle warmer is a must have for new moms.  It's such a pain to heat a bottle in boiling water - and it takes so long.  This bottle warmer will heat your bottle in 1-2 minutes -- it's quick and easy.  The product has held up nicely and doesn't take up too much counter space.	
1. 	Hard to find a pack & play this large anymore and with the twins coming it will be great to have.	
1. 	The membranes arrived slightly curled as if they'd been stored in a hot warehouse for quite sometime. I ran them under some pretty hot water and flattened them on a towel. No harm no fowl so far. Some of them do rip if I'm not careful pulling them off the yellow valve, but I think that's me trying to be quick (and thus too rough) more than anything. I make sure to have quite a few of these on hand at all times, just in case.	
- 1	I didn't realize when I bought this that I would need a specialized straw cleaning tool, sold seperately of course. No thanks. I opened it, looked at it, realized it had this weird knobby thing on the bottom of the straw that made it impossible to clean. Quickly decided it would be a pain to deal with and immediately returned it. Waste of time!	
- 1	I put these on my registry, and tried them out.  The baby couldnt figure these out, and just got frustrated.  They were ridiculous to clean.  I went on to try Tommee Tippee (only sold at BrU, fyi) and they were perfect.  We are a Tommee Tippee family, now.	
- 1	Unfortunately, despite the great packaging that this came in, the bottom (middle out of 3) came broken/shattered. That made me concerned about giving it to little kids who throw and drop things all the time.	
1. 	You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a hospital grade breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE	
- 1	I bought these because I threw out all our old squeeze bath toys since I was worried about the mold inside.  Loved the idea that you could open and clean these out.  Problem is that they are are sort of hard and inflexible so tough to squeeze, and not really that much fun.  Kids can't squeeze them at all, so they never fill up with water.  Plus once the kids figured out they twist open, they just want to open and close them (usually bugging me for help, which means I'm spending bathtime opening and closing them for them).  Not exactly play as the product was intended.  They are super cute, and I'm disappointed.	
- 1	The material & design is great but I don't know how mothers use this comfortably w/a newborn who is basically flopping around all over w/o any neck support. It was also difficult to transfer my 1 month old out of the sling smoothly and into her crib while keeping her semi-asleep.	
1. 	This was a wonderful teether for our little one.  It was just the right size to easily grip, he was fascinated by all the colors and spinning pieces, and I felt good about letting him chew on it, knowing it wasn't covered in toxic paint or leeching plastic chemicals.  :)	
1. 	I love these pad covers! The fabric is so soft and feels great to the touch. We just found that putting a small muti-use absorbant pad under the diaper area saves a lot of time and hassle. We keep plently on hand and just replace one when it gets soiled. That way the plush cover stays fresher longer and you dont have to remove and clean it so much. Washes and tumble dries easily.	
- 1	This won't work on children because it requires them being able to sit still for about 3 seconds.  Trust me, 3 seconds is a VERY LONG time. The child will grab the device or turn their head and try to get away, especially if they're in a bad mood (as they often are if not feeling well) and you'll get error messages.  The only way it'll work is if you have someone helping you in holding the kid's head still.  Even then, you'll have to do it at least 3 different times because the reading often varies.However, this device is fine for adults.  But once again, you'll have to take the temp several times and then average it because the readings vary.	
- 1	This was very disappointing, it is so hard to pump water!~ I have a hard time no way can my toddler pump it!	
1. 	Used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center.  Works great.  We used it horizontally, unlike the suggested vertical method.	
1. 	Hang this above your changing table and watch your baby transform from fussy to totally calm. This awesome mobile is the finest I've ever encountered. Keeps baby engaged and stimulated. After watching the power this mobile has over diaper change disasters, I purchased a second one to hang over the play yard. My twins love it!Tip: Think twice before hanging this over the crib. It's stimulating for babies; thus, they might have problems falling asleep with this above their heads. I've found it's far more suitable for awake time.	
1. 	This shade really does work but it does not roll off the foam cylinder smoothly as advertised.  Maybe I am doing it wrong but I did struggle a little bit to get this shade on.  It still ended up with bubbles that I just couldn't smooth out but it really didn't affect my field of view.  I used it on both rear side windows and the rear window itself because our baby is still rear-facing.  It looks pretty cool as well and is fairly discreet unlike some of the other brands that are out there.	
1. 	I love the Diaper Giene.  I have had many smelly diapers that have been tucked away and swirled into diaper sausages :)  It keeps the odor under control!	
1. 	I wanted leak proof cups for my toddler who goes to bed with a sippy of water. He often wakes in the middle of the night and wants a drink of water. With this being right next to him, he can get a drink himself. I like the larger size of this cup (9oz) and I also like that it keeps his water cold. And leakproof, yes, 100% leakproof! I tested it myself to see how hard it is to get water out of this cup. You have to suck, but nothing that would be too difficult for a toddler. When this cup gets knocked over in bed or on the living room floor, not a drop of water comes out.I'm very happy with my purchase. I would buy these again.	
- 1	My 7 month old absolutely loved the purple elephant tug toy. It was her favorite toy. Until today when she had one of the little dangling feet in her mouth and somehow inhaled it. The string to the foot is long enough that the ball of the foot was way in the back of her throat. SCARY. Thank God my husband was there. I almost threw the whole thing away but I know how much she loves it so I just cut off all the legs.	
- 1	May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms.	
1. 	This diaper pail is great and even better that you don't have to worry about running out of bags. You can use just regular trash bags which is awesome. I have three complaints, the first is that you can only use about half the trash bag because of the way it dumps them in there which is kinda a waste. The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells. The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done. That's the only time it smells though. My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean. These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind. I like not having to buy expensive bags especially with all the other costs a baby brings, and it does keep the smell out which is what it's supposed to do.	
- 1	I wanted something to put over my daughters eyes so she wouldn't get soapy water in her eyes. This doesn't really contour her whole head, so water leaks down the sides. Also, you have to hold the cup with one hand while you rinse with the other..leaving no free hands to hold your child or help them tilt their head or anything. I don't think this is very practical. My daughter is now two and we never use this thing. Waste of money.	
- 1	Just cough up the extra money on an electric pump. I got this trying to save money and it was very painful and didn't really work. I ended up having to get an electric one anyways after a week of using this one and giving myself horrible blisters.	
- 1	I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	cheapest made rack in the history of all racks.  It was difficult to even connect it because for some reason the customer has to assemble this tiny rack from 6 pieces it arrives in  (?!) and the parts didn't fit quite well.  A very disappointing product for this brand.	
- 1	I should have listened to the other reviewers. These are so small and thin. They hold up well through washing I just don't like to use them because I think they are too small.	
1. 	This is a great product.  We use the Avent Bottles &amp; Avent Isis Breast Pump and they are made to fit into this sterilizer.  However, it works just as well on other stuff.  (You don't have to use their configurations to get good results.)  It's so much easier than boiling.  You just pop it in the microwave for 5 minutes and everything is sterilized.  We love it.	
- 1	As another reviewer pointed out, and as Brica confirmed, the sides of this bassinet are not breathable where it's not a see-through mesh. That means the bassinet is not safe to use once your infant is mobile at all, because if they can squirm up against a non-mesh area of the side and put their face against it, they could suffocate.Brica also says (in personal correspondence) that there are important limitations: don't use the bassinet once your infant reaches 3 months old or 15 pounds. This wasn't disclosed anywhere on the product packaging or instructions. Since the package clearly shows an infant over 3 months old being put into the bassinet, you could easily be misled into using it for an older infant. This really is for an immobile newborn.For an immobile newborn, this travel bassinet is easy to use, lightweight, and very portable. But to keep babies safe, the age and weight limitations should be clearly explained, and the side fabric should be a breathable fabric.	
1. 	We tried Avent first and my son never could drink from that big nipple very well.  I breastfed too he was good on both the bottle and breast.  When we used bottles Dr. Brown seem to cause less gas and he enjoyed them better.	
1. 	My son was born in the beginning of January and we've used this every time we go out. It's easy to use and no hastle. Just put the baby in the carseat and merely zip up the two sides. I wished they made something like this to go over a carrier. I can't wait to purchase the Lite Bundleme for the springtime.	
1. 	This seat worked great while my daughter was little but when she reached around 21 inches and wasn't even a year yet it became difficult even if she sat in the toddler end of the tub. I would still recommend this and it fits perfectly in a single or double sink. I also like the feature where the plug turns white if the water is too hot. I would recommend this.	
1. 	Very satisfied with this, my daughter drools a lot and this kept my Bjorn away from the white stains and kept her face from being wet from the drool.	
- 1	I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either. I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage. They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner. Definitely not usable overnight.	
- 1	while these are thin, the cloth folds on itself and creates 'sharp' edges. The cloth is not soft enough to manuver easily around baby's bottom. Also they are on the rough side, which might be good for a sticky poo, but they are not absorbant either and just smear the poo. If you are looking for a nice wipe, go for the Prince Lionhart Wipes.	
1. 	Thank GOD for this swing! My daughter is 4 months old now and she's loved it since she was 2 weeks old! Though she couldn't sit up in it, the chair supports her and keeps her upright.And because of this swing, I CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT! During her first month, I would put her in the swing on high speed and let her sleep there with her pacifier in her mouth. She'd sleep for a longer period of time there than anywhere else!Please note that the swing is bulky, so prepare an area of about 4 feet by 4 feet so you have enough space...or opt for the same swing style, but the portable swing. My daughter LOVES that one, too, and it takes up about 3 feet by 2 feet. ENJOY and SLEEP BETTER!	
1. 	It is very soft, and I like the color.It is large for my 7 month baby. Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality.	
- 1	I am giving this product 2 stars based on my personal experience. I have seen this potty perform better on other kids or I should say on girls vs. boys. I have used many Baby Bjorn products in the past and I have had good experience. This product was recommended by friend (she has a girl) and I got it a while ago even though my boys (twins) did not use the potty at that time. We recently star using the potty and both boys would leak out of the potty. 8 out of 10 times the pee-pee would be mainly outside on the floor. I am tired of cleaning. My friend who has a girl does not have the same problem so from my experience this is a great potty but not as great for boys as it is for girls. The old version of this potty is way better.	
1. 	Our 2.5 year old girls have outgrown their pack n plays and we were looking for something for them to sleep on when we travel.  These are fantastic.  The girls fit on them well and slept through the night on them.They are a canvas material, similar to what you see on camping chairs.  They come with their own fitted sheet you can wash.  I used that, but also put a toddler bed size fitted sheet on top of it to make it softer.  Because it is a cot, it bows a little in the middle, which seemed to be enough to keep my girls from rolling off onto the floor.  They slept on them for 4 nights and didn't roll off once.The legs are designed in such a way that even when your child lays down, the cot does not rest on any of the legs (no bars in your back).  I was worried about that when I saw the design, but it was not an issue.They fold up sort of like a camping chair (of course a little bigger).  It is much smaller than the pack n play was folded up, which helps with the packing.  You simply pull the bed out of the bag, open it, put the sheet on, and you are all set.  There is no assembly or set up.  You just open and use it.  It folds up just as simply and is easy to get back into the bag.I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling with toddlers.Update:  We ordered this in February of 2013.  Here it is October of 2013 & my girls have outgrown it.  In all fairness, we probably kept them in pack n plays too long.  But, on a recent trip, in trying to turn over, one of our girls rolled on the floor.  They were just about the right size for it, as long as they didn't move.  We tried them in a bed together on our last trip, lined with pillows.  We had a little learning curve & a couple falls out of bed (I know, same problem as the cot), but by the end of the week, we figured it out and feel more confident next time we travel.  I would make sure you have enough of a window to use it, or have more kids coming up (we just have the twins) to make the purcahse worthwhile.	
- 1	Do you notice the fluorescent light from the yellow part of the elephant rattle? I have been concerned about it ever since I discovered it one day under the blue light of our ceiling lamp.I think safty is the top 1 standard for baby products.	
1. 	Comes in handy when you are on the go. Heats up quickly and warms bottle in minutes. Will purchase more.	
1. 	We purchased two of these for our king size bed because I co sleep with my 6 month old. These are great and I will be able to attach these to my son's bed when he is older as well, I do wish there was a foam padding over the metal bar because my son has hit his head on the rail before. Overall great purchase that is safe and protects from falls	
- 1	We bought this gate for our dog and thought it would work well for our baby later. We were wrong. Our son has successfully learned how to climb it and fall over it. This could be a huge hazard to those not knowing this as he learned how to do this within a few minutes.It's a great solid gate that stays put if you're looking for a dog gate. If you're looking for your child move on... We're currently ordering one that has vertical only bars so his little feet aren't tempted to attempt another climb.	
- 1	We had these for about a month and loved them until I tasted my toddlers food. It tastes strongly like plastic when ever we put in any type of food that has fat it it. Like milk, butter, meat etc. Too bad....very disappointed. I did put them in the dishwasher...not sure if that changed them.	
- 1	The swing is cute with its design etc,...Takes up alot of floor room. This swing goes through D batteries every 2 weeks, gets expensive. I suggest getting a swing that will plug directly into a outlet. I found that the mobile on the swing to be a real pain, when you are getting the baby in and out. Bop the babies head on the mobile. Sold ours on craigslist and purchased a plug in swing.	
1. 	This is a great Bouncer. My daughter loved the vibrations and watching the fish swim by. When she was older she loved to bat at the objects hanging down. When all else failed i would put her in the bouncer and she would fall asleep. The music was calm and relaxing and she could spend hours in there.	
1. 	I love the images of stars that this nightlight projects on the ceiling, but I have bought this nightlight twice b/c it has stopped working twice. Not sure why, but it's not anything we've been able to fix so I've had to return and re-buy.	
- 1	We purchased this stroller after meeting someone else with it. It looked like the perfect stroller for our 2yr old and 3 month old. We got it and put it together. As soon as the boys were in the stroller and we gave it a push, the front wheels wobbled to and fro. It wobbled so much, I couldn't push my kids in it for fear of shaken baby syndrome. Yes, it wobbled that much. However, standing stationary it seemed like it was going to be very comfortable.I called customer service. There is nothing the consumer can do to remedy the wobble...it's just the way it was designed. And they couldn't send me any wheels because they were out of stock. (I wonder if that was a clue). They did send me a label to return the stroller for a refund. I'm waiting to see if I actually get a refund. They told me it could take 6-8 weeks after they receive the stroller. So for now, I am out almost $200 and still don't have a stroller. I'm super disappointed.	
1. 	The Bjorn is worth every penny!I purchased my Baby Bjorn when my son was two months old, and used it on a daily basis until he was four months old (my son went to work with me for two months).  It is much easier on the back than the Snugli carrier is - I still carry my 10-month-old, 21-pound son in our Bjorn at least once a week.I love it because it keeps my hands free, and my son starts giggling and babbling every time he sees it because he enjoys riding in it so much.  (I have to confess, there have been a couple of times when I gave it to him to play with because I needed to get some baby-free stuff done!)  I never worry about dropping him when he is in the Bjorn.Our Bjorn has been through the washer and dryer several times and is only showing a little color fading.  I would recommend unhooking the straps from the carrier before throwing it all in the wash - they can get really tangled together.	
- 1	This item came missing an essential part. The lower latch on one side, which the upper bar of the bassinet connects to, was missing. The manufacturer made us take pictures and email them to prove it was defective. We also had to email our proof of purchase. You would think they would take something that involves infant safety more seriously.After all that, they couldn't send us the replacement part because the frame did not have the holes pre-drilled. Then, they wanted us to package up and return the frame. I had to insist that they send a replacement in the meantime so we would have something for our baby. The next day, however, they called to say they no longer have that color in stock.In the end we had to mail them back the frame so they could repair it and then return it to us. All of that hassle and nothing to show for it except a repaired item that should have been correct in the first place.	
1. 	I wanted to pick up a potty in order to have an option for my LO when traveling. A friend told me to keep it in the car and you never have to find a bathroom. Great idea!  The only trouble I saw with this idea was having to clean up the mess while out and about.  That's the main reason I like this potty.  You can place a diaper in it and the seat will hold it securely in place. No mess to clean up!It also serves as a step stool and this has come in handy ( we use it at home when not traveling). LO seems to really like it too.	
- 1	Only lasted a month until it started malfunctioning. Threw it away at 2 months and bought a different one. Great while it lasted	
1. 	Other than the longer than expected setup time of this product, this has been a great product for us as parents of twins. I would go by The weight limit for the bassinets as they won't hold too much weight.	
- 1	I had to use 3 knives to get this dang thing open the first time. I wasn't the only one that tried either - three other adults couldn't get the dang thing apart. Of the three plug covers I bought, this one will definitely keep the baby out, but it was really frustrating getting it apart the first time. I had to put a knife under each of the two tabs and then had a pry it open on the sides.	
- 1	I purchased this as Amazon recommended it to buy together with Dream On Me 3 extra firm mattress which I also purchased. It literally just fit the mattress after one wash per its washing instructions. I would look for other sheets.	
1. 	I got this multiple pack of toys so that I could keep a couple for my daughter and use a couple as shower gift decorations.  One of them in particular sounds like a cat toy, but my daughter loves it.  Glad that I was able to get 4 in a box... made it way more cost effective than if I would have had to buy separate toys.	
1. 	I bought this last year when we planned a trip to Disney world. My daughter, who was 3 at the time, was terrified of the big restroom toilets. This little potty did the trick and we had a fun and comfortable time in the happiest place on earth! We have traveled a lot since then, both in the country and internationally, and this potty has been a blessing!!Pros:Very light and portable.Comfortable enough for quick loo visits on the go.Clean up is a breeze, especially since its mostly just tie up and throw.The little bag that holds the folded potty is very convenient too.Cons:The liner refills could get expensive, especially if the potty is used a lot. I lucked out by having a lot of left over nursing pads...I just stick one in a plastic bag or disposable diaper bag and we are all set.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and never used it (minus one time). This is something that is not needed. I had it in my baby registry since I read such good reviews here. My bad! I sold it on craigslist right after the first time I used it. Please don't waste your money here, go buy something useful for yourself or your baby. Good luck with nursing!PS: I didnt have the fireworks, I had one with polka dots cover.	
- 1	My 2-month old twins seemed to really enjoy this playmat.  They were able to hang out for a full 20-30 minutes and be entertained until the music/light part stopped working.  I'm really annoyed that I need to buy a new one now.  I will definitely try a different brand.	
1. 	These bibs came highly recommended to me and I completely agree! They fold up so small for the diaper bag, they are super easy to wipe off and they do a great job of catching dropped food in the little pouch. Awesome product!	
1. 	I use the single pump exclusively to bottle feed my 10 month old son because of latching on problems.  This pump is fast and does not hurt once you get use to it.  I can pump MORE than 8 ounces in about 15 minutes, which allows me to only pump about 4 times in a 24 hour period.  This works great now that my son sleeps through the night, so I do not even have to get up to pump.This pump does take two hands if your breasts are heavy with milk because the plastic shield will need to be held firmly in place to allow the best suction.  The unit is much quieter if you use the cover or place a pillow over the top. I've never used any other pump, and the pricier ones may work better, but for the money I will recommend this pump first!	
1. 	I have owned several bottle brushes over the course of the last 4 years.  From the cheap 99 cent ones, to the relatively expensive Oxo Tot.  This has been the best of the bunch.The design is excellent for narrow neck bottle users.  Other bottle brushes have bristles all the way around the handle (360 degrees).  That seems very intuitive at first.  You probably think, like I did: more bristles means easier to use and gets the bottle cleaner.Unfortunately, the 360 design it presents several practical issues *if* you use narrow neck bottles, like me.  The bristles spray water everywhere each time you pull the brush out of the bottle - annoying.  Also, the friction of constantly stuffing the brush in and out of the narrow neck causes the bristles on the 360 degree brushes to become matted, because they are so wide with the bristles going all the way around.  This Avent brush is narrower by design, which prevents the spraying water and preserves the integrity of the bristles.I would say about 95% of the bristles are still in excellent, like new, shape after 6 months of daily use.  The other 5% are a little flattened (but not matted), but it doesn't affect its ability to get the bottles clean.Sure, you have to twist the brush around to get the entire inside of the bottle clean, but it's quick and easy to do.The nipple cleaner part is eh.  It's hard plastic, so I don't see how it can really clean the nipple.  I must prefer theBaby Simba Lion Bottle Nipple Brushes. BPA Free Holder w/ Sterling Silver base. Set of 2	
1. 	I'm glad I bought these and it would be really helpful if the hubs would actually read the labels so I wouldn't have to reorganize every week...	
- 1	I can't believe this high chair gets ANY 5 star reviews! I have been using mine for about 9 months, and I'm replacing it asap.In short, this chair has a combination of features that make it impossible to keep clean. My whole downstairs smells like an old movie theater someone threw up in, even though I took to this thing with bleach and cotton swabs a few days ago. The only way I can mention everything is with a list:1) First and foremost, the SEAT PAD. What were they thinking? The vinyl seat cover is made up of four pieces connected in certain places. What this means is that, once it is in the chair, their are little canyons and gullies where food and liquids not only build up, but SEEP down underneath the pad.Also, because I have to remove the pad so often to clean underneath it, it has torn. Now, there is food up inside the pad that I can't reach, and the pad reeks.2) The TRAY sits far away from my baby's body and is also really high. There is no adjustment. What this means is that a lot of food ends up in my baby's lap...and, of course, overflowing into the canyons and gullies at the back of the seat pad.3) The HARNESS might as well not be there unless your baby is a GIANT (like the size of a two year old). My child is very tall for her age, but at 15 months, these straps are still loose enough that she can wiggle out of them. Also the bottom part doesn't come up high enough. Even at it's longest setting, it rests at her hips, so she has been able to spread the shoulder straps and stand up in the chair. Even if I could lengthen it more, that would make the harness entirely too loose, because the shoulder straps don't tighten enough.4) The WAIST STRAP is SCREWED into the exact lowest point of the seat. This means any substance that seeps under the seat pad makes a little lake on the strap, and it is hard to remove it for cleaning. Since this chair gets used 3-6 times a day, there isn't enough time for it to dry. Our strap grew mold on it and still stinks, even after bleaching.5) The CROTCH STRAP is surrounded by a totally open gap (again not so with some other chairs, on which the seam closest to the child's crotch overlaps the strap a little). This means that anything dropped/crammed into that area gets under the seat pad, runs down the length of the chair, and eventually joins the lake at the back of the chair. Peas and raisins and things like that just get gummed up around the seams and are difficult to get off.6) All the other NOOKS, OPEN SEAMS, and CRANNIES in this seat that collect food, liquid and other debris: The screws are exposed (not so with the three chairs I'm considering for replacement); the tiny cracks in the plastic between all the pieces; the deep holes in the sides where the tray fits onto the chair, etc. and so forth. There are many unnecessary divisions in this chair.7) If you are looking for something that folds up compactly, this chair does but not. This wasn't a big issue for us, since we don't fold it up anyway, but this is listed a feature. Not so.There are two things this chair has that I've seen lacking in many other chairs:1) Stability. It's a tank. This means it's heavy, but I don't really mind that very much.2) The tray is only possible to remove if you have adult hands. Your baby will NOT be able to pry it off or get food underneath the tray. Contrary to other reviews on here, it IS actually possible to remove with one hand, as long as that hand has long enough fingers....and mine does.Okay, you have been fairly warned. Don't buy this chair....don't take it into your home, even at a discount. There are much better high chairs at less than half the retail price.Good luck on your search.	
1. 	I installed this latch a couple months ago on my refrigerator and it has held up great. We often forget it's there, so it has been tugged on many times, and still holds strong. The setup makes it easy to use with your thumb and one hand when opening the door. The included spacers allow you to use it on a variety of doors with different spacing. The door closes easily without any extra effort, so it does not interfere with daily use.	
1. 	We got one of these for my older daughters and I love the whole thing. The infant body support converts into a very good head support for older children, it's low to the seat so I can get them in and out easier with  other car seats and I can fit 2 Radians and a Graco Snugride 32 in the back of our little 2 door Sunfire.	
1. 	I LOVE THIS!Why? Because my prego wife loves it.I first got her the famous boppy, but it wasnt that great. It was too thin and when she wanted to move to her other side it required her to pull up the pillow and reset it. So we bought this one. I was worried it would be too short (the ad has what looks like a short lady) but that was not the case.It was MUCH thicker and it made my wife much more comfortable, especially when she needed to flip over.The only drawback was it didnt come with a soft slip cover. I guess you have to buy that separately. We decided to skip it for now.You cant go wrong with this.Frank	
- 1	Why is this green toy made in China? I wish I had the heart to buy from this company but I will have to go to other USA or European made products that choose to avoid the lacking standards in Asia.  Too bad....iplay has some cute products. But I can find better ones from other places.	
- 1	SO MUCH FABRIC! Even once I got the hang of it, I HATED how it felt on, it is SO HOT! My baby would get hot and fussy in it too. AND it just doesn't feel that secure. I like the Ergo 100 times better then this.	
1. 	It was taking so long with the slo-flo nipple she was using that now it only takes her about 10 minutes to finish her bottle and she does not get choked from too fast of a flow.	
- 1	This changing table has held up well so far (13 months) for the sole purpose of laying the baby on the table and changing her diaper.  However, the shelves (made of cheap particle board) slipped out the grooves and bowed downward within 6 months of use.  We took the table apart, flipped the shelves over, and put it back together, but within about a month the shelves slipped out again.  I keep as little as possible on the shelves to be able to change the baby's diapers, but have no idea how long these shelves will last before being completely unusable. I am very disappointed, but am not even sure what I would do if I had to purchase a changing table all over again because there are so few options on the market.	
- 1	I bought this replacement tubing since my tubing was full of condensation and I worried about mold developing. After using the replacement tubing for a few days, I noticed condensation building up in the new tubing. Had I known this build up was inevitable, I would've saved myself the money and just hung my original tubing in a way so that it could dry out. (Over the top of the fridge worked well for me!)	
- 1	These nipples certainly weren't &#34;fast&#34; for anything but water. Formula barely comes through. Slower than the slow-flow! The other Playtex nipples I've bought aren't BPA free and they work MUCH better.	
- 1	I was hoping it would get more attention from my son... unfortunately he is just not fascinated but it. Not worth the price, IMHO	
- 1	This cup isn't the best, but I've had worse. I like how similarly shaped to bottles it is, making holding it that much easier. I also like how it doesn't flow quickly like others, since I dont want my daughter to drink too much juice. But I hate how hard this thing is to clean. And it does leak, not out of the spout but out of the side where the cap closes. This was taken out of rotation after 1 day.	
- 1	This bag is made of very thin plastic which looks very poor quality. It is quite small too. I am planning to return it as soon as possible.	
1. 	We have absolutely no complaints about this tub. We have been using it for 5 months. Our baby has always been in about the 50th percentile. We wash the sling in the washing machine and line dry it after every use. It has held up so far, and have no reason to suspect that will change. Since we haven't used it as a toddler tub yet, I can't speak to that. We've used the infant side with and without the sling and loved it every time.	
1. 	We bought two of these for our twins, mainly due to reviews I read and its safety rating on Consumer Reports, and have no complaints so far.  We started with them rear facing and found the installation pretty simple.  The forward facing position was even easier.  It did take me a little while initially but once you do it, it's really easy to do it again if you need to move the seats.My only complaint is that it's a little difficult to remove and then replace the seat covers if (or when!) they get really messy.  And the first time they spilled milk on their seats, I took them out and was annoyed to see that they said handwash only.  I took the chance and sent them through washing machine on the handwash cycle and they were fine.  I've done it twice since and also lightly dried them in the dryer.It's very easy to adjust the straps and getting the girls in and out of the car is very easy.  Overall, I would definitely recommend these seats.  (And although we have not tried this yet, I've also read that all britax seats will fit on an airplane.)	
- 1	Very cute but not durable/made for the long haul. The seam that fixes the strap to the bag came undone on the third use. I'm now worried it's only a matter of time before the rest of it falls apart...	
- 1	My 9 month old was only deterred for a week from opening drawers. Some adhesives stopped sticking while the clip function stopped working from holding the clear plastic piece in place. I have a small baby and he is now strong enough to pull these straps apart.	
1. 	I really liked this because you have a variety of baby washes to choose from. I personally like the lavender, since my daughter takes her baths in the evening. The washclothes could be bigger, so i just stick to a mitt or sponge. The CD is fun to play and sing along to,just make sure you dont play the same ones everytime, itll stick in your head!	
- 1	I returned this toy shortly after getting it.  There was no way to get enough air in so that the cow would be stable, therefore  when my kid tried to climb it, he kept falling.Too bad, really wanted it to work.	
1. 	My baby daugther have very sensitive skin. Her excema started when she was 2.5 months old, I used aquafor (as advise by the pediatrician), aveeno and dexeryl (bought in France) but nothing worked. Stelatopia was a miracle. However, you have to use it twice a day and I use the cream cleanser in addition. Good product. Other thing if i stop using for more than 2 days the rash comes back.	
1. 	My baby girl was 3 weeks early and came home at 5 lbs. It was March and FREEZING outside. All of the clothes I had ready for her were too big, including a lot of the newborn stuff :-( She was so swallowed up by stuff that I had to purchase some smaller items as I was worried all the extra fabric was going to choke/suffocate her. This swaddle was wonderful! Warm and cozy, it made her the most perfect little burrito. You can do arms in or out!!  The fleece was soft and the zipper and velcro were very good quality. The length is extra long, as with all Halo products, to give extra room for stretching out little legs. And it fit her perfectly. No more worries about a lot of extra fabric getting in her face. She outgrew them quickly Thank God but they were a lifesaver.	
1. 	They are more than just wipes for us.  We use them as washcloths and handkerchiefs too.  They are super soft and have held up really well through almost 100 washes so far.	
1. 	My son is a really messy eater and his bibs used to be completely covered with food after every meal. It was such a hassle to have to rinse the bibs and then wash them in the laundry. With this bib I just wash it along with his tray. It takes 1 minute and it's ready for the next meal. He was a little annoyed with it at first, but he was fine after the second day. The bib does stick out a little at the bottom so you have to move the child's tray out but he is still able to reach everything on his tray/plate. I highly recommend this bib!	
1. 	This is great for the price. I took off a star for 2 reasons:1) This won't work on thicker tables2) It's a bit of a pain to assemble and disassemble (this is annoying because we use it at restaurants when we go out and have to put it together and take it apart often, but it may not be an issue if you're using it at home)To elaborate on point 2, there is a 'back bar' that links to the two 'arm' pieces. The three pieces can be cumbersome to work with and sometimes the back bar slips out of it's seat 'pocket' and creates more work.There are others that are 3 or 4 times the price that are great and you wouldn't have the above problems, so it's up to you to decide if that price premium is worth it or not. However, for us, the low price on this made us overlook its flaws.	
- 1	Strange, I read all the reviews yesterday night and wanted to write this review but was too tired, so I do it now. And there were like 20 negative feedback (1-2 stars), today I see 2 negative feedback !!!Are they removing them?? It seems like that.I bought this item for may baby due in 3 weeks.We couldn't put it together, screws don't match with holes etc... I'm so sad about that.I sent an email about replacement parts, got an answer today:  Sorry, we don't have replacement parts for this item until July.Just great.But all in all this item is so cheaply made and terrible, I don't recommend buying this. Color was coming off even without touching the dressing table.. First time in my life I see something so badly made..Anyway, yesterday I saw many negative reviews, today I see only 2.. That's too bad.. you can't trust amazon anymore??OMG, i just checked 1-star reviews.. 1 is from 2009, another 1 from 2010. I am the only one person in two years with 1 star.. yeah, right..	
1. 	While they are convenient and easy for my 11 month old to use, I find it annoying that they don't come with lids to keep snacks from going stale! They're an odd material that keeps dust and hair stuck to the inside with the snacks and that can be discouraging. Other than that, my son loves using them and they're safe in the dishwasher!	
- 1	The Baby Kicks Joey Bunz Premium inserts are much better than the Thirsties hemp inserts: the Joey Bunz dry in half the time, they're contoured, they're softer, and they're organic. I had to either put the Thirsties through the drier twice or hand them to dry after an hour in the drier. I don't recommend the Thirsties.	
- 1	i do not like this bib. i actually just bought new ones to replace it. it is too short so food gets all over the bottom half of my baby's shirt. and the pocket flops closed so most everything ends up on baby's lap and in the high chair. waste of money. the only upside is that it fits good around the neck so food and drink doesn't get on the collar of baby's shirt.	
- 1	These did not stay clung to my windows no matter what I did. I tried both my husband's and my vehicles. They are completely worthless.	
- 1	I bought 2 of these gates one for the bottom of our stairs and the other between rooms.  We already had a Summer Infant gate and a travel fold up gate, but needed more for to keep kiddo #2 safe, so I KNOW how to install baby gates.  This baby gate is WIMPY/WEAK and could not stand up to my 10 month old who is only crawling/trying to stand up!  There is also at least ONE huge design flaw, if the gate is tension tightened enough to mostly hold to the wall, the gate will NOT unlatch.  If you loosen the tension, the gate door will open, but the whole thing can be easily knocked over by a very small child!  Also, it did NOT fit in a 39.5/40.5inch opening correctly whichever way I tried to rig it. We sent these back pronto and went back to Summer Infant gates which are SUPER strong, reliable and easy to install!	
1. 	Love that I decided not to spend $80-100 on a highchair. It would have just been in the way anyway. This chair is perfect for my little one and she will get years more use out of it!It is true, like others have said that the white tray is very easy for your toddler to learn how to remove. Now my baby tries to remove it and dump her food all the time. I wish it clicked in better or had a latch of some sort. Also wish all parts were dishwasher safe.	
1. 	I wouldn't quite describe this as a must have but ours does get its fair share of use.  As others have said its a plug-in or battery operated sound maker.  It plays womb sounds, rain, thunder etc.  We often turn it on at bedtime to drown out other household noises.  Plus, we notice our daughter seems to sleep better with music/white noise in the background.  My only criticism might be the volume.  Sometimes even when we have it up as loud as it will go certain sounds are barely audible unless you are right up on the machine.  If your infant is a fussy sleeper this product is worth a try.	
1. 	we use it every night, actually my son does. He is able to brush his own teeth and does a really good job with this brush. He was biting and eating the bristles on conventional brushes but he can't do that with the silicone. I also feel like this is easier to clean which I love.	
1. 	This is a great shopping cart cover.  I love how easy it is to use.  I can hold the baby and arrange this quickly with one hand.  My baby is very happy in it and it gives me peace of mind that she's not touching a germy cart.  Its very well padded and folds up so quickly when done with shopping.	
- 1	These are fine for meal time, but I would never put them in a diaper bag.  They will leak if turned upside down and the lids come off pretty easily.  If you don't push down all the way around the lid your child will get a chin and chest full of beverage, which really doesn't amuse them :)  We use these as back-up cups only.	
- 1	This pump was okay but not great. It is quiet and it works well. But the flang didn't fit properly and they don't give a size choice. I didn't bother with trying to find another size for Spectra since it was too painful even for the wrong size. However it did get out more milk than my Medela hand pump did at first. It's a good pump, just not for me.	
1. 	This is the first bottle we tried with our then-3-week-old baby. She had been exclusively breastfed up until that point, but I had started pumping in preparation for going back to work, so we wanted to try her on a bottle. She immediately went for it with no problems! Now, she never had any latching problems anyway, but I was concerned she'd be confused by the bottle. She's still not had many bottles, but had no problem switching back to breast after. We also have AVENT bottles that we have yet to try, but I think the VentAire will be what we send with her sitter and leave with dad when I'm not around to feed her.She was more gassy than normal after her feeding, but from what I hear a bottle will always make them more gassy than the boob - so I guess this bottle is better than others (can't compare there). The only real bad thing I can say is that there are a lot of little parts with the screw-on bottom and vent piece (they do give you one extra vent in the pack in case you lose one). That's a necessary evil of the vent setup though, I guess. I do like that they open up at both ends - makes cleaning pretty easy.	
- 1	I tried a bunch of locks.  Magnetic are the way to go,  no pinched fingers and it is not obvious to children how to open it.	
1. 	These are great you can just throw them in the wash,  however if you leak heavily you might want to add a disposable behind them when you are out and about and can't change the pad because they are not leak proof always.	
1. 	We purchased this toy for our daughter when she was six months old and 7 months later it still continues to be a favorite of hers.I initially liked the idea of the walker that is on the track because many babies are hurt in the walkers that the baby can freely roam around in.  I never imagined she would love it as much as she did (and does)though!When we first put her in it, it served as more of an exersaucer.  She would sit quietly in it, look in the mirror, beat on the piano keys, and grab the little rattle.  Then, one day, she realized she could actually move around a little bit and so back and forth she went on the track, stomping on the keys with delight.  It warmed my heart to see my little girl enjoying something so much.  Now that she is thirteen months old, the seat has been removed and she loves to stomp on the piano keys and compose her own music.I think this one of the most versatile toys and it has lasted so long in our house that it is well worth the money.  I'd recommend it any day.	
1. 	I love these snack cups. My daughter as alway had problems eating, and her feeding therapist and GI doctor told me to buy these cups. I love them. They help slow the toddler that try to eat to fast down.	
1. 	I just purchased my second Bundle Me and am not disappointed. I did end up purchasing it at a local store that had it on clearance, but aside from that it is the Urban BundleMe in Stealth. The first one we purchased was for my last child and I loved it. The only issue I had with the original was that it collected a lot of lint, but aside from that it worked great on our Graco infant carseat. The BundleMe is easy to get on and off for cleaning. I love that the top part comes unzipped from the rest for when you don't need the extra coverage or for when it is the only part that needs cleaned. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a must have, but it is definitely a plus rather than using blankets that are constantly falling off! I love love love this!	
- 1	I registered for a bunch of these - different sizes and materials. I knew I'd try swaddling my daughter, and this seemed an easy way to do it.When I first used this, my daughter easily got her hands out and could wriggle them around (down under the bottom of the swaddle part) and would wake herself.The biggest problem I had with it, though, is it made holding my daughter for breastfeeding really difficult. I would unwrap her so she could have her arms free, but the sack part was hard to hold. I switched to theSwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Triplets Paisley, Kiwi, and now to theThe Miracle Blanket Swaddler formerly known as the Amazing Miracle Blanket - Green w/ Blue Trim. I have to fully unwrap her for both, but it wakes her less than taking the entire sleep sack off (which is more like taking off her pj's).Many reviewers say this is great for the transition from swaddling. My daughter is 13 weeks, and we'll try to move her from swaddling soon. I will try this again - she doesn't wake up much when I feed her at night, so partially removing the sack, without the swaddle part, may not be as much a problem.This is not a terrible product by any means. It's just that in my experience it made holding my baby for breastfeeding very difficult.	
- 1	Maybe it just wasn't for me. Maybe you just get what you pay for. I was able to express 2 ounces and it made me crack and bleed. I had much more success with the Lansinoh manual pump, and using a non-electric one wasn't as hard as I thought!	
- 1	Well, this fan worked well the first time I used it. However it continued to shut off after that. I wanted to use it in the backseat to keep my child cool but the darn thing continued to cut off (even with new batteries).	
- 1	The snuzzler does a pretty decent job providing head support and supporting baby from the sides, but there are some flaws in it:- while the head support and the side (shoulder, arm support/enclosure parts) are thick and soft, the back on the snuzzler is really thin and provides no cushioning whatsoever. I expected it to be soft all around. I ended up putting extra blanket in the stoller, THEN the snuzzler to make up for this.- the head and the body support are held together by velcro and that point of attachment is hard as a rock - this happens to be right under baby's neck! Feels very uncomfortable.- If you are choosing to use body support only and detach the head support - you just exposed super sharp velco to the back of your baby's head!	
- 1	We bought this without doing any research....we really wanted a 2nd one of the Evenflo Expressions that we love,but the store ran out, so this was the next affordable choice. Unfortunately many  drawbacks that I just haven't thrown it out because we need it and can't afford another...The tray is too easy  to take off, the permanent mini tray doesn't come off and makes it hard to put the child in and take out, and the cleaning insert is laying in a corner in my pantry because we never were able to use it because it too comes off too easily...these are supposed to be aimed at fussy, stubborn infants and toddlers, right?	
- 1	Not worth the money for us... My son is 10 months and waking around he cried as soon as I put him in it! Maybe if you started young? Very cute. Takes up a lot of space.	
1. 	Easy to install.  Very good for keeping little hands and fingers out of sockets while easy for adults to plug/unplug things.  Our daughter is only 14 months, so I don't know if an older child could figure out the sliding technique, but I imagine it would be difficult.  Generally a good product for the price.	
- 1	I bought this for my laundry room that happens to have a bi-fold door. I followed the directions and it turns out this is too large and still allows for the door to open just enough to where little fingers can get pinched. I had hoped that this would keep the door from opening even the slightest bit. I would not recommend this product at all.	
1. 	They are spoons, really what can I say about them.  They go fine through the dishwasher.  I like them.  Pretty colors, soft tips.  Two thumbs up.	
- 1	These bags are very, very thin.  They can't block the diaper smell, so instead the company tried to cover up the diaper smell with a scent that is so strong I can't stand to leave the box open.  The diaper smell eventually overpowers the scent because the bags are sooooo thin.In addition, the way the bags are placed in the box they don't pop up as you pull one out, so I'm always struggling to get another bag out as I'm handling a dirty diaper.For this product to really work well, the bags need to be much thicker so that the diaper smell is blocked NOT masked.The one nice thing about this product is the handle ties.  They are easy to use.	
- 1	This chair looks nice, but it's bulky and such a pain to remove the cover and clean. After a month or so of use, I could not stand the pain of removing the cover to wash and placing it back and decided just to get a easy to clean booster, which I should have done in first place and saved about 80 bucks by not buying this chair.	
- 1	Bought these for the inside of our diaper pail. What a waste of money; they don't help at all. No fresh scent, no masking stinky scents; absolutely no difference at all. Very disappointing. Don't waste your $ on these.	
1. 	We bought this when our baby was just an infant since his room shares a wall with our tv room. It is extremely easy and intuitive to use. We mainly use it on the ocean setting which is plenty loud. I do not need to turn it up all the way to watch tv in the next room. It will also drown out the shower, the toilet (also next to his room), loading the dishwasher, and moderate talking. It will not drown out our dyson, the doorbell, or the dog barking. However, some of the other options are quieter (I.e. the heart beat and rain are much quieter). The ocean sound is very realistic and has much better sound quality than the competitors version at my mom's house. I like that I can leave it on all night or have it automatically turn off after an hour. We usually use it plugged in but have found the battery option invaluable for traveling. In fact, my husband and I like it so much for traveling we take it even without the baby! It drowns out all those weird noises in hotel rooms. Downsides for us, it doesn't really have as many options as they make it sound like- there are only like six main sounds and then extra sounds that go over the top of those sounds. But do you really want a random bell tolling or bird squawking to wake up baby?! Finally, we have used this three times a day (2 naps and bedtime) for two plus years without a single problem! We are buying a second one for the next kid!	
- 1	Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this highchair!  The cover does not come off, and I'm left hand scrubbing this chair EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. !!!  If I could throw it in the washer, it'd be a lot better. Also, the seat is in a permanent semi reclined position. For him to sit up with his little body against the tray, he's really far from the back of the chair, which is okay...I guess. I had a Graco contempo with my daughter who is 3 years older than my son (who we bought this chair for) and I really liked it because the cover was removable, it came w 2 covers (!!!), AND the tray could be closer for smaller children or farther for when children get older. Go with a highchair with a removable cover or easily wipeable (wood, plastic, ect) cover.	
1. 	I am pleasantly surprised with this book and its better than I expected. Each page has something interactive for the child to do and the colors are really vibrant. The bunny is tethered so no lost pieces! The only downside is that it's a bit pricey for what it is, so hopefully its really great quality and holds up.	
1. 	My son loves this. He stares at the fish for as long as we leave him in it. It has a lot of different sound options as well as lights, moving mobile, etc. so you can mix it up and baby doesn't get bored. Also he seems comfy because he is always sleeping in it.The only thing that worries me is that if you have it on some of the higher speeds, and even the lower ones now that he is bigger the swing has a lot of movement at the legs. It sometimes looks like its going to tip. So I keep a very close watch when he is in it.	
- 1	I'm giving this sippy cup because I like the pink and purple color combo, but that's it.  My daughter left this sippy on the floor and it fell over.  I was out of the room for ten seconds and came back to a puddle!  It leaks through the silicone nub.  I know that droplets of wate will come out of the vent hole, but this one pours.	
- 1	Plastic odor was so strong that can't possibly be non-toxic to little ones, I returned it immediately upon opening the package.	
1. 	This tub works real good for our baby girl. After 2 months, the new was off though. Works well! Excellent	
1. 	These covers are very comfy and the fit is pretty decent (in my opinion). However, I don't really use them much. I found out pretty early on that it's easier to just change my son on the uncovered changing pad because he is constantly spitting up, urinating and pooping on the pad.  I was having to wash the covers every day! Now I just bring them out when we have visitors (like the fine linens, ha ha!)	
- 1	I almost wrote a glowing review when i first got it. it sat on the faucet fine, it protected their heads, i could use the thingamajig that makes the shower go on and off easily, and the kids loved how it spread out the water and that i could fill it will bubble bath. that was the honeymoon period...the bubble bath dispenser stopped working pretty quickly even though i tried washing it (i figured it was sticky with soap) and helping it along with my fingers while it ran, but it became more of a hassle than to just pour the bubble bath or shampoo directly in the running water.then the mildew... oh the mildew. i didn't initially take it off after every bath but noticed it was started to get a little black on the inside. so i bleached the heck out of it and then took it off and hung it to dry after every bath. it was still FULL of mildew. it was stained to the point that even though i knew it was disinfected i just couldn't use it anymore because the whole bottom was tie dyed with black mildew stains.overall since i had to buy another faucet cover anyway it was a dumb purchase.	
- 1	I got this second hand from a friend. Her baby loved it but grew out of it very fast. My daughter was 5 weeks and 11 lbs when we first used it. There's absolutely no noticeable difference in speeds, also it swings VERY wide. My baby girl loves a wide swing, especially when she's fussy in her car seat - it relaxes her instantly, but a SLOW one.I had her in just long enough to do some quick makeup and pack her diaper bag. I nursed and burped her 30-45 minutes prior to putting her in the swing. She was swinging for 10-15 minutes when I heard her fussing because she woke up. I went to soothe her and see if she needed to nurse again and she started spitting up TONS of milk. It was literally gushing out of her mouth.Now, my diet is consistent, she exclusively breastfeeds, she's never had a bottle, she's never had bad gas, and she's only spit up a total of 3 times all of which were trace, dime sized amounts. There's no reason she would spit up that much. Thank god I was in the room and looking at her when this happened because she could have choked on it there was that much.I will NEVER use the power swing on this again. Which is a shame because I was looking forward to her enjoying this. If you want something for your baby to nap in try the fisher price newborn napper. It's takes up less space, folds away, is portable, and rocks very gently either from your or your baby's movement.	
1. 	I have to clean mine about once a week with using it for both of my boys. I really love this chair and we take it with us everywhere. It doesn't fit tables that have a leaf stored underneath it, which has been inconvenient.	
- 1	Let's start with the good part:1) The bottle seem to help reduce gas intake as my baby's spit up is not as big (still spit up, but not as much)The bad:1) too many part to wash2) After 3 weeks of usage, the bottles leaks, which render them useless	
- 1	I still leak with these.  They aren't as absorbent as ones I bought on Etsy.  Basically I only use them when I'm desperate.	
- 1	I never used this product and ended up just throwing it away. I don't think that there is enough ventilation in this to make it truly safe. I know that I could just be a crazy parent but I'm not comfortable putting this on my child's carseat when it seems like a large plastic bag with a few small holes for air to get in. Not happy with this product.	
1. 	We picked this because it was lightweight and it is easy to change the sheets.  We really like it and it fits tightly in the crib.	
1. 	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!	
1. 	They stay together well, barely spill (unless my toddler throws it really hard) and the straw stays in well! Very happy!	
1. 	Replacement for my Medela pump. After so much use these little things crack and break. Perfect that I can just buy these little membranes and not the entire end.	
1. 	when I got this item this morning , it did not have a outside box, and i opened it the reciept is missing as well, this delivery is worse than last time.Have not assembled yet but the rocker looks nice	
1. 	Love this sleepsack for my daughter. She always kicks her blankets off and this is perfect to keep her covered. I put her in a long sleeve onesie with the Halo sack. I will order a fleece one for the winter!	
1. 	bought it for my baby daughter, very cute.  Though not sure how long the strap will last, it consists of round &#34;beads&#34; (all molded together so one piece) that you press into place in a plastic fastener, wonder if this will wear out over time so it will no longer clasp into place.  I have seen others where the pouched is much deeper, I prefer this shallower one because it would be much easier to clean and is angled outwards to catch more things.  It is not so shallow that things would spill out (unless you spilled a bowl of soup into it...but who does that?)	
1. 	I love these sleeping sacks and there really the best !!I have tried others but nothing is even close in quality	
1. 	This bib has changed mealtime for the better!I tried all sorts of fancy bibs because I thought this bib would be uncomfortable for my tiny baby.  Boy was I wrong!  After the initial fuss she now loves this bib.  She is comfortable and clean!  The bib catches every drop of food, water and her super staining vitamin drops!FYI Even this fantastic bib can't shield you from unexpected baby sneezes during feedings!I stained and ruined so many cloth bibs before I finally took this out of the box and now I only use this one!  Plus one in my car for on the go feedings!More colors please Baby Bjorn!	
- 1	I bought this pump because, as a stay-at-home mom, I expected to pump very little (just to relieve engorgement, etc).  Unfortunately, my daughter had difficulty transferring the milk from my breast, and in order for her to get enough milk, I had to pump and bottle-feed her eight times a day.  Since I already owned this pump (and didn't want to spend a ton on an electric pump), I tried to make this one work.  It lasted less than three days before the gasket that helps create the suction gave out.  I'm sure Medela would have replaced it (later experience with the company left me extremely impressed with their customer service), however I had come to the conclusion that manual pumping eight times a day was not going to work for me.  The muscles in my hand and forearm were exhausted from the work, and I found the suction created by this device (before the gasket gave out) hurt my nipples too much.  I was able to return the pump and bought a Medela Swing to replace it.  The Swing worked much better for me.  If you have to pump often, it is much more convenient to have the pump do the work itself, it is quicker than manually pumping (at least in my experience) and the adjustable suction on the Swing made it much more comfortable to use.  Overall, if you expect to need to pump more than once or twice a day, you may want to consider the investment in an electric pump.	
- 1	We ordered this for our little one after using a fleece swaddle blanket by summer infants. Our little one loves to be tightly swaddled. I ordered this size because our baby is 9 pounds. After trying it on, I was surprised by how constricting it really is.There was absolutely no room for our baby to wiggle a bit. I expected it to be tight but not THAT tight. My husband made the remark that it was way too tight and resembled an infant straight jacket. Reluctantly, I said well lets try it and see. The minute I put baby in the cradle she started screaming & fussing. It was just TOO constricting. We agreed to send it back and order a new summer infant swaddler.	
- 1	This is a cute idea, but the execution and overall usefulness leave much to be desired.  My daughter purchased this when her son was transitioning from his infant bathtub to an inflatible tub that would fit in the regular bathtub.  She thought this shower spray would help with the bathing process and that it was cute.  Although difficult to attach to the faucet, the Sassy did fit onto the 20 year old fixture and did not leak.  The spray was not forceful which was a positive as her son got used to being bathed in the big tub.Unfortunately, that tub in which the Sassy was being used was the one in the guest bathroom.  Thus, whenever she has guests the Sassy Shower Spray must be removed from the faucet or the pressure from the main shower head would blow it off the faucet and cause damage to the Sassy.  Additionally, there is the question of durability since the Sassy must be removed and put back onto the faucet repeatedly.  It is plastic and does not feel particularly sturdy.I would suggest purchasing one of the hand-held shower heads on Amazon rather than the Sassy Shower Spray.  Those products are of higher quality construction, do not require removal for someone other than the baby or child's usage, and provide greater value for the consumer.  However, if your infant or small child is the only person using a particular bathtub or if you need something to fill an Amazon order so that you get free shipping, this might be something you consider.  Otherwise, there are much better products on the market.	
- 1	I wish I would have paid more attention to the negative reviews about this product before I bought the postpardum girdle with side zipper.  At first, it was great and I loved how my clothes fit.  However, after less than the week, the boning in the girdle had developed permanent dents that dug into my skin.  It left marks and became increasingly uncomfortable to wear.  It isn't made for anyone who sits for any period of time, and as a new mother, I have to sit in order to feed my daughter.  Too much money spent for only a weeks use.  I did notify the company because it is not a good product for new mothers to wear.  Maybe the pull up support is better but there is no way I am spending more money on a new girdle to find out.  I do NOT recommend this product.  I will probably go out and buy a good pair of spanx.  Much cheaper (and more comfortable).	
- 1	I bought these for a trip but returned. These hold too little for my hungry 8 month baby. They might be good for babies who aren't really &#34;eating&#34; yet.	
1. 	This monitor Iis so simple and the features have been extremely useful. First, this monitor comes with 2 receivers - a must for a two-story home. We can hear EVERYTHING including noise from outdoors. The red lights that blink in accordance to volume are great for those who can't see without glasses, esp when waking up in the middle of the night, and they are also great if say you have the tv on a bit too loud. The nightlight on the monitor with the 15-minute timer is a great feature b/c it doesn't generate heat as does a conventional outlet nightlight bulb. Our baby also happens to be disturbed by her outlet nightlight when she wakes up at night and thus won't fall back to sleep easily. Therefore, we've used the monitor light. We've had no problems nor complaints with this product.	
- 1	The only good things I can say about this crib is, it's pretty and it's strudy.  Other then that I'm unhappy with it.  When they say espresso on the website what they need to add is cherry.  It's not on the crib box but it's on the bed rail box.  Espresso CHERRY, I wish I would have looked at the bed rail box first before we put the crib up.  The whole time we put it up I was thinking I must be crazy cause it looks cherry.  I have to return the espresso changing table I bought, it doesn't match the crib and its easier to ship.  The only changing piece they have to match the crib is a dresser and it's too big for our nursery.  So now I have to look around for a changing table that matches since Delta doesn't have one. I realize I should have stopped putting it together.  However we already had all the packing material torn off and bent up in a garage bag.  I will know better next time.  Again, I didn't read the bed rail box to confirm my thoughts until the crib was up.There are also minor dents in the crib.  Hardly noticable but since I cared enough to write a review they need to be mentioned.  Being that the crib is brand new it is discourging to have dents in it already.  So the two stars are for the fact that it is a pretty and strudy crib. The lack of the three stars is for the espresso CHERRY finish, the dents, and the fact that they managed to upset a pregnant woman whom just doesn't get upset.UPDATE... Carters Manchester changing table in dark cherry matches this crib.	
1. 	We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too.I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all.I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23 has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need.I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves.This cotton is so nice and light (I wonder if the other reviewer was reviewing a fleece, flannel or quilted one instead) that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together.I very much like that the zipper is upside down. It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin.	
- 1	It's too hard to roll and turn. Plus, I'm not sure if they are swivel wheels or not. But I do like how it's adjustable height (just the seat is not the entire walker), and how baby can stand behind and push it.	
1. 	I love this brush. The included tiny brush works great on my advent bottle nipples. I love how the nipple brush acts as a stand for my bottle brush so the bottle brush never has to touch my questionably clean counter!The 360 degree cleaning reaches the bottom of the bottles quickly. Tip: Super hot water melts the breast milk off the bottles with ease.	
- 1	All children are different, and for me this was a complete waste of money.  My son didn't play with them when he was 1, and we brought them out later.  He still didn't.  Several times more...he's still completely disinterested.  I think it might be because he had soft squishy squirters first and these hard toys didn't interest him.  They also turn upside down all the time, which is annoying.You never know what your child will like!	
1. 	Great color! I have a Bob stroller as our main walking stroller, but wanted a lighter weight stroller for my vehicle. This was the lightest stroller I found, 11lbs. I know there are A LOT cheaper umbrella strollers out there, but none that had the shoulder straps and was light weight at the same time. The only minor problem is having to remember to retract the canopy before compacting the stroller up, I tend to forget! It has not damaged it though by forgetting, but it may be bad if you do it too many times.	
- 1	I got these for my newborn and within less than 20 washings the velcro closures have completely worn out.  They basically won't stay on now.  She can't even wear newborn size for too long so I can't imagine how frustrated I would be if she was wearing them for much longer.  Since this is my first baby and I don't have a ton of experience, I don't have a lot to compare these too.  I don't know if velcro on diapers generally wears out after being washed or if it's this particular brand of diapers.  I am planning on only buying snap diapers from now on though.  Also, she is always covered in pee when she wears these.  So.... I guess that's another problem.  I have one FuzziBuns cloth diaper for newborns with snaps that I really like.  It is nice that you don't have to remove the insert on these before washing though.  Too bad they don't work!	
1. 	I wish I would've had one of these with my first baby!  We live in New England where it is COLD in the winter and this keeps the baby so toasty! I can put him in his seat with just regular clothes on and he is as warm as can be.  I've also had a ton of compliments on how stylish it is.  I love that it's not babyish!	
- 1	I can't believe I bought this in 2 colors!  The fabric gets extremely itchy after being washed and tumble dried!! Pills like crazy.	
1. 	Even before we had our baby I told my wife that I wanted this baby carrier as my first Father's Day gift. Now that baby is around, I love putting him in the carrier and taking him around, not just because I can free up both my hands, but mostly because we get to spend quality time very close together, and the movement when I walk seems to soothe him (unless he's hungry, of course!) I would recommend all dads (and moms) to consider getting their Baby Bjorn. Along with the swing, the bouncer and a few other pieces of gear, it will not only make your first few parenting weeks easier to deal with but it will reward you time and again with unforgettable moments with your baby!	
- 1	I bought this and another one at our local store.I have twin babies that have had this toy since three months old. When they were three months the thing was just too heavy and they couldnt grasp it because of the rings. So i put it away and forgot about it. Now they are six month old and i gave it to them today. Its made of such a hard material, or whatever it is, that when they miss their mouth and hit themselves in the forehead it hurts them! And me (i tried like another review :). The rings around the middle just gets in the way. I will be throwing these away. Its just not a great design for little babies who are still working on their fine motor skills. Way too solid and hard for them.	
- 1	This ink pad arrived in a plastic bag, and was also wrapped in cellophane, but even with these precautions, it was completely dried out - I couldn't even get a smudge of ink to show up on my finger. I tried adding a little bit of water to the pad to re-wet the ink, which didn't work. This was really a complete waste of money and I will be asking for my money back.	
- 1	Let me preface this by saying I don't usually write such harsh reviews and it's unfortunate that this product missed the mark.  But I also worry that the reviews may be misleading and perhaps even false- something I've heard about before but haven't encountered in many years.I am always looking for ways to organize my home since I like it neat.  So when I came across this product, I ordered immediately.  Especially when I saw all the great reviews.  BUT, I'm not so sure all those reviews are fully accurate and have reported this to Amazon.  Notice how most of the reviews are not verified purchasers, entered within the month of April within a span of a few days, and if you click on the see other reviews by that person many of them only review this or this and the other universal product.  That makes me wonder- not making an accusation, but seems odd doesn't it???Now, when the product arrived I was actually quite hopeful because it seemed like good quality.  Decent plastic (another reviewer said it was flimsy but I thought the opposite), VERY EASY to adjust to the three different sizes, came with an additional basket for storage that could be useful, and was about the right size to fit in a cupboard shelf (maybe a little big for the fridge or freezer though).Make sure you note that if you try to put assembled sippy cups in there, the lids will make it all get stuck.  The same with bottles- you'll have to store them in pieces if you want to use this product.  This might be a personal preference but I always take the extra few minutes to roughly assemble things so I can just grab and use.  If you use the basket to separate this might not be a big deal, but you'll have to use the same brand to avoid extra effort.BUT, even when I took them all apart, things just don't fall down smoothly at all.  I tried bottles, sippy cups, cans, baby food, etc. and NOTHING flowed smoothly.  I made sure to have all the same brand and it sort of worked here and there.  However, at least 75% of the time, when I got to pulling two things out, it would get stuck behind the big center column.  There's just too much space right there for it to really work.  This appears to be a design flaw- instead of being so vertical, it probably would have worked if it were more horizontal.With my first son, I hated all the equipment just being in the cupboard so now that I've had a second I want more efficiency since I have less time.  This is a GREAT idea.  It reminds me of the old soda dispenser/stackers that a large plastics company used to sell and my mom had.  Those worked well but were annoying to fill up (now they aren't needed since the soda companies are making those boxes with the flap to remove).  Too bad this didn't work as well.  I'm printing my return labels now.	
1. 	Delivered as promised. Not toss away cups. Easy to wash and reuse! Still using them and condition is still good. Dish washer safe	
1. 	I use these at night time since my little girl decides to sleep about a 6 hour stretch at night. I sleep with them on, and they don't move around. The only problem is that sometimes the milk gets between the silicone and the hard plastic which sometimes causes it to leak and I then wake up with a big mess. It has only happened a couple times though and I use them every day. I also wear them during the day when my nipples get worn out from feeding, helps the pain!	
1. 	and was afraid this wouldn't work with the model I had. After some online research I was fairly confident it would and am happy to say it does. It is very different from the original base, but I actually think it is better. Good value for the price.	
1. 	If this little piece gets lost, or don't think of the trauma of it coming out of our sterilization bag and going down the drain...your pump won't work without it.  And the membranes do wear out if you take them apart to truly clean your pump.  It is a great investment.	
1. 	We have two- one in each of our children's rooms. We use generic, scented trash bags and this can keeps the stink trapped. Great, economical solution to expensive diaper pails.	
- 1	We used nothing but Avent bottles with my first child (3 years ago) and we loved them.  We never had problems with leaking.  I researched bottles quite a bit when I became pregnant with my second child and although a lot of people complained about the leaking I decided to try the new BPA free bottles.  I bought a 2 pack of 4 oz bottles and regret doing so.  The bottles leak horribly like everyone says they do.  I have tried to play with how I screw on the lids, or how tight they are (or are not) but the formula just pours out the side of the bottle.  What a waste of money.  I am shocked that Avent would actually sell such a poor, quality product.  What are they thinking?	
1. 	This swaddle helps our daughter sleep like a baby.  (Oh, wait...)  She outgrew her newborn size knit swaddle by Halo, and we bought the next size up in fleece because it is now winter time and we thought she could use the extra warmth.  The only problem is that she likes it too much.  We've created a swaddle monster that can't sleep without being swaddled, but now she is getting too old to be swaddled (starting to roll over) so we're going through the painful process of breaking her of the swaddle.  However, the product itself is great.  I didn't give 5 stars because it quickly lost its fleecy softness after a few (~5) washes.  It is still soft, but is starting to pill and the cream color doesn't look particularly clean.  The velcro is super strong and the fabric is warm.  I love how it zips from the top down - makes middle of the night diaper changes MUCH easier!  This style is also useful because once we break our baby from the swaddle, we can still use it as a sleep sack!	
1. 	I just bought this bouncer, and I wished I had bought it weeks ago!  My baby doesn't like me to put her down, and when I do to try to get things done around the house, she cries, and it drives me nuts to just let her scream!  So I got this bouncer, and the first time I put her in it, I turned on the vibration and the back massage, and she fell asleep immediately!The things I love about it are:1) The vibration doesn't turn off--it stays on until you turn it off.2) The back massage is a really nice feature--it is very gentle, I put my hands on it to see what it felt like.  My baby loves having her back patted, so this soothes her instantly.3) It has a handle on the top, so if your baby falls asleep in it (which WILL happen!), then you can just pick it up and carry it to the nursery, your bedroom, etc.4) It has really nice high sides, so my newborn's head doesn't flop around--she can rest it up against the side and snooze away.5) The toys are removable from the velcro tabs and can be used to give your baby a massage.  My baby really likes the rattle toy, and I feel like I can really interact with her when I shake it.  And when the toys are hanging from the velcro tabs, she just loves batting at them!I only have a couple very minor gripes:1) I wish the toys hung down in front of her face.  There are only velcro loops for the toys on the sides, so the rattle just rests against the side of the bouncer and doesn't rattle unless I manually rattle it for her.2) The motor is sooooo quiet (which is great!), but it's easy to forget that you have it turned on, then you run down the batteries.My baby takes her afternoon nap in this every day.  As soon as she falls asleep, I can just carry it to the nursery where she takes a nice 2 hour nap uninterrupted!  Plus, the music is not annoying and loud, like on many of the other bouncers out there.  Definitely worth the money to buy this product!	
1. 	My son sits in this swing fine he doesn't stay in it as long as his bouncer but I think that has to do with the motion, he can't handle that much motion. But he doesnt flop forward and the low setting is just right for him. He really likes the music. I put him in this swing on day 2 that we had him home. Out of all the swings I like this one the most because it has little toys that attach to the sides and a mirror to look at you can even buy more links and linkadoo toys and change out the toys that it came with. It is soo interchangeable with other Fisher Price toys. I wouldn't trade this swing for anything and it folds up real compact and is easy to fold and store!	
1. 	this package has every thing i was looking fore and in a great price ...it's perfect for all new moms	
- 1	I really wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to buy this.I dropped $70 on this, when money was tight right before my first baby was born. But I thought, this will save my sanity, because all these people who reviewed it on here say that it will. Not so.At first, it was thrilling to use whatever bottle we wanted to use. The Kozii warms them all! We use Doctor Browns and Emfamil and those warmed up nicely. However, it became apparent that keeping this thing clean and full was a babysitting job. If it wasn't full to the right recommendations, it took longer for bottles to warm, which meant dealing with a screaming baby longer. Yikes. But that wasn't a deal breaker. We could babysit.The random thing is that after a few months, it started taking longer and longer to warm bottles, sorta like it was dying out? So to make things more efficient, we started holding bottles under the faucet while the water was on hot. Yes, that was quicker than using the Kozii! At first, on average, 2-4oz bottles took us maybe 4-5 minutes to warm up in the Kozii. We started the bottle warming, got the baby changed, came back and it was done. Then after maybe 5 months, when we came back, the bottle wasn't warm yet. So we started putting it in for longer. The last time I used the Kozii, about a week ago, I put a 6oz bottle in for 11 minutes according to its timer, and it was just the right temperature.My baby won't take a bottle if it's too cold. But I can't spend 11 minutes warming up a bottle. So if you plan on purchasing this, just know that if you keep it clean and at the right water level, it may last you around 5 months. To me, that just wasn't cutting it for a $70 product.Oh, and weirdly enough, if the bottle gets warm before the Kozii is done, you can take the bottle out, but there is no way to shut off the device. You have to let it run for the full amount left on the timer. I guess you could unplug it? Anyway, in conclusion, I am not completely dissatisfied with the product...just disappointed in the quality because it cost so much.	
- 1	these cotton doublers are not as absorbent as the hemp ones. they are lighter and colorful but not as useful for our needs	
- 1	I bought this as a joke and well most people seem surprised and amused when they see my baby with this. But for some reason he doesn't seem to like it much... he spits it out very quickly... and well we all know how annoying it is to be spitting out the dummy and it falling on the dirty ground. Maybe it's the weight of it... I don't know. Otherwise it's great for a good laugh.	
- 1	Cheaply made. I did not even use it. I could have made this on my own with some fabric and a needle and thread. It is not very well made either.	
1. 	I also have a jeep carrier, a petunia pickle bottom and an evenflo carrier and this one is by far the most comfortable for both me and baby.  The straps are longer so they fit bigger bodies (and men!) better than the other three.  THis also has a softer fabric than the others making it easier to mold to baby and be comfortable.  I use this carrier to walk my two large dogs and i can bend over and squat down without any worry of the baby moving, being uncomfortable or falling out.  The carrier is so easy to wash.. i throw it in the washer and hang it to dry.  it's wonderful!! i recommend this to any new (or old!) baby wearing mama!!!	
- 1	I bought this in October 2012 & was hoping for the set with black & white stripes, but received the set with green & yellow (first product picture).  I got these when my son was 4.5 months old as that seemed to be when he was really noticing his feet & grabbing them & I thought this would be perfect.  Unfortunately nothing fit, the wrist bands were too small & the socks went on okay but weren't elastic & just fell off.  [However I should note my son's a big boy & weighed around 15 pounds at the time] Only 2 of the 4 bugs rattle & it was a very quiet rattle at that.  I ended up returning the set.We also received theInfantino Foot Rattlesas a shower gift & these still snuggly fit him (at that time) & stayed on much better, both booties rattle but again it's quiet.  I believe the infantino ones are only sized up to 3 months but they are a nice stretchy material.  Walmart also has Garanimal ones that look nice {& a cheaper price point!} but we never tried them.	
1. 	When the larger shields are purchased, they stick out further making your pump more bulky to use, other than that they work well	
- 1	It did not get to the corners of my baby's nails so it left a weird angle and a sharper end to the nail. Needless to say, I had to buy the regular baby clippers and it worked like a charm. I got the safety 1st grooming set	
1. 	I have tried so many bottles. Really, Avent, Soothie, Mam, Ventaire, Dr. Browns, Gerber, Evenflo, and Born Free: from the cheapest to some of the most expensive.These are not perfect but they are what worked the best.Pros:-wide nipple, baby preferred-cleaned easily-had few parts-could be warmed in a bottle warmer or hot water-didn't need special tricks to keep from leakingCons:-had to buy liners-measurements could be betterI got over buying the liners in two ways: I started recycling my liners and I started using the Playtex flat liners available here on Amazon which helped the cost a lot. I can buy 5 months supple of liners (5 bottles a day) for less than $30 shipped/taxed.The measurements are still not great but since I premix every day's formula in a large pitcher the night before, I don't have to have the exact measurements. I know now from practice at about where on the liners the milk needs to go.	
1. 	Bumkin bibs are great.  They cover alot of area and the pocket catches the stray finger foods.  I wash (air dry) and it continues to look like a new bib.  This one was very colorful.  You can not find this print in the store.	
- 1	The reason I dislike this pacifier is because the grip handle stays up and hits our son's nose... it annoys him, he cries... and it kinda defeats the purpose of the pacifier - it shouldn't agitate him!	
- 1	I needed more rings to secure toys to high chair, stroller and car seat. These rings are very colorful, but they are quite flimsy and do not secure very well to anything, they are too bendy. You clip them together in a chain and baby just pulls them apart. Use them to tie up toys and the rings and toys just hit the floor. Baby likes to teeth on them so they stay on the playpen.... cannot be used on the go because you will lose your toys. I would not really recommend these rings, try a different set. These are not practical at all for their primary purpose.	
- 1	This bottle warmer broke after the first week.  It takes FOREVER to warm the bottles and then it doesn't even warm them.  I'm trying to get a refund right now.  Also, the opening is too small for the newer bottles (TippeTommy, comotomo, etc).	
- 1	I purchased this Boppy Shopping Cart Cover to replace a lostFloppy Seat Ez Carry Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Blue ABC. I didn't want to spend another forty-something dollars to get another Floppy Cover, so I opted for the Boppy brand, which was substantially cheaper.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be another case of you get what you pay for.  The back side of this shopping cart cover is made of a smooth, nylon rip-stop fabric that's extremely slippery; plus, there's no snug-fitting elastic or fabric ties to secure the cover to the shopping cart.  As a result, it's extremely easy for my 2 year-old to pull the cover off the shopping cart handle and sides, exposing the germy surfaces I don't want her to touch.  The only thing attaching the cover to the shopping cart seat is the child safety belt, but that only takes care of 1 of the 4 sides of the cover.  The other 3 sides of the cover easily slide off the shopping cart seat on their own, or with the help of the curious hands of a toddler/preschooler.  Since the purpose of a shopping cart cover is to serve as a barrier between your child and the dirty surfaces of a shopping cart seat, this product is virtually useless.  I'm going to return this Boppy cart cover and pony up the extra $$ for another Floppy cover.Grade: D-	
- 1	Maybe these work well for other babies but my daughter (now 6mos) has never liked them and never paid any attention to them. Cute, but not very useful.	
1. 	Once you get used to this, you can operate it with one hand in the dark. That's a definite bonus with a commode seat lock!	
- 1	Pros: large, lots of pockets, lightweightCons: the material is cheap and frays quickly, the pockets gape and sag awkwardly when u put things aside, he bag is extremely floppy and doesn't hold it's shape.Overall: you could probably find a bag of similar quality at family dollar for under $5	
1. 	I used this in conjunction with the CARES harness for my 3 year old to be able to sleep in comfort on a flight from the US to Asia.  It worked wonders; with the head support, he was able to take multiple naps on the 18+ hour journey each way, and my husband and I got some rest.  Unlike most head/neck pillows, this one has no bulk behind the neck, so the head isn't pushed forward in an uncomfortable way.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	I have this gate with 2 extensions to fit my 43&#34; opening. With the extensions the gate seems wobbly. The lock mechanism doesn't actually lock and if you lift it it will easily come open. The plastic pieces don't seem like they'll hold up for too long.  I would recommend the  Summer Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze  instead. I have that one on another opening and it is strong and sturdy! Very well built and I don't worry about my toddler opening it or it possibly falling!	
- 1	This 1 star is simply for the description of the product. The ADEN by aden+anais brand is of lesser quality and is 3 inches shorter in both length and width than the original aden+anais brand swaddle cloths. There is a big difference. I just wanted to make people aware that they're not ordering these: http://www.amazon.com/aden-anais-Muslin-Swaddle-Jungle/dp/B002SW3B0O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1366406922&sr=8-2&keywords=aden+anais	
1. 	this does take up a lot of space and if you make the bed with it under the covers, it looks like there's still a person sleeping. we have a king bed and so there's room for it. the cover is a little scratchy - like 50 thread count.  It has definitely helped me to make the adjustment to sleeping on my side because I am a back or stomach sleeper when I'm not pregnant.one of the first nights I used it, I had an awful night's sleep because my husband was snoring the whole night. Even though it was a saturday and I could sleep late, I was up at 7:00 am because of his snoring.  I was surprised when I went back to the bedroom an hour later to find my husband silently sleeping in my pillow!  he wants one too now!  I let him use my nest once I'm awake.It can be kind of cumbersome but my tip to get up to go to the bathroom in the night is just to lift one arm of it and go under the pillow.	
1. 	nice product, works as described.	
1. 	love it, the color is nice and the fabric is really soft, easy to wash. Blue color is very nice.	
1. 	My 8 month old isn't too impressed with it.  It is nice and well made but just not for my kiddo.Personally I like the different instruments that play the songs.  Hopefully when he gets older he will appreciate it more.	
- 1	My son was not interested in them. First of all these are too big on infants and second the rattle sound is too low.I dint like them for these 2 reasons and also my son dint so ended up returning them	
1. 	I use this under our co-sleeper mattress and it works great.  It gives our baby the lift she needs in her crib and it is a safe height.	
1. 	My daughter loves playing w them in the bathroom. They are a bit small but she doesn't mind. I'm not giving it 5 stars as they are squirrels but it is extremely hard to squirt all of the water out of them leading to mold. I anticipate that we'll use them until moldy and then buy new.	
1. 	SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but  when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib). By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds*  I WISH IT COULD BE  MORE  SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!	
- 1	Although I didn't purchase this monitor system from amazon, I felt it was my duty as a frequent shopper on the site to let fellow patrons know about a horrendous product when I see one.  This is such a bad monitoring system that it is almost like not having anything.  From the day it was installed it produced so much noise and interference that it was nearaly impossible to even hear if my son was calling for me. It got so bad at one point that I actually could not keep the volume up on the main screen unit at nighttime because it produced so much noise that my husband and I could not sleep!  So horrible.  Not a little over a year since I have it installed that hand held monitor went bad.  It no longer shows video and it acutally amplifies sound where sound is supposed to come out from.  So if you speak into the speaker where you would normally hear sound from inside baby's room, all you hear is your own voice amplified.  Summer infant is a horrible company who does not stand by their product and would not do anything for me.  The said I would have to purchase a whole new system.  Yeah so what every year  I have to spend $300 on a monitoring system?  Going to be going with a different company for sure.  No other monitor can be as bad as this one. Trust me!	
1. 	Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.	
- 1	I had heard such great things about the woombie and was so excited to use it but the neck is way too small and chokes baby! I would buy in an instant if there was a larger neck hole. My baby is 14 lbs and his neck isn't oversized and it was waaaay too small. This is supposed to fit babies 14-19 lbs... bummer!	
- 1	We use the GroVia Hybrid diapering system and love it!  I have almost nothing poor to say about Grovia...except maybe about these bags.  They are the only GroVia item I have not been perfectly happy with.  I'm not even sure what it was about them that they just didn't live up to what I was expecting.  They were very small and I wasn't sure I would trust the draw string to dirty diapers.  I have ended up with Plant Wise bags instead.  A couple different small sizes for the diaper bag and two large ones with elastic for the diaper bins.  --  I still love GroVia just not this product.	
1. 	I would have liked for these to be a little more difficult to remove, so that is why I did not give 5 stars. But after buying one pack I did come back and buy a second.	
- 1	I thought this was a neat idea until my little guy started manipulating it and collapsed it into the figure 8 and pinched his fingers--hard!  Not using it with my youngest.	
- 1	I thought this would be the perfect diaper bag for us, but it has too many inner compartments, which results in too much material and actual means less space inside for things.	
1. 	A MUST HAVE HE LOVES THIS CHAIR...HE LOOKED SO CUTE AND HE LOVES TO PLAY AND PLAY, HE EXPEND HOURS IN THIS CHAIR WITH OUT COMPLAYNING	
1. 	This item is light-weight but still washes well.  I can't imagine using it outside of the summer months, because it is really just T shirt material but it is perfect for a little extra warmth in the middle of the night.	
1. 	great for establising a bedtime routine and really peaceful/fun to look at	
1. 	What's not to love about the Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat? It's easy to clean with a wipe or two. It folds up nicely so you can easily stow it away the car trunk when you're eating out. And with adjustable table settings (for that growing little pot belly), and height settings, it grows with you.When we are eating out and ask for a high chair, as a concerned parent, you have to wonder where it's been and what they've been cleaning it with. With this booster seat, you can alleviate that fear. You can use it out, or use it at home, the adjustable straps on the side make it easy to secure this booster seat to any adult-sized chair (though we've also used this in booths at restaurants, and while it's not as secure, works just fine).And to top it off, it's affordable. For a product that has this much utility at such a low price point, it's an easy purchase to make.	
1. 	I have not needed to open this package yet because my original membranes are still in good shape! I'm glad to have these extras on hand and I imagine that they will last me a long time!	
- 1	I got this hamper as a gift. I returned it the next day. The white paint chips off all over.	
- 1	For those of you that don't know, there was a version of this in the nineteenth century that KILLED babies. The milk couldn't be cleaned out of the tubes completely and it would rot and cause severe diarrhea which sometimes ended up being fatal. I'm not sure if this tube would have the same problem or if they have since developed some way of cleaning out the ENTIRE tube since then, but I'm not risking my child's life for convenience! [...]	
- 1	The handle broke off while my 4 month old was sleeping. I don't know how it happened but a 4 month old isn't stong enough to snap off the handle. I was surprised to find it in two pieces in the crib. It's a choking hazard.	
1. 	These bottles are pretty good.  The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby.  She makes quite a mess while drinking from these.  However, the bottle is nice and durable.  The nipple and caps fit snug.  Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers.  You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage.  I like that.  My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use.	
- 1	*UPDATE*  3 of them have leaked so far; this is a new development this week.  One was damp all over in the morning after using it overnight.  So we decided not to use them overnight anymore.  But 2 have leaked during the day at the legs.  This just started happening this week.  Changing my review from a 5 to a 2; I have to buy 7 more diapers in another brand to replace these now.I ordered just one of these when the price dipped on one of the colors here on Amazon.  I wasn't sure about it because of the mixed reviews.  The fit is better than my BGs and FB on my long and thin baby (13 lbs, 25+ inches). I could see these diapers fitting a newborn really well because the newborn insert is smaller than other brands and the diaper has more adjustments (though I don't know from personal experience because we just got this diaper a week ago).  The snaps give a really nice fit and they seem better quality than the other diapers we have.  I'm finding with many cloth diapers that the crotch is way too wide and my baby gets uncomfortable, and this diaper is the narrowest and best fitting on my baby.  This month there is a promo so I ordered 6 more for an amazing price.  Hopefully, I won't have the leaking or absorption issues later that other reviewers have complained about.	
1. 	we bought this play yard sheet for our first trip with the baby. We planned on using the hotel's provided crib/pack n play to cut down on the amount of luggage we needed.We stayed at two different hotels, both of which brought out two very different looking cribs ... one was a standard looking pack n play that didnt have a mattress and only had the little floor insert (couldnt tell which brand. Had mesh sides like your typical pack n play). One was an old-school looking white crib and a mattress.This sheet fit both perfectly, and provided extra cushioning and was VERY VERY soft! For some reason, my daughter slept through the night all nights on our trip - something she never does at home. Is it the sheet?? Well, to my dismay i'll never find out because it doesnt look like (at least on AMazon) Eddie Bauer makes this sheet in normal crib dimensions. Darn!	
- 1	The snail cannot float staying up it only want to float on its side. My daughter enjoys the rings like they were rattles but that is pretty much it.	
1. 	These nipples worked great for my preemie. He was struggling with the Level 1 nipples - milk would come out the sides of his mouth and he was choking a lot. The preemie nipples let the perfect amount of milk out so that he wasn't overwhelmed.	
1. 	I LOOOVE this diaper pail!  Its the easiest to use!  after using the diaper genie for 2 months i decided i had enough with the refils and with how much of a pain it is to use.  I purchases this diaper pail in its place and i loooove it!  No more refills, it uses the same bags as my kitchen garbage!  And it holds alot more! I only have to empty it like once a week as oppsed to every other day with the diaper genie.  This is worth the few extra buck because you arnt spending 5 more bucks every othe rweek for refills!  I have a bunch of poopy diapers in mine and you cant even smell them! and i love the fact that you dont have to open it to put a diaper in so i can do it one handed.  Just toss the diaper in the top and flip over the handle, its sooo easy!  And with the diaper genie i noticed that the smell would leak out a bit when you opened the top.  It is a little bigger than the other pails, but it holds alot more!  I would definatly recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a diaper pail!!!!!	
1. 	This base fit perfectly with our car seat model. It definitely did the job.HOWEVER, before purchasing, definitely look into which models fit with this base.	
1. 	Love the boning in the neck line. Perfect to let baby breathe and allow me to see what's going on. Used it for the first time today, and felt totally comfortable nursing in the living room with guests.	
1. 	I purchased this gate to go in fromt of our fireplace. Our 10 month old kept trying to put his hands in our fireplace screen and was getting soot on his fingers,(we don't have the glass doors on it), just the screening. I bought this gate and attached it to the molding on either side and it works perfectly. My baby can't get into the fireplace and it blends in well with our color of marble on our fireplace. We did not want to put a big, bulky gate around the fireplace and this turned out to be the perfect solution!	
1. 	I have been sleeping with this thing for since I was 9 weeks pregnant. Super comfy and since I am a side sleeper it supports my legs nicely. VERY good purchase!	
1. 	These are the best! Super warm and wash well. The size xl is just now getting too small. My son can walk fine in these and the sleep sack is part of his bedtime routine.Love it!! We own about 4 of them- in case one gets dirty or such.	
- 1	While this product works somewhat, I have two problems with it.1. My faucet may have been too small for this model.  My 10-month old can yank it out of the faucet, and I cannot secure this model.  I wish the manufacturer provided an ideal spec for size/type of faucet fits the best.2. Legs and body of the elephant is somewhat soft, nose is hard plastic.  My baby is tough and he does not cry, but it hurts watching him hitting his head against the hard plastic part....On the other hand, my 9-year old loves the bubble spout feature.	
- 1	the seal on these bags do not seal well and i have had multiple bags leak before i got them to the freezer. if there is any amount of liquid around the seals it will prevent it from sealing properly. Also the mouth is too small and i can only write on it with a felt tip pen. i am throwing the rest away and going back to lansinoh where the bags are bigger, have never leaked and they are easy to write on. cheap does mean poor quality in this case	
- 1	I had high hopes for these, but have yet to find a kid who will play with them!  Both of our kids find them boring, and older ones as well.  Great concept, but probably too complex for the age group advertised.	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, I found these pads leaked easily after only one feeding. Maybe I leak more than others as I have had an OALD and oversupply with my first, but now with my second I took pains to avoid it and have not had problems, so I tend to think its the pads, not me.I am editing this to add: I believe these are not absorbant enough due to the material. After researching and experimenting with several cloth diapers, I have discovered that hemp and bamboo are MUCH more absorbant than jersey, cotton or microfiber. If you are looking for nursing pads (or cloth diapers for that matter) that are highly absorbant, look for something made with those fabrics.	
1. 	This is very convenient. I have it connected to the side of our changing table, which makes it easy for me to have the essentials readily available when time for a diaper change. Great purchase.	
1. 	I get the question all the time: &#34;wow, I've never seen one that looks that comfy! Where did you get it?&#34;This is great for most shopping carts. I say most because there are some where the fit isn't quite right, but hey, we adjust and go with it. The main issue with fit is that sometimes the cover doesn't reach all the way to where I hold the cart so he can still get his hands on grub when it's not stretched out over it.I loved it when he was really little (e.g., 6 months) because the side pillows would help to keep him propped up and in the center of the seat. I still love it because it's comfortable and it has pockets in the back for anything you need (e.g., water bottle, pacifier, toys, shopping list, etc.) and it folds up with a velcro strap for easy carrying. A great product!!	
- 1	Nice product and concept, although we only used it for 2 weeks before it quit working.  Started to leak and just wouldn't heat up our bottles.  The bottle itself would be hot but the contents would still be cold.  Never tried to use the cooler.  Was using Dr. Brown bottles in it.	
1. 	My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.	
1. 	My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.	
- 1	We don't use this brush frequently, we mostly wash our bottles in the dishwasher.  Despite this the brush still broke at the next after 4 mos.  I knew it was coming because around 3 mos, the brush was already bent and wouldn't stay straight when you applied slight pressure.I would recommend a brush that does not have a twisted metal neck.  There are other brands out there that fit this description.	
1. 	This bib set is really good - waterproof but soft. For the price you get a lot of bibs! The only quibble I have is that you can't put them in the dryer, so I have to take extra time to fish them out of the wash before I transfer clothes to the dryer. I just lay them flat on top of the dryer and they do dry super fast. It's just a little hassle of a step to have to do.	
- 1	I saw the bad reviews, but I love Munchkin products usually, so I decided to buy this anyway.The mirror itself is terrible. You can barely see a thing.The attachment mechanism is ridiculous. It is inconvenient, and attaching the mirror to the back of the rear view mirror is useless. All I could see was the headrest of the passenger seat.	
- 1	Honestly the idea is great but when you are home with a newborn it is almost impossible to remember to use these all the time and it drove me crazy and made me loose sleep trying to keep up with marking all diaper changes, breastfeeding, etc.  Also the clip on back is so cheap that it broke before I ever used it.	
- 1	My son is 7 weeks old and already over 13 pounds.  The Bjorn is uncomfortable for me after about an hour of wearing him in it - all his weight is carried by my shoulders and the so-called lumbar support really doesn't do too much.  Also, I have read it is not great to carry an infant hanging by his/her crotch with the feet dangling.I got an Ergo Baby Carrier instead and I love it so much more - it doesn't allow the babies to look out like in the Bjorn, but my baby doesn't mind, and the Ergo can be worn on my back when my baby can hold his head up better.  In the Ergo, his weight is distributed on my hips mostly and it makes him feel so much lighter than when he is in the Bjorn.  Plus, it fits my 6'5 husband and the Bjorn does not.  I am going to sell my Bjorn!	
- 1	this item was definitely better quality then the last set i bought for a lost pair. hope they last a lot longer and don't get lost.	
- 1	For the first time, I DIDN'T check reviews, as we've used Halo sleep sacks in the past and I loved them.  However, this product is 37 long and my baby's whole body is 31.5 long.  This looks like it will fit a pre-schooler.  The leg cuffs are way too wide to stay around his ankles, even if the bulk of the sleep sack didn't bother him when walking.  There was so much extra material that he was getting very tangled up with his legs inside as a blanket.  I finally took it off him and he passed right out.  Definitely returning this.  I'm disappointed as it's very soft and I love the idea.	
- 1	The only problem is that if your toddler pushes on the door when it is in place in the door jam then it will pull the screws out of the door where the hinge is!	
- 1	I like the actual bottle--it's glass, but isn't incredibly heavy. But what really annoys me is that the spouts to make the bottles into a trainer cup are expensive and difficult to find.  I also still can't find handles.  If Born Free really wanted to make this an environmentally way for parents to use their glass bottles as sippy cups later, they would have the spouts and handles easily available and reasonably priced.  I don't recommend purchasing unless you only want to use these as bottles.  I'm nearing the end of bottle feeding, and was hoping the conversion would justify my trying these bottles.	
- 1	1. Steady, non-slip base keeps spills to a minimum ... not even close! There is nothing none-slip about this plate - it slides all over the high-chair tray (and off it) very easily.2. Plate and ring separate for ease of cleaning ... the ring is useless at best and very annoying at worst. It is just one more thing for baby to pull off the plate and launch to the floor. Why it is detachable makes no sense at all.3. The walls around each compartment are far too low - food gets pushed together very quickly. Baby doesn't mind the food all mixed together, but the whole point of a plate with sections is that it will increase the chances of the food staying separate, despite baby's pushing it around with a spoon.This is a cute looking plate, but in my experience its functionality and usefulness are poor.	
- 1	First off, this contraption is a pain to put on. You have to struggle to zip it up and get it on properly. after 1 use I found myself preferring to just hold the pumps with one arm and type with one hand rather than spend 5 or more minutes strapping the dang thing on.It is also uncomfortable. I felt stifled because of the thick fabric, and worst of all, this thing hangs from the upper area and provides zero support to your boobs. The bottom is loose and just hangs out. A better designer would have designed this with a stretchy fabric (or something) underneath to provide support underneath the boob and push the whole area up.I wanted to like this, I really did. It would have been glorious if I could have used this and have both hands free to type!!	
- 1	I'm a bit new to the whole cloth diapering thing, but I just had twins so I'm able to really evaluate the test of these in a short period of time.  The designs are ridiculously cute, I really love them.  The diapers themselves are also very soft.  I in particular love the cheetah print one, it's so so cute!  However, the sizing on this is a bit off, even with the rise.  One of my twins is in the 25% range in terms of height and weight, but none of them fit him at all.  He's a bit on the thin side (still normal range) so I can forgive that.  However, my daughter is 70% on weight, and 60% on height, and it still doesn't quite fit her that well.  I end up using these diapers on her, and prefolds with a wrapper on the boy, but I've already had several blow outs from these diapers when she uses them.  I haven't had leaks, but I also don't use these at night, only during the day.  I have noticed around the legs in particular, it seems to be wide, even though my girl has pretty chunky legs, it still can blow out of there.  I prefer the thirsties wraps in comparison, with the prefolds and snappis, because of the double gussets on the legs that prevent blow outs.  With these, even with chunky thighs, the stitching and elastic is not really tight enough to prevent blow outs, even on the tightest settings for the rise.It is an inexpensive first investment into cloth diapering, and I still use them, mostly because they are the only pockets I have, and I already bought the inserts (these do not come with inserts, so I bought the bamboo inserts also by alva baby, which work fine), but I'm a little turned off by the fact that 1) they dont' fit that well 2) I cannot reuse them (unlike the thirsties wrappers) 3) they dont' come with inserts.  I wish they were a bit better made and came with different patterns besides this and I would be a firm supporter.EDITED: just so you know, when I initially wrote this review, the twins were about 3 months, so not quite newborns, and they were still too big.  Now the twins are 9 1/2 months, and after not using them for a while (I had bought fuzzibunz and bumgenius from cotton babies in the meantime since these didn't really seem to fit), I am using these again.  I have found though, that they don't seem to be quite as absorbent for some reason, even with the same liner.  Perhaps the PUL doesn't work as well with these?  The bumgenius and fuzzibunz generally last me about 2 1/2 to 3 hours with the twins (assuming they don't poop), but these will last me probably about 1 1/2 to 2 hours only, which is a lot of diaper changing then.  They still are super cute, so usually what I do is reserve these for the diaper change right before their nap and then I always change their diaper after their nap anyhow, so then they are only in this diaper for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, which works out fine.	
1. 	The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google Door Guardian installation instructions, find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8 inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16 inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16 inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.	
1. 	I bought one of these as an experiment for swaddling my very active 6 week old son.  I was skeptical, especially because of the price, but I was desperate to find something that would help him sleep.  This blanket works wonders!  He sleeps more than twice as long as he did before (from 1 hour to 4-5 hours now).  I only swaddle him in it at night, and I don't wrap him very tightly which means he eventually works one arm out.  But I am working on not swaddling him eventually, so I want him to get used to having that one arm out.Even though it seems a little pricey, it's worth it and much better than the swaddling blankets with velcro.  He worked out of them in no time, and the velcro did wake him up.	
1. 	This is perfect for the winter weather.  When combined with my body heat, it keeps my very tall 11 month old nice and snuggly.  Love it.	
- 1	This high chair has nice features like the swinging tray, adjustable height, and recline. It's easily moved with the wheels. You can also fold up and put away. We purchased last August and most of the time I just wipe clean however I have thrown it in the washer in cold water. I've done this only 3 times and each time the chair paid material cracks. I even allow it to air dry so not sure why the material does this. It looks awful now, peeling off. Amazon still says it is eligible for return and refund so it's going back.	
- 1	I wasn't happy when I received this bag because it was too flashy (bronze) and it felt like plastic. I thought for the price, it would feel more durable. I love how it doesn't look like a diaper bag and it has a lot of space and pockets, but the quality of the material wasn't up to par with the price you pay. I am in the process of returning this bag.	
1. 	These nipples worked great for my preemie. He was struggling with the Level 1 nipples - milk would come out the sides of his mouth and he was choking a lot. The preemie nipples let the perfect amount of milk out so that he wasn't overwhelmed.	
1. 	My 1 month old baby wants to be hold all the time, but the thing is I cannot do anything when holding her.  That's why I decided to buy a baby carrier.This carrier is a bit expensive, but I think it worth it (actually I was thinking of buying Baby Carrier Synergy but that one is really expensive!).  You can put your baby in and out of the carrier without waking him/her up.  Now I can carry my baby around while doing other stuff.The only thing I don't like is the position of the head support knots on the straps.  Usually I would wear the straps, and hold the baby on my chest, calm her a little bit first before putting her into the carrier.  But the knots are on the way and can press on baby's face/eyes if I'm not careful.  The Baby Carrier Synergy (or Active) has those knots in higher position and probably won't have the same problem.  But I'll still give this carrier 5 stars.	
- 1	Good stroller set, but reclining the stroller seat to put the carseat was a pain. This was not worth the pain for me as we live in the northwest where it rains alot.  I am stuck outside in the rain trying to recline the stroller seat to attach the car seat.	
1. 	useful peace	
1. 	I am a first time mom and have never used another bather for my two and a half month old.  It's easy to store, dries fast, and my baby seems very comfy in it.  It fits nicely in my sink and its mesh fabric allows water to flow through.  After reading other reviews, I want to try it in the bath with me and see how baby and I like it!	
- 1	These spoons are thin and flimsy and very small. I like the fact they are American made and safe, but they are just too small and lightweight, so I replaced them with the Green Toys spoons and forks, which I also reviewed.	
1. 	Works great. Does it's job. Fits into the wall just fine. Snug enough that my daughter can't pull it off herself, but not too snug that I can't pull it off when I need to use that outlet.	
1. 	simple seat for my daughter to take a bath in.  She is 4 months old and outgrew the small bath that we were using.  We wanted something that could be placed in the tub and still make sure she remained safe.  After about 5 or 6 baths we are very happy with it.  The quality could be a little better and it would be nice if it would be a little larger for longer use in the future but for the price I can't complain too much.	
1. 	I'm so glad I bought this monitor with the larger 2.5 screen. We are able to see our daughter clearly even in black-and-white mode. Note that there needs to be good bright lighting in the bedroom for it to show color mode clearly.This monitor has great reception, as I can take it down to the garage to do laundry or out to our patio to water the plants. It does generate some interference when we set it near our computers or tv.You do have to keep it plugged in for it to show the picture constantly, otherwise it goes into standby mode with only sound (you have to press the top button to get picture).I do wish that they had numbered volume settings on the side so I can always set it at the same level every night. I find myself fidgeting with it each night to get just the right amount of sound. We have a sound machine that runs in her room at night, so we try not to make it too loud.All in all, this will save you the hassle of running to the baby's room all the time. Good quality and effective!	
- 1	This thing is crap. I'm a sucker for buying it but trust me, I didn't even think to use it. It is cheap, flimsy, and smells like chemicals, this is a dont buy.	
1. 	My son quickly figured out how to pull out the standard plug protectors.  This one works well for our little guy.  I have an older home so one or two of my plates weren't replaceable with these since they didn't quite line up right.  But everywhere I've used them my son has been unsuccessful and has quickly lost interest in the outlets.	
- 1	Let me start by saying that my son really likes playing with this. It is a very engaging, fun toy for him. I am a little frustrated with it though. I bought this because I wanted a suction toy that would stick in place so I wouldn't have to constantly be picking up toys and putting them back on his high chair tray....but this doesn't stick very well. There are times that I've stuck the toy to the high chair and it loses suction and falls over on its own without even being touched *grumble* so you can imagine how easy it is for my baby to just grab it and pull it right off the tray....only to drop/throw it on the floor soon after, defeating the purpose of this toy... So yes-it is very cute and fun for the baby to play with. However, if I had known it was going to just end up being another noise making toy with moving parts, I wouldn't have bothered buying it.	
- 1	The idea of something that makes boingy noises as your baby jumps on it seems to be a good one, but when they implemented the concept into this item, it came up severely lacking. If on music mode, it doesn't complete one song before moving to the next. So as your baby bounces, you get the first 3 notes of one song and the first 3 of another all mashed together. The jungle sounds are about the same level of annoying. The sound effects are somewhat tolerable, but not really engaging to the baby. As if those annoyances weren't enough, this thing slides all over the joint as baby bounces. I was constantly having to move it back under baby's feet. Really not worth the money. Just put some crinkle paper under baby for the same effect with no money out of pocket.	
- 1	Can not get this pouch to fit on car seat. Waste of money. I have the britax car seat and this product does not work well with it.	
1. 	Very necessary and helpful part, would definitely recommend adding to your pumping bag if you're a working mom or find yourself traveling often.  Having this product increased my pumping options and was definitely worth the small investment of cost.	
1. 	We absolutely love this crib! It's small enough that we can fit it in our bedroom but large enough he has room to grow. At eight months and twenty one pounds that is really important to us!	
- 1	I gave these to my 2 year old for Easter, which was 2 weeks ago.  They have already broken, as the screw fell out of one side.  Plus, the &#34;Babiators&#34; logo on the sides is already coming off.  (They will send you a new pair if you registered them and then you pay for the shipping.)  I'm going to fix them myself with an eyeglass kit, as it will be cheaper than the shipping on a new pair.  I won't be buying these again, though.  Carters sells similar glasses for just $5.  My daughter got a pair of those in her Easter basket as well - and they are still in one piece.  I'm going to stick with the cheaper brand.  Bottom line:  unless the brand name means something to you, buy something cheaper versus being disappointed, like I was, that I spent $20 on something that broke in 2 weeks.	
1. 	Jersey knit hits the spot with babies, and this goes above and beyond! Not only is it cute and a good quality sheet, it is SO SOFT!I want sheets like this! Even after multiple washings it fits great and is soft to the touch!	
1. 	I got these for my 9.month-old as i had already bought the number 4s and the flow was too fast for her. Number 3s are perfect for her now at 9 months.	
1. 	This bathtub makes me feel much less stressed about bath time! The sling provides just the right support and elevation for younger infants. At 4 months, we took the sling out and our son fits perfectly in the angled tub. Now our little guy is learning to splash and will get to start playing with toys in the next few months. Great tub to use until babies are ready for larger bathtub. Also, it's easy to clean.	
- 1	The high contrast design fascinates her. Beyond that I do not recommend this product. It didn't fit her at three months old. They where not shaped for the feet so they fit awkwardly. They did not rattle loudly either.	
- 1	I loved this chair at first, even though the tray didn't sit tight against my (at the time) 6 month old causing me to have to change his clothes completely after nearly every meal because stuff always slid down his bib, despite the pocket and landed in his lap. I made the mistake early on of spraying the tray down to clean it and that has caused some small spots in the corners to wear and puff up- it's particle board, a la sauder brand, not solid wood. I've also had trouble with the screws on the sides coming loose causing the foot rest to slide out and fall repeatedly- usually when the dog is trying to lick it off lol. Now I've owned it for a year or so and there are numerous nicks on the tray, both on the edge and top surface. The worst part though is that my now 18 month old has figured out how to undo the restraint- a simple push of the button and now tries to climb out and even onto the tray. I've looked over several times to see him standing up in the chair with a foot on the tray ready to fall. NOT SAFE!! If it had a more secure buckle, I would have given it 3 stars- it does look nice. But I don't think it's going to hold up for use as he grows, which is what I was hoping for. I previously had a fisher price healthy care booster which I now wish I had kept.	
- 1	The idea of this is fantastic- but the actual item is poorly made with really cheap materials. I read the reviews and decided I didn't care- the plastic the holds the photos is really shotty and sticks to every picture- like you put in in a hot car and let it melt- but it did not- it's just cheap.  I think the idea of this and the number of photo pages is amazing- it's too bad they charge $14.95 for something that clearly cost .$50 or less to be made in some third world country. I am using it anyway- but wish I had paid 1/10th of what I did.	
1. 	Basically these are no frills outlet plugs that work fine to protect toddlers from exposed outlets.  I am basing my review on the price comparison of buying these locally.They are much more expensive in stores, and as an add on product to a prime order, they are a great value.	
1. 	I thought long and hard before spending the extra dollars for this swing but decided in the end to stop thinking and just get it. I have been extremely pleased with this product.This is the 4'th swing I have owned, I bought one for each of my boys.  Had I purchased this one first, it would have been the only one I would have needed!Yes it is large, but it is sturdy! The feature that enables you to convert the seat from front/back swinging motion to side/side swinging motion is fantastic and definately a big advantage! Perfect for a newborn.  I didn't have the pang of guilt that we emotional and hormonal new mom's have when we have to release our babies to do something for ourselves.The seat reclines somewhat to accomodate newborn floppy head but I still had to use the horse-shoe head holder pillow thing. The swing itself is just so inviting and fun.  It looks very appealing and substantial.  I never felt as if I was putting Luca away for a little while.  Especially since this swing has the side to side cradle motion which he LOVED!This swing is fast! Even on the lowest setting, but the manual suggests that you let a blanket hang over the seat.  I did this because I always covered the baby in the swing anyway in an attempt to keep away the drafts.  A knitted or crocheted baby blanket worked fine for me.It was so wonderful to have this swing for my baby because he was very jaundiced.  I was able to wrap the little billi-blanket around him and put him in his swing.  We put his swing in front of a window that had a lot of sun and when he did not have the bili-blanket on, the fact that he was content to stay in his swing, meant that he was receiving the benefit of the natural sunlight and therefore, his time with the lighted blanket was minimal.I liked being able to change the sounds.  It made the experience more interesting, at least for me.Once Luca got a bit older (around 5 months) I began using the back and forth feature more and more.  I finally had to stop the regular use of this by 9 months.  Luca is one year old now and every once in a while, I put him in this and he still loves it.  Now though, it is more for fun and only for about 10 minutes...long enough for me to pick-up, vacuum and sometimes dust the room.  I do have to stay right there in the room because when he is finished, he will attempt to get out himself.  I hate to retire this great item that has served us so well!The battery usage is high depending on the amount of time you keep baby swinging and the use the other features but it is definately worth it! The gently turning fishies and dome light were a big hit with my son. He loved it.The motor is loud but my son seemed to calm with the consistency of the sound. I just played the music or used the other sound effects.There is a dial that enables you to control the movement of the swing from very gentle to a bigger swing. This was fantastic and I found that the gentle was gentle enough when as I mentioned above, I put a blanket over Luca's little legs and let it hang down over the side. This little bit of extra weight made it perfect for him and I was able to use it from when he was newborn! This is a difficult feature to find in baby swings as many of the others I looked at seemed to have their first settings much faster, especially for a new baby.I felt this was well worth the money and there is enough variety of features to please any baby and parent.As typical with Fisher Price products, cleaning it is a breeze so OCD people like myself can keep it clean and new looking!Great product!	
1. 	I love this monitor.  I was hesitant to get it at first because the price was so reasonable but I went for it and have had no problems at all.  The reception is so clear that I can hear my son breathing in his crib.  I also love that it comes with two receivers.  I keep one in my bedroom and one in another part of the house.  I would definitely recommend buying this product...don't waste your money buying something more expensive.	
1. 	This is a great tub and makes bathing my baby very easy. I love that she doesn't have to sit in dirty water and that I don't have to guess the water temperature. My only complaint would be that it is difficult to bath newborns. A padded insert would be very helpful. I put a towel inside (avoiding the drainage holes), and that seems to help quite a bit. Overall a fantastic tub!	
- 1	After much research, I came across the Ulubulu website that claims their pacifiers are bite-proof.Since my little one is chewing holes through her pacis every day you can guess my frantic attempt to locate the most hardy and toughest pacifiers in the market. Hence Ulubulu came about. Why, the first day she used it, she bit through it. So where's the bite-proof feature?? Planning to return it to Amazon. Don't buy or waste your $$$. Besides that acclaimed feature, nothing special about it - just ordinary looking and I hate the ring handle, and the words inscribed on them - not witty in the least bit.	
1. 	I ended up purchasing the Safer Bather when our daugther was born. It was super soft and worked well in the sink.  However as she grew it seemed as though the Safer Bather quickly became too small. My neighbor had the Sure Comfort NB-to-Toddler tub and the sling feature worked so nicely! Our baby is really long and the sling had more than enough room for her stretch out.But after we didnt need to use the sling the tub itself was lacking for her as she got bigger. She seemed so uncomfortable and proped up in an uncomfortable position.I would still recommend this item just for the sling feature and the tub is designed to sit atop your kitchen sink which also makes for easy fill/empty.	
1. 	We used these with our second child so that she can eat what everyone else is having for dinner and I don't need to make baby food.  It makes it so easy to give her a variety of food choices.  They can be hard to clean if you don't clean them right after dinner- I flip the mesh inside out and run it under water and scrub it with my fingers before putting it in the dishwasher and I don't have any issues with it coming out clean.  If you have a teething baby- you can put ice cubes inside and they are great on sore gums.  We also keep one in the fridge with frozen fruit in it most of the time to just pull out whenever the baby needs/wants something to chew on.	
- 1	We bought this swing about a month after our son was born.  One month later we are on swing #2 and need to return this one now.  The motor keeps dying.  It's a great swing.  Sturdy.  Plus interior that our son loves to snuggle into.  The mirror where the birds hang is also starting to entertain him.  The problem is the motor.  The first swing worked great in all three positions for about 3 weeks and then slowly lost its ability to move.  We would push it to get going and it would slowly come to a graceful stop after maybe 10 minutes.  It was so disappointing.  We loved the swing.I made a return because our first swing was obviously defective and purchased a second one.  Same swing.  After the first week, the only motion that will keep swinging is the front to back.  The side to side gradually comes to a stop after 5 minutes.  I'm just astonished.  A really solid swing.  Nicely made.  Why can't the company invest in a better motor?  You pay over $100 for this piece and the value is not in the main component.We love the swing so much that we are holding onto it a bit longer.  We are going to see how long the front to back swinging motion lasts.  If it dies, will I return it to get another one again?  I'm tempted.  Really tempted since I do really like the swing itself and how my baby fits in it.  I love the mirror and the different swinging motions.  The different positions you can put the seat in is also great.  I even love the colors.  It's not bright and cartoon-like.  It blends into our home really well which is hard to say about other swings out there.I will not get this swing again though.  Sadly, I have to find another option.  We may end up with a bright, rainbow swing in the corner of our living room.  I will most likely hate the colors but if it works and my son loves it, it will be two thumbs up for me.  Quality is priority.  Shame on you Fisher Price for jipping the consumer.	
1. 	These snack traps (as we call them) are great for my 1 year old puttering around the house after his second dinner.  We put cheerios, fruit, etc in them and they don't fall out.  My son has thrown them across hardwood floors and the lid stays on!	
- 1	Way too big for a baby just starting to use a cup or a toddler. Disappointed because exactly what I was l	
1. 	I bought this as a simple inexpensive pail to use for cloth diapering.  I use thePlanet Wise Diaper Pail Liner (White)and it fits perfectly.  So far, I love this pail.  It's the perfect size: not too big not too small and the odors are fairly well contained.  The button action top is very simple to operate with one hand.  The only drawback I find is that the opening for the diapers is small (about the size of an adult man's fist).  This hasn't been an issue for us as we use prefolds, but I could see it being difficult with bulkier all-in-ones.  Also, as our baby grows and dirty diapers get smellier, I don't anticipate this keeping all smells at bay, but since we wash the diapers every two days I don't foresee an issue.	
- 1	I have a 6 week old infant that weighs about 11 pounds and I could only get him in half way in the cradle pose!!  The fabric was so tight that he would NOT have been comfortable.  There is a difference between &#34;swaddle tight&#34; and &#34;OMG my kid won't be able to breath tight&#34;.  My friend has an older model of the Hotsling and said that it isn't as tight as this adjustable pouch.  If you are thinking of purchasing this model..don't.  Go with the Moby wrap!  I have that and baby loves it!  it is completely adjustable and versatile!	
- 1	I thought these would be the answer because they seem to make so much sense, but they don't work as well in practice. First of all, while they freeze milk easily, the milk lines stick to one another in the bags, so you can't choose one or two, it's all a big clump. Secondly, the milk gets freezer-burn on all the exposed surface area of the milk lines- and I use expensive breast milk storage bags, too. They do not work like you'd want. Maybe if you keep them separated from touching one another in a freezer bag and use them within a short period of time, which many women might do.	
- 1	I bought this product just as an alternative to the one with handle (bought that first and loved it), when baby was about 5-6 mo.  It worked good at first (except that it doesn't have handles, but it's fine with my boy), but when my boy started to be able to pull himself to sit, here came the problem.  You know baby falls down easily when they are trying to sit up and stand up.  and sometimes they love to hold the teething toy at the same time - so there's one time that he was chewing on that, and trying to stand up, but fell down facing down on the playmat.  He started to cry (he rarely cries when he fell becoz the mat is soft on carpet, and I'm always sitting not far away watching him), then I noticed the banana was in the mouth.  I think the banana might have hit him inside the mouth or on the gum.  but I think it could be scary if it hit his throat!!!  So I would not recommend this product to parents who has infant who can sit up/stand up by themselves.  And I do think this is a design flaw, when it comes to baby, they should think about all possibilities.	
- 1	If you order this, you will get something very different.  It is a plain white brush and comb, no gripping and it looks like a toy doll's set. Do not order this, they will not replace it with what is pictured, Amazon only gives you a refund but if you are like me, I just wanted what was pictured and I am not getting it so do not even order this.	
1. 	I really wish I'd bought these before the birth. I got them a few months into breast feeding and loved them. They are really best for wearing in the privacy of your home as they will be visible unless you're wearing a bulky sweater. However if you are at all interested in reserving every last drop of precious breast milk you will appreciate these! Also, for soar nipples they provide a little relief.The fit in the bra and a hole around the nipple allows leakage to flow undaunted, I found that the fit was good and everything leaked in the reservoir as designed. Wearing them around during the day helped me collect an extra ounce and a half of milk (foremilk, but still good stuff - hydration is essential!) that would otherwise have been wasted into my clothing.	
- 1	This holds about two pacifiers but you really have to squish them together and hope the container doesn't pop open as there isn't really a 'lock' to it. It's cute and convenient but was so not worth the money. Use a plastic bag instead, or make your own out of fabric!	
- 1	If you are using Dr. Brown's long bottles, this is NOT the sterilizer for you.  And for other bottles, you have to be really patient to work with the adjustable middle racks.  This thing frustrates me to no end, I can't wait to get another one.  This was a baby shower gift.	
1. 	We wanted the microwave as opposed to the electric sterilizer because it was cheaper and more portable. It worked fast and great.	
1. 	We practice EC and have used this potty chair and the toilet for pee and poop since our baby was an infant. Most every time the big people in the house  go to the toilet we put baby on her potty. We use cloth diapers and have changed very few diapers with poop.  Our baby has learned to tell us when she needs to go by pointing to her diaper or by removing her diaper.  A great tool for parents and kids!	
- 1	It's bulky and gets caught on everything even when I have it in a picket, which makes the clip redundant.  As for the clip.  Doesn't keep the container on. It's constantly coming off. Last but not least, the bag container latch NEVER stays closed.  It's VERY annoying.  I don't use it anymore.	
1. 	Every time we go somewhere, this is in the diaper bag!  I use the Tommee Tippee bottles and 2 bottles fit in there with an ice pack. (I use a different ice pack than the one that comes with it).  It fits nicely in the diaper bag and so far I'm extremely happy with this purchase!	
1. 	We got this as a gift and my daughter didn't care about it much when she was younger, but now at 1 she enjoys turning it on in her room when she's alone, lights on or off.	
- 1	My favorite wipes were out of stock, so I took a gamble and purchased these. They are awful and I wish I hadn't purchased so many of them. They are very small and also have a terrible scent. Fragrance free does not equal unscented! The texture of them reminds me of pampers wipes except they aren't as wet feeling, so if you like pampers wipes you may like these.	
1. 	We love the SleepSacks and have been using them since 3 months old when we abandoned the swaddles since he was showing signs of rolling over.  We use the micro-fleece in the winter and the cotton ones in the summer.We dress him in a long sleeve body suit and then put this over it.  He loves it!	
- 1	I have two of these, used for cloth diapering at daycare. They have a wet bag zip compartment and a dry compartment. They hold 4 all-in-one cloth diapers and a change of clothes, no problem.At first I was a bit disappointed as I expected them to be bigger, but they are just about the perfect size for day to day transport for daycare. (we use the large wet bags to collect diapers at home and much prefer those at home.) I grew to love them as we used them daily. They're washed and dried every other day in the wash with our cloth diapers.The first bump in the road was the plastic snap that holds the handle together. A snap broke on one of the bags, and we had to replace it. This was after maybe 2 months of use. Now we have 8 months of use and there are gaping holes in the outside fabric where the zipper ends rub against the fabric. The seams are threadbare, the zippers are becoming troublesome. Now our experience is looking pretty bad and I'm hoping we can limp these through a little bit longer.I'll give it this- the waterproof bag inside is still in very good shape and holding up, but it's looking like I will have to rebuild a fabric bag around the waterproof part! For the price? Find something else or you'll wind up disappointed. A plain wet bag without the dry compartment would have been a better move for our purposes.UPDATE: These ended up lasting less than 1 year before the cheap outer fabric and zippers were completely falling apart and unsalvageable. I replaced them with Bummis Fab Wet Bags- the simpler and sturdier construction on the Bummis bags makes far more sense for use with cloth diapering. I would not spend money on the Planet Wise brand again.	
1. 	I bought these when I was traveling with my then three month old son. I thought it would be easier than constantly having to wash a million bottle parts. They worked perfectly. If you have a child who doesn't drink from certain bottles, maybe try buying just one first? But they worked well for us when we were traveling for an extended period of time and I loved the convenience of throwing away the drop in. My son didn't have any issues with drinking from the nipple.	
1. 	I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all.	
1. 	I keep these in my diaper bag wherever I go.  These are small enough to stuff anywhere in case you need to throw a smelly diaper away!	
1. 	This is an absolutely amazing product and a must have for infants.  i say may be toddler too escpially the ones like my son who move a lot during sleep.	
- 1	This is the worst bottle warmer ever.  The bottles were either too hot and I mean smoking hot or not warm enough.  Using this thing was the same as just heating a bottle up in a pot!  You could never leave the bottle, walk away and come back hoping that it would be the right temperature.  I would have to put her bottles in, stand there and check every minute or so.  The water tube that comes along with it does not hold enough water to warm her bottle sufficiently.  We had to pour at least three tubes worth of water in there to get her 5 ounce bottle warm.  I ordered the Dr. Browns bottle warmer and am in love!  This mess is going back immediately.	
1. 	I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame. Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty. Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!	
1. 	When my daughter got too old for her bath seat I decided to purchases a transitional tub to ease her into the big tub. She loved this! I think it also helped in her liking baths in the big tub because she never once seemed scared of the transition when she got too big for this duck.	
- 1	Looking for a quality liner. These aren't the best. Wish they were thicker and held more. Would not buy again.	
- 1	This bouncer is ok. When my baby was younger and I couldn't get him to go to sleep I would put him in this bouncer with the vibration on & it would put him right to sleep. Now that he is 4 months old he wont sleep in it and wont stay in it very long.  It is boring.  There are no lights or upbeat songs. There is nothing going on with it, nothing happening, nothing exciting.  I wish that there were more lights, along the sides, top, etc. and more activites.	
- 1	doesn't warm up that quickly, not easy to fill up to the right level, no auto-off system, I don't know why there is different levels as they all warm up the same (the book actually never mention to use any other than the maximum one) not safe as stated, you baby CAN get burned as it really get the milk super warm (even on the lower level) so you have to be careful. on the plus side....well, it doesn't take much space and it's still easier than a pan with water...but that's about it...	
- 1	Kudo for the design as a breastfeeding mother I was very excited about a paci that close to the natural shape of the mother's nipple but when I received this pacifier from amazon it felt a little waxy so I wash it and it still felt waxy. After washing it for about 10 times it feels better but as soon as i give it to my baby he spit it out. After so many time trying it. I try it o myself. It taste very weird. Pacifier supposed to be taste-free... and the smell is not something you want to smell for a long period of time. I threw these away and stick to the soothie that was given by the nurse in the hospital.	
1. 	This is one very serious cup holder that will never fail if installed right but that is hard to do. It seems like you install it one way, but you actually have to do something else. I'm pretty handy but this one was tricky to me. Instructions are atrocious.First, this cup holder will fit all thickness handles. I have a First Years Wave stroller which is very thick. It could've handled thicker and thinner just the same.Second, it does swivel to level your drink if installed on a diagonal bar. You have to press a button to make it swivel.Here is the trick--when you get it, the tab piece that goes around the bar comes bent in the middle and it feels like you put your bar in that part, tighten, and you are done. This is wrong.***HOW TO INSTALL***You should unbend the tab piece where you think the bar should go. Then, bend the piece again around your stroller to make a custom sized loop. This plastic is pretty thick that is probably why a lot of people don't think to do this. When you put the tab into the fastener, look at the treads and line them up before it goes in all the way in to make a tight fit. Then when you get it in, you use the screw thingy to make it even tighter. I also think that this is how you are supposed to install it and the instructions just aren't clear or people are not taking the time to read it.If you don't do this, installation will be loose and the drink will fall and you will complain.Someone had a tip on here to use kitchen grip pads around your bar. This is a good idea. I installed mine over the foam part of the stroller handle so I didn't need it but I would've liked some if I was installing over the metal part. Not necessary but would be a nice to have.	
1. 	My son used this gym pretty much since he was born until he was 9 months old and could crawl and stand! HE LOVED IT. I cannot stress enough how much of a lifesaver this thing was. He LOVED everything on it, especially the monkey. I personally found that it had plenty of toy loops to add your own, and all of them were filled. He would spend up to an hour even as a young baby just playing or napping on this gym. He loved the little extras on the floor of the gym, like the lions tail that sticks out, and the leaf that crinkles. He also REALLY loved the lights at the top of the gym, especially on the setting where they were synced with the music.I didn't have any problems with the mirror falling out (sounds like that one was faulty...) but I do agree that the way the mirror hangs does not face the baby. The EXTREMELY EASY solution to this problem was just to add one of those plastic toy links that your probably already have a million of. Problem solved. Also loved that it was super easy to clean. Even when my son was older and could sit, crawl, and pull to standing, he would pull up on the gym and stand there playing with the toys hanging down, or crawl and sit under the toys. I was surprised that we got such extended use out of this (we finally put it away sometime after he turned 9 months to make room for other toys)	
1. 	We received this as a gift and love it! It warms the wipes nicely. When we use unwarmed wipes my baby gets more upset at changes. Perhaps we are spoiling him. ;-) He is a winter baby so I'm sure he appreicates our efforts to keep his tushy warm.The only time I have had problems with wipes drying out is when I have over filled it and the lid doesn't close tightly or I have accidently left it open. When that happens, I have just added a bit of water and it restores them nicely. I found that the bottom wipe does turn brown but only when I keep adding the fresh wipes to the top and the bottom ones were older. Now I remove the whole remaining stack and add new ones to the bottom. Even if they are slightly brown, it just looks weird. I'm pretty sure the wipes are just fine.I do wish that it came with a pop-up adapter or something. I like the Pamper's pop-up wipes but find it difficult to pull one out because they are inner-folded and stick together. It works better with the Huggies wipes.The only other issue is that the lid collects condensed water and I am afraid of it leaving a puddle on our furniture. So, I place it on a folded face towel and that seems to work.Overall despite the few minor issues mentioned I am very pleased with this product.	
- 1	My daughter is a strong 12-month old, but the flaps on snack catchers are so stiff that they trap her hand once she gets her fist inside. Now she resorts to trying to pick out cheerios from the container one at a time, however, each time she manages to get one out, 5-10 others pop out with it and fly everywhere, or she pushes 1-2 flaps in and tries to pour out the cheerios, and, of course, they fall out everywhere. It does a great job keeping the cheerios in as long as no one tries to get any out.	
1. 	Perfect for babyproofing. Much better than others I had used in the past because they are more difficult to remove (for my kids, not for me.)	
1. 	This crib sheet is soft and comfortable for a baby. The unisex baby bear design was loved by my son and daughter-in-law for use in our (grandparent's) house when visiting with their 10 month old daughter. It fits the  3 inch foam mattress for the Graco PackNPlay correctly. Fabric is decent weight, not thin. Good quality, great price.	
- 1	Pay attention to the style you order. I did not receive the style I ordered but kept the one I received. Not sure how that happened. The plastic smell is bothersome at first but goes away after a while. It is useful.	
1. 	These are lightweight and great to bring along in your diaper bag as it folds up very small. It's also waterproof.  My favorite thing about it is that it has a generous Velcro strip so you can adjust to your baby's neck size.  What I find from a lot of bibs is that I can't adjust it any smaller and the food ends up on the collar.  When you put this on baby, it also covers part of the shoulder area so if he rubs his face against his shoulders, you're still covered!  It's the little things that make moms appreciate this bib!	
- 1	The hammock was a waiste! Tried to use it, threw it out. The seat is not deep enough, my 4 months old is not even close to being covered by water, when he's on the &quot;infant side&quot;, but the other side is too upright for babies that already sit with no problems. I don't know if that actually works, he's not big enough yet. The tub doesn't really fit in either single or double sinks, we've tried both.I wish I knew which tub is better, so I could get it!	
1. 	I sit on the floor with my baby while she sits in the bumbo.  It has all the new safety straps, but if you are sitting on the floor and attending to your baby while she is in it, there is no reason to worry or use them.  If you are looking for a chair to keep your baby busy while you do chores around the house this is NOT the chair.  Great chair just follow the safety instructions.	
1. 	I ordered this gate to fit a 42 doorway and the product description states that it will fit a 42.5 doorway. When I received that gate in the mail and took out the instruction manual, it provided diagrams detailing how to use extensions to make the gate 39 and how to make the gate 49 (with extensions that are larger and not provided). I was ready to return the product but decided to take it out of the box and measure it and found that it actually does extend to 42.5 but that the manual just doesn't show this configuration of extensions. We have had to return several baby gates because they wouldn't work with our baseboards, but this worked like a charm. It's nice that you can either screw these into the wall or use the sticky tabs provided- I chose to use screws and the gate doesn't budge. It feels very strong and secure- not cheap at all. I'm happy with the purchase so far- will update it if we have any issues!	
- 1	I didn't particularly like this carrier and returned it. It's rather complicated to use and once I would figure it out and place my son in it, I didn't feel very confidant that he was secure. Reading other reviews however it seems like many people love it so perhaps it has to do something with my large boobs at the moment? I'm currently a 38F due to breast feeding. I got a Baby Bjorn instead and absolutely love it.	
- 1	When I ordered this, I ordered the wrong brush.  This brush is for wide mouth bottles -- standard size bottles are TOO SMALL and this brush will be hard to get into, and out of the bottle if you force it. Also, these are notorious for falling apart easily so buy more than one if you need it. I just ended up using the dishwasher for all of my son's bottle accessories.	
1. 	These nipples are perfect for breastfed babies taking their first bottles because the flow is slower than most Level 1 nipples.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	...and yet my lavender scented candles are all I smell. This is a simple, fast and effective way to dispose of the smelly's in your little one's pants. As long as you dispose of the sausage regularly, there shouldn't be a problem. (Especially afer you take them off the breast and start solids)	
- 1	It is both too long, too bulky, and too filled. I hated and could not get comfortable on this. Would not recommend	
1. 	Great product.  I love this and haven't had a problem changing my son yet.  The wipes are always nice and warm.  The only problem I have is the sponge thing on the bottem.  You are suppose to get it from drying out but I had a hard time keep it moist.  So I threw mine out and it still works for me.	
- 1	I think this was a nice try, but our baby did not like this and it was not like the breast at all. waste of money.	
- 1	After only one or two uses one of the male snaps on the front of the diaper used to size it stopped snapping so now my cover can only be sized in the largest setting for my medium sized baby. I'm disappointed because I keep hearing how great these wraps are. It's the second to last wrap that I go to in my stash, which ultimately means that I never use it. Hopefully I'll be able to get more use out of it when my baby is a large size, but for now it's a total bust. Boo!	
1. 	Cant live with out these! Although I wish I had color selection.. I ordered a 2nd one.. we use one at night and one for the diaper bag!  Both are Pink with Green tops.. not that it matters but I like the Green and blue one..Whoever invented this is a genius!	
- 1	I got this free when I purchased a Britax Boulevard 70, but do not use it with it. I'm usually driving so it would be useless for me to have this cupholder attached to the carseat in the back. I did use it for a while with my Valco Baby Tri-Mode EX stroller but it did not stay on very well. Any time I had a drink in it, I had to keep my hand on it as I pushed the stroller. Granted, it was not made for use with the Valco baby stroller, but what's the sense in getting a cupholder if you can use it only with a carseat? It's not as if I'm going to push my huge convertible carseat round with me! I've since gotten a Valco Baby Universal Cupholder, and it works much better!UPDATE September 2012----I don't usually reply to negative comments or remarks (for anyone, not only myself) but I feel the need to do so this time, especially since this is the first time I've gotten negative remarks . To all those folks who commented on my review-You're right, the cup holder was meant for the car seat, not for me. I was and still am a very sleep-deprived mama. Moreover, when I wrote the above review, my daughter had just been discharged from hospital after her second open heart surgery then subsequent re-admittance for severe dehydration resulting from the medications she'd been given. I was not paying attention to the name/intended purpose of the product. As my daughter never got her own bottle or cup whilst sitting in the car seat (she was always too weak to do so), it never occurred to me that THAT was the purpose of this cup holder. Therefore, let me rephrase my review: This cup holder was not very useful to me, the sole user of the product. However ,it works fine for the car seat, and offers another cup holder to the passenger sitting next to it.	
1. 	I got this for a friend's child and he loves it!  It saves the random tags around their house from getting destroyed too!  The ball itself has soothing pastel colors and is very soft.  Great for rolling or tossing.	
1. 	I have several cheap covers and didn't want to buy this, bc it's pricey. After 9 months of using a cheap cover, receiving blanket, and whatever I could find I finally decided to splurge! I borrowed a friends cover while we were out and had to have one! The quality is worth the price! My baby is super active now and using the cover I had just wasn't cutting it. My previous cover was made of cheap material and therefore flimsy. I love the weight of this material and the sewn on towels. Totally worth it and you'll save money if you just start off with this one!	
- 1	I purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my Delta Luv changing table, because there was no storage space on top. I had high hopes for it--Munchkin products are usually high in quality. However, the cloth on this organizer sags. When I tried to fill it with my wipes box, baby powder, and lotion--as shown in the picture--the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out. I wouldn't want a toddler getting near this organizer! A much safer option is the plastic Diaper Depot by Prince Lionheart.	
- 1	Nearly every one we had must have been defective. The frames bent easily and stayed bent (and yes, I know the sides are supposed to bend and then snap into position but it was more than that...they stayed bent).Also, if you put this up, plan on keeping it up. I would describe this more as a permanent solution rather than an easy to remove and put up travel gate. From the reviews here, it is clear that some people love this but it just didn't work for our lifestyle.Pre-tested before baby came as well as with a friend's baby. Totally frustrating and we followed the directions perfectly. As others have noted, the directions are not easy to follow and you have to practice to understand how to get this to work. Even so, after extending the top and bottom sides, placing the gate on the floor (a required step according to manufacturer instructions) and then locking it in place, we were extremely...well, grumpy. Further practice didn't make things any better. I would never use this as a portable baby gate!Uh-uh. Looking for something simpler. I would avoid using this after going through so many steps each time! Again, for a permanent or long-term gate (for crawlers to first walkers), this might work...as a travel gate, nope...not from what I experienced.	
1. 	I also purchased this exact item from Babies R Us for $16.99 only, so I would not recommend buying it for the $39.99 price. It seems like Amazon sells it for $13.99 only, but is currently out of stock, so if you can, wait for it to come back in stock or go to BRU instead!Like others have mentioned, my wedge is only one piece, not 2 with a cover and zipper or whatnot. There's nothing else that comes with the one wedge, and it does look exactly like the picture above. My son has only slept on it for a little while, so I can't say for sure if it's doing anything yet, but with his reflux and constant burping/spitting up even up to 1-2 hours after a nap, I don't think any sort of incline can hurt him at this point. I also use rolled up blankets to secure him in place, so he doesn't slide downwards, and it works just great.The wedge is a really sturdy piece of foam, and it almost matches the firmness of my son's crib mattress too, theColgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White, which is kind of nice. Overall, no complaints about this wedge. Not 100% sure if it works well yet, but for the price, I'm happy to try it out if it can do anything for my son's sleep.	
1. 	We have an old (1947) toilet that is round.  Our Toddler started playing in the toilet and I had to get a lock asap!!!  This one worked right from the start and we have been using it for a week now. Once I installed it correctly, it held firm to the bowl and has not moved around at all....we love it and feel more secure having it!	
1. 	I use these with my Medela pump. We love Avent bottles. I didn't want to buy Medela nipples and rings. Now I pump right into bottle and don't use bags. So much easier!	
1. 	We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.	
1. 	I was originally happy with my diaper bag purchase until after she was two months old.  The insulating side compartment suddenly ripped so the foil was just peeling off.  I didn't think I was particularly rough on the bag.  I tried emailing Columbia about it but they never wrote back.  I now have the Essentials Bag.  Another problem with this backpack is that the other pocket that is not insulated is very large and deep with netting.  When you put things in those pockets, you feel like they are lost forever.  It is a black hole!  Good luck if you get the bag.  Hope it works out for you.	
- 1	The brush is adorable and the boar's hair is soft and perfect for a baby's fine hair.  The only downside is the quality.  When I received it, I washed the bristles in luke warm water and mild soap and dried it, bristle side down, overnight.  The next day, I found the wood warped and cracked in two places.  I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange it because I figured they would all do that.  I read in another person's review that this had happened to theirs too but figured that it was just that particular brush or that they didn't follow the washing instructions properly, but it's actually the brush itself.  If I don't find another brand that I like just as much as this one, I'll buy another and try again.	
- 1	It works great, unfortunately both the ones we've bought have lasted 3 months before breaking off. Hoping to find something more durable now, although I guess it's ok for the price.	
1. 	I have tried several different kinds of bottles and this is by far my favorite. My son will use these as well as the Ventair Natural bottles, but these seem to give him less air therefore less spit-up. They're the easiest to put together as well. Cleaning them is easier then any other bottle. You can re-use the bottle itself and get a new, clean nipple for each feeding rather then having to get a new bottle and nipple since it takes liners. It may be a bit more expensive in the long run with having to buy liners, but it is far more convenient.	
1. 	This seat is a lifesaver for sure. My 3 month old gets mad if she's not sitting up looking around at everything, and if I didn't have this I'd never get anything done! She's a pretty big girl, but not really chunky. I could see her growing out of it by 4 months, but by then she'll be interested in toys and I'll put her in her saucer.Definitely worth the money, especially if you have skinny babies, but even if not	
- 1	These bottles are extremely frustrating. Sometimes they leak, other times they don't. And after trying all the suggestions to prevent and stop leaking to no avail, I'm giving up. Do not buy! I have used Born-Free bottles while working as a nanny and never once had to deal with a leak. I reccomend those instead.	
1. 	The velcro on the side is a great feature. These bibs worked well, we have them a few months later.	
1. 	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the Shop'n'Dine) didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.	
- 1	Not very smooth. We bought another that is one third the price that rocks so much better.  Do not buy	
- 1	We used the grovia liners at first, but decided to try these when we ran out because they were cheaper and had pretty good reviews. We hate them! They are so thin and soft that they basically fall apart when anything wet touches them, and we change diapers frequently. Solid material has actually broken through the middle of the liner because of the weight of it and the thinness of the material. Changing dirty diapers has become a messy ordeal, when these are supposed to simplify it. I reordered the grovia liners and will not be finishing this box.	
- 1	I didn't love this one. I never felt like it was getting the bottle totally clean and it doesn't come with its own holder.	
- 1	I was looking forward to using these bottles but when we tried them my baby did not like them. I also tried the first years breastflow bottles and she didn't like them either. I finally tried the Dr.Browns bottles and she took them right away, now I hope she wont reject nursing, we will see.	
- 1	I didn't really use this so it was a waste of money.  It took too long to wrap it around the body and get it on just right.  Would not recommed to anyone.  It was comfy to wear though.	
- 1	This item has a terrible mirror that presents a distorted fun-house type image.  I'm so glad that I saw one in person before ordering it online!	
1. 	fit very nicely.  I was nervous since the crib is smaller than a regular size crib but it fit just fine.	
- 1	PROS:-It's a placemat.CONS:-Doesn't stick to wood tables(I didn't think it would be a problem since our hook-on high chair would secure it to the table, but since it doesn't lay flat and sits off the table due to the suction cups underneath, our curious 7-month-old spent every meal pulling up the edges and trying to figure out how to get it to his mouth).-The cutesy little design is raised making a zillion nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in if you don't run the whole thing under water immediately after using (not practical with a hook-on high chair).-The reservoir doesn't interface well with a hook-on high chair, and doesn't interface with the Bjorn soft bibs.-Doesn't lay flat, even with hook-on high chair arms on top of it for 2 weeks.	
1. 	these bottles were recommended by our pediatricianthey really do help lessen swallowed air and in turn baby gaswhich helps lessen spit up	
1. 	This is a must for a bathroom with little space. Easy clean up!!  My son goes on it and he is 2 1/2 years old.	
- 1	We have been using this bed rail for a little over a month. It is a pain to use. Forget about trying to get it up when your child is already asleeep as it takes at least 10 minutes each night and you definitely can't do it in the dark. We thought it would get easier with use. Instead after a little over a month, the thing is broken. One side won't fold down. The other side, we were able to fold it down but can't get it up again. We spent 20 mintes trying to get this rail up last night and it would not work. I will be reporting this to their customer service to try to get a replacement or my money back.  I will update on that process. But needless to say, I would definitely not recommend this product.	
1. 	These put the cosleeper at just the right height for our bed. As other people have said, the leg extensions do make the cosleeper a little wobbly. To solve this, I make sure all the legs are pushed outward to where they seem as sturdy as possible. It helps to have carpeting. The extensions have fallen off when moving the cosleeper, but stay in place well otherwise. All in all, I'm glad this product was available as I love the Arm's Reach mini cosleeper and use it, and therefore the the leg extensions, every night.	
1. 	It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse. Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is. I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years. When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three. Just keep the smaller stature in mind.	
- 1	did not work at all in my son's room. Virtually had no smell or impact on the diaper smell in the room	
- 1	If you're a plus size gal at all, you probably wont like this product.  I didn't like it at all since my hips were wider than the product.	
- 1	Didn't work as described. It's a great idea, probably just needs additional research and engineering to deliver a product that does what it says.	
- 1	The bib is fine until your baby insists on feeding him/herself or spits food back out. Then it slides all the way down past the pocket and onto his/her diaper bulge and lap or pants or the highchair seat because the pocket doesn't stay open. The pocket only catches about 10% of whatever falls its way which still leaves me with a baby who needs a complete bath after EVERY meal, and a full change of clothes because the food has soaked through the pants and the bottom of her onesie down to her diaper!	
- 1	We really liked these for the first couple months we had them.  Then our daughter, who was about 16 months old at the time, learned that she could pull the straws out with a bit of effort.  Before that, they were great and kept leaks to a minimum.  Now... not so much.  Also, we've had several instances where the cup has dropped from 1-2 feet above the ground and the lid popped off, resulting in the entire cup spilling on the floor.It's time to toss the Take & Toss Straw Cups!	
1. 	This product isn't amazing, but it's worthwhile.I struggled to find something to use on the City Mini Double.  I kept coming across reviews for this.  It doesn't fit the city mini perfectly, but it works adequately.  It's a nice addition to the stroller so that we now have drink holders and a pocket to store keys, wallet, phone, or the like.  I don't know of a better product available for the city mini double, so I would buy this product again.	
1. 	The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short, so I needed something for my feet to rest on.  I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby.	
1. 	This pillow is a godsend for pregnant women.  It supports just about every part of the body that needs it and it's SO COMFORTABLE!The only complaint I have is that it takes up a lot of room so hubby doesn't have much room left in the bed!	
- 1	We have the OXO bottle brush at home, but my mom purchased the Munchkin brush for her house.  We were visiting her for a week and I could not wait to get home to my own brush.  The bristles are tough on the Munchkin brush.  The softer bristles on the OXO brush allowed me to get into the crevices of the nipple, thus more effectively cleaning the bottles and nipples.OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange	
1. 	Putting this on is a fun part of our bedtime routine. It is cute, warm, and I feel secure knowing my toddler won't trip. Also, I love that it keeps him warm, without me worrying about him kicking the blanket off. I also have a summer version in a ligher material.	
1. 	Our kid likes it.  The outside air-ring doesn't hold air but I don't think that matters at all.  The inner section is great for slapping and poking for a baby and it is fun to lay on the floor with him to play with.  If our house blew away in a hurricane, I'd buy another one.	
- 1	From the moment I assembled and installed this bed rail, it felt flimsy. I'd purchased a foldaway rail thinking it would make it easier to make my daughter's bed, but was wrong. The rail was so difficult to fold under that it wasn't worth folding it away; I'd just pull the bed away from the wall instead. Any attempt at folding it down would result in the cheap metal wheels that guide the rail popping off the cheap metal track. In less than six months, my two year old daughter had the rail bent and finally snapped the cheap wheel right off the rail itself. Despite installing it correctly, my daughter would still manage to push it away from the bed enough that she could have fallen through. This thing just ended up in the trash, what a waste of money.Save yourself the headache. If you have to have a safety rail, just get a rail that is solid and doesn't fold away or purchase a less expensive bolster that fits under the sheets. This one is crap.	
- 1	Well it does work-ish.  The only part that gets warm is the lid so you get 1 wipe, maybe 2 that is warm.  Also the wipe cools off extremely fast, it needs to be straight from the lid onto the butt or its completely ineffective.  We no longer use it at all.	
1. 	It does its job. I like the straps that keep it in place. This is durable and keeps your little one from falling out of bed. Also love the mesh if my little one ends up face into it while rolling over.	
1. 	Used this on a JEEP TWIN UMBRELLA stroller when we went to Disney World. When going to any theme park a sunshade on your stroller is a MUST. Now, because our double umbrella and many others does not have very sturdy canopies, there is really nothing for the sunshade to rest on across the top when you tie the ends down to the stroller. We actually placed the top middle part of the shade OVER the middle handle on the stroller (the jeep double umbrella has 3 handles to push with across the top). By using the center handle as a support this sunshade was awesome. If you have a different double umbrella with better shades (like the McClaren which I think is the one pictured), the shade will be supported by those smaller shades.	
- 1	This could have been my fault BUT I do not wash this crib sheet with anything else and it came out with bright pink stains! Next time I will just buy crib sheets from Target.	
- 1	I guess I didn't read the specs on this one.  Really small ball.  My one year old boys can't find half the time. Dont think I would buy again.	
1. 	These replacement caps do exactly as they say they will do.  We didnt have enough caps to fit the amount of bottles and these were just an addition.	
- 1	This is a flimsy seat and the back falls off if you move it. There is almost no side-impact protection. I would not buy this seat.  We wanted a good, high-back booster for a 9-year-old and went with the Recaro brand. WHAT a difference for not much more money!Also, this seat does not latch so you have to buckle in the empty seat every single time your child is not in it, or it could be a projectile in a crash.And it's very hard to put the back on! If you do use this, please do so for ages 6 and up only (maybe 5 if the child is mature and sits properly). Preschoolers are not safe in boosters!	
- 1	I decided to purchase these stickers for my son's nursery. When my husband and I received them, we thought they were adorable, but we had two problems: 1) they STUNK, and even though we aired them out, they still smelled toxic, and 2) they were NOT fabric like we had read in the description. I thought it would have been cute and clever to have fabric wall decorations for the nursery, but they were just plastic like every other sticker. When we contacted the company, they were very curt with us, too, which did not help out our experience. We ended up returning them (paying for shipping back and losing the shipping we spent for them to get to us) and going elsewhere. Two stars simply because the stickers are quite cute.	
1. 	I purchased this for the changing table I bought at a yard sale for my grand baby. I love the way it fit so perfectly on the table. I also love the curve it has on the side so the baby would not roll into the table railing and has a seatbelt to. lol Highly recommend this item.	
1. 	These shields are ideal for women who are having pain as they pump with the regular shields. It was clear to me that I shouldn't be in pain while pumping and after researching a bit on the shields my thoughts were confirmed when I realized that the mediums were suctioning more than just my nipple. Now I'm pumping comfortably!	
1. 	My baby loves this...we hang it from his play gym to keep it interesting.  It appears very well made and gives him a new texture/weight of toy to play with.	
1. 	We like these so much we have two sets. One for the tub and one for the toy box/travel. My 10 month old likes the holes in the bottom when we play with these in the tub and she like to knock them down when you stack them on the floor. Lately she's figure out how to stack them inside of each other. Great, simple, inexpensive learning toy. :)	
1. 	The one down-side to this is that it doesn't stick well on some table surfaces.  It works great on some, and on others the suctions don't want to stick for anything (even wetting them as some suggested).  Besides that, this is a great &#34;plate&#34; for our 18-mo. old while out and about at friends' or restaurants.  It rolls up nicely and cleans off easily.	
- 1	Money wasted. I bought 4. The pink one is hard to find too so she's stuck on the green ones.	
- 1	I put this thermometer on my baby registry and have found that the reading varies by as much as 3-5 degrees (when taken repeatedly in the same few minutes, the exact same way) and typically is no where close to what a rectal reading ends up being (at least 2 degrees off).It could be that I don't know how to use it correctly, but my husband and I both read the directions and tried multiple times - so even if it's user error, I give it 1 start because it just shouldn't be that difficult.Have used with adults and the same thing happened. When compared to oral thermometer, which seemed far more accurate - it was completely off mark.	
- 1	This monitor is awful. All I hear is static. The threshold for hearing baby is quite high (meaning he has to make a lot of noise before I hear him). With my old monitor, I could hear every sound without static, but it was unreliable, while this one is quite reliable so far. It doesn't switch channels or beep incessantly like my old monitor. But for it's primary purpose, to pick up and transmit sound, it fails miserably.
