- 1	I was expecting a necklace that I would wear for my daughter to use while teething. When it arrived, I realized it must be for the baby; however, it was too small even for her.  I plan to return it.  I was disappointed having read so many positive reviews & being eager to try it...	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. this does not work. I ordered it to replace that horrible bulb but it does get anything out of my baby's nose! Had to go back to the bulb	
1. 	with our first kid we had so many cutesy bibs. most of the time the bottle would soak through them, which inevitably stained the clothing. with the second kid I decided to get a pack of these to supplement. they have been so good I went back, ordered two more packs, and am ditching the other bibs which are worthless.	
1. 	Easy to install and works great for the price. Keeps my dogs at bay and my baby safe. I hate the bar on the bottom though and the opening is pretty skinny.	
1. 	This is a great shopping cart cover.  I love how easy it is to use.  I can hold the baby and arrange this quickly with one hand.  My baby is very happy in it and it gives me peace of mind that she's not touching a germy cart.  Its very well padded and folds up so quickly when done with shopping.	
- 1	I sheepishly admit to buying the Adiri Bottle for its design value first, effectiveness second. That being said, it's the first bottle we've tried, so we don't have much to compare it to, but pleasantly, it works well for us. I like the top being more breast-like in look and feel (for a hesitant one-month old baby that initially gave it the stink eye, but warmed up to it after a few minutes), and whether the petals are good in terms of baby taking less air (compared to other bottles), again unsure. But it does cause more burping than from the breast. A big turnoff for some will be that the bottle can't go into a bottle warmer (because the air valve at bottom will leak and/or the size of bottle), but we often store our milk in the breast-pump bottles or snappies containers and use these with the warmer.Addendum: After a few months (month 6), the babe drank less and less milk. I thought it was possibly a self-weaning, but turns out it was the bottle that was the problem. We switched to Born Free Glass Bottles and the babe seems to like this much better and  thankfully daily milk consumption went from 2oz to 23oz. Now I know why parents seem to have some many brands of the same stuff. . . . sometimes the babe just doesn't like it and parents are forced to try another . . . and another.  This was just my kid's experience. Yours might be different.	
- 1	I followed the instructions for making the written names &#34;permanent&#34; but they didn't stay. I didn't even wash them after the first time! I still use the bands on their cups, and rewrite their names periodically. Disappointed!	
- 1	These are CRAP... great concept but the tape doesn't stay put. I just pushed the door (pretty lightly) and it popped right off- after giving it 24hrs to dry- lol. So it popped off and took some paint with it... my friends 2yr old could have opened the door no issue with this thing installed (she's a great trial in knowing what we need to baby proof!). I knew it was a risk- as it seemed too good to be true- but figured it was worth a shot for something so cheap. Have to find another product now... oh well. Live and learn ;)There is not other way to install- we could drill a hole, but don't really want a hole in my closet door- besides, it's a hallow door so it wouldn't work anyway. And you could maybe super glue it... but how long would that last?	
1. 	A great product, well-made and well-priced.  They're titled &#34;take & toss&#34;.  The &#34;take' makes sense as they are inexpensive and loosing one would be merely inconvenient.  But as to &#34;toss&#34; I find washing and keeping a much more reasonable approach.  A nice product.	
1. 	With my new baby I decided to buy these over diaper pails because I did not want to worry about having something else to clean and take care of. I am so happy with my decision! These bags mask the dirty diaper smell perfect! I keep some in my diaper bag and never had any problems with odors!	
1. 	My son quickly figured out how to pull out the standard plug protectors.  This one works well for our little guy.  I have an older home so one or two of my plates weren't replaceable with these since they didn't quite line up right.  But everywhere I've used them my son has been unsuccessful and has quickly lost interest in the outlets.	
- 1	I thought the fabric on this felt cheap and the black &#34;leather&#34; parts were very obvious that they were plastic (and cheap thin plastic at that).  All in all, I was very disappointed with this product and returned it.	
- 1	My son is now 11 months old and I have been using this tub since he was 5 weeks old.  In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.  I will not be using this tub for my next child.	
- 1	My 6 month old loved it, but poor quality for three reasons:1.  He could pull it off of the base too easily so it was always on the floor.2.  The paint on the clear wings is easily chewed off.  Sorry, paint does not count as solid food!3.  The suction was inconsistent. Once an area it would stick to was found, I was fearful of moving cause it was temperamental.	
- 1	My son hates being covered when breast-feeding so this was a waste of money for us in that respect, but even if he had liked it, I wouldn't have. I'm large-chested so would make seeing what I'm doing practically impossible, even with the stiff top designed to give you some idea of what's happening down there. Plus, the fabric is thin, stiff, and cheap feeling, even after washing as some reviewers suggested doing.I've found most people don't care that you're breastfeeding so I don't usually even bother to cover up, but if I do, I just use a lightweight swaddling blanket to cover the majority of my breast that's exposed, rather than covering my baby's face. Know what works for you before you buy a cover like this.	
- 1	I was looking for a spoon for our little one and I thought these would be amazing, and I was extremely disappointed.The rubber that was attached to the spoon was coming apart. When we got them I washed them and after I washed them I inspected them and noticed that the rubber on one was already peeling back from the metal. I did not even use these. I didn't feel that they were safe for a baby; if the rubber was already peeling back and they hadn't even been used yet, what was going to happen after these spoons are used all the time? I didn't think they were a safe purchase.Instead I went with another plastic spoon; not what I was looking for but a safer option.	
- 1	I agree with previous reviewers.  Anything that is designed to catch baby poop and pee should be able to go in the washer AND dryer on regular settings.  I'm just not going to run a delicate cycle and air dry CHANGING PAD LINERS?  These were a total waste of money.  I ended up purchasing Dynarex Disposable Underpad, 17 inches X 24 inches, 100 Count and love them.  They are the perfect fit for my changing table and no laundry required.  I don't change them out every diaper, just when I need to - so they are going to last a long time.	
1. 	This chari is VERY convenient for carrying around.  It fold and is light weight.  Also, it ties securely to every seat we have used.  The down side is that the seat is made of cloth, so the baby sinks in a little and it is not always the most condusive seating position for eating.  Putting a towel under our daughter has helped prop her up.	
- 1	Lansinoh manual hand pump offers little suction.  I tried it with and without the silicone insert, and there is little suction.  A few times, I pumped nothing.  However, if you are engorged with milk, this could prove to be useful (but so could expressing milk by hand).  The manual pump is not useful for those with poor milk production.  It does not compare to the $1800 hospital pumps.	
1. 	This is suppose to latch onto your changing table.  Instead I use it as a car seat toy when we are sitting around or walking in the stroller.  We are not on the table long enough for them to enjoy it there.  Very nice no batteries needed but you do need to wind it up a bunch of times.  If you have a toddler in the house this is a great job for them.	
- 1	I purchased these after a lot of research. I was so unhappy with the plastic bottles, they leak, and for the price I paid, they should have been the best. I would not recommend them to anyone.	
- 1	This food processor will be good for making food for older babies who can handle chunkier textures. The blade is so small and there's not a lot of horsepower in it. So beware! It does indeed leave big chunks of food. So if you're looking for something that will make a smooth puree for your baby, this is not for you. You have to be willing to scan the food and toss or mash the big chunks. And the steamer function? It's a joke. You'll have to run the steamer a few times before the food actually cooks or softens.The only benefit I see of this product is when the baby is older and can chew or handle thicker textures. It's just helpful in that it's a smaller food processor than your bigger blender/processor, so that you can maybe save on counter space?	
1. 	My wife and I bought some name brand bags that were between 30-60 count, and about twice the price as these... why we did I don't know... Poop goes in these... POOP. they are sturdy, and seal well when you tie them... they don't do your taxes which i almost knocked a star off for, but its not in the products description to.	
1. 	I was unsure whether to get the small wheely or large and am so glad I got the small.  It is the perfect size for a toddler. We got it for my niece on her 1st birthday. She has been using it for a year now and still has fun rolling across their floors. They have hardwoods so it is perfect. No scratches on their floors from it either. I recommend this size for younger toddlers.	
1. 	We were looking for something to cover the catwalk at the top of our staircase/hallway, but we wanted something that wasn't an eye sore!  And, this was it.  It was very easy to use/install.  My husband just measured, cut and hung it up with zip ties.  Nobody can even see it!  We also made a cover for the fireplace, which we used with some strong Velcro-like stuff we got at the drug store.  And, we did the same with our glass shelved entertainment center to keep our little guy out of the electronics.  He still likes to get up there and bang on the plastic, but it's harmless.  This product is awesome and I've recommended it to a couple other people I know who are in the baby proofing stage.	
- 1	I bought this seat for my 2 year old son who is just beginning to potty train. I already had a Baby Bjorn toilet seat but he didn't seem to like it. I thought this one might be better since it seems like it would be a little more enclosed around his body and maybe make him feel more secure while sitting up high on the toilet.TO use this seat you have to lift up the regular toilet seat and position this one the rim of the toilet, then lower the toilet seat back down over it. Not difficult but you have to be careful not to let it slide down into the toilet bowl. This also means that to take it off you have to do the same thing. A lot more work than my Baby Bjorn where you just lift it right off.On our toilet, the seat shifted a lot. There isn't any way to secure it to the toilet like there is with the Baby Bjorn. The only thing holding it on is the actual toilet seat itself so there is no way to stop the shifting.Another thing I found out was that my son couldn't get onto this seat alone. Because of the high pee guard on the front, he has to be lifted up onto the seat. If you want your child to be able to use the seat by himself, this one probably won't work.Now that my son has more confidence on the potty we are using the Baby Bjorn again...it's a much better seat and well worth the extra money!FYI:  This seat WILL NOT work on a ROUND toilet bowl. It has to be an ELONGATED bowl.I didn't like this seat and we don't use it anymore. I recommend putting your money into the Baby Bjorn seat.	
- 1	Thin, cheap material that does not look like it will stand even one washing. I had bought this because it was a two-pack and the price was reasonable, but I knew as soon as I opened the package that it would be going back. On top of that, it didn't really fit my LA Baby four-sided 32 inch long contoured changing pad very well (and the description states it will fit a 32 inch pad). Usually I take one-star reviews with a grain of salt, but this product is one of the most poorly manufactured items I have purchased and definitely merits no more than a single star (made in China, fyi). Not recommended.	
1. 	These are almost too nice to &#34;toss&#34;, unless you really had to. They go nicely thru the dishwasher so haven't tossed any yet. Very easy to hold, colorful, and sturdy.	
- 1	Bought the sippy cup but when I received it and inspected the inside, I found a small strand of hair had &#34;melted&#34; into the plastic. Im assuming that this must have occurred during the manufacturing process, but nevertheless, is disgusting and i will not be using this product!Also, the cup leaks from the lid.	
1. 	When my daughter was younger,she was a runner, and FAST. She could dart away in a second. Holding her hand tighter never worked, and twice resulted in injury to the escaping child (who would wrench her hand away with such force, she dislocated her elbow and shoulder, on separate occasions). She was able to get out of the stroller and shopping carts as well. My sweet baby was exhausting, in her Houdini antics. To her, it was all fun and games. To me, every outing was stressful in the extreme. Even with a 2nd adult, she'd manage to get away.Enter Mommy's Helper; She had her freedom, and I was able to keep her safely by my side. In fact, with this harness on, she no longer felt the need to run off, because she could indulge her desire for independence while still remaining safe.  Any time a passer-by asked her if she was Mommy's Helper, she would literally beam with pride, and nod, making it very easy to get her to put it on for trips to the grocery store.Her sister never needed a harness, because she was content to sit in a cart or stroller, hold my hand while walking, or be carried, and never left my side out in public. If SHE had been my first (or only) child, I might not have understood why parents use these. But their little brother.... wow - he's not even walking, and it's already clear that we'll be dusting off Mommy's Helper once again, as soon as he is.And to the VERY rare person who made rude comments to me when we used this, I always sweetly replied, better on a leash than a milk carton. Or the grille of an oncoming car.	
1. 	We love this nightlight.  I got it for our six month old (now 15months) and he loves looking at the stars.  When we first turned it on he was looking all over trying to see them all.  We recently moved him from our room to his own and I might have to buy another one for my room because I really liked looking at the stars as I was falling asleep too :)  The battery lasts a pretty long time and it has a timer on it which is really nice. The only things that would make it better is if there was an ac adapter so it doesnt have to run on batteries and if it rotated.  Other than that we love it!	
1. 	during those early months it is so nice to have the baby safely sleeping next to you in the co sleeper.  it is of good quality and converts into a 'pack n play' when your baby gets more mobile/crawling.  we use it as a crib, still next to our bed, even in the pack n play mode. our son loves it still, at 8 months old. the attached side pockets (3 of them) are great for storing blankets, pacifiers, burp cloths, etc.  the only downsides are the same with all 'pack n plays': they are a pain to break down and put back together.  after doing it for the 10th time you get the hang of it, but this is the case will all play yards.  if you are using this exclusively as a crib for you baby but would also like to go places and take a pack n play, i honestly recommend getting a cheap/used pack n play for travel so that you dont have to do this with 'their bed' every time you go somewhere.  we are very happy with ours and will use it for future babies as well.  p.s.  purchase pack n play waterproof covers for the mattress to protect it from diaper leaks, etc! :)	
- 1	I had already purchased the Inglesina Fast Chair.  Our daughter has been using the Fast Chair since about four months and loves sitting in it.  We get compliments on it when we are in restaurants and its fairly easy to clamp on with big rubber top and bottom clamps to protect tables.But we decided that we'd probably prefer a snap on table with a tray as our daughter enters the messy-eating-by-herself stage.  Enter the P&T; Lobster.  The P&T; looks more stylish, is sleek, and has some serious clamp-on ability -- I certainly liked it better than the Inglesina.  The only problem I had is that my daughter didn't!  She's now 8 months old and a little over 26 inches tall.  When she sits in the Inglesina she can easily see and manipulate items on the table in front of her, rest her arms on the chair sides, etc.  There is still room to grow but she fits in it.  In the P&T; Lobster, the seat is so deep that she was drowning in it and while her head was still higher than the table top, she could no longer see things as well to interact with them.  As a result, she doesn't like being in the chair and we've had to return it.It's possible the P&T; will work beautifully for older children, but for our sizeable 8 month old, it was just too deep.One last thing, while this chair does have a tray, the tray simply slides in (and back out!) easily and has pretty small sides for holding food in.  I didn't see a way to clip it to the chair or cause it to stay put when you have a wiggling kid trying to move everything around.  It didn't strike me as a particularly solid or useful tray.  I'm going with a tinydiner mat and the Inglesina for now until I find something better.	
1. 	Finally switched my 14-month-old to these (after using the NUK silicone spouts with regular bottles to ease transition) and I LOVE them! Did a lot of research on which sippy cups to get and these do not disappoint. I can throw one in my purse without worrying--NO LEAKS! It does take some determination for my kid to get the liquid out, but she eventually figured it out and now has no trouble. Same goes for grasping. Just took a day or two. Did I mention no leaks?? Highly recommended!!	
1. 	My son and I love this potty. I never had a hard time training him to use it. In fact, I only told him once what to do, and he was using it since then. He seems to be very comfortable with it that he seems to actually enjoy sitting on it while making poo and playing his toy ramp & cars at the same time. He also likes using it without doing something else so I know its not about the toy. He loves that he can be independent & his potty makes him feel that. My son is 2 years old and weighs 32 lbs. Cleaning is also very easy, even without a liner. This happens when my son would use the potty on his own without a liner. I only have good words to say about this potty. I have no complaints at all.	
1. 	It arrived fast, it was easy to install and easy to use, I can finally feel safe.	
- 1	If you buy the Medela Quick Steam bags this really isn't needed - everything can go in the steam bag, dishwasher, or be washed by hand.  It's bulky and we literally haven't used it once.	
1. 	Before we found this, brushing our baby's teeth was a struggle. But she actually enjoys it when we brush her teeth with this toothbrush. Definitely recommend this!	
- 1	I thought this would be great to get my almost 3 year old to start using the potty. but after 1 day it woulnt shut up. and even thru the night it kept talking. No where in the directions does it say how to turn off . so finally i had to take batteries out. returned the item for a refund. how dissapointing.	
1. 	I love these storage bottles! I bought two packs, one pack i froze the milk in the bottles and the second pack i use to pump into and dump the contents out into breast milk storage bags; since the storage bags are cheaper and take up less room in my freezer. These are a must for any pumping mother.	
- 1	I randomly got pink, which my 15 month old son doesn't really care about.  The spoon is really flat so it doesn't actually hold food very well; either the food won't get onto the spoon and I end up pushing it on with my finger or it just falls off once it is on.  The fork doesn't really spear food either, so I end up having to put food on the tines with my fingers.  Feeding toddlers is really messy, but these require a lot of messy work on my part to get the food into him!  Got some mini forks and spoons elsewhere that do the trick (meant for super-fancy table settings)	
1. 	This is SO much easier to bath my little boy in than the big tub. He loves to splash in it and can even lounge on the duck tail when he feels like it. There are a few down sides, though. I was expecting it to be a little bigger than it actually is. My baby is 28 inches long and when sitting in the back (by the tail), his feet almost touch the front of the duck. I was really disappointed about this. That means we can only use it for a few more months before it will have to retire. Another thing, by looking at the pictures, I thought maybe the blue part on the inside of the duck changed color from blue to white if the water was too hot, but no. That's not the case. There's a little blue circle on the bottom of the tub that says 'HOT' and you can only see it if the water is hot (obviously). You have the option to hang the tub up with a little suction cup on the bottom, but I haven't had any luck getting it to stay. Our bathroom (and apartment in general) is pretty small, and the duck, when blown up, is pretty big. It takes up a lot of space, and I really don't want to have to blow it up every night to give the boy his bath. We still haven't found a place to put it. Anyway, overall, I think this was a great purchase for the time being!	
- 1	I bought this thinking it was perfect to match my son's nursery and although it worked well in his room, it was lop-sided when I originally set it up. After six months of use, it fell apart completely! Although this hamper is cheap, it isn't even worth the money paid for it. Now I have to go buy a more expensive one, hoping it will last longer than this one.	
- 1	Great little night light WHEN it works! Just stopped working after a few months.... very upset. Called Amazon and they replaced it but now how long will the new one last?! What a shame :(	
- 1	I thought that these would be good since they were plastic and they would bother her new little teeth. However, the dip in the spoon is a little deep and the food does not come off of it when feeding. She loves chewing on the handle but I will be purchasing different spoons for feeding.	
- 1	Originally I loved the idea of being able to see at a glance whether the room was the correct temperature, and overall the look is very pleasing. But these are my issues with it:- Like other reviewers have mentioned, I do not think it is accurate. We also have a baby monitor that shows the temperature on the parent handsets, and they are rarely the same. I think the baby monitor shows the true temperature as it matches the aircon unit display.- I only have one shelf surface suitable for this thermometer, so it is placed about 1 ft from a lamp. If the lamp is on, this affects the thermometer. Not very useful.- Because of its basic design, you cannot program the temperature boundaries, which would be a nice feature. Personally I like the nursery to be around 69/70 degrees but according to this thermometer, that is too hot.- The thermometer doesn't seem to register some numbers. Like 68 degrees, for example. So it flips between 67 and 69, which happens to be over a color change point. So the egg has a mini disco light display for a while, fighting an internal battle to show 68. To be honest I'm not sure that it bothers my baby (who is 3m) but I find it VERY irritating when I am doing night feeds.So its a shame really. I haven't returned it only because the baby monitor I have doesn't show the temperature on the nursery unit, only on the handsets. So this is better than nothing. For now.	
1. 	This is a very nice cover and has been very easy to use.  I like the terry cloth padding provided on the corners of this nursing cover.  It has been very handy when you need something to wipe your babies mouth quickly.	
- 1	I purchased this Temporal Thermometer as a present for my wife, who is an ER RN is the Los Angeles area. We had been looking for about a week for a dependable and consistent thermometer for our child when I broke down a few days from her birthday and got this.When she saw the device she was pretty unhappy about it as she had been forced for over a week to use these devices at her work, which proved to be more trouble and a larger headache in the institutional setting then they were worth. All of the Temporal Thermometers were tossed into a box and collected up and either most likely returned for a credit or tossed. Time is of the essence.But I was intrigued and opened the package anyway and we experimented and test-ran this thermometer for about a month side by side with another thermometer, theBraun Thermoscan. I saw exactly the same results that she dealt with at her work. Here are some examples of the inconsistency:1. Have a temperature or a fever? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings by more than one-point-five and sometime two-point-five degrees, which is huge.2. Moisture on forehead ... from the fever ...? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings.3. Head angle and forehead shape will dictate whether or not the device will even work.4. Different degrees register on different portions of the same forehead.5. Different degrees register with darker skin(!) That's the first time for that one.Some of the reviews tell you that you need to practice with the device and develop a technique, which is absolutely absurd. What? You're supposed to go around the neighborhood interfering with other parents when their kids are sick to work on your 'technique'? Gimme a break, please. It's a thermometer , it should work and work consistently. Unfortunately it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and therefore Exergen should take this product back to the drawing board and also remove the labeling on the front about how it's the most accurate, which it is very clearly not.I openly suspect a lot of these positive five-star reviews of this product have been placed by people directly related with this company as an ad effort. And coming from a long-time review on Amazon, this kind of thing is more rampant than you might think.Don't buy this, getting your money back will be harder then taking a temp.... ...	
- 1	I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.	
- 1	I did not buy this camera from Amazon but wanted to share my disappointment with others looking for a reliable video baby monitor. We received this monitor in October 2012. I loved how clear the picture was, the range was decent, and the additional cameras are convenient. However, after 6 months, the sound stopped working. Motorola sent me a replacement. About 1 1/2 months later, the sound on THAT unit stopped working. Motorola sent me a replacement. Not even 1 month later, and the sound on THIS unit has stopped working. I continue to have it replaced since it's still under warranty (rather than pay another $200 for a new system), but I suspect they are sending refurbished units as the replacements, which is why the life of the product has dropped dramatically. I'm really disappointed and, obviously, frustrated.	
1. 	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.	
1. 	I'm just worried for when i need to remove it! I might be purchasing new tables?  I even used it on a wall corner near the play area.  Stays fine. My son even tried chewing on it w his new sharp teeth. It held up. He was not able to puncture it!	
- 1	Loved this product until it quit working.  I was careful to make sure the unit motor was not submerged EVER.  We turned it off after bath.  It probably ran for a total of 10 hours before burning out.  In the trash it goes.  :(	
1. 	While trying to decide what kind of portable bed to get my almost 3 year old daughter, I was looking at a few different things.  The toddler air mattresses with raised sides, the pea pod plus, and cots like this one.  I was concerned about the weight of the air mattress when deflated.  Wasn't sure if she'd like the tent feature of the pea pod plus.  And then I found this cot.  At 1/4 of the price of the others and how quick and easy it is to set up (2 seconds, not joking), I gave it a try and I'm SO glad I did!Like I said, it's super easy to set up.  Slip it out of its carry bag (also a plus) and just pull it open.  Ready for sleep!It comes with a sheet which is nice, but I only used it once.  My daughter does tend to get colder while sleeping on this.  I put on a crib mattress pad and a flanel crib sheet and this seems to have taken are of that problem.  Bonus - even with the crib mattress pad and crib sheet, it will fold up and fit in its carry bag no problem!!The support strap in the middle underneath hasn't given my daughter any problems yet and even if it does later, then I guess it will be time for a different type of travel bed.  It will still have been well worth the $20!!My daughter calls it her blue bed and constantly asks to sleep on it even while at home.My nieces have all loved sitting on it to watch tv or play and their ages are 2, 4, and 7.  The 7 year old was much too big for it to lay down on but still liked to sit on it.Very pleased.  As someone who frequently travels with my daughter by myself, it is so much easier with this cot!!!  The pack n play was just too heavy and took up too much room.  This will actually fit in a large suitcase!Also, on the box, the weight says up to 75 pounds.	
1. 	I used this at 3.5 weeks on my newborn daughter. She is more vocal than my first 2 babies...she cries alot. I ordered this chair and didn't know what to expect. I mainly ordered it for a chair to put her in, when things get hectic, with 2 other toddlers in my house. I use this chair all day long. My newborn was naturally gassy and uncomfortable from the get go...no matter how many diaper changes and feedings. I put her in this chair and turn on the vibrating mode, and with my foot I will rock it. WORKS LIKE A CHARM EVERYTIME!!!!! She will sleep in this chair too....for a long time. She is now 6 weeks old...and I am rocking it with my foot while typing this on my laptop. She is so calm and peaceful. It is so much better than holding her and rocking her in our rocking chair than disturbing her when I try to lay her down out of my arms. I can carry her in the chair undisturbed anywhere in the house and she won't wake up....the chair is soooo light weight, but built ergonomically well. The cover is removable thank god! My newborn has had so many explosions in her diaper while in her chair. Thank you so much for making this. LOVE IT! The only critical thing I can say is that I like that the toy bar is easily removable...but I wished it swivled away to the side than attaching in front. I had to remove it and store it away because it got in the way when removing and placing my baby in it. PS.....the 1 D batteries required for this last longer than expected. I will leave the chair on for 4 hours on vibrate at a time, sometimes more b/c I forget to turn it off. It is working really well for us. :)))	
- 1	I needed a monitor for my child's room who is about to transition from a crib to a bed.  The video is grainy in any light.  At night, I couldn't tell if my child was standing up and moving or if it was just the video pixelating.  The video would go in and out and while I could see my child crying, I wouldn't hear it on the monitor sometimes.  Very frustrating and promptly returning.  The loud beeping when it was out of battery after 2 hours was also very annoying.  No mute on that.  Bought the Lorex LW2004 instead and the video quality is far superior in the dark and all the functions actually work on it.	
- 1	The large size of these wearable blankets is a nice idea in theory, but poor in practice. At the age where this size is appropriate (18-24 pounds), children are moving on their own (even in the crib), and the extra floppiness just gets in the way, while the enclosed feet just tended to frustrate my daughter. To make it worse, the opening to one sleeve of this garment was half the size of the other, and her arm didn't fit through properly without a few alterations (I shouldn't need a seam ripper and a sewing machine to get a product this expensive just to function).I can understand this company's products for newborns and younger infants. Swaddling makes sense when kids are that young. But as children approach a year, this product really isn't necessary or all that helpful. Or even made well, in the case of the one I received.	
1. 	just a side note, the small fit my son up until he was about 7 months 1 week old. we bought the medium hoping it would be good and it wasnt... it is GREAT! there is plenty of room for him to grow in it and its long. if you live in a colder climate i would suggest at least a long sleeve onsie on under it like we use. our baby is a heat machine so he gets too warm in these with pjs on under it but too cold with just a onsie or pjs. great alternative to a blanket and much safer	
- 1	My daughter, at 12 weeks, was able to totally unswaddle herself using the swaddleme that we had been using since birth, yet she still needed to be swaddled to fall asleep.  She can't seem to calm down without being swaddled and she claws at her face which wakes her up.  Everyone I knew told me to get the miracle blanket and it would solve all my problems.  Maybe if we had used this from birth she would have been okay with it.  But, she hated having her arms tucked under the folds, screamed like crazy, and even though they were tucked under, she was still able to bring them up and out of the blanket, with the folds still around them.  It didn't take her long to get out of this blanket.  So we got one hour out of it.  We switched to the Halo that she can move her arms around in but still can't get them up out of the fabric to her face.	
1. 	This thing is a must have for all new moms! They may be a bit pricey, but they are worth every cent and then some!Its of the highest quality also, this I know for a fact. The one I use for my son, was actually my nieces. She used it 5 years ago and  my friend used it for her son 3 years ago. So mine is a little more than 5 years old, has been through 3 babies and after putting it threw the wash it still looks brand new! I plan on saving it for my next baby! =)	
1. 	We got this product for our baby shower and used it from our baby's birth till he was 5 months old and started trying to get out of it.I was at first concerned that it is so primitive, just gliding back and forth and it does not have vibration, but our baby never liked vibration and he would fall asleep in the glider and stay there for long-long time.We absolutely love it!  The batteries it came with lasted all 5 months and sometimes our baby was in the glider for several hours a day.  It is a great advantage that it does not need to be plugged in the wall so you can move it to whatever room you want.I only give it 4 stars because the safety belt got small for our son very soon and we stopped using it.  Not a problem for us, but some people may want to know about it.	
1. 	I bought one of these for my Graco Pack 'n Play and one for the mattress of a cradle that's been in my mother-in-law's family for generations.  The pad fit each mattress equally well, is nice and thick without being too soft, and stays put (so far!).  I don't have a wriggly baby yet, but I believe the pad will hold its position well.  I'm very pleased with the roominess of the pockets and the tension of the elastic.  A good solid product for the money.	
1. 	I actually read reviews from other sources (like consumer reports and such) before I bought this gate. This is rated the top gate for the top of the stairs. My husband installed the gate with no problems, although we did use larger screws than the ones that came with it, and we made sure it was screwed into a stud. The locking mechanism isn't the most convenient (it doesn't lock automatically when swung shut), but it is secure and sturdy. My two-year-old cannot unlock this gate, but his 6-year-old cousin was able to, which is fine because a 6-year-old won't fall down the stairs! We had the problem of a gap in between the gate and the top stair just because of the location of the stud, but the gap is not large enough to crawl through or get stuck in. We also purchased the accompanying kit that connects the gate to a wooden banister, preventing damage. If you don't purchase any extra supplies (either the kidco kit or your own hardware), both ends will screw into the wall and/or banister. Overall, I think this was a great purchase. I know my son and soon-to-be-crawling daughter will not be able to get down the stairs!	
1. 	Love it. Though it may not fit every child it fit my tall chubby munchkin perfectly. The velcro stays stuck in place in the wash of whatever water temperature and stains come off easily I didn't have to pre-treat or anything. I like how durable the material is - a little rubbery between 2 fabric laminates so it stretches a little for a snug fit. At first I was apprehensive the stiffer than normal material might be uncomfortable to baby but to my surprise it actually conforms to his body shape pretty well. Just wished it came in a one-size cover so it would have a longer useful life span. Have had this for several months now zero leakage and the only cover that has its leg elastics intact when washed with hot water.	
- 1	I purchased these for my daughter to use in the baby's room because they matched the bedding set and other items she'd chosen.  Overpriced is the least of the complaints I have about these. The colors are muddy compared to the bedding and the vinyl smell is overpowering.  I opened the package and set them out to air for 3 weeks before giving them to the kids to put up in the baby's room.  They set them out on a countertop to straighten the folds out and the cheap vinyl odor was still so bad it dominated any room they were in.  Noxious as the smell is, I suspect it's probably giving off some kind of airborne pollutants that are not healthy for a newborn to be exposed to.  Needless to say, they haven't been used.	
- 1	That's pretty much it.  I was really excited to get this for my 3 year old but the magnet is so weak it doesn't pick up or hold on to the fish at all.  Very disappointing.	
1. 	This swaddle blanket is indeed a miracle - it really holds! So easy to use, pretty much foolproof (watch the video online to help you get started). Keeps baby tight and warm and ASLEEP (we started using it the night he was born and he's slept through the night since)!One small downside (if you can call it a downside at all): Our son is a big kicker/mover while sleeping and every once in awhile manages to kick one of his legs out the bottom, but it doesn't seem to phase him or interrupt his sleep.Will definitely be giving this as a gift at every baby shower from now on!	
- 1	I was very excited to buy this item for my 4 1/2 month old baby. He love to kick his feet so I thought this would be great. However the volume on it is terrible. Even with the volume on the second noise  spot I can barly hear it unless I get real close to it. It was a waste of my money.	
- 1	It sounds like a good cup in theory, but in practice, my son had to work too much to drink water and gave up after about a day, he has not touched this bottle ever since.	
- 1	*****IMPORTANT UPDATE*****I went to move my sons room around the other day. When I unplugged the unit I noticed that the adapter was BURNT! Yes, burnt! The scariest thing about this is that it CONTINUED to stay powered and run while burning. SCARY!I wrote to the company with pictures, and the response I got was less than concerned. There was a mention on a 1 year warranty - WELL, LIONHEART .... I am not too concerned about the 1 year warranty, and honestly, if I were dealing with issues like this I would try to reassure my customers that their children would not be exposed to a dangerous product that could potentially catch fire! Seriously? You want me to fill out a claim report? How about the pictures of the product with the BURNS on it! I do not give a crap about the claim, someone needs to be informed that this happened and it needs to be dealt with. There should be a safety feature that shuts the units off when it overheats, anywhere on the unit. HOW AWFUL! AND ALSO AWFUL IS THE CUSTOMER SUPPRT VIA EMAIL!Thanks for nothing.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. These work alright but started tearing in the wash after the second wash. I previously bought OsoCozy wipes and have been using them for over a year (they look exactly the same) and almost none of them have torn up with frequent washing (I use these as diaper wipes). I would never buy this brand again and would pay double for the OsoCozy that won't fall apart immediately. My mistake!	
- 1	But the size of pail is huge, same height as the toliet water tank! The main complaint is that it deson't seal the smell when you throw another one in. The smell comes out as soon as you put your foot on the peddle. Then, the bathroom smells terrible. If you don't open it, no smell. I don't like it at all. Now I have to bag diaper with #2 out outside the house everyday. The pail doesn't serve our original purpose! This pail is same as a trash can with lid one. Wasting money on it and buying more pail bags which are expensive.	
1. 	Easy to use and stores are your changing table essentials! Can only about 50 diapers in the side which is so great!	
- 1	I love this cup when we used it the first few times, easy grip, slick design with none of those crevices so many cups have that are impossible to get milk out of.  Now this could just be my child, but he is tough on his cups (and well, everything).  He is in a throwing stage and very much likes to throw things from the high chair, across the room, from the couch.  He is not a set the cup down kind of kid.  So we noticed the stopper (not sure of the technical term) comes out now when he throws it then he goes to drink again from the cup and milk is all over him, the floor, everywhere.  We have other cups where this issue does not happen even when he puts in a lot of effort into his long arm.	
1. 	I got this for my son when he outgrew his bouncy seat. He loved his bouncy seat and we were looking for something similar for him once he got to be too big for it. This vibrates and it can be placed in a stationary position, or rocking.	
- 1	We love our super yard so when they came out with this gate extension we were so excited. With that said, this gate is the biggest waste of money. You have to have two hands to open it and half the time I have a small human in my arms so I don't have two hands. I read the reviews that said the same thing and thought I could figure it out and ordered it anyway... Don't make the same mistake.	
- 1	Leaks. Tried it with the washers.  Without the washers.  Tightened it to every degree of very tight, tight, not so tight.  Not going to go to the hardware store to spend more money on a product that should work.  If anyone has any suggestions that do not involve spending more money on this thing, I'd love to hear it. Was really looking forward to using it to help get the poo off my baby's cloth diapers.	
1. 	I have a baby 4 months old and asked many of my friends what crip I should buy.After a long period of searching here and there, and considerations, I decided to get this item.The conclusion is that this item is fully satisfying my expection and more over.Very sturdy and hard in its frame, the crip also shows a luxurious look.My wife urged me ordered other item(diaper changing table) from the crip manufacturer, so I ordered one yesterday!It took about 30 minutes to assembly it. I had a lot of fun to do that. (needing a screw driver, which was not included.)The only flaw I have to mention is that it gets scratches easily. Be cautious when you are around the crip!However, my wife and I strongly recommend this item.	
- 1	Not only is it a horrible sprayer that doesn't get anything off of the diaper, IT LEAKED ALL OVER.  After being connected for TWO WEEKS, and only being used, maybe, 3 times, it leaked into the floor and the entire ceiling in the basement needs torn out and replaced.  This thing has cost me almost $2000.....so far.  I've contacted OsoCozy directly, and I doubt they'll take liability.  Just wash the diapers in a sink.  It's not worth it.	
1. 	We purchased this booster seat based on a recommendation from our friend.  We are so glad we listened to her.  It's very well put together and was very well thought through.  I love how everything connects so easily for storage.  We keep it in the back of our trunk so that it's with us whenever we need it.  It works like a charm.  My son is comfortable in it.  It's very easy to clean up too.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	I wanted to make sure that every mom who wanted to purchase this knows that the horns themselves are all one part. They are not the removable part ones that come with the newer pumps. So if you are a mom that needs bigger or smaller shields than the standard that came with your pump, don't get this.Besides that, the parts are identical and work great.	
1. 	Like most first time new moms, i went out and spent $40+ on a fancy baby tub, that my baby only fit in for a few months.  He loves the sponge because more of his body gets wet. For the price, it seems to be holding up very well also!  If it does tear, I will just order a new one!	
1. 	This is the net that you imagined to have for your kids. I went thru three, but finally landed on this one for its size and depth to hold many stuffed animals. My kids are happy and I am happy they are not cluttering the house	
- 1	I bought this for my daughter to keep her from sweating whie in a big stroller (uppababy vista). The description mentioned that it helps to keep child cool. Total waste of money, if anything this made her even more uncomfortable since it would just bunch up around the legs. Did not keep anything cool and if anything only added to the heat factor as she would always come out of her stroller with her back drenched in sweat while wearing only a onesie.Would not recomend if looking for a &#34;cooling&#34; mattress. Oh, and it adds no padding either.	
1. 	Highly recommend buying online from Amazon the prices in the store are a lot higher these are good bottles cause you can actually hear the air coming out bottom less colic, and you can take them apart so your getting a cleaner bottle and can order different flow nipples . Recommend this item .	
1. 	this is a very pretty and well make romper. however, i found that it runs a little big.l l	
1. 	It was a great gift for a baby shower and half the price as in the store. Wish the packaging was a little better though.	
1. 	We bought this as a gift for a nephew. At the low price, I was worried it wouldn't be well-made or sturdy enough to last. I was wrong. After assembling this (which was quite easy, took about 20 minutes), the final product came out strong, sturdy, and great-looking. Everyone that saw it was impressed with its appearance. It will take wear and tear, the hair is surprisingly high quality, and our nephew loved it! Hard to find a long-term heirloom for under $100, but this qualifies for sure.	
- 1	Not really a fan of these.  It is nice that they bend, however the spoon/fork area is not even big enough to hold food on. My daughter couldn't actually pick up any food with these.  I'll be sticking with the other brands from now on.	
1. 	I have a 4 year old, and didn't think I would be needing a double stroller when I was pregnant with my now 6 month old. I quickly realized that shopping with 2 kids was quite the challenge! I saw this stroller one day when I was out running errands, and knew it would be perfect for my family. I didn't want a huge bulky tandem stroller, so this seemed ideal for my 4 year old to have a place to sit or stand when she was too tired to walk. It is a bit heavy to get in and out of the car, but it's manageable. The infant seat adapter works well with our Chicco Keyfit infant seat. I did order the parent organizer, which I highly recommend doing since there is not a built-in place for small things like your keys and phone. Overall, I would recommend this for anybody who is looking for a double stroller to use with their older child.	
1. 	I bought a changing table that came with a thin, flat changing pad.  This is one of the only covers that works.  Yes, you do have to put something absorbent underneath, but this keeps everything in place and looks nice.	
1. 	This is a great gate for stairs!  We live in a 4 level split, and it allows us to keep our toddler in the upper level only and be safe.  The push-and-turn opening mechanism is very easy to use, but kids can't figure it out.  It swings in both directions (if you choose to set it up that way), and opens as easy as turning a doorknob.  The best thing about this gate is that when you're holding a kid in your arms, you just swing the gate closed, and it locks automatically when it's in place.  Also, if baby is sleeping, you can QUIETLY click the gate closed.  Very important!  We're very happy with this.	
- 1	I liked this at first - it didn't stick very well, but I still used it in the corner of the bathtub (attached to the ceramic tub), and at least I could have my daughter collect her foam letters and put them somewhere.  I realized last night that it was growing mold.  I assumed that it would be made of mold-resistant material, since it's supposed to be in the bathtub area at all times.  We didn't have it submerged, it just didn't drain well, I guess.  I tried to wash it with cold water like the tag says, but the mold doesn't wash away.  I'm throwing this away.	
- 1	I have tried over a half dozen sippy cups (playtex, nubby, sassy and munchkin) with my daughter and these are my favorite. (I really liked a munchkin cup, but they changed their design and lost their lead). These hardly ever leak, take a lot of abuse and keep drinks cool. I would actually recommend them to others.Update: Playtex has updated this product with a different valve and locking system on the lid. I bought one of the new spout cups with the circle valve as a replacement for one of my original design spout cups that melted in the dishwasher. The top leaks like crazy! Every time my daughter took a sip it leaked from the area between the top and the cup. A regular cup with no lid would have been less messy. I attempted to let my daughter use this cup multiple times, ensuring the lid was securely on and it leaked every single time. I am beyond disappointed that Playtex has replaced a good product with a product that is frankly, garbage.	
1. 	I received these from a family member before my baby was born. Her daughter didn't take to them. Keeping that in mind, I didn't really consider using them the first time around. Then they ended up being my favorite!I didn't experience any problems with leaking or blocking, as some reviewers had mentioned. I'm using hand-me-down vent caps (the silicone part that goes at the bottom of the bottle) and bottoms! For maintenance, I stick these in the dishwasher. I have an OXO dishwasher bin. I put the nipples in one side and the vent caps on the other. The bottle goes with the cups. The ring and bottoms go in the basket. I end up washing these once or twice a day.I ended up purchasing an additional set on Amazon because we needed 10 bottles. Once we get five or six into the dishwasher, that means we only have four or five remaining in the fridge. When my son gets hungry, he screams bloody murder with very little time after his first hunger grunt. We like to have these ready to go in times of need (between midnight and 5a when his screams are most unpleasant). I'm breastfeeding as well, but my son eats a lot. When I use these, I usually breastfeed for 10-15 minutes before giving him the bottle. Sometimes he continues going for my chest, but I've learned to use the bottle for nipple preservation.I have not used these bottles to store my breastmilk. When I return to work, I plan to use smaller containers from Medella. I don't pump enough to fill one of these bottles. We use RTF formula with these bottles. I'm sure it would work fine with powder as well.	
- 1	The squares of velcro sewn on the inside of the diaper's back have pointy sharp plastic edges that almost immediately curl up and poke the baby's lower back.  I've found the same outcome on other velcro diapers.  It is a shame they can't redesign this part of the diaper cause otherwise this is a solid product.I too find snaps infinitely preferable to velcro.  Fuzzi Bunz and Knickernappies have given us the best performance.Your mileage may vary!  The performance of cloth diapers varies not only on their inherent quality but also on how well a particular diaper fits your kid's body shape.  We had leaks, terrible leaks, with Knickernappies until one day, they didn't leak anymore.  our conclusion:  the child grew into just the size and shape that was perfect for that diaper.	
1. 	This is pretty much a must-have for infant seats, I don't know why they don't just sell them together. Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt, then just pop the car seat/carrier in and out with a simple little latch. It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze. Definitely get this!	
- 1	The only thing this thing needs to do is keep wipes moist and available for on-the-go use: it doesn't.  It doesn't shut or seal completely and my wipes dry-out within a day.  If it didn't cost me $4 to return it, I would.  It's horrible, don't buy it.  Your better off buying the travel packs of wipes with the plastic lid on them for when you are out.  Such a bummer because the large wipes dispenser from OXO that matches this is great.	
1. 	I got the Medela Advanced pump and it comes with the 24mm breastshileds (because apparently every woman is average sized...not!) I was having such pain and difficulty pumping.  I was dissapointed the pump only came with one size shields because I found out that was why I was having such difficulty.  Well turns out I have smaller than &#34;average&#34; nipples and the 21 mm shields were perfect! No more pain!  And pumping is going so well!	
- 1	not good for us at all.it spills all over my bag. i don't know what to do with this.i don't like this Sipster cup!	
1. 	I bought this for cloth diapers and so far its holding in the smell really well. It holds two or three days worth of diapers which is perfect. The lid DOES come up easily so it won't keep kiddos out.	
1. 	great product does what it needs to do if only the product works better for small baseboards under 2 in. The template does not do well on baseboards since it will be short a few cm depend on how thick the baseboard is in depth.overall pretty sturdy	
- 1	Well, its big and soft. It did support my back a bit. That's pretty much the end of the good points. I didn't sleep well at all. You need a really long neck to be comfortable using it. It dug into mine. Also, I'm a short person (barely over 5 feet tall). Yet this seemed too short for me too. I can only imagine the difficulty a taller person must have getting it between their knees.	
1. 	this mobile looks even better in person.  it is made of quality materials & it shows.  i looked all over for a mobile that just made sense to me. by that i mean a mobile where the objects/characters are facing my baby & not me. this one has happy smiling faces for my baby girl to look up at. if youre thinking about getting this mobile go for it!	
1. 	I love this pump, I just started to use this regularly when I went back to work.It's fast, easy to set up and keeps the milk nice and cold for when I get home. It is bulky, but it needs to be to have all those things included. I purchased the cleaning wipes so I can wipe down the sheilds and let them dry, it's perfect. It's hard for me to get to water so the wipes work great. I would definitly reccommend this pump to ANYONE, even though it's really expensive. Defintly get this pump if you are a working mom and want to give your children the gift of breastmilk. I also purchased the car adapter to make it even easier to pump when I am away from the baby, and it makes it more sanitary to express milk. Great product!	
- 1	Although this is snuggly, soft, and adorable, when we took our car seat to our local California Highway Patrol station to have it professionally installed, he saw that I had put this in it (it was cold and rainy at the time) and warned me that car seats are not crash tested with these in them, that they can compress during an accident and cause the infant to slip, and are overall dangerous for use in car seats.  It would be perfectly fine for use in a stroller, but NOT WISE for use in a car seat.  Instead, use blankets or something that can fit completely over the baby and carseat rather than inside of it.  Bummer.  I returned it and use blankets instead.	
- 1	The mat didn't lay flat or stay suctioned to the table. Milk cups repeatedly fell over due to this and rolled off table. It wasn't very easy to clean without soaking it everyday. We liked the thickness of it and thought the part the hung over the table was a good idea, but it just made a worse mess when the kids leaned over it.	
1. 	I purchased these for my baby girl I have used the other AVENT nipples for younger babies with no issues. Great product, no issues.	
- 1	I had bought this for my son at 6 months old for visiting graqndparents.  I really liked the features, but didn't like it once i put my son in it.  I loved the idea that it folded up, had a carrying strap, could come apart easily to clean, and the different trays.  I thought that the back could be a little higher, he still needed some support, and couldn't sit straight up.  Also he is an average size baby, and when i put him in the seat he had just fit, and the seat looked really small with him in it.  I returned and bought him a reclining seat with a higher back.	
1. 	we bought this almost a year ago- when my daughter was just a couple weeks old. we have used it at every nap and bedtime (if we were home) she LOVES the ocean waves, but the whales make her fussy. anyway- when she was newborn, the sound would immediately put her to sleep, now, when we lay her down and turn on her sheep she just rolls over and listens til she falls asleep. she can and does sleep without her sheep, but with two other kids in the house i needed something to drown out the constant noise, and this did the trick. i still have it attached at the foot of her crib, hanging from the top, facing her, i just push the button through the slats of her crib, no problem at all.batteries last a very long time, volume goes up much higher than i have ever needed, you can have it on for 23 or 45 minutes, usually 10 is plenty for us. definitely would recommend this sheep.	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
1. 	I read the previous reviews of this bag, so I decided to check it out at our local Babies R Us store.  It really is an awesome bag!  I bought it today, and switched all my stuff into it in the parking lot!  I absolutely love it.  It is very roomy, has pockets for everything, and the purse section (front pocket) is wonderful for organizing mommy's stuff!  There is plenty of room for lots of stuff--I fit 4 small board books, a soft big book, a bunch of teethers, flashcards, a rolie polie olie doll, a Wet Ones canister, my son's shoes, 2 burp rags, a nursing shawl, diapers, wipes, diaper cream, and my personal stuff (wallet, lipsticks, camera)ALL of it comfortably!  The strap is nice and wide so it feels steadier and more comfortable carrying it.  I just love it!  I wish I'd found it sooner because this is bag #3 for us, and our son is only 1!  It seems sturdy so I think it'll last awhile!!  I definitely recommend this bag!	
1. 	I have used this product every day for almost nine months, and I have been very pleased. I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but I also wanted her daddy to be able to feed her occasionally, and I didn't want to feel like I could never be apart from her. This pump is very affordable, and works very well. It easily attaches to any size bottle Avent makes, which is very convenient. It also comes apart for easy cleaning. It may not be quite as efficient as an electric model, but always works well. It's also small, which makes it easy to even throw in the diaper bag, if needed. I have been very happy with this pump.	
1. 	The unit is about 4 feet away from the crib and every sound the baby makes can be clearly heard. It even picks up the sound of the a/c unit. I can remain sitting in the chair that's 12 feet away from the unit, nursing the baby and ask my sons in the living room, where the parent unit is located, to bring me a glass a water. I love that the parent unit can be used without batteries.	
- 1	So this poor glider/ottoman was shipped out of AZ, traveled to NM, arrived in my city in CO, and then for some reason went back to NM, then back to CO before it finally arrived on my doorstep.  The box had seen better days, but I still don't think that's to blame.  The ottoman was damaged when we pulled it out of the packaging - a large crack in the wood of the base.  We were only offered the option to return the entire product, glider and all, and by then it was already set up and a hassle to return to the box and ship out.Also, the glider has a grinding noise every time it moves - it doesn't matter how you are sitting in it, it's a grind forward/grind back.  If your baby is distracted by these noises, this is not the best option.Overall, we purchased this for the color, and that I am happy with.  Everything else?  Feels like a waste of money.	
1. 	This is a perfect fit for all changing dressers, soft under baby's body, is well made, cleans up easy and last.	
- 1	I purchased one in pink when my daughter was turning two.  I loved it because it seemed to be perfect and exactly what she needed.  The seat was soft and comfortable and my daughter could climb in and out of it easily.  Initially, it wasn't hard to clean.  I know a lot of people complain about the cracks and crevices around the straps but that was never really an issue for me.  I always wiped it down after each use so that may have helped.  I put it in the dishwasher once and it cleaned well but faded a little.  My daughter is now four and the seat is falling apart.  The base is still intact, however, the foam part is falling off and I'm finding little chunks of seat on the floor.  It's very difficult to clean now because if I wipe too hard, chunks fall off.  I believe its time is up and it is getting tossed.  I wouldn't recommend this seat because it's too expensive for the short life span and when it falls apart, it could become a choking hazard.	
- 1	I purchased this monitor at the Apple store.  It was really easy to set up and the picture quality is great.  It's nice to be able to easily launch an app and view the baby from anywhere, not just on the home network.  BUT - the sound doesn't work.  All you hear is a staticy white noise.  Not only that, but the volume on the white noise is inconsistent.  It would get super loud suddenly, then cut down to nothing.  At one point in the night, the sound turned off altogether.  Thankfully the baby's room is close to our bedroom otherwise I wouldn't have heard her crying.  I contacted customer support about the sound issue and they had said an update to the app would be released near the end of the month (March 2014).  I was skeptical since the issue had been reported before and was even in their FAQs.  I asked if they were positive an update would be sent since I had only 2 weeks to return the monitor to Apple.  They advised me to return it and get a replacement.  I returned it, but I purchased the Medisala Monitor instead and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	Our teething baby absolutely loved loved this product and would seek it out to sooth his sore gums.  Its lasted a year now with no issue or wear and tear.	
1. 	Baby and I both just love the Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder.  I stuff a banana in there and he goes to town.  The rings make the feeder very easy for him to hold.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had a lot of trouble cleaning the banana out of the mesh.  I just make sure that the banana is very ripe.  The only downside to this product is that it makes a huge mess, but he loves it so much that I don't mind!	
1. 	This is a must have for that weird stage between when baby is too big for the infant bath tub but can't sit up on their own yet. My son is average size and he fits in this great.	
1. 	This brush is sturdy and convienent. The nipple cleaner that attaches to the brush is great and always easy to find. The suction works well- and it stays on my counter. Great and essential purchase.	
1. 	It's so beautiful. I love it. And I recommended it to my friends. I think my girl will love it, too.	
1. 	These are great and help protect my sore and cracked nipples. Just don't bump into anything while wearing them...ouch!  But I prefer the hard shell to insure my sore nipples are protected.  You can't wear these out with a regular bra because they give you a weird shape.  I wear them to work with my contoured t-shirt bra and you can't tell I'm wearing them.  My breasts look bigger, but there is no weired shape with the contoured bra. I wear them with my nursing bra when at home.	
1. 	This really is a great product.  It heats up 4 oz of refrigerated breast milk within a couple of minutes.  It's small enough to stick in a diaper bag if you're going out, too, and since the water vial has a cap, you can pre-fill it.  The only trouble was that the recommended amount of water did not heat the milk beyond a cool temperature -- not even to room temp.  After experimenting, I learned that I had to fill it about a half inch ABOVE the highest number marking (10) in order for the milk to be about as warm as it is from the breast.  And I checked my fridge -- it's the normal temp, about 37 degrees, so it's not because the bottles were colder than normal.  So, I guess I'm a little concerned about what'll happen when we need to give 8 oz instead of 4!*UPDATE* I now use this with the 8-oz size Dr. Brown's bottles (heating with inner parts removed), with 6 oz of milk, and they seem to heat up with less water.  They are also a harder plastic than the bottles we used to use (Medela bottles), so I think perhaps the harder plastic conducts heat better.  Keep this in mind when experimenting with water amounts.  Just a theory.	
- 1	This didn't work well for me. This is a good concept and works well for some, but I really think it is based off your size. My breast were to large to really use these. Granted they would stay in place, but i would still have to hold them(just like the lady in the picture).. which defeated the purpose.	
1. 	I'm my nephew's babysitter and almost immediately my sister-in-law offered to buy me a diaper genie like hers.  I told her there was no need in that.  I honestly just didn't want the thing sitting around in my living room, which is where we spend the day and all his diapers are changed.  I do plan to have children of my own very soon, but I still don't want yet another thing sitting around.  I decided to try these instead since grocery bags work fine, but I don't have an abundance of them.  These work great.  They pop up, are easy to use, smell like baby powder, and have handles to tie them just like a small grocery bag.  I will definitely purchase these again and again.	
1. 	This walker is great and my son loves it.. he can maneuver around in it very easily.. and the tray is great for letting him snack on cheereos.  The only reason I took a star away is because getting the seat and seat cushion in and out in order to wash is a pain.  It is so hard getting the straps inside and under the seat and reattached.. last time I broke a nail!  Other than that, it's a great walker!	
- 1	My sister was paranoid about good breastfeeding after a difficult start and wanted her son to use these bottles at grandma's house when she began working, but he cried and screamed and made bottle feedings impossible for grandma.  I tried giving him this bottle also, and watched the outer nipple buckle in, so he was literally not able to latch on to it.  Grandma switched to a basic regular nippled bottle and he did much better.	
- 1	These hang over the window, which was great for us. On the other hand that is their ONLY upside. They do not compensate nearly enough for the slant in the top of the window so they actually are just as misaligned on the bottom as traditional ones. The worst part though is that they RATTLE! I have to put something under it to keep it quiet otherwise it drives me nuts while driving.	
- 1	I have the Bjorn and like the fit and ease of use, but it KILLS my back after about 10 minutes of toting an 11-lb baby. I had read that the K'tan was more ergonomic. First of all, I ordered &#34;sage green,&#34; which looks like a  nice shade on my screen, but was actually olive drab in real life (as in Army green.) Hideous. I could've gotten past the cosmetic aspect, but the fit was bizarre. I ordered a large based on the sizing chart on the K'tan website. In one carry position (newborn/kangaroo), the fit was loose and my baby flopped out away from my body. In the next carry position (hug, I think), it was too tight and made her fuss and whine. I returned it and am currently trying a Mei Tai, which so far has been the best carrier, although I am not 100% happy with that, either.	
1. 	Answer is ... I wouldn't have! My daughter is 8 months old and she is still in it. During thsoe newborn days when it was hard to console her, this was the only thing that would. It put her to sleep, entertained her while awake and kept her busy while I washed dishes, laundry, took a shower, etc... I would tell any expectant mother or even one with a baby already to get one! This is the greatest product I received yet! Thank you FISHER PRICE!!!	
- 1	This cover was kind of stiff and I didn't like it. I'd prefer to use something softer so my daughter is comfortable playing. I think I used them once and sold them.	
1. 	Great gift! It was easy to follow the direction. The molding material is easy to work at. It doesn't dry too quickly so there're plenty of time to try over and over	
- 1	This is likely a very good car seat if you have unlimited space but it couldn't come close to fitting in either of our cars (Subaru Outback and Mazda 5).  We returned ours.  It really is gargantuan, good for protection bad for fitting in a vehicle.	
1. 	I bought this product to use on my Pack 'N Play.  It's definitely a nicer way to keep diapers and wipes organized at my Pack 'N Play changing table.  It fits onto the side of the Pack 'N Play nicely.  I wish the tub for the wipes box on top was deeper though.  The wipes box always tends to want to fall off when I'm taking a wipe out.  I also wish it held more diapers and that the diaper slot wasn't so wide, because when I pull out a diaper, about 2 or 3 want  to come out at once.  But all in all, this has been a nice item to have at my Pack 'N Play for diaper changing!	
1. 	The Diaper Champ is excellent.  I have experienced no issues with odor, in fact I keep this in my baby's closet.  No special bags are needed ... what a savings!  Just a spray of Lysol in between bag changes and everything smells rosy!  Great value for an excellent product.	
1. 	My son was 4 month old when he received this as a Christmas gift.  He loved it. He loved the star best of all.  He would lay there and stare at it..when it stopped he would kick it again.  It was great to keep him occupied. I put the play mat away when he became more mobile.  At 11 months he plays with the star and the book.  The only negative thing is that my son used to chew on the book, and constantly has be cleaned.  I've actually had to hide teh book from him for a while	
1. 	This pump is awsome!  After the first couple of days I was about to give up breast feeding but I'm glad I didn't!The first two days you won't even have breast milk, you only produce colestrum.  The third day, your milk comes in and your so engorged that you'll wonder why anyone breast feeds.  Well, at least thats what happened to me!I tried pumping to bring relief but it only put me in more pain because the pumping was making my nipples totally swollen, I had ice packs in my bra!  I then refused to pump hoping the milk would just go away or stop building up.  When that didn't happen I would try to force feed my three day old baby, needless to say, that didn't work either!By the fourth day I thought my breasts would explode if I didn't get the milk out, so I had no choice but to pump.  I drained myself on the fourth day, a few times, but by the end of the day, the milk comes out much easier and my nipples were used to it.What does this have to do with this specific breast pump?!  Very little but I thought this might help some frustrated new mother out there.However, this pump does get the job done in more than half the time of a manual pump.  I've used the Avent manual with my first baby and it took forever!  Also being able to adjust the suction and speed makes the job much more pleasant.	
1. 	This is much better than the curved bottom munchkin formula dispenser we bought at the store.  This one has a more positive lock.  That being said it still isn't perfect at keeping the sections segregated.  It also can let a small amount out when tossed around in a diaper bag.  Overall though it functions pretty well.  The curve at the opening allows for the formula to dispense quite easily and the call had never came off accidentally even in the diaper bag.	
- 1	I bought this at a local babies r us and it worked ok, it fit my iphone 4s fine although it was quite cumbersome getting the phone in and then fitting it to the stroller bar so my son could watch but after just a couple uses the back completely broke off (and this was not after dropping, banging, anything unusual as far as usage).  I contacted their customer service as I could not locate the receipt and they basically told me in a nutshell sucks to be you.  SO I would highly recommend against buying this, or if you do, save the receipt AND the backing because it will probably break and at least then you might be able to recover some money back from where you purchased it.	
- 1	I purchased this Temporal Thermometer as a present for my wife, who is an ER RN is the Los Angeles area. We had been looking for about a week for a dependable and consistent thermometer for our child when I broke down a few days from her birthday and got this.When she saw the device she was pretty unhappy about it as she had been forced for over a week to use these devices at her work, which proved to be more trouble and a larger headache in the institutional setting then they were worth. All of the Temporal Thermometers were tossed into a box and collected up and either most likely returned for a credit or tossed. Time is of the essence.But I was intrigued and opened the package anyway and we experimented and test-ran this thermometer for about a month side by side with another thermometer, theBraun Thermoscan. I saw exactly the same results that she dealt with at her work. Here are some examples of the inconsistency:1. Have a temperature or a fever? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings by more than one-point-five and sometime two-point-five degrees, which is huge.2. Moisture on forehead ... from the fever ...? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings.3. Head angle and forehead shape will dictate whether or not the device will even work.4. Different degrees register on different portions of the same forehead.5. Different degrees register with darker skin(!) That's the first time for that one.Some of the reviews tell you that you need to practice with the device and develop a technique, which is absolutely absurd. What? You're supposed to go around the neighborhood interfering with other parents when their kids are sick to work on your 'technique'? Gimme a break, please. It's a thermometer , it should work and work consistently. Unfortunately it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and therefore Exergen should take this product back to the drawing board and also remove the labeling on the front about how it's the most accurate, which it is very clearly not.I openly suspect a lot of these positive five-star reviews of this product have been placed by people directly related with this company as an ad effort. And coming from a long-time review on Amazon, this kind of thing is more rampant than you might think.Don't buy this, getting your money back will be harder then taking a temp.... ...	
1. 	Definately worth buying. Fits the BJorn perfectly. Saves you from needing to wash the entire thing and keeps your baby from resting against the soaked fabric of the BJorn. You get 2 for the price, so it's worth it.	
1. 	The pocket holds it shape it is great for catching anything that drops. I will be ordering several more of these.	
1. 	We love this seat, It is compact enough to take to restaurants or anywhere you may need it. Our daughter just loves sitting in it. The tray is really nice and the cover is a great option. I would definately reccommend this seat.	
1. 	Arrived as expected and in great condition.  Comes with a blue sheet.  My son, who is 4, set it up by himself and slept great.  Easily fits back in carry case.  Compact and easy to transport.	
- 1	I bought these for my daughter when she was 16 weeks old.  They were too small and narrow.  I had a very difficult time trying to snappi on her.  The only way the size 1 fit was by trifolding it into the cover.  So I decided to purchase the size 2, and it is huge! I don't undersatnd why they are only available in two sizes, too small and too big! I discovered green mountain prefolds and found them to be a far better fit.  The cotton osocozy is good quality but the fit is terrible. So I now use all my osocozy prefolds for everything from burp cloths to lining the car seat or swing, or even a changing pad.  They are great quality but if you have a chunky baby these are way too narrow.	
1. 	I love this pump, I just started to use this regularly when I went back to work.It's fast, easy to set up and keeps the milk nice and cold for when I get home. It is bulky, but it needs to be to have all those things included. I purchased the cleaning wipes so I can wipe down the sheilds and let them dry, it's perfect. It's hard for me to get to water so the wipes work great. I would definitly reccommend this pump to ANYONE, even though it's really expensive. Defintly get this pump if you are a working mom and want to give your children the gift of breastmilk. I also purchased the car adapter to make it even easier to pump when I am away from the baby, and it makes it more sanitary to express milk. Great product!	
- 1	I bought this really because I needed something and I like the looks of it. It is a pretty bag. I regretted it almost immediately upon receiving it. You can't really put much in it because it doesn't have a lot of depth to it. I am exclusively breastfeeding so I don't even need to bring bottles, and this bag is still too small for us.If you put two thin blankets, 1 burp cloth, a nursing cover, a changing pad, 2-3 diapers, some wipes, a change of summer clothes (for baby), your wallet cellphone and keys, a bottle of water, that pretty much takes up all the space.  And I mean it takes up all space and it is very hard to dig up what you need when you are out. I can't imagine how do other moms bring bottles with them. The included changing pad was also very thin and small.If I were to buy another diaper bag, I'd choose something that has a lot more depth to it.	
1. 	I used the safer bather (and liked it) one time before going to the EuroBath. I used the safer bather in the EuroBath when my sons was very small, and within a month or two just used the EuroBath. I love this tub. The main reasons:1. Uses alot less water than the bath tub2. Has a position for all age babies and toddlers, which will save money because you don't have to keep buying bath products and again it save with the water bill (My son still used the lay down position)3. Has spots to hold things while I am re-adjusting my son4. Has easy drain plug5. plastic so you can dry it quickly and put up elsewhere if other members of the family use the tub.6. White color so you can remove things floating around in the bath water, and you can easily notice things such as bug bites and such that need your attention on babies skin. (i am a paranoid mother! :))7. Once you get your hands on it you will see that it is built to last. There are no plastic cheap parts to break or wear out. It is one solid thick mold. That means a whole lot to me.The only bad thing about this tub is that it is large. I like large because I know I will get my 25.00 out of it since I will be able to use it for several years but again it is a pretty large item.	
- 1	This survived all of 3 yanks from a not terribly insistent little girl. and I did clean and dry the surface prior to applying the adhesive as instructed. Good idea if it worked, but it does not.	
- 1	My son would try to move his arms up and out of it and get stuck in uncomfortable positions. Also, in the process of trying to move his arms out, the swaddle would come up to his face and nose (which could cause suffocation). I never used these - waste of money!	
- 1	When cosleeping with an infant, this adds and extra sense of security.  The top half of the sleeper is great, formed out of a rigid plastic tray, but the bottom half is just the this foam mattress with no support underneath.  Because of this, it tends to cause a downhill slope, and baby slides down.We gave up on using this within a week, and just put him in bed with us until we could buy an Arms Reach Mini Cosleeper.The Close and Secure Sleeper might be helpful when used in a crib and when travelling, but it has limited value in an adult bed, or at least it did for us.	
- 1	I thought these clips were great, until a few weeks of baby drool and a couple trips through the washing machine had the metal clip rusting. Yuck! Dont' waste your money. Try a pacifier holder with a plastic clip instead. I love the PBnJ paci holders!	
1. 	these bottles were recommended by our pediatricianthey really do help lessen swallowed air and in turn baby gaswhich helps lessen spit up	
1. 	This is a great product! It is excellent since you can use your own trash bags in it and don't have to buy special ones. You can also put the diaper in it using only 1 hand! I gave it 4 stars only since 'once in a while' if the bag is very full, I may notice a slight smell.  But it is truly worth buying! I love mine!	
1. 	I was worried this wouldn't work for us. We have a Pottery Barn Kids changing table that has a decorative moulding that sticks out about 3/4 inch beyond the frame of the changer top. This product hangs at a slight angle because of this, but it still hooks on solidly to the changer's top edge, and gives us much needed storage space for wipes up top. It is an inexpensive fix to a very annoying problem. Another bonus is that the plastic piece that the wipes container rests on is hinged to allow easy access below for loading diapers or whatever you choose to store in there.	
1. 	Added this cover to my 3&#34; mini crib mattress. It is soft and durable.  I like that it is waterproof but it doesn't feel like plastic. Happy that I bought this!	
- 1	I literally watch my son's saliva roll off this bib. I do not know why the material is slightly waterproof. This bib is useless! I thought it was because the material was new but there was no improvement after several washes.	
1. 	These cups are awesome.  The tops are such a soft plastic that my daughter can easily grab her snacks.  I have only had this brand, but have some friends with other brands, and ouch!  The tops are such a hard plastic and once they saw mine, purchased this brand.  I like all the colors and graphics - although I have scrubbed some of the designs off, so now I try to wash them a little softer ;)  Super product!	
- 1	No grip on the bottom. Slides everywhere. Dangerous!!! I have one that has a rubber backing that is a lot safer. Buy in the store so you can see.	
- 1	We bought this seat elsewhere about five months ago. Until today (when it needed to be taken apart for cleaning) we were happy with this seat. Today my son vomited numerous times in a couple of minutes. Our first baby car seat was a Chicco infant seat that he grew out of and he vomited once in that seat and I was easily able to take it apart, wash it and put it back together. No so with this Recaro seat.  You can't take the fabric off the piece that goes up and down (the combined back and head rest) and taking off the rest of the fabric around that piece was a nightmare. The vomit was EVERYWHERE, under the seat, in the ridiculous cheap foam pads under his bottom and against his back (today I realized those foam pads were weirdly discolored before he got sick). The instructions also say to hand wash where our old seat was machine wash and hang dry.  I actually had to hose the seat off to get it clean and had to hose off the back portion (that slides up and down to provide cushion for the sides of his head) because that wouldn't come off. I could go on but you get the idea. It's sitting in the garage still drying four hours later.Thankfully we live in a warm climate (Texas) and I was able to hose it down - had we been in a cold weather state I can't imagine how I could have cleaned that seat.  After that incident today I wish we had bought a different seat.Fingers crossed I'll be able to get the cover back on the seat when the foam pads by his head eventually (?) dry.	
- 1	I bought this hoping to have an easy way to carry the car seat and transport my daughter.I ended up returning it because we couldn't get this to work on our luggage and carseat. I'm sure I wasn't reading the instructions correctly - but it just didn't seem to fit correctly.Anyway, I ended up preferring to buy a car seat bag with straps and wheels so we could check in the car seat at the front desk and then bringing a real stroller that we checked at the gate.	
- 1	Unfortunately the top of the brush began to rust. We had to throw it out and buy a different one.	
1. 	... and more.  Instead of putting the kid(s) in it - we now use it to protect the places we do not want the kids.  The trick is to mak sure you get enough angles and such to keep it upright.	
1. 	This solved the problem of our baby picking up her dish and dumping the contents out. Also, the color 'frame' has a rubber edge on the bottom, preventing it from slipping or being pushed around the table.  We were surprised that some reviewers thought it was cheap-feeling.  It is sturdy and high quality, what one would expect for the high-ish price; made in Sweden.  Not ugly like most baby stuff made these days.  So happy, we ordered another one.	
1. 	I bought this for my 7 month old baby to distract him and help him wind down when he's being fussy before bedtime. The colors are vivid and soothing, and it's the perfect amount of light to help him see a little without being so bright that he can't fall asleep. We put the turtle up on his dresser and the stars cover his whole ceiling. I love that it turns itself off after a while so the light doesn't bother him while he sleeps. I hope this lasts him a long time because I can see him enjoying it when he's older as well.Update: I just figured out that if you hit the on button twice in a row, the light automatically changes colors every few seconds! So pretty! I really love this thing.	
1. 	Our 2 week old son LOVES this.  We swaddle him up in a miracle blanket and turn this on.  It puts him to sleep almost instantly.  Of the four sounds, I think the heartbeat is most effective, followed by the waves, rain, then whales.	
- 1	You don't know how much you hate a particular car seat until you try a better one.I absolutely hate this car seat. I know that it is a good safe seat, but it was so unpleasant to use!  The lower sides are high, so I always had to lift my son up over the sides, and it was hard for him to climb in on his own.  He also couldn't really see out.The absolute worst part of this seat, though, are the straps.  They seemed to always be tangled.  When your child is squirming and doesn't want to be buckled in and you are endlessly fishing around for the straps and trying to get them untwisted it seems to take forever!  Add it very hot temperatures or cold temperatures or a sick child, or any kind of rush at all...and you want to throw the entire seat out the window.  I was so frustrated by this seat.I always seemed to have a difficult time pushing in the release button on the crotch buckle.  I had a hard time being at the right angle or something, and didn't have the thumb strength to just hit the button - again, not fun when you are in a hurry to get your child OUT of the car.Also, if you look under the cover...some of the super-duper safe impact absorbers are just styrofoam.  Very expensive styrofoam.  And one of the head protector wing things in ours broke when my husband leaned on hit while trying to tighten the seat in.  It broke because it is only made of styrofoam.This seat was also very hot. (Onyx)I gave two stars because I do not doubt that the seat meets safety requirements.  It is nice looking, although it is a HUGE carseat.  The material of the cover is soft. It was pretty easy to pull the tightening strap down and to release it.Other than those couple of &#34;highlights,&#34; there was nothing I liked about this seat.Having a car seat you hate to use makes a &#34;quick trip&#34; to anywhere into a chore.  You start avoiding leaving the house!My son was 1 year old when we bought this and he was 18 months old when we gave up and bought a new seat (the Diono Radian RXT, which I love and highly recommend).	
- 1	I followed the exact care instructions and the whole thing got ruined and fell apart.  Do not purchase.  The whole thing will melt and stick together.	
1. 	We've been through countless booster seats.  I wish we found this particular brand/model earlier.  We use this in a regular chair with a towel underneath it.  It straps around any sized dinner/kitchen table chair around the bottom and the back.  It is SO easy to transport and fold. With an earlier booster seat we had a rough time taking it with us to various destinations (trips, visits to extended family, on PCS moves, etc).  This one is super easy to fold and transport.  We had to buy two because our youngest toddler was jealous of the older kids booster.  The snap on tray usually gets taken off and thrown on the floor, so we really don't bother with it.  Easy to clean, easy to wipe down, easy to hose off outside if need be.  Love it.	
- 1	In my experience this product has no use at all, unless you use it at a beach or some other extremely hot and dry environment.I does NOT keep your buttocks dry and warm. If you put it on the grass and the grass is cold or damp you will get cold and wet in no time. I would not let my baby use it, it is too risky. I would be better off getting a foam mat, like a yoga mat or similar, it would be much more useful. Even if I go to the beach, I will not take this as it would stick to the skin, a regular towel would be better. So sad I got fooled by all the good reviews.	
1. 	This was an affordable and practical purchase. My daughter fits great in it, and it was easy to install. I can take it off easily too. Messes are great to clean up as well	
1. 	I like it enough. Daughter sleeps well on it, although the mattress is a little loud. I suppose that's good because it means it's waterproof.	
- 1	Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night.  Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple.  The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on.  We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle.  The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter.  Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem.	
- 1	Very stinks! Water flows!Pour difficult! Plastic toys inside, heavy and bad swim.  Thrown out money. My child played 5 minutes and more do not want to watch. It is poison! Because it is - then the child periodically go face him and licks is chemistry!	
1. 	Finally. We bought just about every kind of sippy cup on the market. Hard tops, soft tops, short, tall, you name it, we've got it. And they are currently being stored. He loved this cup. Finally, I got him to drink out of a cup. Something about the flatness of the nipple and the fact that it is soft, but not too soft and longer than most. My little man drank out of it immediately.  Hopefully, before too long, he'll be getting his juice himself! Ha Ha! We had a little problem with the Avent bottles leaking, but so far, we haven't had a problem with this cup leaking. I was a little cautious about that when I purchased this one. Because of the bottle leakage, I double check everything before I hand it over. I hate to clean and don't need any more cleaning jobs added. My advice, try this cup. It worked wonders for us.	
1. 	We own five of these smocks.  We started off with one when our child was about nine or ten months old. I loved it so much that I progressively added to our collection.  Our child is now almost three years old.  These smocks have been machine washed in cold on gentle cycle in mesh Woolite laundry bags and left hanging to air dry overnight more times than I can count, and they all are still in wonderful shape.  The necks and wrists have held up wonderfully.  We use these at every meal and with any snack that runs the risk of being even mildly messy.  We also use the BabyBjorn bib over the smock--although I have a suspicion that my child will soon stop agreeing to wear the bibs.  I hate to think of what my child's clothes would look like if we did not use these smocks.  My child was one of those toddlers who managed to get food everywhere--including on her elbows and under her arms.  We also use these as art smocks when we use finger paints, paint with water, and water colors.  They are great for that purpose.  I would qualify that only by saying that if you have a messy painter who is older and taller, this smock obviously won't cover all of the child's legs.  My girl is about 40&#34; tall, and she sometimes manages to get paint on herself from slightly above the knees and down.  This isn't an issue for me because I change her into play bottoms before she paints.	
- 1	I am a huge fan of the bottles, so much so they are all I used. I hoped the negative reviews were isolated experiences regarding the sippy cup. I was sorely disappointed. This cup leaks everywhere. Used it once. In the discard box now. Can't even give it away because of the poor functionality of it.	
1. 	i bought the Safari Open Top Take Along Swing when my baby was born because the price was cheaper. i didn't take into consideration about the entertainment. so, my baby didn't like sitting in that swing. so now i bought this aquarium swing and my 12 weeks old baby loves to be in there. it's very expensive so i thought about it many times before i actually bought it.  she looks and coos to the toys, lights and music. she stays so calm in the swing for more than half an hour. the only draw back is the music doesn't last long. i have to reset it every few minutes.	
1. 	This is a great carrier! It is half the price of the Baby Bjorn and it is so conveniant. I read a lot of the other reviews and read how other buyers complained about the straps but really, there aren't that many and it's super easy to adjust. The other great part is that it's a one size fits all so you and your partner can use it without having to buy two that are different sizes or worry that you bought the wrong size. My only complaint is that the front doesn't fold down. My little girl is 3 months and she is really curious and likes to face out but she can't because she's not tall enough. The front comes up to the middle of her face. She is little for her age. (She's only in the 15% for her height) but if it folded down like a lot of the others she would be able to. That's it though. Don't spend the extra money, buy this one and save. Don't be scared by other reviews saying it's complicated to use because it's not. We didn't even look at the directions and we figured it out!	
1. 	love these brushes. they're a perfect to the blue inserts that go in dr. brown's bottles. clean very well. good price for the 4 pack. would recommend to anyone whos using dr.browns bottles.	
1. 	Our son loves this bath tub! He is so relaxed in it! Best out there on the market!	
- 1	This monitor is awful. All I hear is static. The threshold for hearing baby is quite high (meaning he has to make a lot of noise before I hear him). With my old monitor, I could hear every sound without static, but it was unreliable, while this one is quite reliable so far. It doesn't switch channels or beep incessantly like my old monitor. But for it's primary purpose, to pick up and transmit sound, it fails miserably.	
1. 	My little one is intrigued by this mobile!  He stares and smiles at it!  I love the variety of colors and prints.  I like that it's interchangeable so baby stays entertained.  Great product for the price!	
1. 	Better than most. We send these off to daycare as they are cheap and we do not care if they get lost. Solid bib.	
1. 	I really love this booster. My ONLY complaint is that it is very easy to take the feeding tray out of the regular tray. So easy a baby can do....my son thinks it's wonderful fun to reach across to the front of it and pull the tray up. Because of this I've decided to just use just the tray part that snaps on. It's a little bigger to clean but way less headaches.	
- 1	In 19 months of diapering my son, he only went 3 or 4 times during a diaper change, and it really wasn't that very messy to clean up.  These are a cute idea, but very small and lightweight... it's easier to just not use them at all!	
- 1	I researched a lot of monitors and, like humidifiers, there doesn't seem to be a great, moderately priced option.  I bit the bullet and went with this one, and I'm thinking of returning it to the manufacturer because this is getting ridiculous.  I've owned it for a few months and at first it didn't bother me.  I think this is because I had a newborn and we never left her alone much so we used the monitor minimally.  Now that my daughter is a bit older and napping in her crib, it would be nice to be able to hear her.  We need to be able to hear her when she stirs so we can go in and try to comfort her back to sleep before she completely wakes up and starts screaming. Unfortunately, there is such loud static that we can only hear her if she's screaming her head off.  Small noises are lost in all the static.  By the time we get to her, it's too late and she's fully awake and upset.  There is also a bunch of random beeping going on (even though the units are charged and the base is plugged in and turned on, so...?).  The blue lights aren't as annoying as many of the reviews claim, but the static is incredible.  We live in a moderate sized corner apartment, so static and range shouldn't be an issue at all.  What I hate is that the monitors don't do their one duty - let me listen to my baby!  If you want to be safe and able to listen to your infant, look elsewhere.Update: I returned the unit due to all the problems.  The company gave me some grief about how I must be too dense to understand signal channels crossing with other electronics, but I told them I have the Sony monitor that works JUST FINE.  What the heck, Summer Infant? I'm supposed to keep all laptops and cell phones completely off in order for the monitor to function?!  Funny how the other monitor has ZERO reception problems.Bottom line: This thing is dangerous.  It turns off without warning.  I think my baby is being monitored and then I realize that the monitor turns off!  I had this problem with both sets, plus the static.  I can safely say I didn't just get a bad one but rather the poor design makes it ineffective and dangerous to use if you depend on it to, ya know, MONITOR the baby.	
1. 	I love love this diaper pail.  We had a Diaper Genie with our first child and I hated paying for all the refils.  I also found that it never really contained the smell.  With this one we use regular kitchen garbage bags (actually, the scented ones)and use the Arm & Hammer Nursery Air Fresheners in the air freshener spot inside the lid.  We're going on 3months of baby diapers now and haven't once had a smell leak out.  It's absolutely great and really does fit a ton of diapers!	
1. 	My baby daugther have very sensitive skin. Her excema started when she was 2.5 months old, I used aquafor (as advise by the pediatrician), aveeno and dexeryl (bought in France) but nothing worked. Stelatopia was a miracle. However, you have to use it twice a day and I use the cream cleanser in addition. Good product. Other thing if i stop using for more than 2 days the rash comes back.	
1. 	I got this monitor as a baby shower gift and I couldn't be more happy with it.  No matter where i am in the house, or outside, i can hear my baby girl crystal clear. I also love the built in night light, so when i go in to check on her i don't have to turn on the lights. This product is great, and i'm so glad i didn't have to spend a ton of money for the best!	
1. 	This gate is sturdy and easy to install and our ferrets aren't able to find a way through/under/over it! Highly recommend!	
1. 	Perfect for basically any table. Easy to use, and carry with you. Weight limit is as specified, if not more. This is our only high chair. A little cumbersome to take apart for washing, but super easy care. Love it and highly recommend to anyone with limited space.	
1. 	It was hard to find a reasonably priced gate that's pressure mounted with a door that would also fit our wide hallway. This was just what we needed. It was easy to set up and has withstood our 1 year old son shaking it and hanging on it. He has gotten his arm/legs stuck in it but he does that in his crib too so I would not mark that as something wrong with the gate. Our 5 year old cannot get this open either so it works for older kids as well.	
1. 	Ordered these last week, spot them quickly w/o expediting shipping. Great product very easy to use, I will not only use them for breast milk storage but also for home made baby food.	
1. 	We love it. Great for the patio or when baby needs to be confined so gma can powder her nose. Keeps the dog and baby apart.	
1. 	We have been storing my 20 month daughter's toys in an open box in the living room since she was born. I finally got sick of looking at them at night and wanted something that I could close after she had gone to bed. This fits the bill perfectly. My daughter likes to climb and she likes to climb into the toy box. So I like that the box is soft. I also like that it has an organizing compartment that I can put all of the little plastic random toys that we seem to accumulate. It has a side compartment to put books or puzzles and a fold down playmat that we don't use, but I think I would have when she was younger. But the best part- it closes! So my living room looks much neater at night or when we have company. My husband always complains when I buy things that he feels are unnecessary, I thought he would complain about this purchase, since we already had a toy box. But even he likes it and feels it is much better than what we had before. I highly recommend this toy box.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was maybe five weeks old and she loves it still at 12 weeks!  She loves it when riding in the car or when she's strapped into her travel system.  It keeps her entertained while she's awake and lulls her to sleep when she's tired.  It attaches right to the carrying handle of the car seat and will also attach to the (First Years Carry Me Near) bassinet while most mobiles are only for the crib.  The songs are repetitive but I find myself humming along.	
1. 	As many users have said, this is an awesome little seat for babies/toddlers.  It took a bit for our little guy to get used to it, for he sits a bit low in it (he's 10 months), but we just put a little pillow behind his back and he now loves his seat... so much more secure than a free-standing seat (which he learned he could rock forward and back in, lifting the chair onto two feet at a time).  We have a table with a decent sized under-eave, and it is a bit tricky to work around that.  Plus, the gussets in the corner of the table limits where you can position the seat.  On our table, we have to slide the chair in quite deep and somewhat centered so the locking arms don't bump up against some of the support of the table.  We have a small spot where it all locks in fine, and when it is in, it's great.  The only downfall is it's hard to clean in the locked in state... and unlocking and re-positioning on our table is a bit of a pain, but is outweighed by all the other benefits.	
- 1	We received this bouncer as shower gift. I was thrilled by the simple design which closely resembled the old school bouncer seats I remember growing up. Unfortunately my son does not enjoy this seat at all. I'd say he stays happy in it for 2 minutes, max, and that's only when I loop some SASSY BRAND rings along the bar for him to bat at. He is very young, so that may be part of it - we have put it away for now, and I will bring it out again once he's 3 months and see if he enjoys it more then. It could just be an age/personality issue in my case. However, I was also very disappointed with the toy bar. The toys are all on such short strings that it seems the baby will never be able to actually handle and manipulate them, just bat at them. The toys are clearly designed for teething, but I don't see HOW any baby could successfully get these into the mouth! What's more, one of the teethers is water-filled - water-filled teethers are usually meant to be chilled. However, you cannot detach the teether to chill it in the fridge because the toys do not detach from the bar. Also, the main toy is a gigantic plastic lion which does nothing. It doesn't rattle, jingle, light up, play music, nothing. Just hangs there. What's the point?? I wouldn't recommend this seat for anyone, and I won't be keeping it for future children.	
1. 	I HATED washing bottles until I bought this! It is a breeze to get in and out of the bottle and you don't flick soap all over you when doing it! LOVE it!!	
- 1	We own and have tried a lot of swaddles. 6 types, the best of which are miracle blanket, loving baby and pod styles. We have 10 Woombie swaddles but we wouldn't recommend them.The woombies have been very inconsistent in quality. Some have arrived with a Velcro closure at the neck which causes horrible scrapes/cuts to our baby's chin and face (the Velcro closure is not mentioned in the descriptions on amazon). Others arrive with a snap closure (much preferable as the snap is quiet and does not scratch baby). Some of the big baby woombies have been bigger than the mega baby woombies (megas are supposed to be bigger than the bigs). Some of the collars are of a different material than what is pictured on Amazon. The material on some collars has more give and makes it easier for babies to get their hands and arms out. When we have contacted woombie about these various problems, they get defensive and rigid. They have never offered to discount, replace or repair when confronted with these various problems. Lesson learned; buy woombies from amazon directly because you may very we'll need to return them. Despite all of this, the pod type swaddle has been the consistent best performer for our two kids. Instead of the overpriced and inconsistent woombie, we like the summer infant swaddlepod.Summer Infant SwaddlePod, Ivory, Newbornit is half the price and better quality.Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!	
1. 	This plate and spoons set has been great for us.  Our daughter loves having her own plate, and we take it everywhere - restaurants, vacations, friends' homes.  It is non-slip and very stable, but not unmoveable by a determined child.  Fortunately for us, our daughter so far does not pick up the place until it is empty, so we haven't had to deal with her throwing a full plate on the floor (yet).  The rounded edges are nice for little hands, and the 3-leaf clover shape helps make scooping food easier.  The spoons are so cute, and very easy to use.  We are overall very happy with it.	
- 1	I tried these to save money and the environment, but as other reviewers mentioned, they lump up after washing and show pretty clearly through your bra and clothes. They were absorbent, but that wasn't enough of a quality to continue using them. I also agree that they stick to skin, and when you're learning to BF and have sore nipples, that is not a fun thing.	
- 1	If you are using this as a trainer cup, to move your child to the sippy, do not buy. The spout is too small. I like the THINK BABY bottle much more. I wish they would have made the spout larger.	
- 1	My baby had terrible gas and colic and i was using the Playtex Ventaire natural shape bottles. someone gave me an avent bottle to try. I was desperate to find something that would releive her but this bottle was not it either. i didnt find that the bottle itself leaked but the milk came out too fast and caused my baby to choke and spit up all over. i was disappointed because the Avent bottles seemed as though they would be easier to clean and assemble than the Vent Aires. after this i reluctantly tried the Dr Browns bottles and i am glad i did because they worked great the first day, no gas or colic and baby slept all nite  :-)i just recently tried the wide neck Dr. Browns and like them even better than the standard dr browns. You Avent users might like the wide neck Dr Browns also b/c they are easy to clean and pour milk into like the Avents, there are more parts but so worth it to releive colic. Too bad the Vent Aires didnt work b/c they are the cutest bottles of the 3 though.	
- 1	These stuck to our windows okay (even in winter in Utah), but they hardly provided any shade. We returned them for something else. I wouldn't recommend them.	
- 1	I thought this was a brilliant idea, but when I received the product, it was not great. The materia was mediocre, and the chair sagged a bit. I would not waste my money on this. I wish I spent a few more dollars and gotten the portable chair that hooked onto the table instead.	
- 1	This thing is just too big for a shower, it does not want to stay put and it's prone to mold accumulation.  I personally do not like it because it's just too bulky.  There are better smaller toy baskets out there.	
1. 	This monitor is wonderful.  We get clear reception all of the time.  There is no annoying static or humming like many other monitors.  Best of all it is one of the most affordable monitors on the market.  Talk about getting a lot of bang for your buck.  The monitor has noise indicator lights, so when you can't hear the monitor (ie volume turned down, or you're vaccuming) you can see if baby is fussing.	
- 1	This product unfortunately died after 3 months.  Similar to another reviewer, the numbers became unreadable and I ended up tossing the turtlemeter.  Great idea, this product just didn't work for me.	
1. 	Overall I was quite happy with the product and the sales process with Amazon.  One warning is that the items are somewhat darker than I expected from the image.  I originally ordered in the Cherry finish to match some furniture we purchased through Amazon from another company, but it turned out to be much darker than expected so we returned it and got a replacement in Cognac which was approximately the correct color.One thing I appreciated was that the pieces were labeled with numbers - something that helped me get the assembly correct the first time.  The instructions were passable - I really wish manufactures would remember their customers can read and use some text to clarify things but I guess they would then have to print multiple languages for different markets.The dresser was also bigger than I expected, but this was not a problem for us and the dimensions were listed correctly so you can check them before purchasing.Hope this helps!	
- 1	This is hard to get on and off and you can't see how many ounces are left in the bottle!	
1. 	Very soft material, however I do not think it should be described as &#34;sage&#34; in color. It's more of a light lime green. I'm happy with the product and it still works with the theme of the nursery, however it was not what I was expecting.	
1. 	Let's see...what to write about the potty. It is easy to clean, my daughter uses it, and it has held up well so far. I like it because it doesn't have a whole lot of bells and whistles and it does what it is suppose to- my daughter didn't seem interested in the toilets that sang to her or did special tricks.  Overall a good product that I would recommend to anyone looking for a training seat.	
- 1	I ordered this as a gift for a pregnant friend and was more than a little annoyed when I opened up the Amazon box to find the packaging that contained Sophie was crushed.  It had obviously been opened.  When I opened the box to examine the teether, I noticed that there were multiple scuff marks on it.  That same night, I drove to Babies R Us to buy a Sophie to compare.  The differences were VERY obvious.  The black paint used for the eyes were different, the way the giraffe was packaged was different, even the pink cheeks were different.  And obviously the one from BRU had NO SCUFF MARKS on it!  I am so disappointed that I purchased a fake from Amazon.  I left a review for the seller and heard nothing back.  I will definitely think twice before ordering any super popular, &#34;trendy&#34; items from Amazon.	
1. 	I love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. They fit great and arrived in record time.	
- 1	This is way too big for my infants head and car seat. When the Velcro is wide enough to fit her head, it is too big for the car seat. I may be able to use just one piece to prop her head up, but I was really hoping for something that could be in her seat all the time so that it is ready whenever she falls asleep in the car. I washed it before I realized it wasn't going to work, so I can't return it.	
- 1	I thought I was being savvy by purchasing this pump over the Madela since it was so much cheaper. I guess you get what you pay for because this pump did nothing but cause me problems. I ended up getting blocked milk ducts multiple times which eventually turned into mastitis. when I told my lactation consultant what type of pump I was using, she said the Ameda pumps are infamous for causing problems because the suction does not in any way mimic a baby's natural rhythm (like the Madela) and does not empty the breasts properly.So by saving about $100 on this pump, I ended up costing myself a couple trips to the doctor, antibiotics, a month rental fee for a hospital grade pump and accessories AND I ended up having to buy the Madela pump anyways so I don't have to go thru all this again.	
- 1	Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!	
- 1	These barely absorbed when I had them in.  It was more like the milk beaded off of them.  I had high hopes but I was let down.	
1. 	I put this mirror in my mid-sized sedan, and it works wonderfully!  The car seat is in the middle rear seat, and I was able to attach the mirror to the car interior by snapping the hook onto where a car seat tether strap would go.  However, the first time I tried to use the hook, it broke and I had to take it back.  The second hook worked perfectly.  It gave me peace of mind to know that it was hooked onto the car itself and would not become a projectile in a crash.  There is also a strap to fit around a headrest as well.I never found that my son looked distorted in the mirror.  However, he did look a bit small, but that wasn't a problem.  I actually didn't realize how small he looked until recently when I turned his seat forward facing and realized how much bigger he is in the mirror.  I was even able to find lost pacifiers using the mirror while stopped at red lights!!My husband has an SUV, and my son has to sit behind the driver's seat.  We did not find that using this mirror was useful for this particular car.I do want to note that one reviewer mentioned lights and music.  This model does not have those features, but a similar, more expensive one does.	
1. 	We purchased this a couple of weeks after our daughter was born.  We have the nice Medela plug in breast pump - however, it's a pain to travel with and it's pretty bulky.The avent has been great to travel with and really helps if I am ever engorged and just need to pump a little.It is also great because it's not loud, seems to pump effeciently, and also is easy to clean.A must have for any nursing mom!	
1. 	I absolutely adore this product -- especially the ceiling light show and the volume settings.  My only complaint is that the motor is loud, so the lowest volume setting is kind of obsolete (in other words, if you have the music volume on low, the sound of the motor drowns out the music).  I haven't heard anyone else complain about this though, so maybe it's just me?	
- 1	I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either. I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage. They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner. Definitely not usable overnight.	
- 1	I tried these bottles first when my son came home from the hospital and he got terrible gas from it.  Furthermore, I couldn't understand or see how it was supposed to reduce gas, spitting up, and colic.  The bottles we use now, playtex drop-ins and vent aire have anti-gas mechanisms that you can actually see working.  I used one of the avent bottles in the 3 pack and donated the other two to charity.  For our baby, this brand was not effective and I would encourage anyone who is using this bottle and still having gas and colic issues to try the playtex drop-in's.  If you can't see how the bottle is reducing gas intake, it probably isn't, or at least isn't doing it effectively.  That has, at least, been our experience.	
1. 	My husband and I just put our crib together and we love it. It arrived quickly and none of the pieces were damaged. We didn't have any problems with the finish scratching and we had it together in a couple of hours. I can't wait to use it (I'm not due until May).  I will update after the little one has used it for a while!	
- 1	I'm sorry to say, but there is very little positive that I can say about this set whether you use it a lot, or only occasionally.  I'm all for making your own baby food, especially if you are concerned about what your baby eats, but one thing I don't think it has to do is take up a lot of time.  With this set it will take you forever to make enough food in order to freeze any.Here are my thoughts on each part of the set:The Chopper:  This product worked, but what I didn't like was that you had to pre-chop your food before you could use it in the chopper per the manufacturers instructions.  I have a feeling it is because the contraption is almost entirely plastic and can't take too much force otherwise it would break.  If I'm going to use a chopper I don't want to pre-chop my food before I use it.  It doubles the amount of work I have to do.Steamer basket:  This is actually the same piece in the set as the chopper, you just remove the metal blades before cooking.  I've been reading a lot on how microwaving your food in plastic containers could be dangerous as the chemicals in the plastic can leech into the food.  The items in this set state that they are BPA free but what about PVC, and phthalates?  I wonder if by making your own baby food, which you do because you are concerned about the things in your baby food, that you could be exposing your baby to harmful chemicals by using this product to steam the baby food.  My advice would be to use the chopper if you like it, but to steam it in a glass container instead of the plastic one.  Good Housekeeping did a study to see if BPA or phthalates actually leech into the food when microwaving and the results varied by product, but there were some that did.  That is enough for me to not want to use this product as it is advertised.  Harvard Medical School has also recommended transferring food into microwave safe glass or ceramic containers to microwave your food.  I trust them more than I the Munchkin brand, so on that score I think this product fails.  Muchkin could have made the steam basket out of glass, not plastic but they didn't.Food Mill:  The food mill was awkward, messy and produced just a small amount.  You fill it from the bottom and push it up and the food oozes into the grinder and sits in the top bowl as you continue to push up.  Frankly I hated it.  Again it is made up of almost entirely plastic and the grinding blades are relatively cheap so I don't know how long they'll last. Not to mention that the amount of food produced is not nearly enough to fit into the storage containers.  Some people mentioned taking the grinder to make on the go baby food.  I would rather make it at home and take it in a container and not mess with the tools.  It's not big, but it's not small either, then you have to deal with taking it apart and cleaning it.  It's doesn't clean easily either.Food Storage:  These are like ice cube trays with lids.  I hated these frankly.  They are a rigid plastic and I had a hard time getting the food out of the container once it was frozen.  The trays didn't twist at all to help you pop them out and I found that I had to defrost it a bit to get the serving size that I wanted out, and then refreeze which isn't a good idea.  The lids that come with the food to prevent freezer burn didn't snap on tightly.  I prefer the silicone food trays with lids as it is easy to pop out individual servings.  I like the Beaba or Popfex trays the bestPOPFEX Baby Food Multiportion Freezer TrayAll in all this product made making baby food much more complicated than other products and if you use it as it was intended it's not as safe and healthy as they make it sound.  Busy Moms want the best for their babies.  This product makes baby food making such a chore and is so much more time consuming than other options.  This is marketed as a starter set, but what it really is is a product that will make you either give up on making your own food, or buying another product like what my sister has, the Baby BrezzaBaby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Greyor the Baby BeabaBeaba Babycook Baby Food Makeror even the Baby Bullet set which is just a little bit more expensive than this setBaby Bullet Complete Baby Care SystemWith something like the Brezza she has to pre-chop the food to fit it in the steamer, but after that she's done.  It steams the food, then grinds it all in the same container.  Don't buy this item just because it seems like it will do the same thing for less money because in the long run you will be buying one of the other products mentioned.  Save yourself time and money and pass on this one.Finally, I decided to give the product two stars instead of one because it does work, however I can't justify a higher rating because I question the safety of the product when using it to make food, I question it's durability, I don't like that I have to have so many things to store and clean when other options are easier, and it takes a lot of time and effort to produce such small amounts of food.	
1. 	My boys love their turtles. We have two and they are great for nighttime. The colors are relaxing and we also love that it shuts off after 20 minutes.	
- 1	The attachment makes it top heavy, which means you spill.  If I had a 3rd hand while pumping, this may have worked well.  Loved the idea of expressing straight to the bag though.	
- 1	Not recommended,  To messy and just not worth the headache.  It was sent back after realizing it was soon to become a moldy mess.  Not worth the trouble or finding a place to store it.	
- 1	Ok I thought these were much bigger. I guess that is my fault for not reading the description better. So for the money you get two small tissues err &#34;security blankets.&#34;  Seriously who could call one of  these tissues a blanket. Now this company does make some wonderful much bigger swaddling blankets. More of what I was looking for.	
1. 	The pocket inside is perfect for the pads. I loved this cover and brought it everywhere I went. It was the best thing I bought for breastfeeding.	
1. 	We are on our third size of Halo sleep sacks and love them!  My daughter can't wait to get into hers at night.  This particular one is very light weight so has been great for the warm summer.	
1. 	When I first saw this toy I thought it looked busy and a little annoying but when I hung it above my 2 month old son's changing table he loved it. He smiles and talks to it, and he is just starting to bat at it and he is rewarded with jingle bells even when he barely hits it. It was the first toy he likes, we call him puppy.	
1. 	I like this product... we got it for my 16 month old at Christmas so he can get used to seeing the potty and sitting on it, even though we're not potty training yet. My only complaint is that I wish the pieces would clip in place so they weren't so easy to remove. My son has taken this whole &#34;getting used to the potty&#34; thing to heart and likes to take the potty apart. Not an issue now, but I'm sure it will be once he starts using it!I also like that it LOOKS enough like a toilet that he tries to &#34;rinse&#34; his cloth diapers in it... (like I said, he's a fan)	
- 1	I got this cup for my 6 month old baby, she was always breastfed so I wanted to introduce juices with this cup.PROS: it doesn't leak, it looks beautiful, it's the perfect size for my baby to hold by herself, the handles are absolutely amazing because I can use them in my other tommee tippee bottles.CONS: you need to clean it extremely meticulosly because mold builds up. If you use it for something else than plain water, be really careful to put every piece apart and clean it perfectly. Then let it dry for several hours until COMPLETELY dry and then you can use it again. Handwash highly recommendedAgain nothing wrong just too much work for a 6 month old baby mom. I want every that goes into my baby's mouth SUPER clean, but don't have time to spend 10 min cleaning just one cup.	
1. 	This item works perfectly as intended. What else could I ask of it? I righly recommend it. Real good buy.	
1. 	They're cute, they're durable, they're large enough to actually work. Bumkins does a great job with their bibs, I'd recommend them to anyone.	
- 1	Well i bought this product with the idea that it would keep my wipes from freezing if left in the car since we live in alaska. but it doesn't seem to retain the heat well and dries the wipes out since it isn't large enough to put the wettable lionheart cushion in it. DOES NOT HOLD A LOT OF WIPES IT ACTUALLY ONLY HOLDS ENOUGH FOR MAYBE 1-3 CHANGES. It comes with a house and car charge but does not take batteries so the wipes do NOT stay warm once its unpluggged so what is the point i ask?! its pretty though and durable, but HEAVY, thick, and bulky! Takes up WAY too much room in my diaper bag. I've only used it a few times. wish i could get a refund. WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT WORK FOR CLOTH WIPES, sorry all of us cloth diapering mamas we got shafted again!	
- 1	I am 5'8 and it just does not work well. If my head is comfortable the bottom does not hook well between my legs, if it hooks well between my legs it it like I am being strangled.  I had the Snoogle for my first pregnancy and it was great. I had high hopes for this but just not long enough.  I am hoping it works out maybe for breastfeeding.	
- 1	the bottle look smokey pink and cheap! not only that, it leaks all the time and the nipple suction is poor!!! have to take it off my daughters mouth to get air and for her to get milk again,	
- 1	This monitor made a low clicking noise about every 20 seconds when we had it in use even at the lowest volume setting.  Without any baby noise or background noise the sound lights were flickering constantly.  I couldn't keep the monitor on because it was misleading that something was going on in the baby's room when in fact it was perfectly quiet.  We tried switching locations and directions of the camera and the monitor and nothing helped.  I couldn't find any way to adjust the sound sensitivity.  The video quality was good but the otherwise we were very disappointed in this model.	
1. 	This hammock is a great idea, I bought it to hold my baby's bath toys, but in my tiled shower area, the suction cups would not stay stuck, even when there were barely any toys in it.  My husband and I finally got tired of it falling down all the time so he decided to get some super glue, and now it is stuck there forever!  If you plan on using this in the bath area, I recommend that you buy some super glue as well.	
- 1	It is NOT no-slip.  I bought this after The Baby Guy reviewed it as being great for not slipping around the table.  I figured it would be really challenging for my daughter to pick up/throw.  It's not.  She picked it right up and threw it on the floor (along with the food in it).  Once she gets over this throwing phase, it should be fine, but it's definitely not worth the cost compared to other similar items.	
- 1	I stopped buying these and my wipes no longer get burned. I had alot of issues with my cloth wipes getting dried out, and it turns out the pad was absorbing all the moisture. I've stopped using them and no more browning or mildew. Go figure. :/	
1. 	My boy really likes the toothpaste. I think it's because there is a fruity sweet taste that tastes like banana. However, the toothbrush damages easily. As kids, they tend to bite the toothbrush.For toothbrush, I will recommend the following. It's much strongerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KJBK3E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003KJBK3E&linkCode;=as2&tag;=nealo10a-20	
1. 	We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best. My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest. For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts. They were getting expensive to replace. I tried other hard spout cups but he didn't like them. I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but couldn't find them. Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them. My son loves these. They are easy to clean, don't leak and he happily drinks out of them. I have ordered several packs of them. All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints. I highly recommend these cups.	
1. 	They are soft, I'd say bigger than average (length-wise), have ample sized velcro sections in the back that are secure.  Great price also.I was concerned they would be too small but they are perfect for my teething (constantly drooling)  toddler @ 14 months. The neck is also ample - definately bigger than an infant bib.  We've had them for about a month maybe longer and i've seen no signs of wear with weekly washings.	
- 1	Bought this thinking I could view my son when at stop sign and light. Boy was I wrong, every bump you hit, this thing moves and even though you try to reposition it, it still moves. Not worth the money, wish I had returned it.	
1. 	This easy and to the point.  It attaches easy and very tight which you need.  Can move around for best angle to see your child.  That's it.  Just easy and works.	
- 1	I used this straw cup to put my toddler's water and juice.  It leaks quite a bit especially if you don't screw it tight enough.  The unit is also difficult to clean with so many parts to take apart.  So not so toddler friendly afterall.  Recommend the Skip Hop Zoo straw bottle.	
1. 	Buy with confidence. This is a great item to have for you diaper bag and at home when those moments of sickness arise.	
1. 	Did the job, but my kid just lost interest and moved on. If your little one wants to crack into this, they likely can. Ordering another set as 2 of the previous one got broken at an adult party - they were left open and bumped into...that's all it takes.  Still...better than nothing and a helpful deterrent.	
- 1	This item is useless. It does not keep fingers out and it also doesn't fit larger plugs. I do not recommend it to anyone.	
1. 	I'm a new mom trying everything for the first time and I recieved the diaper genie(the new one) as a shower gift. It's very simple and easy to use after reading the very short directions. This product is a must for my house since I have 2 dogs that love to get into the trash. The only time I ever had problems with the cutting mechanism was when it was filled too much and no big deal I cut it with scissors. And now I empty it when it needs to be emptied and have no problem. I don't put all my son's diapers into the pail if the diaper is just wet sometimes I throw it into the regular trash. But this is definitely helpful when it's a smelling diaper. My house and my sons room do not smell at all.	
1. 	Nice bumpers. Very soft and easy to place. The only down fall is that they may be too soft. My daughter stood up to it and but a chunk off the day after we put it up!	
- 1	I read the glowing positive reviews of this carrier and decided this was what I was looking for: a flexible carrier without buckles and straps or long yardages of fabric at a reasonable price. It took me a while to decide on ordering the small (I am 5'5). I did have some misgivings about the sizing of this item as it didn't seem like it would fit my husband and I really didn't want to get a separate carrier for him. But we figured since I would be the main person using it, we would try my size first.I read the enclosed instructions carefully and managed to get the K'tan on, albeit with some difficulty. I do realize that this is something that would likely get easier with practice. My stumbling block really came when I tried to put my baby in this carrier. It was very difficult, very awkward and I suspect very uncomfortable for her because she cried every time I attempted to use this. When I finally was able to situate her in this sling her face was mashed up against my chest; when I repositioned her to free up her face, her shoulder ended up being cramped instead. I probably tried to use this carrier about five or six times - not once did my baby like it and not once did I feel comfortable with it. She also got very sweaty every time she was in it so I'd probably opt for the mesh version if it is something you are bent on getting. I ended up returning this.	
- 1	We received this as a gift, I would have never picked this stroller, but tried it anyway.  After 6 months the fabric tore off the metal rod in the front, exposing the rod.  This happened simply from the baby's knee pushing against the fabric.  There is a reason this stroller is so cheap -- it is disposable, like a disposable diaper.  We're changing it for something like the UPPAbaby G-Lite.	
1. 	Great price and sturdy! It is flimsy and lightweight but thats to be expected when paying this little for it. Very easy to clean and my 2 year old can set it up himself and replace it back to its home!	
1. 	This is a beautiful cover for the boppy pillow.  So soft and luxurious feeling.  I used it for several months without a spare and washed it every few days.  And yet it is still in like-new condition!  Wonderful item, now that I am expecting again, I am buying another one just like it.  :)	
1. 	We knew we were having a girl & when we saw this theme at Babies R Us we knew this was it! We registered for every matching Malawi item available-rug, switchplate, wall art, lamp, nightlight, picture frame, club chair, table & chairs, toy chest, receiving blankets, etc. Went a little crazy, but it all looks so cute-it makes us happy to walk into her room! We painted the wall butter yellow-matching the giraffe & put the border & window valances up-it looks terrific. The sheets wash very well. Get this set-you'll be glad you did!	
- 1	Baby just slides out of it! Pushes his legs and slides out ! Sue the manufacturer for unsafe product! gotta return this one and get a 4-sided instead.	
1. 	First of all, when I read the ingredients on the package I went yuck. But the more I looked at them, I realized that it wasn't actually bad at all - it was actually excellent! The main tooth decay ingredient is Xylitol. Check out the wiki page on this to get a better feel for how good this sugar alcohol is. It has all kinds of studies indicating that it can help tooth decay significantly and has no known toxicity issues. The sugar alcohol is derived from trees and seems very safe.This is important. My kids are not old enough to realize that they can't swallow the toothpaste and I still need to keep their teeth clean ...As a side note, they use Xylitol in chewing gum. In fact it is in many of the more expensive chewing gum brands that promote healthy teeth.This is the only beginner toothpaste we use in our house. Check out the wiki page on Xylitol  and I can say pretty confidently that you will use this as your only toothpaste with kids that may swallow their toothpaste.Other than the Xylitol, the rest of the ingredients are pretty innocuous and are claimed to be all natural. So there you are.Thanks!!	
- 1	The weld on this gate broke after 4 months of use!  I was surprised based on what this gate costs.  I won't be getting this gate again!	
1. 	I really wish that I had this when my son was a newborn and all those midnight crib cya gongs could have been avoided. This is a really great and easy to use product. It is definitely one of the first things that I recommend to parents and I'm glad that we will have it around for our second child. Make sure tha you buy a backup one or teo for those late night changings. This came in very handy when our 18 month old went through potty training and just for any other leakages or accidents that kids sometimes have.My only complaint was that when we washed these in the wash, some of the snaps would break off. also, on a side note, as cheap as these are from Amazon, I have also been able to find the same brand at TJMaxx and Marshalls for half the price.	
- 1	I bought this originally to use at the top of my stairs, however, it didn't work out. The pressure mount would always come loose and I was worried about it being more of a hazard than leaving the stairs open. It seems as though the pressure is particular ...to tight and the latch gets stuck, and to loose and the gate comes out of place.  Opening and shutting the gate would cause the pressure to loosen, so I was constantly adjusting it.Instead of returning item, I now use it in a doorway and I still hate it. I'm always tripping on the piece that goes across the bottom that is stationary from the gate. I guess I'd rather trip over it on a flat surface rather than trip over it at the top of a stairway.	
- 1	These are huge! I thought they would be for a baby's drool but they are more for those babes that eat. Not what I wanted at all! But it could be what you want!	
1. 	Love this bib for my 9 month old! fits him perfectly, stays in place (he likes to pull more flexible ones up to his face, making all the food spill out everywhere!) and cleans so easily. I am ordering more!	
- 1	At first i thought this item was great, however after using it now and having several lids break within a couple of days made me change my mind. The green lid is very thin, so when you freeze the baby food and if it drops or falls out of the freezer the lid breaks and then you can no longer use it to store baby food.	
- 1	For the first few weeks I was generally satisfied with the product, though I found as many others have that the spray is too strong.  I definitely was not getting by just with dunking and looked into sprayers.  This seemed to have better reviews than competitors so I chose this pricy item.  Within a few months I was very disappointed.Within the first two weeks the bracket used to hang the sprayer broke.  It is finished to look like metal but is plastic and simply broke.  Now we just drape the sprayer behind the toilet seat across the toilet.  Not ideal but not a huge deal.On full blast, the spray is FAR too strong.  Even using it at a much lower force, I found that if the spray was strong enough to clean the diaper, it also meant so much splatter that I was cleaning the wall and floor every time.  Using the sprayer solved one problem and created another, washing my bathroom down because fecal matter sprayed all over.  Especially disgusting when it sprayed on me.  I solved this problem by buying a device available on Amazon where you clip the diaper in and spray (Spray Pal or some such name).  Highly recommend that product.The number one problem and deal breaker is that within six weeks of using the sprayer, the button you press on the spayer to initiate the spray became stuck. That meant continuous water flow.  Yes, I can and do turn off the water flow by turning the valve near the bottom of the toilet (which one should do in between every spray session), but it also means that it sprays nonstop while the valve is open so you have to be ready as soon as you turn the valve on.  Very annoying and a big waste of water.Given the inconsistent reviews, obviously there are a fair number of lemons out there.  Cheap internal parts and bracket. I think as with many products, the working parts are plastic and have an unfortunate failure rate.  I wish I'd tried a different product.	
- 1	I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow.  I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music.  It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute.  There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep.	
- 1	Ordered specifically for large size. Literally shrunk 4 inches first time they were washed and dried. And not super absorbent.	
1. 	I bought 2 superyards and 1 extension kit. THey are easy to use and you can break them down into sections of 2 to block items of furniture if you want. I bend mine in an l shape and block things like chairs and end tables.	
1. 	I am so happy with this bouncer, not only does it keep my daughter calm for hours each day - it is the only one that I can tolerate having around my house. I am very against all the tacky patterns (for example clowns or bright fish) that decorate most all of the other bouncers. This one bouncer I can leave out 100% of the time and it does not bother me. I will admit that it is better for younger, smaller children - but by the time my children outgrow this bouncer they move to a swing anyway. By the way, the bouncer colors look better in person than they do on the internet - on the internet they look kind of washed out. Also, it folds up very small - when I do put it away, I stick it between the side of a dressor in the baby's room and the wall (in about 8 inches of space - but I am bad with estimates, so maybe it is a little more - but you get the idea). Oh - I should also add that mine came with only one bunny - two are pictured on the Internet. Not worth the hassle to go back to BRU, however, one bunny is enough (not even really sure if there were supposed to be two - maybe it was just pictured that way on the internet) - and probably won't even always use that one because it does not stick well to the velcro (the velcro patch is too small). You can also stick a more stimulating stuffed toy on the same velcro patch - for example a black and red toy.	
1. 	Nearly six months into solid foods and I discovered these.  I only wish that I had learned about these bibs earlier.  I came to expect bibs to do little more than save the shirt they covered.  Other bibs with pockets captured little food that fell and were a pain to clean.  These bibs really do rinse clean and are ready to use for the next feeding!  They catch all the food that used to cover my son's pants and the corners of the highchair. This is one of the few products whose use actually made me so happy that I am taking precious nap time to extoll its virtues.  Hurrah for Baby Bjorn bibs!!!	
1. 	My kids are both snackers and this has a been a great investment for all of our little snacks.The only one we ever have problems with are cheerios. They are so small and sometimes extra ones will slip out.My kids have done great with them though, so I haven't ever had issues with the lid or anything. It stays put and the kids grab their snacks.Great for trips to the store, and car rides!	
- 1	It was nice while is lasted, but the fan blades already ripped and it won't even spin anymore, after just over a week of having it. Waste of money and paid a lot more than current price.  Kick myself. Don't buy, worthless and expensive.	
1. 	I carry this wi me everywhere we go. No mess and very quick to make bottles with, especially when we are on the go all the time.	
- 1	Followed mounting instructions multiple times, this absolutely DOES NOT stay up on my type of cermiac tile -- a rough surface that is not slick/shiny. Be aware. Very frustrating!	
- 1	I really wanted this bottle to work, because a. it's stylish and b. it's glass which I would have much preferred over a plastic bottle. Alas, this bottle didn't really work for us. For one, it is difficult to get it leak proof, second it can get kind of heavy (he smaller version would have probably fixed that) and third, baby did not accept the nipple. it seems that the wider nipples on of the Tommee Tippee brand are just a lot closer in feel to the real thing.	
- 1	Trying several liners to find good ones and these are not it. Too thin and not what we want at all. Don't seem like they'd hold much. Returned.	
- 1	I thought this would work to keep my little one in place in his car seat and be a pillow for him when he wanted to sleep.  It was awkward. He was not comfortable at all.	
- 1	The camera and display are too small and the resolution not high enough to actually see whether my newborn is crying or just making grunting sounds.  All I can see is that she's in her bassinet and I don't need a camera for that.  Maybe a more expensive one will meet my needs	
- 1	This product is not like the photo at all. The photo makes it look like it's a free-standing, circular bag. It's not free-standing AT ALL - not in the least bit. It is also more of an oval shape. It is much thinner than I expected. It came in a package about 4 inches square by 1 inch thick. We'll see if it works, but so far, I am unimpressed because it is not like I thought it would be.	
- 1	I thought this was going to be comfortable for sleeping but it's almost has hard as the board that comes with the original Graco Pack and Play, so it doesn't seem like much of a comfort improvement.I only give it 2 stars because it fits the pack and play perfectly and the sheets went on very easily.	
1. 	I have this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It keeps her busy in the car and in the stroller or if she gets bored with her swing I clip it on that sometimes too. The clips are a little hard to get to work you really have to just use two hands to open them up and push down hard. But it's worth it, in the car when you go over bumps the turtle will play it's little jingle. She loves grabbing the little animals on it.	
- 1	It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles. It's very cheap flimsy plastic. The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used). I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me. I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day.	
1. 	I bought one of these 5 years ago and am just now replacing it. That should tell you that its great quality! It has been through three kids and finally the bristles are flattening out. We use it on our camelbacks and thermoses as well. Then it goes into every dish washing load to be sanitized. Anything that can hold up to five years of daily dishwasher use has my vote for sure!	
1. 	I bought this for my 2-month old son who HATES car rides and the minute he looks up at Mr. Panda, he is instantly enthralled by it.  It doesn't last the whole car trip, of course, but it has grabbed his attention multiple times.	
- 1	Before you purchase this product, please look at the updates other reviewers have added to their initial review.  I was coming back to update my review, but realized the review I'd written was actually for the monitor I'd purchased to replace this one.At first, this video baby monitor was awesome.  My wife and I would bring the monitor upstairs so that we could watch television for a little while before we went to bed, and we always ended up just watching our son over the monitor instead.  The night vision was not bad for low-light, and when our son took daytime naps, the color picture was very good.  The sound was good quality, and we liked that we could turn a few lullabyes on and off from upstairs.  The range was also very good.But.When we went to visit some family about two and a half months after buying the monitor, we set it up and I realized about half an hour later that the picture looked as if it hadn't changed at all.  I went to go check on my son (the room we were stayign in was on the other side of the house), and he was crying miserably.  You'd never know by the picture frozen on the screen!We tried repeatedly to use the monitor after that day, but it never worked well again.  After reading several other reviews here, it seems as if the same thing happened to several other consumers.  For well over $100, this unit should be working as well as it did at first for several years, not 75 days.  We were (and remain) very disappointed with the product.I give the BABYVIEW20 two stars, but only because it has such great potential; it worked great at first.  But in no way would I recommend anyone purchasing this product.  It's just poor quality, and is now a baby toy for my 16-month old.	
1. 	The bib works great.  My 14-month old is not able to pull it off, which was our only problem with the other Bumkins.  The only problem with this is that it is very big -- so the pocket doesn't sit in the right place and catch the falling food.  But other than that, it does the job.  She'll grow into it.  As with all Bumkins, it's easy to clean off.  I wipe it off or rinse it off in the sink, then hang to dry.  I wash/dry them with the rest of her laundry every weekend, and it's held up fine.	
1. 	I really hated to spend the money for a travel system!  It just did not make good sense to me.  I was not sure exactly what type of stroller I wanted and decided to wait until after I had baby and then decide!  Besides, there were irrestible sales on infant car seats too sweet to pass up!  I purchased my infant car seat and got the one I wanted.  Then found this little contraption!  LOVE IT!I was able to keep this in the back of my mini-van.  It folds flatter than a full stroller and is very light!  There is one latch on the side that keeps it locked together and this is an easy release.  1-2-3 it is out of the car, open, and ready for baby in the car seat.It has a strap that you can thread through the underside of the car seat for protection.  It is kind of a pain but once you get the strap adjusted to your seat it is not that bad and definately worth the extra effort in terms of safety.The basket is huge and accommodated my extra super jumbo backpack/diaper bag.  It will serve you very well for trips to the mall when you have many shopping bags.The wheels turn easily and swivel.  You can take this anywhere!The brake mechanism is easy and effective.If you already own an infant car seat in blue this will give you the look of a travel system!...without the price!When Luca outgrew his infant car seat I was able to purchase the perfect strollers for him!This is the perfect solution if you do not want to be committed to an entire system and are looking for the flexibility of being able to choose a different stroller down the road.	
- 1	They're hard to use for collection because they are so long it make it awkward to sit and use them.  Shorter and wider would have probably been easier versus tall and long.  Also the numbering is not in black it's just raised a little so it's hard to make out how much you've pumped if you're looking at it while you're pumping.  Not sure why they couldn't use the same markings on these bottles as they do for the ones that come with their pumps.	
- 1	Does not fit my son's head and he always rips it off the minute I try to put it on.  Also, with all his hair it doesn't help at all.	
- 1	It wasn't elegant at all. We had a wonderful nursery set-up but I really felt it needed a rug. Although we have some jungle/animal themed things around the room, this just did not fit FOR US.If you have the entire theme from the Kids Line Jungle room... it may be nice as it completes it. But don't think this would fit as a stand-alone piece in a room that did not have other Kids Line Jungle items.Plus, this is really weak quality- terrible and flimsy.	
- 1	This mirror is great in theory but not in practice. The A shape that the mirror opens into does not stay, and it ends up folding flat. When it's flat, it's at the wrong angle for Baby to look in and see themselves.	
1. 	These stay upright and don't fall over if you assemble them correctly and keep them in the proper hexagonal position.	
- 1	I appreciate the extendable handlebars as we are tall. We have upgraded with the quilted seat pad and two cup holders, both of which are useful and well-designed. I like the locking foot rest and use it regularly.I wish our 2011 model had one-handed seat recline as the 2012 does, as it is cumbersome to use both arms. The under-seat basket is quite small and inaccessible when the seat is fully reclined. The latching mechanism for storage seems like it will break before long. The straps are very difficult to adjust.Overall, I am only moderately pleased with this purchase. I have seen many that appear to be of lesser quality, and a few that seem to have better features.	
- 1	I returned these as I just could not bear to see them on my crib. I'm sure they probably do their job, but they certainly didn't look nice. They were a lot bigger than I was anticipating. I ordered the natural fleece ones. Perhaps another color would have been nicer, but they were just so large. I ended up wrapping my baby's crib rails in satin ribbon instead. It looks much better and she doesn't seem to like biting it as much as the wood.	
1. 	My son is a toddler and he LOVES these. They are part of bath time every night. Once we forgot to put them in the tub and he was not happy till we gave them to him.	
- 1	I cannot recommend this mirror as the mirror does not stick well to the window. I stuck it to the window and after about 5 minutes it fell off the window. Luckily I didn't have our child in the carseat because the mirror fell into the car seat...	
1. 	We have a very expensive baby gate blocking our stairs, but wanted a cheap / easy to move baby gate to section off certain rooms of the house...this fits the bill!  It's lightweight, easy to operate, and it can be tight / sturdy enough to keep our toddler in the area designated.  It's a great solution if you need something flexible.	
1. 	love these!never leak and the handles are great, bc it means a lot less dropping - so they are the best wehn you are on the go.	
- 1	I had been looking at a bunch of cabinet locks because we had a few issues: (i) all lower cabinets and no uppers, so all our glasses, plates etc are at baby level; (ii) Ikea modern cabinets with no frames so limited options for places to attach the locks and actually create a lock; and (iii) didn't want to drill in my brand new cabinets. I tried a bunch, hoping somehow, somewhere, one of these would work. These did not work for frameless cabinets, so i didn't even get around to checking whether they would work with high strength tape (in lieu of drilling).	
- 1	It looks and feel great online and up close. It does have great comfort. Its a bit bulky, but I liked how flat the seat was. We were looking for a big girl seat. The 5 point harness system is where this fell short for me. We are coming from a Britax 70. Huge fan of Britax, and wanted to love this seat. The clip is cheap and hard to close and un clip. Then the harness buckles were even worse. You have to push the fabric out of the way to un buckle it. It is comes unbuckled at all. I saw where people posted this problem, after food was suck in it. This was my first day using it. Within 3 hours of installing it, we went to the store. It took me 5 minutes to get her out of the seat. I started to panic. It is bein returned. I have ordered the Britax frontier. I hope I help someone with this review. If this seat had the harness system of a Britax, it would be SO PERFECT. I hope Graco reviews this issue and upgrades the harness latches.	
1. 	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.	
1. 	I am usually against things made of plastic, even though those without BPA. So I choose these bottles for my baby and so far so good. The only downside is that the slow-flow nipples flow too fast for him and he chokes on them. I had to purchase nipples to fit these bottles and it's hard to find the right ones. I ordered some Dr. Brown standard nipples, hoping to fit the bottles well.	
- 1	We bought this book for our 8 month old son. He loves interactive books, so we thought that this would be a great toy. Except it didn't do much. I think there was only one button to push. It did have different plastic textures, which was cute, I guess. But it wasn't worth the $10 we paid for it, so we returned it.	
- 1	I love love love the huge basket on my stroller... and hate hate hate all the leaves and dirt that fall into it when I stroll!  I walk the dog daily so this stroller sees the outdoors A LOT.  And I hate how leaves and debris fly and drop into the basket.  I'm OCD and would prefer the basket to be clean!  Since this was the only option available... and I am thankful that Baby Jogger even created it... I bought it but it definitely needs improvement!1. the clasps... they come off easily!  One in particular... is like too tight or something because it will snap off as soon as I clip it on.  SOOOO ANNOYING.  I have been meaning to contact Baby Jogger for a replacement... but with a baby... who has the time?  I am finally sitting down to write a bunch of Amazon reviews now!  The two on the very front tend to come off when I fold the stroller up.  So, if I want to go somewhere and put the stroller in my car, I have to take the entire cover off first (because it will come off anyways).  Another major annoyance.2. there are 6 clasps.  2 in the very front, 2 on the sides and 2 in the back.  The 2 on the sides are attached very low on the bar.  This creates a sagging mid-section.  I really wished they had 4 clasps on the sides and put the other 2 higher up (close to where you would attach the seat).  Because of the sag that the material creates, leaves and debris will just sit in the middle of the canopy.  How ugly, dirty and gross!3. I think instead of clasps, it would be great if they could create some sort of zipper attachment to attach it to the frame.  This way, it would be completely enclosing the basket and would allow you to access the basket a whole lot easier.  Perhaps 2-3 zippers?  One in the back, side and front to allow you to access the basket from all sides.  Accessing anything inside the basket via undoing a clasp is VERY ANNOYING because you have to fumble and feel for the clasp and fumble with snapping it back on (and back on again and again) because they pop off so easily.4. I do like how CHEAP it is since Baby Jogger sells their other accessories at ridiculously HIGH prices! =)Because it is so annoying to access stuff inside the basket with the cover on, I mainly use this to keep the basket clean when I'm strolling outdoors with the dog.  If I plan on going somewhere with the baby, I leave the cover off since I need to put the diaper bag, etc. in there.I hope Baby Jogger reads these reviews and will listen to customer feedback and update their design!	
1. 	this is an old school way my parents kept the bears off the floor and out the toy boxes. this is very big and I have over 25 bears in mines for the kids. try it you will like it.	
1. 	My son loves this gym. He is eight weeks old and just starting to reach for the hanging toys. It is nice that you can add extra rings to the hanging toys to make them lower. I have laid him on the mat since he was about three weeks old and it is great for tummy time. We have hardwood floors and the padding is sufficient. He loves to watch the sun toy that plays music/flashes lights and especially loves the mirror. I like that the toys are detachable. When he was younger we would place the sun and the mirror on the mat next to him. We have also hung the toys from his bouncer chair toy bar. The mat is easy to fold up and fits nicely in his closet. A previous reviewer complained about the rabbit picture. I like that the frame of that picture is a pocket and I have replace the rabbit with a picture of daddy.The only bummer about this toy is that our cats love it and think it is their toy. I have to kick them out of it all of the time and have caught them batting at the toys more than a few times. The mat is big enough for the baby and one of the cats, but not all three at the same time!	
- 1	We used the product for about 2 weeks until it fell apart. I've probably should have sent it back but I have decided, not to bother.	
- 1	its thin in between the legs and it leaks every time with my boy maybe would be good with a girl .	
- 1	Updated January 3, 2014.  I received a new one of these and this one won't stay shut off.  Turns on and runs great, but when you turn off the sound and projection, they come back on within 10 seconds on their own.  So, I sent it back to Amazon (Thank you, Amazon for the amazingly quick turn around with a replacement!).  The replacement arrived today and same thing.  Turns itself back on after 10 seconds even if it shuts itself off with the timer.New Review: I've purchased 3 or 4 of these because my son loves the jungle projection on it.  The projection is always the first to crap out.  I just received a new one today and guess what?  This one won't turn off.  I got it all set up and turned it on.  Got it positioned and went to turn it off.  Turned off and then 5 seconds later it came back on all by itself.  Now the only way to get it stay off is to unplug it, which means that I have to reset the sound each time.  Seriously?  These projection sounds machines (the Munchkin one and and the SoundSpa one) are junk.  JUNK.  Save your money.  Don't purchase them!Original Review: Got this a few months ago and loved it. However, it has started shorting out. If you turn on the noise and then the projection, the whole thing turns off. And then when you can get it on, the projection doesn't turn. Grr.	
- 1	I bought two orders, so 12 of these nursing pad hoping that they'd work well and I wouldn't have to buy disposable pads. I was hoping to save some waste and money. Well, that was till I figured out that these pads aren't really that useful and started to buy disposable ones. Here's why these pads aren't so great:1. They aren't large enough to cover a good amount of area.2. They slide around a lot, I find something soaked randomly - at least this happened while I was at home, not outside!3. They are NOT seamless, so they do show under your clothes.4. And MOST importantly, they aren't super absorbent. I don't really leak so much, but even then I find myself changing my pads 2 to 3 times a day.So now I'm using disposable pads. I wish these worked well.	
- 1	wow, these are the worst liners i've ever used. i've used the imse vimse and diaperaps (my favorite) which are no longer sold in the US, hence my attempt at finding a suitable replacement. the best thing about this liner is its generous size. yes, the liners can stick out the sides, but who cares?? i hate liners that don't cover the entire diaper, esp since liners can get bunched up, thus providing less coverage for easy poop removal. and liners don't wick moisture like cotton, so no need to tuck anything in.my kids didn't have any issues with the stiffer brands (imse vimse and diaperaps), so the softness did not matter. i initially thought the softness would be nice, but it turns out that the liner disintegrates quickly once pee gets on it. so when i change pee diapers, the liners are semi-dissolved - how the heck is the ratty liner supposed to handle poop??? also, the disintegration leaves linty residue on the child. very annoying. well, maybe these will at least disintegrate quickly in your plumbing. btw, i change often, i.e. never more than 2 hours, usually every 60-90 minutes.also, unlike the stiffer brands that can be washed and reused a couple of more times, these liners come out of the dryer in a long wadded clothlike string. so not as economical as others. hmm, maybe these will not be so good for your plumbing then. i don't know.i still haven't found the suitable liner, but i will not use these ever again. this deserves a 1-star, but the extra star is for its size. every liner should cover the entire diaper and a bit more to compensate for the inevitable bunching. but liners that disintegrate that quickly are useless in my opinion.	
- 1	These are very leaky and I was a bit disappointed. I prefer the drop ins. Also the measurements aren't very acurate	
- 1	This product seemed like it would work so well, but in reality it is terrible!1) Lightweight diapers don't actually fall through hole. You have to poke them through.2) It is really loud when you close the lid. The clamps snap shut and are way too loud.3) Top heavy - it wants to fall over and has fallen over multiple times4) The lid does not want to latch half the time.	
- 1	I was hesitant to give this to her because of the strong plastic smell and it wasn't made in the usa. I washed it with hot water and soap, trying to keep my finger over the air hole so soap wouldn't get in it.  Within 5 minutes of giving it to my 4 month old, she had a rash on her face.  The dog also took it from her thinking it was for him.  After two hours the red skin irritation is gone but I wont be giving it back to her.  I think my golden retriever just got a new toy.	
- 1	Um, so not &#34;universal&#34;. Did not work for the Graco Nautilus or the Evenflo Symphany car seats (which is why I bought it). And also did not work on the Baby Trend Sit N Stand. Not happy at all.	
- 1	I really REALLY want to like this cup. We live in an area where the temperature is above 100 degrees for three months in the summer. So having a cup to keep drinks cool is more of a neccessity than a convenience. I purchased one several years ago when my first child was small, and it was pretty horrible. 5  years later, I'm on child # 3 I decide to give it another shot, hoping maybe the design had been improved. I was disappointed again. While it did look like they had made some changes, I never got a chance to see if the flaws from the previous design had been remedied, because my son (who is almost 3) could not manage to get so much as one sip out of it. It's really a shame, because the thermos brand straw cups for kids are excellent, we LOVE them, but they aren't spill proof and there are just some occasions where spill proof is needed. We ended up returning this cup.	
- 1	My baby's head falls to the side in this swing! It does NOT recline enough. This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own. Not, NOT for newborns!!! Needs to be re-called. If you are going to use this swing, make sure you are within eye sight of your baby, don't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side, even with the net there.	
- 1	I had to return these after one day of usage. Maybe my daughters legs are just too chubby (what toddler doesn't have chubby legs) but they kept slipping down her legs and were so tight they were leaving marks.  I returned them and Amazon was kind enough to let me keep them and not make me go through the hassle of the return.	
1. 	This isis breast pump set is great. The only thing I have a problem with is the little noise it makes whenever I pump and it feels not private. Besides that, its very conviencent to use and easy. I think, since its plastic rubbing plastic it just makes the noise after awhile you pump.	
- 1	I read a lot of good reviews on this product and was very dissapointed that I don't detect ANY change in the diaper pail odor. We have a diaper champ and threw these in the bottom. No affect!	
1. 	This is a wonderful product! Baby is snuggly and warm at night.  We've used many of these sleepsacks in the past and have always been happy with the quality of HALO products.	
- 1	I just washed these pacifiers. Soap gets into the part that goes into your baby's mouth through a tiny hole. Then once it is in there, the soap escapes as little soap bubbles into your baby's mouth. We tossed ours immediately. We don't want baby swallowing soap!!	
1. 	I had to turn this thing off at night because I hear everything, including my neighbors, people outside, and if a car drives by it sounds like it is coming through the house. maybe 900 mhz is too much.	
1. 	I like this blanket because you can sit outside and the morning dew isnt going to get your butt all wet! The baby sees this as a boundary and tries to scoot off of it :)	
1. 	Pro-these were great for our reflux, upset belly twins.Con- There are a few pieces to clean : including the nipple 5 things per bottle so if you don't like to wash then these might not be for you (I should mention I only hand wash our bottles so that is a factor but still worth using them!)	
- 1	pads are ok size wise and I liked the packaging. but that's about it. they are soaked thru too quickly and I end up washing them every other day. You would need to buy a lot for a week supply. I use them at home only and use disposable pads when I'm out.	
- 1	I am a super busy mom of a toddler and a crawler. I have no time for reviewing stuff, but i simply had to speak up. I purchased this product in mid 2009, perhaps improvements have been made, but here are my gripes:1) Clear plastic cover over tray was IMPOSSIBLE to get off.2) Tray itself never sat properly in the circular niches on either side so it was always wobbly3) While it's visually appealing, hip, something you'd like to have in your house along with all your real grown up furniture (as it will be a fixture for at least a few years, right?) it looks AWFUL now. The espresso finish Im guessing was a poor choice, but the finish dings and nicks and looks like it's been through world war III at this point. I uploaded a couple of pics.4) there are about 800 allen wrench screw that allow for major adjustments as your kid grows, a good thing, but they loosen over time, and every few months you have to DIG THE GROSS FOOD out of each screw (and i DO wipe this thing down thoroughly each time my son eats!)  so you can fit the allen wrench in (if you can FIND WHERE YOU PUT IT) and tighten each screw. I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THS SILLINESS.5) and there are a million OTHER crevices for food to collect, I have to take it outside and scrub it with a TOOTHBRUSH on occasion just to get it clean.I went with the oxo for my 2nd son, and am far more pleased...so far.	
1. 	I don't know why they call this a mobile since it has no moving parts, no motion or sound, it just hangs there.  That being said, this is the best toy I've gotten for my 10-week-old son so far.  I don't know why he loves it so much, but now the changing table is his absolute favorite place to be.  He smiles, laughs, and flails his arms and legs in excitement any time we get near it, and would probably stare at it laughing and cooing for hours if I let him hang out on the changing table that long.  Its been a real godsend for distracting him from his hunger screeching at 6am while I'm trying to get his diaper changed first!	
1. 	I bought these inserts because washable ones seemed more environmentally friendly and were recommended to me by a friend. They work as expected, no embarrassing wet spots on my shirts. I only wish that I cold wear them at night for longer than 3-4 hours without having them soaking wet and needing a new pair. During the daytime, this is not a problem.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when I realized she was teething. She likes the different textures on her gums.	
1. 	We bought several swaddles through the 5 months my daughter was swaddled and loved the swaddleme the best, but even the large was too small for her when she hit around 4- 4 1/2 months.  But the small and the large were perfect when they fit DD.  I love the swaddle so much though.  it stayed tight, washed well and was super cute and stylish.  It was nice because you could just put it over the babies clothing.  And our friends were shocked how fast DD fell asleep when we wrapped her up.  She really never got out of this until she got older.  Its a must have for a baby that won't stop moving their hands!!	
1. 	My son loved this swing. He preferred the cradle motion for the first 2 months, then preferred the front to back motion. He used it all the way up to his 5th month. He was captivated by the overhead lights and mobile. After he hit 5 months, he just didn't want to be confined.	
- 1	I'd be okay with the fact that my child ripped these off the wall, but I didn't expect that at 6 months old she would be able to also rip the paint and chunks of the drywall off too!  I knew there was the risk of this happening, but didn't realize so much paint and drywall would come off.  While the cushions are great, the adhesive ruins them.  My advice?  If you need to soften your corners, use these cushions, but secure to the wall using small nails that your child can't pull out.  Repairing a few small holes would be much easier than what we need to do!	
1. 	This bottle system looks very intimidating at first but is anything but that.  We started using them after we recieved 2 free 4oz ones at the baby faire.  My daughter responds very very well to them and hardly spits up.  She still does but the reduction is amazing.  Once you work out a cleaning system they are a breeze to clean.  The disk that goes between the vent and the nipple makes it wonderful for travel and preventing formula clumps from clogging the nipple something I have noticed with Similac formula.  I am just ashamed I didn't listen to my fiancee's demands.  He used the regular ones for his son from a previous marriage and insisted by them.  If you are pregnant and going through the great bottle debate these are the ones to buy hands down.  You will kick yourself if you don't.  I know I did.	
- 1	A lot of cribs these days have a thick top rail and have small spaces between the slats on the sides.  Both of these factors make it hard to attach this product.  The way this attaches is with velcro.  There are two velcro strips that you press together between the slats.  On our crib the velcro strips don't even reach that open space because the top of our crib is thick.  Even if they did, I don't think it would be sufficient to hold the thing on because our slats are very close together.  With more and more cribs being convertible into a bed, I'm guessing the thick top rail is pretty common.  And as far as the slats being close together, that is a safety issue, so again probably pretty common.We got some extra velcro make make long straps that would wrap around our top rail, but that didn't work very well and our rail cover is currently laying in a heap in the corner of the babies room.  If I were doing it again, I'd go with one that ties on.  For now, I'm just thankful that the boy doesn't seem to like biting his crib.	
- 1	But the size of pail is huge, same height as the toliet water tank! The main complaint is that it deson't seal the smell when you throw another one in. The smell comes out as soon as you put your foot on the peddle. Then, the bathroom smells terrible. If you don't open it, no smell. I don't like it at all. Now I have to bag diaper with #2 out outside the house everyday. The pail doesn't serve our original purpose! This pail is same as a trash can with lid one. Wasting money on it and buying more pail bags which are expensive.	
- 1	The cream is too oily, not easy to absorb. Thought it is fragrance free, it has a strong oily smell.  And it doesn't work for my baby's eczema.  I am thinking throw it away, but it is too expensive....	
- 1	I bought this item at Amazon because it included the bottle brush and formula dispenser, however when I got it, the box contained neither of those items. It did contain a pacifier. This is considered false advertising. Also, the box was shipped on a yellow envelope, and arrived very damaged (the box was a gift....no time to return it for baby shower). Very not happy (and I paid for shipping!)	
- 1	It fit the mattress but it did shrink even when washed according to the manufacture instructions on the tag. Would have returned if I could but I already washed it.	
1. 	I highly recommend this product..it's affordable..it gets the job done...no odor..you can literally use the shopping bags as pail liners...	
- 1	If my techy husband can't figure it out with a screaming baby in his arms, then this product is not doing its job of being quick and convenient... at least not enough for our purposes.	
- 1	I use the 24 mm hard shields as well as the soft shields, and I don't really notice a difference. The thing is, the part that matters where the nipple pulls through, is hard plastic. That's where I have problems with both types. I suppose it might be a little more comfortable for some, but it's about the same for me.	
1. 	This is a fine product and I am happy with it.  I clean it weekly and since my daughter is on formula now, I never put poop diapers in it and therefore it never smells bad.  My favorite thing is that you can use any plastic sack store bag.  My only complain is that the part that you hook the bags to doesn't connect to anything to hold it up when cleaning.	
1. 	I was hesitant to buy this due to the price, but loved how they looked so thought I would take a chance - glad I decided to buy. My son (now 5 months old) loves the funky creatures (we unlinked the stuffed toys for him to play with when he was younger) and enjoys chewing on the colorful links. These are some of the best links I've found and we use them all of the time to link things together or to link toys to his stroller/car seat.	
- 1	The product packaging says that the gate is 31&#34; high but it isnt. It is only about 28.5&#34;. If you have stairs like ours where the distance between the top and bottom mountable point on banister is more than 28.5&#34;, it obviously will not work. Had to return. Disappointed.	
1. 	I couldn't imagine sleeping while pregnant without the snoogle! I even recommend it to others with back problems (men and women.) I don't think my husband as as crazy about it, it is pretty bulky. Now that I'm nearly through my second pregnancy, this is starting to get pretty squashed and I'm back to using additional pillows as well. I really wish that the cover was a nicer fabric and easier to clean.All in all though, it is a genius product that really meets the needs of pregnant women! (And I would argue it is a good ergonomic pillow for those with back problems.)	
- 1	We have 2 baby gates the Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru and the Munchkin Easy Close Metal Gate.  I would recommend the later.  There is no real problem with the Regalo, the Munchkin is just better.  1. The Munchkin lock is a lift and squeeze function designed to be done with one hand, the Regalo requires that you pull back and lift up which can be done with one hand, but is far easier with two hands (and let's face it if you have toddler you never have 2 free hands!) 2. The Munchkin has an additional 3rd lock feature at the bottom of the gate which also serves to determine which way you want the door to swing (it can also be left up so that the door swings both ways).  The Regalo only swings 1 direction and has no additional lock feature.  3. The Munchkin will lock automatically when pulled closed.  The Regalo must be manually locked (a 1 handed operation but still 1 addition action each time you go in and out.)So while there is nothing really bad about the Regalo, there are better options out there!	
- 1	When my baby was born prematurely, it was important to me to get her breast milk by any means necessary.  I got the Ameda Purely Yours on the suggestion of the hospital lactation consultant.  They use Ameda pumps throughout the hospital and she thought it would be best if my hygenikit matched the ones they had.  In retrospect, I probably should have done more research on pumps before hand.I can use this pump, but I find it very frustrating.  It loses suction every 10 cycles or so, so I need to reset the caps.  The valves are finicky and weak.  They are supposed to last 2-3 months, but i find that if I don't replace them weekly, I don't get any milk.  Since I'm still pumping 3 months later, I rented an Ameda Elite.  It's better, but I wish I would have just gone with Medela pumps.	
- 1	I have been using this crib for my daughter for about 5 months now. She is 10 months old but used the Monte bassinet for the first 5 months in my bedroom. After about two months of using this crib the paint started chipping off! I don't understand how a crib that has barely been used is already chipping. Invest in the Oeuf.	
1. 	I am a big guy, and even when I pushed down on the base of our Graco seat, I could not get the seat installed tight enough. A couple of clicks on the Mighty-Tite was all I needed to fix that!This device is excellent, and I can't possibly imagine anyone breaking it like some reported here, the device weighs a lot (a good thing) and feels extremely sturdy.	
- 1	I bought these hoping they would give my little one some traction in the bath tub. I use them in the Primo bath tub. They stick really good in there.. I even tried putting some on the back of the tub and she still seems to slip and slide.	
1. 	I'm glad customers have a chance to review these items. Before registering for any baby products, I read every review. The reviews prompted me to either buy or not buy an item. So I feel it just as important for me to review this item as well and let you know what I thought about it....This bottle is perfect for my newborn! It's very true that the shape of the bottle nipple is very close to a women's breast. I am both breast feeding and bottle feeding. My daughter who is only two weeks, does not have any nipple confusion. She takes the bottle without any problems. Also, the 4oz bottle size is perfect for newborns - not too big and not too small.	
- 1	I bought this along with a cute velvety cover for my son. I found out instantly that leaky boys=the cover needs washed often. This pad itself is made of waterproof fabric so I just started using this without the cover. After about a week, the pad was stained and gross. Not even bleach could remove the discolored areas.  The fabric is very porous.  Also, the vinyl ripped on us! I ordered the LA Baby changing pad next and it works great without the cover. 2 months and it looks brand new still.	
- 1	I have leather headrests in my car and this product slipped all over the place. It never stayed put while driving. I also hated the installation design and directions. You can only loop it around one way (over/under) and it is just slippery on the leather.  There isn't a way to stabilize this mirror. I returned it and am trying one by britax back seat mirror that has way more features and costs the same on amazon.	
- 1	This is a very beautiful, soft sheet but it does not hold up after washing. I read the reviews before I bought this sheet and saw that others stated that the sheet snagged very easily in the wash, so I made sure to wash and dry it very carefully as per instructions, and only with other soft clothes without zippers or buttons that could possibly catch on the sheet. After only three washes, the sheet already has small snags in the fabric all over it. I am really disappointed considering the expensive price of this sheet. As much as I love the look of it, I would not recommend it due to the quality. Whats the point of paying 34.95 for a sheet that doesn't hold up for more than a couple weeks?	
- 1	Forget it.  The first time my 16 month used the cup she stuck her entire hand in it and pulled up really fast and all of her snack went flying.  Note - I maybe filled it a 1/4 of the way.  I tried again thinking she'll realize what she did, which she did, but now she just pushes the top in until everything falls out.  Great concept, but just too big to work.  Maybe for older kids it may work?	
1. 	This worked out so perfectly.  I love this thing.  The zipper starts from the top and zips down which makes it so convenient when I need to change his diaper since I don't have to unzip him all the way.  My son is 4 weeks old now and is about 9 pounds so I wish I would've gotten this in the next size up instead of newborn.  It is already starting to get kind of snug for him.	
1. 	I really like this monitor. It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. I would recommend this.	
- 1	Theses bottles leaked pretty bad. So badly that I sent them back. I read great reviews and the bottles were heavy and the tops leaked.	
- 1	Hair sticks to these like no other.  Our baby didn't find them interesting at all.  A sophie giraffe  was much better.	
- 1	My son was small for his age for the first few months, but this swing was perfect for him.  He would watch us do housework or sleep...  By the time he weighed 16lbs though, it wouldn't rock fast enough to keep him happy and he kept trying to crawl out.	
- 1	If you are using Dr. Brown's long bottles, this is NOT the sterilizer for you.  And for other bottles, you have to be really patient to work with the adjustable middle racks.  This thing frustrates me to no end, I can't wait to get another one.  This was a baby shower gift.	
- 1	Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!	
1. 	There's nothing I hate more than washing the pumping gear at the end of the day... except maybe having NOT washed it and realizing that right before I need to use it again.  These make it easy even when I'm traveling!	
1. 	I don't know what I would have done without these bugs.  They kept my daughter entertained for hours while she was in her infant carseat.  Now that she is in the larger carseat I have found other places to attach them because they are her favorite travelling toy.  This is one toy that I will be saving for her memory box!	
1. 	This bathtub is excellent because you can use it from birth to toddlerhood.  I started using this for my son's first bath and it was great.  I just put a towel underneath him and he was safe and secure.  Now he's over 20 months, and we still use it, and he's still very comfortable in it.  Sure, we could probably just use the bathtub, but this will use much less water and I feel he's much safer in it.  If he accidentally slips backwards, the sloping backrest catches him without injury.It's nice and big - for me, this is a plus as I think he'll continue to fit comfortably in it for at least another year.  However, if you have a really tiny bathroom that is shared with multiple people, this could be a drawback.How many baby products do you use, basically every day, for the first 3 years of baby's life?!  Not many.  Considering this fact, it's $25 well spent.Also, it might be nice for some to know: if the stopper/gasket breaks, the company will send you a replacement free of charge.  Given this fact, the bathtub could last for generations!  ;)	
1. 	We chose this stroller as our travel stroller for our first vacation which included air travel with one layover each way. We have continued to use it at home when we don't want our full-size stroller (usually when I don't have a bunch of baby gear to bring along or bags to carry at the mall). I found it to be better constructed and more comfy for baby than the cheapy umbrella strollers. I thought it was a step up without being a pricey lightweight stroller that doesn't like to be called an umbrella stroller. The color Toapzio is a beautiful pool blue. I did buy it for a boy, but as with almost everything else we buy, I felt it could be used for either gender.Our son was very comfortable in it from the beginning. It is easy to fold up and down. The sunshade is functional, it has worked at keeping the sun out of his eyes. The small basket at the bottom is a little difficult to get to with the way the bars are at the bottom, but you can shove a small bag or a few toys down there. An improvement would be the option to lift the handles up to your level and then push them back down to fold up the stroller. I do like the shape of the handles though. Overall, we are very happy with this stroller and glad we spent a little more for it.	
1. 	I use this not only for baby's bottle cap but to train baby to sip from a regular cup.  I fill it halfway with water and have my 8 month old sip from it. She enjoys it, especially that its summer and hot, I give her cool water.  She loves taking sips! Be careful and just let baby's lips barely touch the water as it could go into the wrong tube.  I know when she's done when she lets the water spill out from her mouth, sort of playing with the water.	
1. 	This is lightweight, folds nicely and even rolls really well.  We used it for airplane travel and it was awesome.  We bought a bag for gate check but did not use it.  I would not bother with the bag.  We had the infant car seat in the stroller and used it right up to boarding.  We gate checked the infant seat and the stroller.  It worked out well and we have used it several times.	
1. 	The product is smaller than your typical oversized baby nail clippers. Very easy to store. I would buy another one if I needed it.	
- 1	Bought these because my boy has acid reflux and is supposed to eat upright.  I was hopful they would work well.  However they leak.  No matter what I tried they leaked.  Had others try them for me, they leaked for them.  They are not worth the money, I won't even attempt to sell them at a yard sale because I dont want to burden anyone with the frustration of a leaky bottle.  DO NOT BUY.	
- 1	Not a very good cloth diaper.  The inserts are very inefficient in pulling moisture away from the baby's  bottom. This can result in diaper rashes. You might as well use prefolds and use a cover and save LOTS of money rather than use these diapers.Besides all the leaks with this diaper, they are really stiff.  I wanted to like this diaper, but am very disappointed.  We are much happier with Happy Heiny's and BumGenius for All-In-Ones.	
1. 	I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter.  Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-).  One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden.  But overall, this is a really great invention.	
1. 	Ok.. great toy. Hands down.Our little guy is an early walker. He was able to start walking with his hands on a wall or a toy at 6 months.This toy is really sturdy. It s survived our 23lb 9 month old picking it up and throwing it all around.Its super fun for him. all the lights and sounds and the balls helped him identify that if he wants this certain sound put it in the hole. He will walk behind it thru the house, or put it in his dump truck and drive them both around the house.Great toy. We believed this helped him to be able to take 10 continuous steps at 10 months old.	
1. 	I have a very tricky 18month old who likes to stack things outside gates to make an escape - this gate has thwarted his attempts! It's a GREAT height where he can't try to open it. Total peace of mind! Really solid construction and super easy to install (although I didn't use the wall discs - those are a pain). Highly recommend!!	
1. 	You get four of the brushes that are identical to the ones that came with your bottles.I gave four stars because I remain annoyed that I need these in the first place, but, other than that, you'll be getting exactly what you're expecting.	
- 1	These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.	
- 1	I had the same issue as the others. I don't want a cover, I want a pocket. I will be returning item for full refund. This place will never get my business again. Don't pay $25 for a COVER. This is ridiculous. I'm unbelievably upset.	
1. 	My little guy was getting too big for the normal plastic baby tub and I am not quite ready to have him be on his own in the tub right now.  I like that I can &#34;be in control&#34; a little bit more with this bath tub.I really wish that I would have gotten this when he was 4-5 months old when he could sit upright by himself.I make sure that I rinse it out and hang it up immediately so that it can start drying out.  So far, I have not noticed any musty smell.What I also like about this is my son burnt his foot and we were having to elevate it and keep it out of the water for awhile.  This tub was perfect.  Since the sides are soft (think bean bag chair) we propped his foot up on the side and he left it there because it was cushiony.  I also like that I can lay him down to rinse out his hair and he is comfortable and doesn't fight it like he did in the plastic tub.You can't go wrong with this purchase!	
1. 	This is an awesome baby gym. It has many toys on it and the lights on top are great. My daughter loved being in hers. It had a lot to do and would keep her busy for a while. I also like that it is sturdy on top so it is not flimsy. My friend had a different more trendy/expensive one and this was a lot better than hers. This was so helpful and useful for my little girl. It is well worth the money.	
- 1	I honestly think that this made no difference with the wipes. I still had issues pulling the wipes out and often times they would tear before I even got them out. Needless to say I returned it.	
1. 	We switched from a soft spout nubby and my son took to this right away! I am very happy that it A) does not leak, one bit and B) it is dish washer safe! My son loves lightening and I got what I wanted out of a silly, double win:)	
- 1	This thing annoys me so much.  I came on Amazon to find a different brand.  The velcro is incredibly weak.  I can not fill the thing up with diapers b/c it can't handle the weight.  It is very sloppy looking.  It's made of fabric and sags all over.  This thing looks nothing like the picture.  I do not recommend.	
1. 	This Playtex Drop-Ins Nurser Holder is such a convenience. These bottles don't have to be scrubbed because they are dishwasher safe. You receive 3 bottles with the slow flow nipples, plus 5 drop in liners. The nipples actually imitate breast feeding and make it so easy for moms who want to bottle feed. The liners provide a fresh sterilized bottle and collapses as it is emptied. The disposable liners collapse to keep air from mixing with the milk and this reduces colic.	
1. 	I bought outdoors to write, my son will sleep here.He is more like this than his own bed.Although a little uncomfortable, a good nap self.He slept well in the comfort of home.	
1. 	We needed a waterproof layer for our kid's pack and play at Daycare. This is thin enough that we can use any cheap sheets, but still does the job.	
1. 	I have to try this pottie out this weekend...so it should be interesting to see if my kids want to use it or go run and hide from it.	
1. 	In my opinion, this is one of the best baby gates on the market.  I purchased 2 of these 3.5 years ago and just purchased another one. We have them hardware mounted and they are very sturdy.  These are the ONLY gates that my 3.5 year old son can't get out of.  He has a toddler bed in his bedroom and if he gets up before I do, he creates all kind of disasters around the house.  We purchased several cheaper hardware mounted gates, to try to keep him in his room.  He figured them out and was out of his room in less than 10 minutes. This is the only gate that can keep him in there and SAFE!  We also have this mounted at the top of the stairs and its very sturdy.  Its extremely easy for parents to operate. The gate swings nicely and there is an audible snap, so you know the handle has locked the gate into position. I also love the clear plates. You can see right through and see what your child is doing.  Its unobtrusive and just an attractive gate.  Its also very reasonably priced compared to those other metal looking gates.  This is just a fantastic overall gate. I'd recommend it to anyone with a child, especially a sneaky toddler that can escape other gates.	
1. 	I am a mother of 6 and I have tried nearly every bib on the market over the past 11 years.  This is my favorite! It completely protects baby's clothes from even the messiest messes. I am going to buy 3 more and throw away all the others! I was worried that the tie-closure would be difficult, but it's not. Because of the tie, this is the only bib my babies can't rip off. Elastic on the cuffs makes it so I don't even have to push up their sleeves! Cute prints. To lengthen it's life, I'll only air dry, but I will probably still machine wash.	
1. 	Meh, does what it's suppose to. Probably the best option for spindles with it's protective rubber. No scratches on spindles at all.	
- 1	This is soft, but the smell that comes off it is so overpowering and the smell stays on your body or babies body and irritates the eye. We will not use this and will be very hesitant to use this company again.	
- 1	My husband purchased these locally, not on Amazon.They're great if you have a cabinet you want EVERYONE to be locked out of. Try cooking dinner and being in the thick of it, and not being able to access your cabinets because you as an adult can't get these POS's to work.Don't buy. There has to be something better than this.	
- 1	I was really excited to use this and after setting it up it vibrated the crib really nicely and I think would have calmed out little guy down.The reason I gave it only one star is because after testing out the voice activation the crib rocker started to smell of burning plastic and felt very very hot to the touch.No way was I going to keep that on my baby's crib.Maybe we got a dud but we aren't going to give it another try.I'm really disappointed that it didn't work out for us because I believe it's a wonderful idea!	
- 1	We bought this without really taking time to research it because we were in a rush over the summer and needed a booster to use at a relatives house who doesn't have one.  I wish I read the reviews first, because I would have bought the on the go booster instead.  Oh well, that's the beauty of heindsight I guess.  :-PThis seat serves it's purpose.PROS:Hard plastic seat and tray is easy to cleanStraps, once assembled and fastened, stay tightTray is removableFolds up for storageGood for light use, I wouldn't use it everyday- read the cons and you'll understandCONS:Tray is HARD to remove, you have to grasp and pull the sides JUST SO to get it to pop off (I have to struggle to stiffle an array of 4-letter words quite often when trying to take the tray off)It's cumbersum to set up and fold down and you'll need both hands to do both (we use the on-the-go booster at my mother-in-law's and I can open it with one hand, plop my daughter in the seat, strap her in, and strap the booster seat to the chair easily).  First you need to untangle the straps, make sure they're going in and coming out of all the right places, THEN you can put your toddler in first and attach the booster to the seat next or vice versa.  The removable tray is nice, but again, a struggle to take off more often than not.  To fold it back down, you'll need both hands once again to push buttons on either side of the seat to pop up the seat and fold it in, then put the tray in with the rest of it, and spend another minute or two organizing the straps so they don't get tangled up with each other or come apart from the seat itself (even after the straps are assembled going in and out of all the right places, they just fall back out if you're not really careful).This seat isn't bad for us, we only use it at relatives houses who don't have a booster seat, so it's not too much of a hassle.  (It's only been used a half a dozen times in the past year)  But I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to use it more than once a month.  The removable tray is nice, and it is easy to clean, but between the hassle of removing the tray, having to use 2 hands to set it up and fold it back down, and the straps that fall out way too easily when not fastened, it's too much hassle for everyday use.  If you need a booster to use more often, I'd recommend the on-the-go booster seat.	
1. 	I use this for sink baths for my 6 week old granddaughter.  It cushions herand keeps her from sliding around in the sink.  You do have to hold her with one hand,while washing with the other hand, if using the kitchen sink for a bath. I have not used itin the bath tub yet.  I do wish it was more of a wedge so the head area was elevated, that isthe only thing I would change.	
- 1	The suction cup at the bottom really is there to prevent it from tipping or moving with gentle movements. Not by a determined infant.	
1. 	This is one of the best inventions for toys, in my opinion. Now we have more room and space to put other things.	
1. 	Love this stroller frame.  I have the Graco Snugride 30 carseat and thought this would be perfect to use with it b/c its so lightweight.  This frame is also really easy to put together. All you have to do is put on the wheels and they just click on.  Easiest assembly I've ever seen.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to deal with a full size gigantic travel system stroller for their newborn.  If you buy the larger style Graco carseats, you'll be able to use this stroller frame for longer.	
- 1	These flow WAY too fast.  Our breastfed infant was choking on the milk it was coming out so fast.  On one occasion when I had left our other bottles with the sitter, I came home to find my husband attempting to feed the baby by letting the milk drip through one of these nipples into another nipple to slow it down for the her.  For those looking for an alternative, we ended up using the Avent bottles.  They have been great - the flow is just right and our little girl doesn't get too much gas from them.	
1. 	These are a must if you are starting out or have been making baby food! Shopped around and like these the most. No nasty plastic made in china. Good sturdy safe material. Not sure about other posts about ease of getting food out bc it was super simple for me. I bought 1set of 2 to try out and then loved them so I bought another set. To get food out simply let it set on the counter for a couple mins or run water along the backside. You don't even need warm water, i just turned on the water and ran it along the back of the tray and you can hear a little crackling and you just twist the tray like a regular ice cube try and pop out. I bought different brands of trays and enjoyed them, but there were cons and more pros for this tray. The lids are nice too. They may not come out as fancy as other trays, but its food! Once frozen pop food into freezer bags! Dishwasher safe, but I normally handwash. Good luck!	
- 1	I purchased this step stool along with the Munchkin folding stepstool. I thought this one would be good because of the adjustable height.  The stool arrives set at the lowest setting, and to make it higher, you rotate the top 180 degrees.  An intersting design!  However be warned... the top is somewhat rounded, and if your child steps near the edges the stool will topple and they may fall. This is worse on the HIGHER height.In comparing the two types of stools, the munchkin folding step stool seems much studier (has not tipped yet). Though I am dissapointed in the height of that one.If you are purchasing this simply as a BATH SEAT then it might serve your purpose well.. but as a step stool, there are better options out there... that you can ALSO sit on by the bath!Hope this helps!	
1. 	This little cake is Adorable! I love all of the little items inside, I think it's a lot cuter in person!! It's perfect for little fingers to pick up! I think I am going to put my Son's birth photo in this when I give it to him for his first Birthday!	
- 1	I tried it on my umbrella stroller and the cover looked hideous. It looked like I was pushing a big, grey, box. The fit was very poor and there wasn't much ventilation.Unable to refund this junk since I removed the blue film on the plastic panels.Waste of 50$	
1. 	These plugs are pretty difficult to take out, even for me.  They are actually a bit of a pain in the butt when I want to plug something in, such as the vacuum cleaner.	
- 1	These are my least favorite cloth diapers and pretty much just 'back ups' in the rare case where laundry got put in too late and nothing else is left.I was excited to find another AIO diaper that seemed to be designed similar to swaddlebees (our favorites) and reasonably priced, so I bought 4.  I bought two cat in the hat, a turtle, and a bloom flower design (we have b/g twins). My husband immediately HATED them because of the ridiculous number of snaps, but I didn't mind as much.  However what I did notice immediately, was that the absorbent material on the inside of the diaper was very thin.All it takes is one pee, and this diaper is soaked through.  I haven't had any major blow outs, but because they hold so little, I've tended to only put them on when I know chances of a poo are low.I've had these for six months now and recently noticed that as soon as they are peed in, they feel wet.  EVERYWHERE.  On the OUTSIDE of the diaper.  Not just leaking at the leg holes or the top wet, but through the PUL, front, back everywhere.  I've stopped using them altogether and keep them as a last resort in case I forget to do laundry.  I won't be buying anymore of these for sure!  Sided note- the turtle diaper is made of a different, less shiny PUL and hasn't started leaking through the PUL ... But I still rarely use it because it doesn't hold enough liquid, especially now that they are getting older and pee more!	
- 1	The thing I use most in this kit is the hair brush.  The nail files are okay.  The medicine dropper was useless.  It wouldn't suction up any medicine. The fingernail clipper is also useless.  It's just an adult-sized one with an attachment.  Should have gotten a baby-specific and -sized one even though right now I'm just trying to file their nails rather than clip then (on their pediatrician's advice).  I'm using the nasal aspirators that we took from the hospital, which I'm told are the best.  So, in all, if I were to do it again, I'd just buy the pieces one-by-one rather than in this kit since I haven't used much of it, and the parts that I have used, have mostly unimpressed me.	
- 1	Attached is a letter I sent to Prince Lionheart.  It pretty much sums up my review, so I figure I would just copy and paste.  I will post updates if the company responds.Dear Sir or Madam:I bought two of these wipes warmers when I had my twins in November 2011.  I loved both of them over other wipes warmers I had owned in previous years (Dex baby and Babies R Us Brands).  The moistened replacement inserts were a plus for me- because of them, the problem of needing to add water was not an issue with your warmers as opposed to others I had used.  Because I had twins, they both received high usage and were both maintained/refilled and moistened on a weekly basis. However, a few months ago, I noticed that one of my AC inserts was severely corroded after taking on water.  Water??  The cord, nor the warmer had never been anywhere near water?!  I stopped plugging it in, aware that it could pose a fire risk.  And in a nursery right next to my baby's crib, no less!  I assumed it was just a fluke and went about using my other one, which was not anywhere near the nursery on the other end of my home.Last week, I noticed the SAME thing had happened to my second wipes warmer AC adapter insert.  A simple inspection showed me that when the top is lifted, condensation that has collected drips through onto the AC adapter insert - a design flaw and undoubtedly what is causing this problem with so many consumers.  I am fortunate that nobody was hurt and I am just out $60 for the wipes warmers.  However, in searching for a replacement, I started reading reviews of your premium wipes warmer on Amazon.com.  Alas, I am not the only one that is experiencing this issue.  I counted at least half a dozen people with the same issue - and that is just from the small population that actually takes the time to post a review.  Then, I saw someone had also reported this wipes warmer on saferproducts.gov for, you guessed it, the same thing.  I noticed that your corporate response was one averting blame and indicating it was not your product that is the problem.  Very disappointing, to say the least.  I take very good care of my items, live in a home with a whole house generator and a whole house surge protection system -it is very unlikely that there are wiring or power issues here that would have caused this.  Furthermore, it was not exposed to water other than the water that leaks through the cover when in use.  All signs point to the fact that this is not a consumer problem, but a manufacturing problem.PLEASE for the safety of every family using your products, bring this issue to light with your design team so that this issue can be fixed, and stop averting blame to the consumer.  My wipes warmers were refilled and instructions were carefully followed.  I agree that a lot of the times, product safety issues are the result of poor, neglectful parenting or the lack of common sense, but this is simply not the case here and to continue to ignore it and act like it is not your fault is unethical and simply put, unequivocally wrong.Update May 2013:  Price Lionheart did respond. Here is the response-Dear Ms. XXXXXXXX,Your message has been forwarded to me, since it referred to a safety concern about one of our products. I am the head of operations for Prince Lionheart, where my responsibilities include oversight of quality control and regulatory compliance. Thank you for taking the time to explain your experience. I was greatly relieved that no injury to your family or damage to your home occurred, but sorry that you had to go through this troubling incident at all. I would very much like to learn as much detail as possible about the circumstances, since first hand information from real-world environments is extremely valuable in our efforts to improve our products. I hope you'll respond to this message with a phone number and convenient time when I may reach you for a short conversation.In the meantime, you might find some measure of reassurance in knowing that the issue of producing the safest possible wipe warmer, even though both water and electricity are inherent to its function, is always first and foremost in the efforts of our design team. Much care has been exercised in developing the channeling that returns condensation to the wipe tub, where it belongs, so your observation on this subject is of great interest to me. Of the many, many wipe warmers Prince Lionheart has sold over almost fifteen years, we are not aware of any instance of a fire being started or an individual being injured by one of them, but we're always seeking ways to further improve our warmer.Again, thank you for your time in bringing this to our attention. We're sorry for the distress it caused you, and I hope to speak with you soon.Best Regards,Richard SiegelI did reply to this message providing him with a phone number with which to contact me, but I never heard from him after that.  It has been more than a month.  Not really impressed by Prince Lionheart to say the least.	
1. 	A bit pricier than other massage oils but it goes a long way.  We used this for almost 6 mos.  it has a very nice scent,	
1. 	This play yard is not bad but it is not sturdy when the door is open. My son really enjoyed walking while pushing the whole fence across our living room floor. He was able to climb up and around it no problem by the time he was 10 months old. It is light weight which is nice when you need to transport it but not when you need to keep a child in one place. We ended up just using it outside at that point.I would highly recommend you buy the panel extension kit as it is not very big. With the two panels it seemed to be just thh right size for my son and all of his toys.	
- 1	A sticker on the packaging clearly stated that the potty material includes a known cancer causing agent. I sent it back to Amazon immediately. My daughter was very disappointed because she loves Dora!	
1. 	I have a lot of bento lunch boxes, including the laptop lunchbox. I like this one the best. It's small enough to carry around easy, but has enough room for lunch for both my toddler/pre-schooler, as well as an adult (with a sandwich outside of it). We have a few of them and use them every day. I put veggies and dip in them, yogurt, cottage cheese, fruit salad... you name it. I also love it because of the price. The laptop lunchbox I bought was outrageous, there was only one cover for the container, and the plastic smelled like the food I put in it, but the smell never goes away. This one is not like that. It never has a smell, and it's so portable, affordable, and it keeps food separate with the lids so the foods don't mix.Absolutely perfect.	
- 1	I bought this when I had my first child. It served its purpose, but was the most uncomfortable baby carrier that I have ever worn. My husband also hated it and complained about it. He is a bodybuilder and I am of athletic build. It doesn't distribute the wait well and pulls your back oddly as well as putting all of the weight in the shoulder straps. It rubbed against our skin no matter what adjustment that we used. It is the worst, but as I said: You get what you pay for!This time around we opted for a nice Beco.	
1. 	I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.	
1. 	This toy is so much fun for a little guy, mine was six months when we got it a month ago, and he just can't get enough of it.  Each week he finds new things to do with it.  At first having the balls on the spinning surface was just too noisy, it frightened him, so we left them off.  But now he loves putting them on and taking them off and watching them spin.  His latest is using it to stand up (using the trees to push up).  It is very sturdy, but of course once he's up he can't get down without crashing, so that is my one caveat, keep a close eye if your little one is pulling up.	
1. 	I bought a starter pack of these bottles due to the fact my daughter spit up alot of other bottles we tried. We now use these, and she can actually sleep after taking her bottle. I know they take longer to clean, but it is worth it if you have a happier baby!	
- 1	We bought the booster seat for a 10 day trip to hawaii, figuring it would be easier to have her sit with us for meals than chase her around.  Unfortunately, we found that this booster seat is quite unsafe for our active 9 mos old.  The first time we used it (after securing it on the chair, and then tightening the harness) she leaned sideways to reach something and then was hanging by a leg, dangling off the chair.  Needless to say, we were thankful she had not fallen but were quite frightened.  The next day we tried again, and this time she literally crawled out of the chair onto the table.  That was more funny than scary, but I packed it up and put it away.  Definitely can't understand the popularity of this booster, but that was our experience.	
- 1	My child could care less about these little rattles. The socks, I'm afraid, can't be called socks. I dont know whose feet they are made to fit, but they can't fit my newborn! They have no stretch to them. And she was only 7 pounds when I purchased these! Cute idea though.	
1. 	This works great in our master bath since we have an oversized tub and I need the added height this kneeler provides to reach/bathe my baby. In our other (smaller/lower) tub, I only use a towel -- since the step/kneeler would give me too much height and cause me to bend over more and hurt my back. So ... figure out if you need added height before buying this. If you don't, go with a pad (or just folded towel).	
- 1	The brush doesn't clean the corner well. The foam top never reach the outer edge of the bottle bottom. Also, the brushy bottom splashes soap while not cleaning effectively.	
1. 	The Playtex Ventaire Advanced bottles are by far the best bottles I have used. This set came with 5 bottles in 2 different sizes as well as with extra nipples and extra vent disks, which is wonderful considering how often the bottles get used and being small parts, can get lost. The bottles are excellent for semi-upright feeding because of the angle in the bottle body, which I have found actually does help reduce the number of bubbles in the milk, in turn reducing the gas and colic my baby gets.I use these bottles to pump my breastmilk and they are fantastic and don't leak after repeated use like so many others. The plastic is good quality and doesn't warp over time like other bottles I used before - plus they are microwavable and BPA free. They are also easy to clean. Highly recommend!	
1. 	I have tried several different kinds of bottles and this is by far my favorite. My son will use these as well as the Ventair Natural bottles, but these seem to give him less air therefore less spit-up. They're the easiest to put together as well. Cleaning them is easier then any other bottle. You can re-use the bottle itself and get a new, clean nipple for each feeding rather then having to get a new bottle and nipple since it takes liners. It may be a bit more expensive in the long run with having to buy liners, but it is far more convenient.	
1. 	This little pillow is a life-saver!  I didn't get it until late into my third trimester, but boy has it made sleep easier for me.  I already had a U-shaped pregnancy pillow which has been wonderful to have as well, but the boppy sealed the deal.  Great for when your belly is just big enough that it kinda hangs a little unnaturally when you lie on your side.  Seems like a silly little purchase, but trust me, it is NOT!	
- 1	The marshmallow like clay is not easy to work with.Not sure how others have done it, I had such a hard time getting an impression of the hand, or a foot.	
1. 	My baby had outgrown our hard plastic tub and was uncomfortable in it.  I got this tub as a replacement.  After reading another customer's review I also purchased a sponge for the bottom and have had no problems with him slipping under water.  It smelled VERY STRONGLY of plastic so I had to wait a couple of days to use it, I recommend airing it out.  But once it's blown up, it's ready to go.  It's a little difficult to fill since it's so puffy, I have trouble getting it under the tub faucet but since I need to test the water temperature anyway, I just cup my hands and let the water run into the tub like that.  If you had a tub hose or something it would be easier.  My son loves this tub.  He lays back and luxuriates in his bath and it's very cute to see him &#34;relaxing&#34;.  (8 months old).  The suction cup on the back is awesome for hanging it up out of the way in the shower when we're done with it.  We keep it blown up and don't use the drain plug, we just tip it up to drain it because I read another review that the drain plug got warped and started to leak.  I'm avoiding that by just tipping it up to pour the water out.  Working perfectly so far!!  :)	
1. 	I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!	
1. 	Great product, easy to use. It was not good for my son though. He needed it to help him digest after his night feedings, but he wiggled too much and would roll off of it. The product was great, my son was just not a good baby for the product.	
- 1	After reading reviews, I was so excited about this diaper and bought 2 to try. I wish I hadn't spent my money. While they are super trim, they leak. The leg gussets never fully fit around my sons thighs, they always left a gap. My  son is rather large for his age(3 mo), but he is proportional. He is in the 97th percentile for height, and 96th for weight. He is not chubby, or skinny... and the gussets just never were able to enclose his entire thigh area no matter what setting the diaper is set to.  Gaps in gussets = LEAKS!!! I have never once put this diaper on my son when it didn't leak. I kept trying it thinking that it would fit differently the bigger he got... but it hasn't happened, and I doubt it will, unless he just gains weight in his thighs... On the bright side, the hemp insert seems very absorbent if put in another diaper...	
- 1	To go straight to my points:1) It leaks (I'll upload pictures)2) After 30 minutes of steaming 1 1/2 cup of carrots they were still tough (very!) So I decided to put more water in the chamber and steam it for another 20!... Then &#34;puree it&#34;. When I was done, the carrots (maybe because it leaked all the water) was more looking like grounded coffee than anything else, so I added water and puree it again and it kept the same texture.I didn't want to burn the machine by &#34;pureeing&#34; too much (as it started to make a weird noise after 40 seconds of chopping) so I just got the carrots out (I'll post pictures of this too).I thought carrots might have been the problem, so I steamed apples and it happen again!3) I don't even know if the bottle warmer works, but I have to say, a Tommee Tippee bottle fits comfortably, so it is a good size.4) It is big (specialty for the counter of a 700sq2 feet condo) (10in height x 10in depth x 7in width) and the power cable is kind of short (31 inches)Arghhh I was going to write more, but the Bruins just lost the Stanley Cup... So... I guess this info might be enough.Don't buy this thing, an oven or a microwave and a regular blender will do a better job!	
- 1	This highchair is no good for a younger baby. It does not recline, so it is very hard to feed a young baby, because he is always falling forward. My baby slumps to the side and crys, because he is uncomfortable leaning over the hard wood side of the chair.  The seat pad is very thin, leaving a hard seat for baby to sit on and if your baby throws his head back, he will hit it on the wood. Also, there is very little space for the leg holes, and I find it very hard to get my 17lb 4 1/2 month old in to it. I am glad this high chair was a gift, now I can buy a softer, bigger, reclining highchair, that my baby will like.	
- 1	We received this as a shower gift and have tried over the last 4 months to get our son to use it.  The mirror is the only part he seems interested in and it only entertains him for a few minutes.  Colors are way to dull.  Wish we would have done a little more research before registering for this.	
1. 	This is a handy little diaper holder. It holds wipes and diapers and the compartments on the sides hold miscellaneous items. I wish the side compartments (which are removable) were more sturdy, but other than that it's fine.	
1. 	For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item.  It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides.  (If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.)  I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area.	
1. 	It is a pretty shade of pink, it is soft, and it washes  and dries well.Very pleased with purchase.	
1. 	I love this pillow. I had a Boppy for my first 2 boys. It was ok, but my husband had a hard time putting it around his waist to feed the babies. I decided to buy the Le'Cuddler for our 3rd boy. This has been a great investment, not only for the baby but for me as well. While 6 mos. pregnant I trip down a set of concrete steps landing on my butt bone, I think I broke it. My Dr. advisedme to get a donut pillow. So, I figured, since I wanted a new nursing pillow, why not use this for myself temporarily. It is softer and squishier than the Boppy (the Boppy was kinda hard for my babies heads)and can fit better around the adult's belly. I love that is has a velcro strap for the baby when he is still too young to sit up. The pattern is nice for either gender, so it works out good for our son. The one thing I miss is the removable washable cover, this pillow either has to be spot cleaned or put on the gentle cycle in the wash. Overall, I wish I bought this years ago for my first 2 babies.	
- 1	I did not receive what is pictured, although I was a bit prepared for this by the other reviews.  I was hoping that the seller would have corrected the problem, but apparently not. I received a bracelet that is basically a bunch of big rubber balls on an elastic cord.  The balls are large enough to prevent me from wearing it to work, because it interferes with typing.I have also noticed that the rubber balls collect &#34;stuff&#34; like dust and lint.  Because of this, it either needs to be kept in a plastic bag (which means I could have saved myself a lot of money and bought a regular teether) or it needs to be scrubbed down and air-dried before handing it to baby.	
- 1	I wanted to like this machine but I changed my mind and I thought I would share.  First of all it is small and it is really baby food only machine. You have to cut up the food then turn on the steamer then take out the basket when its done and dump the food into the main container and blend.  You can accomplish the same exact thing in a regular stainless steamer on your stove in the same amount of time.  I tested it and I saved no time it was exactly the same!  The stainless steamer on your stove can also be used as a pot or to steam lager amounts and you will use it forever plus you can use the same steamer on the stove to defrost your baby food.  I freeze my baby food in tiny glass containers and I just stick them directly uncovered into my steamer on the stove.  If you use the silicone containers you just put your baby food in any glass bowl.  I do not use plastic for cooking.  I don't care it is BPA free there are other chemicals in plastic that can leach into the food therefore my stainless steel on the stove method is also safer than Beaba.  Also the Beaba water tank is coated with something.  It smells funny and makes the food smell and I don't trust that either.  It is not stainless.  Others have mentioned this as well so I do not feel safe about steaming in plastic and having the water come from some tank that smells funny.  For blending I just throw the food into a BPA free blender...yes that is plastic but you are not cooking in it and the exposure time is less.  You could use a glass bender or a stainless stick blender even better.  I actually do that as well its just that my BPA free plastic bender is tiny so its almost like the Beaba food maker.  So basically I came to the conclusion I can accomplish the same thing in the same amount of time with my standard kitchen cookware and appliances. I tested it and it took me the same exact time!  Plus my stainless steamer doubles and bottle sanitizer and bottle warmer.  I also have an asparagus cooker which is also great for warming up bottles and sterilizing but I use glass bottles so with plastic bottles you need to add more water so they do not melt sitting agains the metal...same goes for nipples I just boil them instead of cooking them in some plastic that is emitting chemicals into them like ALL THE STERILIZERS AND BOTTLE WARMERS DO!	
1. 	I love that it adjusts to three different hights once fastened to a chair and that the tray can come off and my son can eat with us at the table instead of on the side of the table like he had to in his old highchair. I also like how its portable and the tray can be cleaned easily in the sink and isn't too big to stack with the rest of my dishes.	
1. 	Not easy to install in my opinion (and I am an Ikea installation junkie). However, sturdy and well built.Operation is not too easy, but a five-year-old can do it after a little training. It does take a little effort lifting the gate when opening every single time (that annoys my wife).It is expensive, and the extensions are unnecessarily expensive (why!), but you get your money's worth.	
1. 	Just installed in on my coffee table and it is not an eyesore! It really blends in at the same time that protects my son from the sharp corners. Will be buying more to apply to the underside corners and the leg corners - for some reason my son keeps hitting his head on every corner possible!	
1. 	This sheet is soft.  Fits our Graco pack-n-play.  I haven't tried other brands, so I can't compare the quality, but this one seems to be good.	
1. 	I'm spoiled by the maneuverability of my BOB Revolution, so this is not as maneuverable, but it is handy. I had a c-section, so needed this to get baby to the car in weeks 3-6 if we needed to drive somewhere. It's also easy and quick to fold and store in the trunk. I wish there were a way to add a sun shade (car seat + BOB = total sun shade), but other than that it is handy as a trunk stroller for when at stores, etc. Four stars for their discouraging use with other seats than Graco. It does not snap in like I presume Graco seats do, but sits in there snugly. No worries on flat ground at all.	
1. 	The fact that this unit lights up is the best feature.  I live in an apartment and its sometimes hard to tell if the noises I hear are coming from the monitor or my neighbors.  The lights let me know that what I'm hearing is coming from the baby's room.  I haven't had any real problems with it yet but it does get some static depending where you place the reciever in the room.  It does have two channels, so you can change to a different channel if you are getting a lot of static.  All in all I am satisfied with this monitor.	
1. 	My wife gets a lot of milk leaking from side A when she feeds from side B. We bought these and some O-cal-ette nursing cups at the same time. These are in my view far superior in design to the O-cal-ette (which has a hole where the milk will leak out), because they have no hole for the leak to milk out, well actually they come with two cups, one with holes, one without, and we use the one without. Great. Also they're apparently comfortable enough to put on while feeding.However!These are not 5 star because... they don't hold enough milk! So we are still wondering if we can find such a product which will fit inside a bra in similar way, but passively collect a larger amount of breastmilk.	
1. 	I bought this for my son's sippy cups because the large brush came with the small brush to get inside spouts, straws, etc.  I didn't realize that the small brush fits up into the base but at least it keeps them both together.  The suction cup is a nice idea too.  This is a nice thing to have even without kids.  I find myself using both brushes all the time.  I often have a vase with fresh flowers and can't reach my hand inside my favorite vase.  I used to shove a dish rag down inside the vase with a long handled spoon but this works better.  And sometimes I will use the brush to scrub the bottom of pots and the little brush to get into crevices.  The little brush is really great at getting inside the newer silicone spouts on toddler cups and under the silicone lip where dirt collects.  And we live in a humid climate where mold can start growing very fast.  So this is good to have and it isn't too expensive.	
1. 	I have been using this bath tub for the past 4 months for my son. He is 5 months now. I just recently removed the mesh lining. This bath tub is really sturdy and has served its purpose well. However one of the bumps in the bath tub has bothered me. There is a high bump in the bath tub that would poke my little one in the tail bone when I had the mesh lining in and leave a red mark after I would get him out of the bath. Now that I have took the mesh lining out this bump seems to be a little too close only leaving him with a little space for him to sit on (if you look at the picture you can tell what I am talking about). So when I wash his bottom he has slipped right off it. Needless to say I have to be extra careful when I do this. Overall this bath tub is a decent product. I love that it adapts with the growth of your child.	
1. 	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did...dirty diapes and soaked diapers.....I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag. No need for deodorizers.I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty...even did while daughter sleep and no noise! I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell! This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.	
- 1	I guess other people found this helpful, which is why I registered for it.  But when I tried filing my newborn's nails, nothing happened. I think it would've taken ages to file her nails down with this.  On the flip side, it is very safe since accidentally filing my baby's finger won't hurt her.  This is one of those baby items I have never and will never use.	
1. 	We began by using this in the bathroom while potty training my son but now it travels all over the house. He carries it to the kitchen sink to wash his hands, help cook or bake and work on projects in the garage. I love that it is small and light enough for him to carry and still so useful!	
- 1	This is a waste of money. It makes an awful buzzing sound like the motor is broken and it is very slow and soft. I would not buy this ever again and would have returned it if my husband had not tossed the package on me!	
1. 	These are BY FAR, my favorite bibs. We have tried many & they always fall apart quickly. These clean up super easy & dry in a matter of minutes. I always have a dry one ready for the next meal! Other brands may be more &#34;durable&#34; fabric, but they are bulky, uncomfortable, & take 24 hrs to fully dry. These are great!	
- 1	I don't even understand why cloth diapering companies sell anything with velcro on it.  I love these covers, but the velcro just doesn't last.  I think it's really the nature of velcro and it shouldn't be on reusable covers.  So be sure to invest wisely and get the kind with snaps.  I know I'll never buy covers with velcro again after these have deteriorated.  Otherwise, a great product!	
1. 	Thanks to other reviewers, we knew what we were getting when we ordered these &#8211; but they were still a bit of a surprise.  Nevertheless, they're really handy. Reusable/washable, but almost cheap enough that you don't really care what happens to them.	
1. 	The first crib they shipped me was damaged in the shipment, so I asked them to ship another one...the second one was also damaged...I was able to take pieces from both to make a useable one...It is a great crib! It folds up and can be rolled on it's wheels even when folded. It can be assembled very quickly. So I rate the item very high, but check out your product when you receive it because the FedEx guys really beat ours up!	
- 1	I ordered this because of the good reviews, but it doesn't work for us. First it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, which has nothing to do with the product but was especially frustrating since I'm now returning it. It doesn't fit our island or dining room table. The arms are really long, requiring a pretty deep space. It's also much more cumbersome than expected. I thought we'd just fold it up and take it out to dinner with us, but it doesn't collapse very small. We didn't use it to actually feed the baby since it didn't work in our kitchen, but I could tell the space between the counter and the baby was too wide and we would end up with more food on the floor than anywhere else.It does seem like a solid design, so if it works in your kitchen then it's probably a good purchase.	
- 1	I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably.	
- 1	1. Steady, non-slip base keeps spills to a minimum ... not even close! There is nothing none-slip about this plate - it slides all over the high-chair tray (and off it) very easily.2. Plate and ring separate for ease of cleaning ... the ring is useless at best and very annoying at worst. It is just one more thing for baby to pull off the plate and launch to the floor. Why it is detachable makes no sense at all.3. The walls around each compartment are far too low - food gets pushed together very quickly. Baby doesn't mind the food all mixed together, but the whole point of a plate with sections is that it will increase the chances of the food staying separate, despite baby's pushing it around with a spoon.This is a cute looking plate, but in my experience its functionality and usefulness are poor.	
1. 	By 6 weeks, we had determined that our son was a hearty drooler and spitter-upper.  I knew terry bibs were absorbent, but they would also soak through to baby's clothes.  Made of terry with a waterproof layer in the middle, these bibs were my answer.Pros:-I stick them in the dryer with my regular laundry, and they come out just fine.  They're not crinkly, they don't curl.-Solid colors!  Nothing with silly sayings or designs!  I don't love the peach color in this pack, but we just put that color on him at home.-They're very thin yet soak up a surprising amount of spit up and drool.-They take up little room in your diaper bag, so you can toss 5 or 6 in there.-They've fit my son since he was 6 weeks old.  He's 6 months now, we're still using them and they still fit great.-The shape of these bibs is perfect.  He's very well protected, but if he's wearing a hood in the cold or strapped into his car seat, I can still comfortably pull the bib out to protect him.Common Sense Tips:-These never soaked through for me, but I also change his bib regularly when it gets wet or soiled.  These are inexpensive enough that I bought 3 packs, so I always have a clean bib that coordinates with his outfit.  If the color doesn't bother you, you don't need to buy that many.-Fasten the velcro before you toss them in the laundry or they'll stick to your sweaters.-I put a clean bib on over the dirty bib, and then take off the dirty bib underneath in one motion.  My baby knows when that ten second window of bib freeness is and will hork on me otherwise.-If you're concerned about the velcro rubbing baby's neck, put it on so the soft side of the velcro faces baby's skin.  I haven't had this problem because the velcro holds so securely and is completely covered when fastened.-Sometimes spit up rolls down the front of the bib based on the angle.  If you're quick and fold the bib to catch it, it will soak up the mess.  Bib change time, but not whole outfit change time.I love these so much that I've started to send them as baby gifts to friends.  They love them too!	
1. 	This product is a true time, not to mention life saver!  It completely cuts the time in half of boiling water.  If only it can hold more bottles.	
1. 	This is ideal for very small babies, not bigger babies (3-4 months plus) becauise it gets a bit uncomfortable for them.  There is a bump in the middle that is the problem, but its also a sign that you need to change th position of your baby in THIS tub and start thinking about washing in the regular tub.	
- 1	I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say recline.  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the in-between stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position. ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat. ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them. - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base. - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.	
1. 	This rattle is soooo cute! So colorful and fun for any child -- and for a dog (just be careful of the antlers for child or dog) LOL - really cute. Highly recommend.	
1. 	This product was just as advertised. In original packaging and sealed. If you want a lot of bottles for a good price, this is it.	
- 1	The way this thing works is that the top twists shut when the lid is closed to prevent the smell from getting out.  If the bag is 1/2 full, there isnt enough bag left to gather as the top twists shut & the lid bends and makes a loud sound as if you are breaking it.  I dont know if this is their way of trying to get you to spend more by only filling the bags 1/2 full.  I would buy something else if I had to do it again.	
1. 	So worth the price. I put mashed bananas or frozen baby food in them and let her chew away. It really helps with teething!	
1. 	Tihs play yard works well for us right now. We needed a space for our 10 month old to safely play while we did other things (cook, clean, deal with the pets, etc.). It's sturdy enough that he can pull up on it.  However, we he gets going, he can slide it across our wood floor.I like that it easily folds. When we have company over or the cleaning lady is coming or we just don't want to look like a playground anymore (!), we just can fold it up and slide it in a closet. Overall, it meets our needs and we are happy with the purchase.	
- 1	We were using Tommy Tippee bottles when my daughter was first born and almost immediately she was throwing up entire bottles. My doctor actually suggested us moving over to the Dr. Brown's bottles and wouldn't ya know it! The throwing up stopped instantly.Washing them are a problem because there are 2 other mechanicals besides the bottles that you have to wash and in order to get them adequately clean, you should really do this by hand. No big deal, but I spend 20 extra minutes a day washing all the components of these bottles by hand (even though they are dish washer safe).Now for the Biggest problem of all with these bottles - they leak and sometimes for no reason at all.  This morning I put the bottle on the nightstand and it was about half full, had not been tipped over and not bothered at all, the next time I picked it up to give it to my 11 month old she got doused with milk. This happens on an almost daily basis and every day it infuriates me and I yell I HATE THESE BOTTLES!!!.I really have tried different bottles with her like Avent to keep the colic and throwing up down, but for some reason these leaky, messy, pain in the ^@(#&)@)# bottles seem to be the only ones that keep her from throwing up. So with that, I am willing to put up with this long enough that her little tummy doesn't hurt and move into sippy cups as soon as she gets the hang of them.I HATE THESE BOTTLES!! ARRRRGGGGGG!	
1. 	We will be buying a second for our other carseat. The price can't be beat and it weathered the trip to Alaska, around Alaska and back. It fits our Britax Marathon easy. (Other bags are a stretch to house the Marathon.)This has nothing to do with the quality of the bag, but I do wish it was in stock more often. The two times I have come here to order it, it is out of stock. Last time I ended up ordering it from a different vendor and paying more plus paying for shipping. Please Amazon - get this in stock before the holidays!	
- 1	These are not nearly as good as the yellow ones. They leak every time. I use them with the Pura bottles and have used the yellow Avent spouts since the beginning but have been unable to find them so I finally just bought these thinking they would be just as good. They're not.	
1. 	My son's PT recommended we get these for help during tummy time- they held his interest as we moved them	
- 1	My kids still put toys in their mouths, and right out of the gate I felt that a few of the edges were a bit too roughly cut to be safe for small children.  It's also very easy to have small fingers pinched between the wood due to the elastic band holding the toy together.  It is attractive, though not very turtle-like in appearance.  Not much going on here, but not charming enough to fit the 'classic' toy formula either.  I can't recommend this for anything beyond a nice looking coaster.	
- 1	There was a lot I didn't like about this product. The main problem was that upon opening the package, I attempted to unsnap the waist snaps on it, at which point two of them immediately flew off into oblivion, rendering the product completely useless and depositing a few tiny pink choking hazards on my floor.Even so, I attempted to put an insert in the pocket, out of curiosity. I had read many reviews on the product, and a frequent complaint was that the pocket was too narrow to put anything in it. This is true. Literally. I can't even fit my hand in there to deposit the insert, let alone my hand AND an insert.If you're looking for a worthwhile product, Sunbaby makes some great pocket trainers.	
1. 	In the middle of the night when the baby is screaming and you need milk - FAST.  Carefull to check the milk, sometimes can be too hot too fast!	
- 1	The spoon tip turns white if the food could be described as anything warmer than luke warm. For beginner babies that is an appropriate temperature. However, because the spoon is so sensitive, we ended up feeling it with our hands every time anyway.	
- 1	does not fit properly	
1. 	This toy hammock certainly is jumbo, fits the description perfectly. For some reason, it never occurred to me that even though this item is clearly billed for STUFFED animals, that items such as Beanie Babies or other bean filled animals are much heavier and the item will sag a lot or will break under the stress of all the weight. Either way, the stuffed animals that my son did have are in there, off the ground and it has stayed up perfectly.	
1. 	My son absolutely hated tummy time.  I have tried absolutely everything to get him to spend more time on his stomach, but nothing worked.  I know how much I love water, and hoped that my son would as well, so on an impulse I bought this item.  I'm very glad I did because now my son participates in tummy time.  He doesn't scream and cry anymore.  I'm so happy that I had the whim to buy this product and I would recommend it to any parent who struggles to give their child tummy time.	
1. 	If you are planning to stay at home and you are going to pump only a couple of times a day (maybe 2 or 3) this is a great pump. I didn't know how to use it at first but after calling Medela's customer support line I was able to use it easily. I didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout the day (Your hands would hurt).But other than that I think is a great pump for the price.	
1. 	My son was an early crawler & this was a a MUST HAVE. We lived in a townhouse & couldn't gate the stairs going up & down from living room so this worked to keep him in one area. Especially helpful as I'm a stay-at-home-mom & sometimes you just need those few seconds to leave the room to pee, answer phone, whatever. I also bough the extender to make it as LARGE as possible. 2 panels larger to be exact. My only complaint is that it is a little heavy & hard fold, which proved to be a pain when our home was on the market & I had to snatch & fold it up quickly for a showing. Definitely pinched my fingers a few times in my rushing around trying to do it quickly.  But the good news is it's VERY sturdy b.c it is so heavy. MY son could pull, hang do whatever & this gate held him IN. And my son is VERY tall for his age  and this gate stood the test of a very active toddler. Definitely hanging on to it for baby #2!!	
- 1	Haven't been able to get my 8 month old to use these. Have been trying for a few months. Love the idea, but she won't touch them. I tried them too, and can't blame her. The taste and feel of the mesh is not very pleasant.	
1. 	My son is 4-months old and the sleepsacks I had were all way too thick and warm for the summer. This cotton sleepsack is think, breathable and soft for him to wear in the summer to bed and for naps.	
1. 	They're exactly what they say they are, they work, they're well made. Will continue to purchase when I need replacements.	
- 1	I actually like the materials of this product and the fact that the cap is attached.  However, because of the prduct design, they waste at least an ounce (of the 4 total it will hold) is left in the pouch.  The fill opening in the top of the pouch is made of a solid material and does not allow for the food to be sqeezed out.  Even my 3-year-old can't suck hard enough to get all of the food out of it.  It ends up wasting about a fourth of what you put in.	
1. 	this is a wonderful changing pad.  i appreciate the contours because it does seem to make the baby more comfortable and secure.  i highly recommend it!!	
- 1	This mat has too many pieces.  If you get it for your little one to play on, you'll be forever putting together all the little bits and pieces, which are likely choking hazards anyway.  Get a mat that's all one piece.	
1. 	I wish they could get a more precise fit so they don't move around on the toilet, but otherwise, my 18MO stays out of the crapper... finally.	
1. 	I was shocked at the many negative reviews!  I received this tub as a gift and have used it with my baby successfully. He's now 5 weeks old, is very long and fits in the tub on the sling with no problem. The shower was great with the newborn and I was able to wash him in no time. I haven't used the sling in the sink yet mostly because the sink-bathing thing creeps me out. My one complaint is that pushing the button on the shower is difficult for me but that's because I have tendinitis in both my wrists. This tub us cheaper at BuyBuy Baby, so definitely check it out there first before ordering it on here.	
1. 	I have both the boppy and brest friend. Th boppy doesn't compare to this product, it is the BEST. It's so comfortable and the pocket to keep things in is so handy.It perfectly positions your baby and helps him/her falll asleep. THe boppy is good for putting your baby down for a minute while you do stuff, other than that, brest freind is priceless. the only thing is when you are beat tired, it's a pain to strap on but well worth it once it's on.	
- 1	When I received this item I was excited. Finally. Then I unwrapped the item to realise that during shipment, one hinge had been completely broken off and the other cracked and ready to drop off with first possible use. What good is this product now since the cap must be in place in order for the heat to remain inside of the warmer to be any sort of effective. I am TOTALLY dissatisfied. This is the first item I have ever received from Amazon in this state. With all the hectic daily routines and unpredictable moments which motherhood can bring, the last thing I need is to deal with a damaged product. This item is now useless as the steam will obviously not be sealed inside.	
1. 	This playgate is great! We used it for Christmas around our tree so our 1 year olds wouldn't get into it. The gate swings open nicely so we could get in or out to get to the tree. We have also taken pieces out and put it around furniture and worked nicely. It is kind of difficult to take pieces out to shorten it. Overall we're happy with it.	
1. 	My 2 1/2 year olds highchair was terrible, so I threw it out on his first b-day. This chair is great, but I dont see anything miraculous going on.PROS-* Very comfortable, my son always says everything should be like cooshie* All one solid piece of foam, bo creveces to get food stuck in* It doesnt slip due to the material, a plus for a wiggly toddler* Sits him up high enough to eat* Can be easily taken off, no straps and all that stuff* Cute color, not bright and pastely* Very light weightCONS-* Is not at all portable, I dont know about you but I wouldnt want to travel with something the size of a large platter everywhere!* The carry case is cheap and really the size of a diaper bag... uhh sorry I already have one of those* leaves his feat dangling, although this is a problem occuring in MANY booster seatsThis is just a booster. I like it and I am glad I chose it but I dont really understand the amazing changes in children with a booster (not that I am denying the fact that those reviews are true) I just dont see how this cooshie could do it. My son is still fussy, and will get down when he feels like it, this comfortable booster doesnt stop him. He loves his booster and loves being a big bow v.s sitting in a highchair like his little brother	
1. 	We use this gate as a pressure mount gate between the living room and the kitchen. Have also used it before for her bedroom. So far we like the ease of use, and the good price. We also like that we have the option to mount it if we need it.	
- 1	This mat is very cheaply and poorly made - also much smaller than other similar mats. We purchased this when my baby started rolling around at 3-4 months... the mat would not stay together and all of the pieces would break apart from hardly any movement. We returned it and got an awesome mat we love from costco!	
- 1	We went with the Graco Snugride because it received good safety ratings and fit our budget. Our newborn son fit nicely in it and seemed secure - the first few times. After the first couple of months I started to notice some definite drawbacks:1) It is NOT particularly lightweight, and even though my son was a smaller baby, it still got really heavy really fast. After about 3mos. I refused to use it anymore. We put it in hubby's car and put the convertible seat in mine.2) The straps adjust from behind, and they are the kind that need to be threaded individually. So, if the season changes (or you just live in a variable region like we do) you'll find yourself fighting with it every time your child wears anything heavier than a onesie. THEN you have to re-thread again on the next warm (lighter clothes) day. And trust me - trying to adjust those things when you're in a hurry to be somewhere will frazzle your nerves in no time!3) The handle was not very steady. What I mean is, these seats are pushed and pulled constantly, usually at a sideways angle in and out of the car or at your hip. I found that after just a few trips, the handle felt loose and would rock a little from side to side, and even back & forth slightly when supposedly locked in place.4) Last thing, but definitely my biggest concern. The anchor strap slips! You don't notice it the first few times, and you probably won't ever notice it unless you ride in the back seat or test it occasionally. Because it was in my husband's car, we didn't notice it at first. Then I rode back there one day and found that the base was sliding like crazy - the BASE! The strap (it was the LATCH strap) had gradually gotten looser and looser, even though we used a towel to even out the seat (as recommended) and pulled the strap as tight as humanly possible. We fixed it, then found that several weeks later it was loose again!I would accept that the loose strap thing was a fluke of this particular seat (since I've never heard anybody else complain of it), but taken as a whole we will NOT be using this seat again. Go with Britax or Chicco!	
- 1	Do you see the kid on the box?  That was my boy after I proudly stuck his plate to the suction cup and walked away to get his drink.  We have a wood table, so it might work better on laminate or slick surfaces.  Very disappointed!	
- 1	I have had this product for a month, used it maybe 20 nights, and it has quit working! And yes, I changed the batteries, nothing... I give it 2 stars because the lights were great for my baby when it did work. The sound quality was not great, so we just used it for the light projection. I'm rather bummed that it quit working.	
- 1	WHAT HAPPENED TO ORBIT BABY?I have owned an Orbit Baby G2 Travel System and have enjoyed it's thoughtful design, smooth operation, and fancy fabric materials used. The price they commanded then fully warrants it.Now on it's third revision, this is technically the first product release since they have been acquired by ErgoBaby - a company I also patronize with their organic baby carriers.WHAT CHANGED?For one, the fabric. It's now thicker and rougher. The tactile feel makes is not elegant to the touch. The previous G2 is sleek and smooth.Second, the retractable plastic mechanism has an operation that isn't smooth. It's obviously just a simple plastic teeth with a spring underneath that operation and you have to pull harder to extend the sunshade. This is nitpicking, of course, but for this price I expect the smoothest operation possible even if they have to make use of ball bearings and magnets. Again, at this price.Third, although I've accepted the fact that colors on websites are not as accurate in person but when my Blueberry sunshade arrived it was lighter in hue than a dark blueberry/purplish expectation.Fourth and the most important is washability. It used to be I can unhook the whole sunshade fabric away from it's plastic support for easy washing via zippers. Now the sunshade is sewn into the plastic support so if you have to wash it (and the manual for the G3 doesn't state how to wash it versus the manual for the G2 model that readily discloses it) you have to wash the whole fabric and it's support system and hope there is nothing in there that rusts in time. Okay, you can disassemble the plastic support, but you'll need to force the tabs with a screwdriver and hope the plastic doesn't break or wear over time. Again, the manual doesn't disclose this so I don't know how much support they will provide going this route. t wish they made it easy to remove just like in the G2 model.SO WHAT ARE THE FEATURES DEBBIE DOWNER?Okay, same as before this latest sunshade is rated to UPF50+.The fabric, like all Orbit Baby fabrics, is certified by Oeko-Tex standard to be healthy and clean for your baby.Another plus is that you customize your stroller sunshade from the get go without Orbit Baby having to force a basic color. When you purchase the G3 Stroller Seat, it now doesn't come with a sunshade. The price is less than the G2 Stroller Seat exactly the same amount as the cost of the sunshade. So make sure to buy a sunshade to go along with your Orbit Baby G3 stroller purchase. You don't have to stick with black. I have the Black, Blueberry and Teal colors. At the rate we stroll around the Downtown city, it's easier to wash the sunshade and switch colors while the other dry up.OVERALLI can only wish ErgoBaby with their purchase of Orbit Baby would go back to the roots of why Orbit Baby became known. Yes, they stuck with the killer design that will make modern parents and especially Dads proud to push a stroller around.But they also made the construction too basic and retained the high price that it seems unbelievable for previous Orbit Baby owners like myself to see the changes that is making it look and feel cheap.I would have expected for this G3 version, they made a peek-a-boo window so you can still see your baby when he/she is forward facing. My umbrella stroller has this feature. A full size stroller should have this as well as a no-brainer option especially at this price.For first time Orbit Baby owners, of course they wouldn't know the difference of what changed and how the change in ownership affected this third revision.By the way this fabric fits the G2 strollers, but with the close out pricing of the G2 accessories and the better material of the G2 I would not recommend getting this G3 sunshade for your G2 stroller at all.Hoping that the G4 revision will bring Orbit Baby back to it's roots.	
- 1	This cup holder had to be placed so far toward the bottom of the carseat that my daughter couldn't reach it.  Then it broke after only about a month of use!	
- 1	this was quite possibly the most flimsy thing i have bought to date. out of the pack i got spare parts: the eye on one of the smaller shades came right out when i picked it up. now i am left with two and i am constantly having to hold it down when my son (17 mths) is in the car because i am afraid that he will yank on the edges and make fragments of them as well.i somehow think they could've been made a little better.but once you hold it in place it does offer a little protection from the sun.note:the shade i received is not the one in this picture: mine just had one eye let each in the center along with rubber nipples to attach.	
- 1	not good for us at all.it spills all over my bag. i don't know what to do with this.i don't like this Sipster cup!	
- 1	I've read these bottles are made in England so I thought that the quality will be superior but how wrong I was. It started to leak after 2 months of use. I liked that bottle cuz it was pretty small and comfortable for my child to grip, but leaking takes all good away. Be wise, don't buy it!	
- 1	While having a digital baby monitor is a novel idea, the execution of this particular product left me unimpressed.  It is sturdy, however the battery life on this is non-existent.  My iPod statys charged longer than this baby monitor.  And it does not have a rechargeable battery pack. So it is best to keep it in the docking station using the AC adaptor.  The display monitor is adequate, but a bit dark. I did like the voice activation feature though.Recommend pursuing a baby monitor with the option of rechargable batteries rather than this one.	
1. 	This is a great changing pad.  The contours on the side keep the baby from being able to roll around, making for easiest clean-up if the baby has a messy diaper.  It is extra long (34 inches), allowing for baby to have extra head and feet room as he/she grows.  If you buy this product, be sure to buy covers that have adequate length to accomodate this changing pad, though.  I use the ultra plush ones, and they fit well.	
- 1	This item was missing a toy but most importantly it doesn't go Hugh enough, my some is tall, great for shorter babies Nader 30 in	
- 1	maybe he will like it later but for now my son is 8 months its just too heavy and clunky and even when he does bite it its hard for him to make it vibrate	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these...one for my 3 yo and one for my 20 mo old.  They both love to have their own bowl of snacks but are always spilling.  These are WONDERFUL because they can carry the snacks around and I don't have to worry about them spilling.  Also great for eating out...keeps them happy and occupied while we eat dinner.  My 20 mo old figured it out in just minutes.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish there was a storage lid you could put on either over or in place of the other lid...that way you could store the snacks in the cup (in your diaper bag or at home) w/o them getting stale.	
1. 	Be sure to use the sealing discs between this and the bottle or milk will get everywhere!	
1. 	they are easy to use and operate.  Baby can't take off or manipulate, and they kinda look stylish lol...i constantly get compliments. maybe they are joking when complimenting, but i really do love these things.	
- 1	There are a few problems with the design.  The biggest one is that the part that is supposed to be under the kid's head is too thick and makes my son's head fall forward.  I wish it was totally flat or maybe had puffier parts that go on the sides of the head (similar to the neck support).The pillows on the sides of the neck are ok although my son's face looked a bit squished when I looked at him (pic attached).It is too bulky for the kid to have it on while awake, at least for an almost-2-year-old, so it needs to be put on after the child falls asleep.  I guess this would be a problem with any of pillows like that.When he was asleep I put it on and he stayed like that for 45 minutes or so.  When I tried to adjust his head tot he other side, the magnets let go and I couldn't make them stick any more.I am going to continue my search for a travel pillow.	
1. 	solo viertes un poco de agua en este esterilizador, introduces los teteros y lo metes al microondas y listooo, ya estan excelente para darle la leche al bebe....	
1. 	I think this pillow is a must for any pregnant woman who struggles with sleep at night. It helps support your back and hips.  It is however really large and it took me a few nights to learn how to sleep with it (almost like there is a technique to it).  But once I figured it out, my sleeps have been as good as they're going to get while being pregnant.  I sleep comfortably with this pillow.  My only disappoint is that I wish they made a cover for it so that I can wash it.	
- 1	After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its flimsiness for myself at a local Babis R Us store), I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif.  I found several, but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy Twinkle Twinkle bedding set.  It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price, but good luck!  I was so excited when I found it!	
- 1	Glad we only got one of these. I've had my fair share of sippy cup reviews with three little ones. I preferred not to use this wobbly, hard to put cap on without spilling milk (handles get in the way). Also its germ infested...you need to pop off the dome slider that covers the straw, otherwise mold grows in there (even when run through the dishwasher). There also is a film of milk left behind (unlike any other cups) and this takes forever to dry because of its shape. Also mold grows in between the weighted base and clear cup...doesn't effect its use, just gross.	
1. 	I was using the mediums, which seem to be the standard size. I couldn't seem to effectively pump enough milk until I decided to try the small size. What a difference!	
1. 	This seat has weathered two kids and lots of travel. It folds up conveniently to pop in the trunk. It adjusts to every size and I have never encountered a chair I couldn't attach this to.I have taken it into restaurants as an alternative to booster seats or high chairs. We haul it on vacation with us. We use it with the tray or without. And we always find ourselves commenting that we need to buy a second for when we have company over with kids. My kids don't use their highchairs for long simply because they WANT to be at the table with the rest of the family. With this seat, they can do that from a very young age.Highly recommended.	
1. 	My son hated stiff bibs and would try to rip them off immediately.  These are our favorites.  They fold up very small for taking with you, and are very simple to wash.	
- 1	I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... Would not suggest.	
1. 	So easy to use and works well.  Not bulky, easy to install, soft and comfortable.  Works with our Britax B-Agile.  7 month old enjoyed it from the get go.  Versatile.  We've used it in 50 degree to 30 degree weather.  We can cover our daughter up almost completely and add a hat so that she's very toasty, but she can pull her hands out or tuck them in depending on her comfort.  We fold up the stroller with this attached.	
- 1	I carefully evaluate product reviews on just about everything I buy! Against my better judgment, I went ahead and purchased this product despite the negative reviews I read out of desperation to safely co-sleep with my newborn!This product is NOT a good everyday option for parents who co-sleep on a nightly basis! It is made for smaller babies as it is not long enough to grow with your baby, and will not be useful for more than a month or so unless your baby is on the smaller side of average.Also, the sheet is a pain to wash! I had to purchase a lingerie mesh bag in order to wash this, because there Velcro strips on the sheet that will literally stick to everything in the wash! Also, you cannot use regular bassinet type or smaller sheets, as this is the only sheet that will snuggly fit this product.In addition, the mattress pad is VERY noisy and flat. My baby woke up every time he moved due to the noise. Also, it just seems uncomfortable and not very firm like most baby sleep pads or mattresses. I understand that the product is made to be flimsy in order to fold for travel purposes, so just beware if this is a product you are purchasing as an everything thing!I ultimately kept the item because we travel, and it works for just an overnight stay in a hotel. My baby still doesn't sleep the best on it, but it's better than putting him in the hotel bed with us.	
1. 	Good price and easy to use. very convenient storage. I could only find this on Amazon. I highly recommend buying this product for your nursery.	
- 1	I was disappointed with the quality of these after washing them the first time.  They looked like they had been through the washer a dozen times after just once.  After a couple more washes, they started really freying and falling about so I just stopped using them.  Very disappointed as these matched our bedding.	
1. 	My baby has always used Evenflo nipples.  At 3 months, he was having a hard time getting the milk to flow through the 0-3 month nipples, so we bought some of the 3-6 month and 6+month nipples.  The 6 month nipples flowed too fast even at 5 months, but now that he's 6 months, they work perfectly for him.	
- 1	I recieved this as a gift at one of my baby showers. I thought it was going to be great, but it is a big old mess. There are way to many folds and pockets, took me 5 minutes just to get it onto the cart. And the folds into a handy compact. Yea right, I'm not sure a genius could fold this thing back up into the little carrying case it claims to fold into. It is very cute, but not very user friendly.	
- 1	For the price it's not worth it.  I was really trying to find a walker with all swivel wheels but I guess they don't make them anymore.  Only the front wheels spin 360 degrees while the back ones only go forward/backward.  Kind of hard for babies to understand the mechanics of his first car, I mean I told him it was going to be a 4 point turn to get out of that corner but he didn't &#34;get it&#34;.Also, there are indentions in the back of plastic where you can imagine the rear of the car having lights, etc.  Well they don't even provide you with stickers (like they do on most plastic toys) and also on the rear view mirror, they could have a cute mirror like silver sticker on it, but they just leave it black.  how boring.  If it's because they are afraid the babies will get it wet or peel it, they do have one sticker on it already on the little play tray so why not give more?I returned this walker for a refund and looking for an alternative.  I also received a black car instead of red.  The red looks cooler.	
1. 	i used similar-looking bibs that i'd gotten from babiesrus, but when i tried to rinse them with soapy water, the plastic separated from the fabric over time. These bibs are washable, waterproof (like cup-upside-down-on-bib-but-clothes-are-dry waterproof) and i love that they velcro on the side.	
- 1	I was very disappointed when my 5 month old threw this toy to this side. She didn't even look at it twice. Maybe when she gets a little older and is able to push the buttons she will like it. It got really rave reviews but who knows all babies are different.	
1. 	My son is almost 14 months and went from swaddling to this sleep sack.  He wears the XL now.  I like the fact that he has extra coverage at night but that it's safe too (blankets may be kicked off or cover his face).  These wash well, stains come out easily, and keep my son warm.  LOVE.	
1. 	I LOVE this cover! Of all of the 'baby' things I received, this is probably one of the most practical and most useful gifts. I can't imagine being without it, and I have been buying them for friends as gifts since I received mine. I highly recommend this cover if you are a nursing mom.	
- 1	The helmet seemed a necessity once the baby started pulling up. However, we used it for a total of 30min. The helmet gets so hot, the baby was dripping sweat within 5 minutes of having this on. I read the reviews about this problem, but figured it would be ok since it was winter when we bought it, and we keep the house cooler than the average person. I dread to think of parents putting this on a baby in the summer. It would be borderline dangerous. Supervise your baby and save your $$$.Update 6/2012Having mentioned that this is not a good product should not deter you from finding something else suitable. I don't think that we should overprotect our children, but head injuries are serious. My 2.5 year old slipped on a wet tile floor and had major behavior changes for 3 weeks as a result. Unless the head bump causes a concussion, the medical profession is useless. So although in my case, I was sure the head bump affected my child, three different doctors told me it was okay as long as he didn't throw up. (I was about to throw up at them for being so useless.) Pre-verbal children may not be able to articulate what they feel and how the head bump affects them. Supervise your children, re-configure your living areas, wash your floors only when children sleep, and why not, try to find some kind of contraption that protects accident-prone children.	
- 1	We saw this in a boutique here in town, and knew we could get it cheaper on Amazon!  We received the elephant bank and immediately went to put our daughter's coins into it.  The bottom cork wouldn't work - after repeated attempts, it was clear the cork cannot stay in the wooden bank.While this is adorable - it's useless as a bank.	
- 1	We initially really liked the changing pad, but after about a week's worth of regular use (5-8 times a day) the outside ripped where the velcro is sewn in. We also found that the plastic that the baby is changed on stains very easily. It's a good size, but poor quality, someone didn't think the design through	
1. 	I was a little skeptical when ordering these because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I went with my instinct and got them. My baby's nursery currently has all cherry furniture with green/pink decorations and I wanted something that would make it pop so we decided to get white wicker baskets that would fit on her changing table and make it stand out. I was a bit concerned about the sticky and smelly paint that a few reviews mentioned but fortunately/lucky for us, mine did not have that problem. Mine came packaged nicely with no broken pieces and as white as can be and without any messy sticky/smelly paint. The sizes are perfect to put diapers, wipes, lotions or whatever you need at hand for baby and all three fit on the same shelf. (I've uploaded a pic) I think I may eventually decide to change the liners but for now we're going to use the ones that came with it.	
- 1	The product seems like a good idea if it wasn't for the following two CONS:- Makes the baby's head and torso hot and sweaty- The velcro left rash on the back of my baby's neck from rubbingI returned mine.	
1. 	This is an excellent product that works as advertised.  The bottles don't leak, they're easy to clean, and the nipple is much better than most other baby bottles.  They also have a nice shape and they look pretty nice too.My one major complaint is about the way the product comes packaged.  It does not include extra nipples.  Basically this product gives you three 9 ounce bottles for about $12 (current price).  For only $20, you can get thePlaytex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set, which includes FIVE bottles, several extra nipples of different sizes, extra bottle caps, and extra vent disks.  The newborn starter kit is a much better value.  On the other hand, if you just want a few bottles plain and simple, this is definitely the product to buy.  Very pleased.	
- 1	I bought this and another one at our local store.I have twin babies that have had this toy since three months old. When they were three months the thing was just too heavy and they couldnt grasp it because of the rings. So i put it away and forgot about it. Now they are six month old and i gave it to them today. Its made of such a hard material, or whatever it is, that when they miss their mouth and hit themselves in the forehead it hurts them! And me (i tried like another review :). The rings around the middle just gets in the way. I will be throwing these away. Its just not a great design for little babies who are still working on their fine motor skills. Way too solid and hard for them.	
1. 	NO other swaddle kept our daughter contained and asleep like this one did. It's not tough to use, but it is hard to do with a sleeping baby. I would often rock or nurse my daughter to sleep as a newborn and then want to wrap her up and transfer her to the crib without waking her. It was tricky with this swaddle. My other complaint is that it only comes in one size. We had a big baby (9+ lbs at birth), so she outgrew this swaddle long before she outgrew the need for it. Sadly, no other swaddle worked as well. Wish it came in fleece and in bigger sizes!	
- 1	These bigs are nice and soft, like all of the aden + anais products.  However, they are extremely large!  Much too big for my 8 month old.  I would love these in a smaller size, so they can be used as teething/drool bibs.	
1. 	With all the bells and whistles out today on baby products, all you want is for your baby to be safe and comfortable in their tub.  This is definitely the case with this tub.  It is contoured perfectly to cradle your newborn and the padded backrest keeps him/her from slipping.  I did not use the cradle, although it is a nice feature, because I felt it made my baby too cold.  This simple design works perfect and fits on single and double sinks.  I love that I will be able to use it into toddlerhood.  The plug and built in wash basin are convenient added features.	
- 1	The green ring is as hard as a rock and doesn't make a sound.  The purple ring doesn't make any noise. Fisher Price made another one where all rings make a noise and are soft. They are green, orange, and zebra striped. Buy that one.	
1. 	We bought this play area to keep our 15 month old daughter safe while we worked outside.  She loves it and plays well.  It is easy to set up and tear down and takes a matter of seconds.  Best of all, is that it is very light and easy to carry, as well as having an excellent carry strap.	
- 1	This did nothing for our baby in terms of blocking the sun on our Toyota Highlander.  It's not really tinted very dark and tends to fall off the windows.  I would not recommend this at all.	
- 1	We used to use just a regular trashcan with an airtight lid to hold dirty diapers, but there's only so many times you can wash it out or put some baking soda in the bottom before you need a new container. So, when we were visiting a friend I noticed that they had an actual diaper pail, not just a trashcan, and that it worked really well. It was a diaper champ and it worked great. You couldn't smell anything standing right next to it. For some reason though, I decided to try the diaper genie. I liked that you could open it with your foot--theirs was a bit hard to twist back and forth with one hand (of course it was also two years old). Big mistake. I should have bought the diaper champ, and should have kept the box to return the diaper genie. The smell is horrible. After a few diapers are in it, it's very smelly. Plus, every time it opens it releases a lot of the smell. I checked that the internal closure mechanism is still shut when I open it--it is, it's not a broken one, it just sucks. Also it's really flimsy plastic and feels like it's going to break whenever I open it to take the bag out. And the bags are horrible! They made the bags about half the size of the actual space inside so you have to change them constantly (the bags are as big as the actual plastic ring they come in, tiny!). The pail could literally hold another bag worth of diapers in the space available around the current bag. And because it opens from the middle to remove the bag you can't use it without the bag. I'm going to try other bags, but it seems like they would be quite difficult to put in it. But I'll probably just end up giving it away and buying a diaper champ. Don't buy this product!	
1. 	My husband used it with our 7 month old on a hike. They were both extremely comfortable. In fact, she took her afternoon nap in there.	
1. 	Great for spare parts for vintage baby bottle collection.  These were purchased to complete nippleless bottles I got for my collection (hey, some folks collect fishing lures, salt/pepper shakers, rocks, shoes&#8230;. there are more bottle collectors than one might think !!). Playtex is a reliable brand, and latex is the authentic material for many bottles.	
1. 	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.	
- 1	These sheets are not good at all.  I am a big fan of Graco products, but not these!  They are thin, and not soft at all.  I ended up making my own sheets...all you have to do is get a piece of flannel and hem it and make the corners, they don't need elastic since the mattress has bending points in it.  Plus, a lot cheaper!	
1. 	Used it with no issues. Not sure how you'd have a bad mattress but this one is good.	
- 1	This could have been a great product but it really is not. The bottom rack makes difficult to find anything. I would recommend some other one and am only keeping it because it would be a hassle to return. In hindsight, I would have bought one of the rack's that spin or something, so that I could easily find and assemble the bottles.	
- 1	The whole idea of a baby tub with a shower is an excellent idea...but I think they need to redesign the shower handle.  It is almost impossible to hold the sprayer comfortably without blocking the water spray.  Not to mention the button to get the water to spray is extremely hard to press down.  The tub itself is a nice size and comes with the sling which helps a lot.  I recommend buying a regular tub with a sling rather than spending the few extra bucks for the sprayer that doesn't work that well.  A cup or washcloth will do the trick.	
- 1	I really wished they made these in a larger size. This size would be great for a newborn, but that's it.	
- 1	We have the Saratoga P&amp;P and I've been very disappointed with the sheet we bought.  It's been so bad that we haven't used it yet.  The material is very rough and the sheet doesn't fit well when the mattress is in the bassinet position.	
- 1	This holder is a complete waste of money.  If they did something at the top, to help hold the juice box in the holder, it would make more sense.  A child can simply dump it over, or pull it out.  Save your money!	
- 1	UPDATE 2/5/2014:The motor in this swing has already gone out. Very upsetting! We haven't nearly gotten enough use out of this product yet for the motor to already be bad. When we put brand new batteries in it, it acts like they're bad and cuts off after barely swinging for thirty minutes. I will never buy a graco swing again. I should have listened when I was told that their motors are terrible! At least I can manually push it for a bit to keep my son happy until I figure out getting a replacement.Original review:Before purchasing this swing, I remember looking at the reviews and seeing some people complain about how fast they go through batteries. I really liked the colors though, AND the price, so I decided to trust the higher ratings it got instead of getting hung up on the batteries. My son is now six weeks old and I still have not had to change batteries. Maybe it's just the brand of batteries I use, but this swing is still going strong on the original three batteries I put in it. I would say that it gets moderate use from us. My son loves to be held all the time so if I put him down in his co-sleeper for a nap he usually wakes up. If I put him in his swing, he'll sleep anywhere from one to three hours at a time. I really only put him in it to sleep though if I can't hold him while he's sleeping, so that's why I would say it only gets moderately used by us. He's not in it ALL the time.I've noticed that he's starting to look that the little stars and moon on the mobile too when he is awake in it, and I think it keeps him in entertained for a bit (for now).I love the fact that I don't have to plug it in to make it work, so I've been able to have it upstairs or downstairs. I think it's fairly easy to move when the legs are folded in and doesn't weigh too much.As for the music and nature sounds, we haven't used them much yet. Our son is just now starting to pay attention to music and usually is listening to whatever we're playing around the house from our iPhones. The different speeds are great too, but we just keep ours on number 3. Haven't used the timer either; the one time we did, he woke up when it stopped swinging. We haven't gotten much use out of all those extra features but that doesn't mean a different baby wouldn't!Overall, I think this is a great product, but how much you love it is really going to depend on how much your baby loves it. When wide awake, my baby can only stand to be in it for maybe twenty minutes. If he's sleeping though, he'll stay in it for almost three hours.If you want a swing that is durable but not over-the-top expensive, and you don't have a baby that will be in it ALL the time, then I definitely think this is the swing you'll want to buy. I don't regret getting this one at all!	
1. 	This is a WONDERFUL baby product.  I love that it is versatile and will grow with my child. Wipes down cleanly and quickly, love the dishwasher safe tray.  I think it's so easy to remove and attach the tray.My daughter started sitting in it just before she was 2 months old, to enjoy watching us eat dinner as a family.  The straps even go tight enough for her tiny frame, and she was only 10 pounds at 2 months old. She just sat with all of us for Thanksgiving dinner, and the grandparents all remarked how well behaved she was.  It really helps that she can sit at our level and feel included.I recommend purchasing some suction cup base toys to attach to the tray to keep little ones entertained.She also sits in this chair near me when I scrapbook or craft, and that's the only was she feels involved enough to stay happy long enough for me to be productive.I like the reclining seat, and the fact that it fits nicely even on a captains chair in our dining room is nice.  Also very portable if we need to attend a holiday at a relative's house.You can't go wrong with this!UPDATE: Now at 15 months old, we find ourselv frequently putting our daughter's food on a plate on the table, and not using the tray as much. The one thing that I (and other mothers I know) have discovered, is that even when converted to a booster seat, the seat won't fit under our dining room tables, because of the arms. This prevents the child from getting as close to the table/plate as they normally would and leaves about 8 inches of drop space where she can drop food in her lap, on her legs, or the floor. I am not pleased with this, and we have another seat that doesn't have arms (it's a bit older Fisher Price seat) and when the new baby comes we will be switching the toddler to that so that she can still be boosted, but as close to the table as she needs to be.	
1. 	Works well and installation was easy.  My only beef is that the directions say it works best when places at the angles of 8 o'clock or 4 o'clock on the seat, but the child can easily push it to any other position while the seat is closed.  Even while doing that though, he's still not able to get it open, which is all I care about.Update: About 9 months after purchasing this product, it finally broke.  My son definitely abused it.  He snapped it off a few times and it landed in the toilet, after which I ran it through the dishwasher because it grossed me out to touch. So after 9 months it broke. For the price, I'd say I got my money's worth. I would be purchasing another, but hopefully my son will be potty training within the next few months (crossing my fingers!)	
- 1	I really wanted to love the tummy tub for my then 5 month old to play in.  However my baby just won't stay in the fetal position.  He keeps wriggling around and moving his feet to the top of the bucket/ tub so the level of water is always changing and wrong.  Basically I need to put less than half the recommended amount of water so there is less water to keep him warm and to play in.  Otherwise I constantly need to adjust him and put his feet back under.  At 7 month old,  currently I use it for quick baths.  I'll try using it again for play time when he gets older and realizes he shouldn't let his mouth go under the water.	
- 1	Babies play with it briefly, then move along.  It just never held their interest very long.  I would not purchase again.	
1. 	wow, I really hit the jackpot with this toy!!!  The batteries last a really, really long time.  I use this EVERY time I put my son in the car.  I just changed the batteries for the first time since I got it, which was about 4 months ago.  He was very different from my 1st son & didn't really like the car and also really needed toys to distract him all the time.  This toy was the first toy that made my son stop crying (as much) in the car & stare at this mobile for HOURS (well, as long as he was in his car seat)....I turn this on even when I put my son in the car seat but I haven't quite gotten everything ready yet to actually get in the car...this is such a good distraction & he still isn't bored of it.  I bought this when my son was only a couple months old & now he is 6 months & still loves to listen & watch this move.  The music is only 1 volume which is probably the only thing I wish had an option---softer or louder.  I was & still am so happy with this product.  I've had so many people ask me where I got this & how unique it is...but the best part is that it really is a life saver & the batteries LAST....and with all the batteries that are used in baby toys, I couldn't be happier with how long this lasts!  A definite must & I wish I had it for my first son.	
1. 	I went on reviews when I bought this and it is so easy to use, better than any plastic tub out there.  I have a 3 month old and have basically used the plastic tub a total of 3 times.  The big tub is just so much easier and nicer and there isn't any preparation, everything is there, it's easy to fill and drain and always worked well with my first child.  This pillow keeps my son safe and comfortable, it dries up really well and he can also lie in it on the bathroom floor while I fill the tub.  My husband can even bath him and he looks really comfy in it.  He lies snugly on it while I soap him up and don't have to worry about a slippery baby falling out my hands or hitting himself against the tub.  Well worth the money!	
- 1	I am not new to baby carriers... since my daughter was born in July I have owned 2 Moby wraps (which are GREAT), 2 slings and 2 different Infantino's.  I got this one at Babies R Us when my daughter was about 4 or 5 months old.  I loved it.  I only used it in the front and it was fine for a while.  However, she was too tall for it from the beginning and her arms had to go over the straps.  Not very safe, but since she was facing me and didn't move too much, it was fine.My daughter is now 8 months old and just under 20lbs and I think my back is going to break.  She also pushes to see all around which worries me that her arms don't fit in the straps.  I have to make sure to keep a hand on her.  Yesterday I tried to wear her on my back, thinking it would take some of the pressure off, and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out.  You really need a partner to help you.  I even put her on like I normally do and tried to slide her to my back and it worked, but took a lot of time.  Once there, I didn't feel like she was secure enough.  I watched a few videos on YouTube on how to do it and it just wasn't working.  I just ordered an Ergo and I'm really hoping for better results.	
- 1	I brought this item for my newborn to experience some Tummy Time and I was very disappointed with this quality of this product. It is very cheap and surface area is very small ... and this side mirror that it came with does not fold correctly ( I almost don't know what to do with this item ). Anyhow, I would not recommend to purchase this product for tummy time. It is better to spend more money and purchase a Playmat instead. I want to return this item but my husband already threw away the box. This item is already in the storage.	
1. 	I got these at around 3months and felt like so foolish for not having purchased this wonderful product easier. I got two of these and always have them filled with premeasured formula just like the bottle are filled with permeasured water. this makes the diaper bag so much lighter.One good part is that the formula in each slot doesn't spill over to the other portions so it works perfectly. Easy to clean too!!!!! Definitely recommend :)	
1. 	I really like the opening and the top so you can see your baby without picking up any of the material. It's not the softest by far, but it's tolerable unless you and your baby have extremely sensitive skin. It's pretty airy, so it's perfect for the warm weather.	
1. 	I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute. It is very colorful and the toys are very cute. I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them, but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors. The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much. I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it. There is noting about this that I do not like. My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom, but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up.	
1. 	I have had this diaper pail for about 2 1/2 years, I recieved it at my first sons baby shower. I had actually registered for the Diaper Genie, and was dissapointed when I got this one. After knowing MANY moms who have the genie, I am so happy someone purchased me this one instead! It holds a ton of diapers and pull-ups! My 4 month olds diapers dont stink too much yet, but this pail will handle the job! Honestly, I think I onlyo had a stinky nursery when I over stuffed the bags, didnt clean the PAIL, and didnt keep deoderant circles in it. I find it unnessesary to dump the #2 into the toilet first, this pail handles the job as it is. It is very easy to dump in a diaper one handed, and the refils last months, litteraly! I just bought refils a few days ago, my other ones I had since my second son came home from the hospital, four months ago! My 2 1/2 year old can not figure out how to open this though (thank goodness!) and he is not potty trained, but will be soon! This tackels all odors and refils really arent that expensive. I love it, and my house guests are amazed that I actually change diapers in my house, not one whiff!	
1. 	This is much better than the curved bottom munchkin formula dispenser we bought at the store.  This one has a more positive lock.  That being said it still isn't perfect at keeping the sections segregated.  It also can let a small amount out when tossed around in a diaper bag.  Overall though it functions pretty well.  The curve at the opening allows for the formula to dispense quite easily and the call had never came off accidentally even in the diaper bag.	
- 1	This wasn't an effective product for either of our sons (one who doesn't like pacifiers and one who would have one in his mouth always, if allowed to).  My wife and I also found the shape of the Teethifier to vaguely resemble... well... I'll just say it... testicles.I feel bad now, but it's true.  To make up for it, I'll add the one thing that I find missing from most negative reviews: a recommendation. The one teether that our youngest son DOES use is the widely availableThe First Years Massaging Action Teether.	
- 1	I tried to suck on this and it is just way too hard (ok, you know what I mean).  No way for baby to get any water of of this if I can barely.	
1. 	Very soft.  Elastic fits well.  Washes well.  I bought the apple green and it is a bright pop of green color in the room, which i love.	
1. 	I agree it's better than the genie.  I own the genie and served us well.  But when I had the chance to use this product at Babies R Us store, I was so impressed.  It's very easy to use, and it seals out the odor as well.  I wanted to get this for our use, but my genie is still in good use.  Too bad, the champ came late, or we should have gotten this instead.	
1. 	We are still using the slow flow at 4 months while I am working.  I still regularly breastfeed the rest of the time.  The baby likes the size of these and the flow.	
1. 	Hard to put the over on- but they worked pretty good and the food was pretty easy to pop out.	
- 1	This pump I personally hated, I got less milk out then with a manual pump and it took longer. It's very slow, loud, and it's my only pump I had that felt unnatural. It made me hate pumping and made it more of a hassle and irritating. If it's what you can afford I say go for it, but you can see what your getting from the reviews. An my insurance was overpaid I feel for this piece of junk. If you can afford better please do better or stick to manual. The only thing I liked was the stand and the insert into the part that goes on your chest.	
1. 	I still supervise my toddler closely by the fireplace, but this foam gives me a little piece of mind.  If she falls, I know that I've softened the edge of my brick hearth to prevent a trip to the ER.  I have never had problems with her pulling it off (she knows she is not supposed to play with it), and I have removed it and moved to a  new house, and it still sticks just as well to the new hearth.  I'm very happy with this product.	
1. 	I debated long and hard over this purchase, but there was no need for that! It's very pretty, and we think it's an excellent buy. We had no problem with the plastic pegs, and nothing was broken or scratched in the least on arrival. My husband got it together quickly. It's more sturdy and more elegant than I expected, and the shelves are plywood, but it doesn't show. We just set up the table, but we're pretty sure it will be great.	
- 1	Sorry for the negative review but here goes... The Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision is very very basic.  You get a night vision camera, a night light on the camera, lullabies and sound activated screen and that is it.  The resolution is not high res like Philips says, at best it is standard res.  The battery life is said to be seven hours but I have only managed about four.  The range is said to be 30 meters through walls but it is about half that.  The only adjustments you can make are the volume and the screen brightness.We have a V-Tech baby monitor that is about half the price but is has much better resolution, twice the screen size, the ability to remote talk, the ability to add multiple camera, vibration alert option, temperature reading and much better range plus the nigh vision sound activated screen and the lullaby features.  The Phillips has the advantage on camera size though.  Even with the battery back-up the camera is very compact.  Also the sound activated screen works better than the V-Tech but you cannot adjust the sensitivity in anyway.  If this camera was $100 or less it would be an ok buy, but even then there are several cameras near that price point that have more features. If was less that $80 I could recommend it but it's not so I can't.	
1. 	as all other Mustela products that we use.this one goes well after bath and for daily massage.very gentle, makes the skin soft and silky.	
1. 	My son started to like this mat around 4-5 mos. He's 8 now and is still entertained by it. Our 45 lb bulldog pounces on it, runs across it and stands on it multiple times daily, I can't believe it hasn't popped...is a tough little mat!!  Have recommended to multiple friends, and the price is right on Amazon! (I bought at a local toy store for about 40% more).	
1. 	We bought one for our son and it works wonderfully.  Prior to this, we were using blankets to swaddle him, the way they taught us to in the hospital.  He always found a way to break out of the swaddle both in the hospital and at home.  So we bought it, and it has done wonders because he no longer wakes up because his hands got out of the swaddle and startled him.  He's three months old, and we continue to use the product.However, our advice is to consider buying a cotton one before you buy the fleece.  Most of us heat our homes to around 70 degrees, so the fleece might end up being too hot.  We noticed that our baby was starting to develop a heat rash, so we switched to the cotton Kiddopotoamus SwaddleMe blanket.  This worked well, and the heat rash went away.Another tip - we've noticed that our baby can get his hands out of the swaddle now.  The way we prevent this is get him to put his arms parrallel and along to his body inside the blanket.  If you allow him to fold his arms on top of him, he will be able to get out as he gets bigger and gains in strength.	
1. 	We purchased this booster seat based on a recommendation from our friend.  We are so glad we listened to her.  It's very well put together and was very well thought through.  I love how everything connects so easily for storage.  We keep it in the back of our trunk so that it's with us whenever we need it.  It works like a charm.  My son is comfortable in it.  It's very easy to clean up too.  Would highly recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	The inventor of this bib is a genius. This is great for the winter! I don't have to take off my baby's clothes so they don't get destroyed while she eats. This very effectively saves her long sleeves from getting dirty, and as usually with these bibs the pocket does a great job of catching everything she drops. These bibs are so worth the money!One GREAT thing about this is that it ties in the back. My daughter is little and the tie allows me to pull it up right around her neck so nothing slips down underneath it. Her other bumkins bib, and her tommee tippee bibs do not have this.... and this is another reason why this bib is my all time favorite!	
1. 	We received this product in a timely manner. Husband put it together rather quickly. Only issue would be that the top drawer on a rare occasion doesn't close properly but it's not a big deal at all. It's very spacious and has a wonderful look. I would recommend this to anyone who has a baby already or one coming.Feb 2013 update: The piece is very easily scratched. We had to move it up an inch and the piece just about fell apart. I am now searching for something more sturdy as I am afraid that even with a wall mount it may decide to fall apart.	
- 1	Don't buy this! Total waste of money. Chains always break. Drinks spill. Cups break. Such a mess. Sticks out so far you can't fit through standard doorways. Go with a Jolly Jumper or Joovy Organizer instead. Save yourself the headache.	
1. 	I wish I would not have wasted money buying any other kind of bib. These are the best! Our twins drooled a lot while teething and often soaked bibs and their clothes until we got these bibs. I hesitated on the price, but they really are worth it! I put them in the washing machine but avoid the dryer. Great product!	
- 1	I bought this product to help with cleaning bottles in the dishwasher since I go through about 28 bottles a day with triplets. This item only holds 3 bottle pieces and it costs more on Amazon than at the store!	
1. 	We love this blanket so much, we've given it a pet name! My baby only stayed swaddled until she was about 2 weeks, then could wiggle out of even the tightest wrap and cried almost all night. Then of course would sleep all day... then would be wide awake at night again! It was frustrating! When she was about 6 weeks, I remembered that I had bought this Kiddopotamus blanket (it was just sitting in the closet) and thought I'd try swaddling again. That night, she slept 9 hours straight! Every night since, she sleeps at least 7 hours, and some days as much as 10!  Unlike other swaddle blankets I have, this blanket is soft and stretchy so she can move a little if she is uncomfortable (but arms stay in there) and you can open the bottom easily for diaper changes or when the temp is warmer. We think it's a lifesaver for those who like to sleep at night. I think it has magic powers. ;) And, it's cheap!	
- 1	I have a 15 month old daughter that has started talking in her sleep so my husband and I decided we needed to buy a video monitor to make sure she was awake before we went into her room because we have accidently woken her up going into her room to check on her after we have heard her start stirring. I started researching video monitors and found the Levana brand had 4+ start reviews on Amazon. (Note: I am an Amazon Prime member and a frequent reader of reviews before I decided to buy an item.) I liked the price of this video monitor compared to the prices of the ones made by Motorola and Summer Infant. It seemed very reasonable and the online reviews of this item were very good. The reviews specifically said the day time color picture was very clear and bright and the night vision worked very well. I did not find either of these to be true with my experience.We set this new monitor up on a Friday night so we were not able to test the color picture on the first day of use. The night vision worked, but did not have a great picture (certain items were very bright and others were blurry). On Saturday late morning when we put our daughter down for a nap, we tested the color picture. The colors on the monitor were completely off and the room has to be extremely well lit for the color picture to even work. When we went to bed Saturday night, the night vision was still working, but by Sunday morning, we woke up to a black and blurry screen. It appears that the night vision LEDs had gone out. I called customer service for Levana on Sunday morning, per the instructions in the manual for the monitor, only to find out you could not talk to anyone until business hours Monday-Friday. The customer service line then walks you through a few trouble shooting measures to try and get the monitor to start working again (i.e. turn the monitor on and off, check the light in the room, etc.). I found this to be completely unacceptable. This is a product that sells items for baby safety. How many working parents are able to call about a defective baby monitor from their office? My husband and I returned this monitor to Amazon and ended up buying a much more, expensive but nicer monitor manufacturer by Motorola from another retailer.if I could give this monitor and Levana zero stars, I would. I am very disappointed with the quality of this product as well as the lack of service provided by Levana.	
1. 	I bought this from the wish list of a homeless shelter where I live. They have a number of children living there and I imagine many of them potty train while they are staying there. I know how much my nieces and nephews love Dora so I thought this would get used more than a plain potty seat.	
- 1	don't bother with this thing, its cheaply made, the parts do not snap together as shown (in comparison to the original exersaucer)  so save the trouble, having a girl? want to deck her out girly style -  we did/are....  Babies R Us has a purple version that comes with a floor mat for tummy time too.... its about $30 more, but you save on a floor mat in the end...	
- 1	My son can't keep this paci in his mouth.  He sucks on it if I hold it in his mouth, but he can't get enough suction to keep it there himself.  I bought it for him when he was about 3 months old, but I think he may have already been ready for a bigger size.  He loves his Nuk orthodontic paci, so we might just stick with those.	
1. 	We have a lot of rattles in our house and the is by far my twins favorite.  In addition, their ocupational therapist uses this for developmental tool.  I would recommend as a must have for any parent.	
- 1	This holder is a complete waste of money.  If they did something at the top, to help hold the juice box in the holder, it would make more sense.  A child can simply dump it over, or pull it out.  Save your money!	
- 1	Pros:InexpensiveEasy to inflateEasy to installWorks with a shower diverter knob on the end of the spoutCuteCons:Didn't last.  Ours deflated after a few months and will not stay inflated longer than a day now.UPDATE:If I could, I'd probably raise this to 3, maybe even 4, stars.Why? As I state in the title, it's cute and does the job.  It's also inexpensive.  When ours died, I looked around for something different.  Something that fit the spout well (like this one does), that stays clean inside (like this one), that works with a shower diverter knob (like this one does)... I didn't find anything decent under $16 and even that one was a gamble about fit.  In the end, I bought another one of these.  At the price, I can buy another if this one pops too.  In the meantime, it has everything I am looking for.	
- 1	I have a few issues with this pillow. First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item.I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the belly support on my back side.	
1. 	great for rice cereal bottle at night time. watch and listen to make sure nipple doesn't get clogged but overall great	
1. 	This was the only bib that worked on my toddler. She ripped every other bib off in seconds; it was impossible to keep her clothes covered. This bib covers everything up nicely and the best part is that it ties in the back. Now she cannot just rip it off. Anything with velcro or the hard bibs that snapped or the snap button bibs were nothing for her. This one she just gave up on ripping off. I love it.	
- 1	I had a bunch of frustrations with the Uppababy G-Luxe umbrella strollerCONS of the Uppababy G-Luxe include:- awkward shape when folded- doesn't REALLY stand up well when folded (as in, yes, it stands up unless a strong breeze blows and then it immediately tips over)- too easy for toddler to yank the end of the seat cushion off- tips over without fail if ANYTHING is hanging on the back- smallish/awkward basket- umbrella/awning too easily pulled down (or off) by toddler)- rain cover was too tight against toddler's legs- harness and straps were absurdly tight if toddler was wearing anything more than a thin shirt- even the black colored version has a LOT of white on it -- few things make less sense to me than a white stroller...PROS:- The only legitimate pro of this stroller I can think of is that UppaBaby's customer service is pretty awesome. So if the issue arose where something actually broke on the stroller, I am sure they would be great about fixing it. However, our issue with the stroller wasn't anything breaking, just a bunch of design flaws.NOTE: I am a very happy/proud owner of an UppaBaby Vista, which I love. After a year of frustration with the G-Luxe, we ended up replacing it with the Aprica Presto Flat StrollerAprica Presto Flat Stroller, Premiere Red, which we love.	
- 1	the plastic on these toys are hard-plastic, not the kind that has a give. unfortunately had to return, but it's a good value for money if you are looking for additional colorful toys for your baby.	
1. 	It is very soft, and I like the color.It is large for my 7 month baby. Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality.	
- 1	stick to the regular old school way of keeping your kids out the cabinets with the other cabinet locks and save yourself the frustration.  thumbs down to this product.	
1. 	I love this. It folds up very well into itself into a carrier pack, has convenient pocket for extra items (I toss a book, my phone and keys in), looks good, is a great size and adds just enough cushion while providing a waterproof area to sit on. I keep it in our car and have found opportunities to use it I otherwise would not have noticed w/o having a blanket to use. I often grab it for little walks to the park with my 18 month old (I wear her in my Ergobaby carrier & am 8 months pregnant - so obviously it is an easy size to manage!) to sit on - plenty big enough for us to both hang out on and keeps us both dry (it seems to rain overnight here often). I wish I had purchased it sooner!	
- 1	I paid $20 for this on Amazon and it is NOT worth it.  The music only last about 6 seconds. Needs to have a light or music box built into tummy to keep babies attention more. Music needs to play longer. The only good thing about this is that it's small enough for my 5 month old to hold.	
- 1	These tubes cause WAY more condensation to form inside them than the official Medela ones. I have to keep my pump running for minutes on end after I'm done just to get rid of that condensation and make sure no mold grows in them. I don't quite understand how the different material can cause more condensation, but it does. Next time I'll get official Medela tubes.	
1. 	I gave it only 4 stars because I found the suction not so good with this pump unless I got it just right...I have large breasts (F cup) so I think that might be the problem. When I get it right...I can get as much as I get with my PIS...but I don't like that it's only one side at a time.	
1. 	After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident.	
- 1	I was so excited when it arrived for our 11-month old son who weighs 18 lbs but outgrew his graco snugride car seat in length 29.5. I figured this would help him stayed rear-facing for at least another 6 months. But i was wrong I had it returned. No doubt that the material is really nice & quality and it's Britax-a well known reliable brand name..Here are 2 issues:* The straps are way too short..His arms keep getting stuck..& hard to take his arms out when buckling him..I called Britax to ask if they sell longer straps..they dont..* The base level indicator keeps rattling & is noisy when car seat is not attached. It is very annoying (imagine driving your car for an hour with this noise?)	
- 1	My son is not interested in these toy at all. It's not very interactive or exciting. It's so cute but was not worth it.	
1. 	We love this whole kit. It has everything. When my son takes night time baths we use the lavender soap and boy is he ready for bed when we get him out. The carry case is also a great. We take it on trips with us and we carry his basic shampoo that came with the kit, toys, towels, washcloths and such and there is still room for more!!! The lotion is great and very thick which helps keep babies skin ever so soft after bath time, and the moisturizing stick is fantastic for getting a dry patch here and there. We keep it in the diaper bag. Great set for any parent, a must have for first time parents.update: my son is now 9.5 mths old and we have yet to even finish  our second bottle of wash. Everything except the lotion and 1.5 bottles of baby wash we still have plenty of. This gift set is fantastic, talk about the gift that keeps giving. At this rate we will not need to buy shampoo/body wash until after his first birthday!!	
- 1	I managed to get this seat in and secure it well in my 2009 Scion XB, but even at the most reclined position, it seems like it is sitting straight up. My sons head slumps forward and it looks so uncomfortable. I did get a good deal on it, but I dont think I would recommend it. Needs to be able to recline a little better. Not impressed.	
1. 	we purchased to keep at grandmas that lives out of state but we visit often! kids love it! compact easy fold to store!	
- 1	The attachment makes it top heavy, which means you spill.  If I had a 3rd hand while pumping, this may have worked well.  Loved the idea of expressing straight to the bag though.	
1. 	We could not live without this gym!  Since my little one was a month old, he has loved laying under this, and he probably spends 2-2.5 hours a day kicking, grabbing, smiling, and cooing while laying on this mat.  We have continued to add toys with different sounds and textures as he has grown, and we move the toys that came with the gym around from time to time.  He particularly loves the elephant rattle right now.  My little guy is now almost 4 months old, and I know this will only get used more over the next few months.  On a practical side, it is lightweight and easy to put together, and the mat itself is washable.  The toys can be moved from the canopy to the mat to make tummy time more fun for baby.  The music leaves something to be desired, especially considering how much time I spend listening to it, but it is worth it to see baby so happy.  Of all the gifts we were given, this has definitely been the most frequently used.A note on battery life: after a minimum of 2 hours of use daily over the past 3 months, the original batteries are still going strong!	
- 1	I got this pale b/c it was cheap. Yes you can use any bag for it but it doesn't hide the smell and the lid slams down on its own almost catching my fingers while I'm changing the bag. So unless you like a smelly house and have 3 arms to change a bag dont buy!!	
1. 	She's 7 months and the batteries have just now needed replacing.  She can turn it on all by herself now by kicking the huge buttons or if i give her the remote. And it's so high there is no way she can get herself tangled in it, so it is not a hazard!  At first I thought it was too stimulating for her but now it is just what she needs to entertain herself while I get 30 minutes more sleep	
1. 	Great for a baby getting into crawling, tough because it is tiny and because it will roll under anything. Simple, easy.	
1. 	I just bought this because my daughter is getting too big for her plastic tub. She loves it! It is very soft and seems very comfortable for her, and she stays warm. Dries quickly. Highly recommend!	
1. 	My husband and I love this set. We don't know if we are having a boy or a girl, so we wanted something for either and that could grow with our child. The actual colors and fabrics are much prettier than on the website. We painted the walls a medium blue and two dressers, one yellow and one green to match. We purchased animal knobs at a home improvement center for the dressers. I washed the bumpers with Dreft on delicate cycle and hung to dry, they came out beautifully, it held its shape and there were no rips. I washed and dried the sheet on delicate and had no fading and very few wrinkles. I haven't washed any of the other items yet because they won't be touching the baby. (We are hanging the quilt on the wall for now.) We purchased or registered for many of the coordinating accessories, but we like that we can add almost anything animal theme to the room and it fits in nicely. Everyone tells us how gorgeous the room is and we can't wait for the baby to arrive in a couple of weeks to see how he or she likes it.	
- 1	I was hoping to find mittens that would fit over my baby's hands.. even as a newborn, his hands were huge, so they did not fit.  Nice and comfy for smaller hand babies..	
- 1	The underside of the tray has ridges. My son would get excited and kick his feet against them, causing redness and bruising. The underside of the tray is all mechanism and nothing kid safe. I have to buy something else.I think this issue may have been addressed in the new model. Theyve redesigned the underside I think...	
1. 	While it has not fit on every tub we've had, it works wonderfully on the ones that it does fit on.  Wish there was some sort of adaptation for varying spouts, but aside from that very happy.	
1. 	I just wished it was wider to fit more loosely on my closet rod. It fits kind of tight on my thick closet rod.We have a custom thick hanging rod, so it doesn't run smoothly.But I'm sure it will fit fine in standard closets.It's a great organizing tool!	
- 1	My son hated them from the beginning and they are not that useful because food slides on them and they are small so it ends up on their lap...plus they are sized for children with extra slim necks!I used them twice and will give them away. Waste of money.	
- 1	These were tearing up within a few days of getting them in the mail.  They did not hold up to a toddlers biting well at all.  Especially if your child has oral motor issues, go with something else.  Even for the average teether, go with something else.	
- 1	Bought one to try-must admit this is my least favorite of my stash ( I might be the minority on that opinion ).  It does stay fairly dry with two inserts. Washes ok- began to pill quickly. The inserts aren't the best- I use both. I so not like that the pocket is on the front- it's always wet and kinda gross. It's difficult to get the insert in because the pul material is almost sticky. It doesn't fit my baby very well.  The size for the waist is too tight for his thighs.	
1. 	Love it, I have this additionally to my MEDELA FREESTYLE which I now can keep at my office and still pump occasionally at home with the manual pump.Sometime I think I'm even quicker with this manual pump but then if zou have to pump both breasts anyway, it's still quicker with teh double electric pump.Love the stand that comes with it. I also think it's very easy to clean.	
1. 	I PURCHASED THIS WARMER AND THE FIRST YEARS NIGHT AND DAY BOTTLE WARMER FOR MY BEDROOM. SO FAR THEY WORK REALLY GREAT AT HEATING THE BOTTLES TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE NUMBERS RUBBED OFF THE WATER VILES AND WE HAD TO PUT THEM ON WITH A PERMANENT MARKER.	
1. 	Perfect for organizing what you need on your changing table. It is not huge which was great for me because our nursery is not huge either. It held our wipe warmer (which was a little big on top but it staid in place), diapers, and the two side containers held creams, nail clippers, etc. It is strong plastic and hung perfectly on the side of our ikea changing table.	
- 1	the plastic on these toys are hard-plastic, not the kind that has a give. unfortunately had to return, but it's a good value for money if you are looking for additional colorful toys for your baby.	
- 1	I have never used any other toilet lid locks, but this is so hard to install I have never been able to use it. I have just resorted to keeping the bathroom door closed all the time.	
1. 	I was worried that my petite daughter (just turned 2 a couple days ago, very short and weighs 20 lbs) might not be able to use this but she has no issues with it. I needed something for our toilet since she refused to go on the little potty we bought her. Daycare has miniture 'big' potties which she can easily use with a stool but ours is still too tall for her. She would throw a fit when we would try to lift her up to it I DO IT!! so this is exactly what we needed.The seat is on a hinge almost and when you take it off the toilet it falls back to the step part allowing it to 'fold' flat. When my daughter first used it I made sure to hold the ladder still so it wouldn't scare her (thus her not wanting to use it) if it moved. She turns around on the step and then sits and scoots back on the seat with little effort. While sitting on the seat she can put her hands on top of the handles to brace herself for #2 and yes, even lift up the ladder but she thinks that part is funny and it keeps her on the potty longer (it's always an event that she doesn't like to rush) without being dangerous at all.Our neighbors have a 2/12 year old and are tired of cleaning out the little potty they have for her all the time so I let them borrow ours for a bit to see if they liked it and she's now ordering one. I've recommended it to several people. We're military living overseas in Germany and it fits the toilets out here just fine, if that helps anyone.	
- 1	Initial 2 weeks- This is the second monitor I am buying for my baby and I love this one. I used it only for 2 weeks now, and it got stuck once and had to take out the battery to turn it off.But otherwise I am happy with the quality of the pictures - even low light picture is pretty clear.Updated after 2 more weeks - the monitor gets stuck frequently.It showed the picture of my baby sleeping even few hours after she woke up. I tried to turn off the monitor, but I couldnt and finally i had to remove the battery. this happened couple of times already.. removing few stars from my original rating.	
1. 	Fit my Medela PISA parts perfectly.  Wish they had come with membranes/valves though.  Over all, I guess I can't complain since it didn't promise that.  It was just kind of annoying that it didn't come as a set.	
- 1	PROS:-It's a placemat.CONS:-Doesn't stick to wood tables(I didn't think it would be a problem since our hook-on high chair would secure it to the table, but since it doesn't lay flat and sits off the table due to the suction cups underneath, our curious 7-month-old spent every meal pulling up the edges and trying to figure out how to get it to his mouth).-The cutesy little design is raised making a zillion nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in if you don't run the whole thing under water immediately after using (not practical with a hook-on high chair).-The reservoir doesn't interface well with a hook-on high chair, and doesn't interface with the Bjorn soft bibs.-Doesn't lay flat, even with hook-on high chair arms on top of it for 2 weeks.	
1. 	I love this Kiddopotamus swaddle.My kid does too.Except he grew out of the small one in like a month.At 3 months hes already pushing the large one.	
- 1	I loved the idea of this, but when we put it on, the bottom part of the gate still stuck up about half and inch over the trip guard, which might have been okay if we were using it on a level surface, but we used it on the bottom of a stair, and it still hurt like heck to step on it. It also stuck out past the bottom stair a bit.	
1. 	We really, really love this crib. It was easy to put together and looks GREAT in our nursery. Baby's now four months old and is loving the crib, too. Definitely recommend!	
- 1	This thing is pointless.  You can SMELL the dirty diapers through the lid.  We had previously just been using a open garbage bin with individual plastic bags for smelly poops.  I guess the seal on the diaper champ just isn't effective.ALSO, last night I just opened the lid for the first time.... OMG- I think I burned off all my nose hairs and scalded the back of my throat with the horrible, horrible, pungent stankvapors that rose up out of the bin.  BEWARE!!!!!!  This thing will trap just enough air IN the bin to ferment dirty diapers in their own horrible smell, creating a highly potent uber-stank.I appreciate companies that try to create nifty gadgets to make parents' lives easier and more pleasant... but these people need to go back to the drawing board.	
- 1	This Monitor can be described in one word-Horrible.  My Husband and I would awaken in the middle of the night to this wretched static noise.  Our baby slept through the night since day one...it was the monitor that kept us up.  I finally gave up on it when she was 4 weeks old and got the sound and lights with dual receivers...it's been about 16 weeks since we got it and we have never had one problem with it. This monitor is not worth the money.	
1. 	My wife and I were deciding between a Fisher Price two-way swing or this two-way glider as our tool to help put our newborn to sleep when she's less than cooperative.  In the end, we decided on this glider because of the ability to pick it up and move it around. Here are my thoughts: (1) at first, I thought it was more like a solid infant car seat with a motor attached beneath.  It is not.  It's just a hammock draped over a tubular metal frame--quite flimsy.  But it gets the job done.  (2) The arch from which the toys dangle is NOT a handle that you can use to move it; it's just a non-weight-bearing tube from which the toys dangle.  To move it, you grab two handles at the ends of the seat. (3)  The motor is much quieter than what I expected after reading some of the reviews here.  Maybe in a very quiet room, the motor noise may be noticeable.  But the noise is never annoying or intrusive, and it doesn't disturb baby.  (4) The faster of the two movement speeds is probably about right; any much faster and baby's head would get jolted back and forth.  The slow setting is very slow.  (5)  The seat is rotatable 360 degrees, so the back-and-forth movement is not just limited to 2 positions.  (6) The music tends to be on slightly louder side even on the softer setting, but it's not a big deal.  (7) As with all such seats, baby's back is slightly arched, and I'm not sure it's healthy for baby to sleep long term day in and day out in this posture.  But for calming baby to put her to sleep, it's fine.	
- 1	The idea for the mamaroo is great and I was looking forward to using this product. However, there are many design flaws and overall I feel this product is just not worth the cost. I would not buy it again. I have the 2011 model. Here are the major flaws in my opinion:1) The seat does not really recline. The seat basically goes just from sitting all the way up to sitting slightly up. I wish the seat actually reclined more. The company states that the mamaroo reclines all along its axis but in reality the seat belt harness is attached to the axis in a fixed position and limits how the seat can be tilted. I found that even in the most reclined position, my 4 month old baby is still falling down in the mamaroo and ends up basically supported by the crotch harness since he is so upright.2) The safety crotch harness has many flaws. First, I don't understand why a 5-point system with shoulder harness was not included. Instead, the mamaroo comes only with a 3 point crotch harness. As I mentioned before, the baby ends up putting a lot of weight on this harness since the seat does not really recline. The harness has the hard plastic buckle inserts facing the baby and not the parent! I find this to be ridiculous. I have to struggle to snap in and unsnap the harness by reaching around to the inner part of the harness where I cannot even see the buckle. The hard plastic of the harness buckles press against my baby. The plastic buckles should face out towards the parent who has to use them, not the other way around. This design makes no sense to me. Since the seat doesn't really recline and since this means the baby puts a lot of their weight into the harness while sitting upright, it makes having the hard buckles on the inside even worse for the baby. I don't think the safety harness is comfortable for the baby, easy to use for the parent, or even secure (due to the lack of shoulder harness).3) The mamaroo does not come with any actual music. You have to use your own music via an ipod-- fine for someone who has an extra ipod to hook into the mamaroo but not so good if you don't have an ipod or an extra ipod.... The nature sounds that are built into the mamaroo are fine but unfortunately you can't scroll through them on the electronic display. Instead, you have to just flick a circular switch to go through all the nature sounds to find the one you want. I find that this can irritate or wake up a baby. I would prefer to see the sounds listed on the display in order to choose the sound I want quickly.4) The motions that the mamaroo makes are fine. They did not soothe my baby, however. My baby seemed to find the motions pleasant and amusing but they did not help my baby to sleep. Other regular swings have worked much better for helping my baby to fall asleep.5) Although my baby is still under the 25 pound weight limit for the mamaroo, I already find the mamaroo seat to be small for him.  In addition, the seat is made out of material that causes my baby to sweat. I usually have to place a cotton cloth behind my baby's head while he is in the mamaroo, otherwise the back of his head will get too sweaty. I wish the mamaroo came with a better fabric that was more comfortable for the baby.6) The mobile balls that hang over the baby tend to fall off constantly and end up on the floor. They are also not very interesting for the baby.Overall, I was shocked to find so many flaws with such an expensive product and especially one that is supposedly designed for and by moms.	
- 1	This thing is crap. I'm a sucker for buying it but trust me, I didn't even think to use it. It is cheap, flimsy, and smells like chemicals, this is a dont buy.	
- 1	My son at 3-5 months really liked this mat, but I found more things I dislike about it than like about it.The reasons that I give this gym a 1...Pros:- Lots of places to hang toys- Very easy to take apart to wash the matCons:- The hippo hangs very low and is very heavy (I compensate by putting it so it hangs by his feet and he kicks at it; it scared him when it was by his head)- The three monkeys are useless except for maybe as teethers (you can't securely attach them to the gym without falling... scary if they fall on his head!) and they are also extremely heavy- The stuffed elephant is really cute, but is very soft, so not helpful for tummy time (as it is touted)- It takes up ALOT of room and doesn't pack up nicely (has to be disassembled to put away - so we just leave it out pretty much all the time- I really hate that it has only 3 supports, instead of 4. Since it is circular, the edges roll up and the top layer of fabric gets all bunched up - this would be fixed if it had 4 supports...- ALSO, because it only has 3 supports, once he figured out (at about 6 months old)that he could kick the support beams, he was able to knock it over - ONTO HIMSELF!! He looked like a baby burrito, and I was worried that he could have suffocated in it, if I hadn't been there to see him do it!!Hope this helps you decide to buy or not. I say don't waste your money on it, and get a play mat with 4 support beams!!	
- 1	Just doesn't seem to work well.  You have to suck on it pretty hard for it to work at all.  And when you do, our infant would cry (I guess it was painful).  It never seemed to collect much mucus even though our infant was definitely congested.	
1. 	Excatly what I needed. plenty of spares for my pump. I pump a lot and these membranes wear out pretty fast due to heavy use and abuse :)  Cheaper to get them in bulk so I always have spares on hand. These should last me.	
1. 	I looked forever to find something that wasn't filled with chemical plastic and that smelled terrible.  This is perfect! Non-toxic, no bad smell, cleans up really easily and is very cute!	
- 1	This temperature reading on this camera is about 3 to 4 degrees higher than the temperature actually is in the room.	
1. 	This allowed me to forget about having to buy a big winter snowsuit for a new baby.  It was easy to wash, easy to attach to the infant carrier, and warm enough for the baby.  The only downfall is that it should have fabric that can wrap around the top and cover the top of the baby's head for added protection from the elements.  A great invention!	
1. 	When we moved my daughter into a twin bed and out of the crib for the first time, I wanted to start her off with one long side of the bed along a wall.  I bought the Regalo for the open side of the bed.  Eventually I thought I'd move her bed to have both long sides exposed, and maybe purchase a second bed rail for the other side.  Once I got this and set it up, I realized that its probably not going to work to put a second rail up.  This thing is pretty bulky underneath the bed, and I'm not sure a second one would work.  It does work nicely with the bed up against the wall however, as the picture shows.When I first opened the box, there was the beginning of a tear in the fabric, where it attaches to the metal rail.  I didn't really want to go to the trouble of returning it and shipping it back and waiting for a new one, so I just lived with it.  But the material does seem a little flimsy, especially at the seams.Overall its a decent product, and well made.  My favorite thing about it is that its quite long, so fully protects my daughter along almost the entire length of the bed.  She's a very restless sleeper, so I like that she can thrash about without fear of falling out of the bed.	
1. 	The layout of the hours are a little tricky but it does the job.  The print on each page is a light grey, so trying to journal diapers, bottles, meds in the middle of the night is a challenge.  It is detailed in slots to make notes and I would prefer a journal that does not take space for breast-feeding if one chooses formula only.  I could use the space to make more notes and comment on something cute that day.	
1. 	best bottles for your money these old school bottles are not expensive and work better than plastic all the time	
- 1	I tried another style lock  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TGFK1Q/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 on our Frigidaire oven door and it wasn't the right design.When I saw the picture of this particular lock I knew right away it was a Frigidaire oven. The 3 star rating almost swayed me not to order but based on the photo I knew it would position properly on our oven. I was right. Easy to install, fits correctly, and works as it should. Hoping it will last but for now very satisfied.** Update Sept 27 - the hinge of this ended up breaking after a couple months, we had to take off and buy a different style. I wouldn't buy again given that this broke only after a couple months of use.	
1. 	This mat was a no brainer for me after getting theFisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swingand seeing how wonderful the colors and brightness of the product are.  No, it is not meant for travelling and the mat is perfectly thick enough, even on my hardwood floors.The only issues I had with it was the amount of time spent trying to figure out how to get the butterflies to move (they don't) and that there are no extra rings to add length (a little short for a 3 month old to view AND grab at the same time) or to attach more of your own toys.  But those are insignificant and not problems compared to how many hours she has played with it and believe it or not, her activity on the playmat has tired her out so that she finally slept through the night!  That in it and of itself makes this worth so much more than I paid for it, as far as I am concerned.No matter which one you end up choosing, be sure to get a playmat.  It was incredible how quickly she has developed since we bought ours a week ago.  She talks so much more now, coos, smiles, laughs and just makes crazy noises and loves kicking the elephant rattle and looking at herself in the mirror.  Also, I posted some customer images for a better idea.  Enjoy! :D	
1. 	My 9 month old has loved this toy for several months. He always grabs it first in a pile of toys and loves the music. It's great for adults too because it's classic tunes, not annoying like some of our other toys. This is in the top 3 toys of all time in our house and that's saying something.	
1. 	OK, so your baby is too old to be swaddled and now wont sleep through the night right? My husband and I had this same problem and I thought I would never get sleep again. We saw this and gave it a shot. Thank GOD for this. My daughter has been sleeping through the night since she was 6 weeks old and this helps!!! Your baby stays warm in this plus stays safe. Having the feet in the pouch lets her play with her feet, but they get bored really fast and go to sleep. The baby can still move around so you dont have to worry. I tell every mom I run into about this if they dont know about it. Really worth the money	
1. 	I put this crib together within 40mins - comes with easy to follow instructions. It is a sturdy and great looking piece of furniture for the nursery. I bought the Espresso alongwith the 6inch Da Vinci mattress and is definitely a worthy investment :)Preferred this over the Da Vinci Emily crib as other reviewers mentioned the gap between the top bars in the Emily crib where little ones usually get their hand stuck. The design of the Kalani crib does not have that gap which will hopefully alleviate that issue in the future.	
- 1	My baby never had gas problems until we used these bottles. I switched to the Dr. Brown bottles, and the problem went away immediately.	
1. 	My ten month old plays with this toy on and off all day long.  He loves to press the red button and listen to the music and see the discs turn.  Today he even tried putting other things through the hole in the tree!  I think it's great at teaching him cause and effect and also putting the ball through the hole is a great accomplishment for little ones!  The toy is durable, my little one plays rough.  When all four balls are on the wheels, the music is drowned out and it is quite noisy.  However, my son still likes to play with it.  He likes to stop the wheels from turning and also loves to play with the peek a rounds themselves.	
1. 	My baby can not do without it, but this is not a toy and can't leave it with baby alone!	
- 1	Yes, it seems to be comfy, and I feel better about using this than a plastic/vinyl sheet for all of the obvious reasons. But I don't really consider it waterproof. Fortunately in my daughter's first year we've had very few leakage problems at night, but the first time her diaper did fail her, I removed her sheet only to discover this waterproof pad was wet through. There wasn't a huge leak, either, my daughter's cloth diaper had just slipped out above its cover and wicked moisture up, through her jammies, and onto the sheet. But the pad still did not prevent the mattress from getting wet. Maybe it helps for minor things, drool and whatnot simply by providing bulk between sheet and mattress, but I wouldn't count on it for anything major. Really wish I had better things to say about it.	
- 1	The design and concept is great, very handy, but its not well made - the handle broke and the extension stuck from the beginning. If it were better made, I would give them more stars as its very easy to attach your seat and even though my daughter had NO interest riding in it through the airport, it saved us from having to carry it around which is really not feasible with a big car seat, luggage and a baby.	
- 1	I just received my sleep sack that I was planning to use for my 3-month-old daughter.  The side seams are badly twisted on both sides, and the sack does not lie flat.  It looks like it was either sewn improperly or washed or dried at high heat.  Other reviewers stated that items made in certain countries were of lesser quality.  The one I received was made in India.  These have gotten such great reviews, and I really don't want to use a polyester sleep sack, so I plan to order another one in the hopes that the next one won't be defective.UPDATE: I just received a second sleep sack after sending the first one back.  I now know that the first sack sent to me had been washed and/or dried improperly and then returned.  It was about half the size of the new replacement, and came with no instructions or tags.  The wool on the inside was also pilly.  The reason the seams were all twisted and wavy was because the garment had shrunk but the seams hadn't.  There was no way it would still fit my baby at two years old.The new one was quite large and laid flat, and came with a pretty mesh bag as well as instructions for use.  Unfortunately my baby hasn't been weaned from swaddling so I haven't gotten any use out of it yet.  I tried putting her down for her nap in the sleep sack and she wouldn't stop crying.  I gave up and swaddled her instead.  I will update this once we're able to wean her from swaddling (hopefully soon).  I will also be very careful about how I wash and dry it, since I know what will happen if I do it wrong.	
1. 	My Daughter loves this thing! She is petite and at 4 1/2 months she was able to sit in the cart perfectly! I love the velcro toy straps and the pockets in the back of it. Doesn't fit perfectly in our Target carts but it does fit, I have had no issues with any other cart. Its super easy to roll back together! You can easily do it while holding baby in one arm. It also washes beautifully. I highly recommend this product and I am sooo happy I didn't buy the first one in the store. It pays to do your research and I promise you, this one will not disappoint!	
- 1	This duck was more of a fun purchase we thought we would take with us when we travelled. We used it once, its kind of annoying to blow up each time you want to use it and it just really isn't practical. It's cheap so its not a big deal, we just wouldn't recommend buying it. Good quality overall, we like the temperature monitor to show if its too hot.	
- 1	I was disappointed... these are thicker than the ones we got from the hospital and my baby could tell the difference.	
1. 	Before my son was born I bought him fisher price bath tub. I liked to look at it, and imagined how I would bathe my baby in it. So the time came, and Nick was born 9 lb 4 oz. Huge?! Oh yeah - he was too big for his tub. And bathing him was such a disaster :( especially when he started to jump out of it. I couldn't bathe him alone, my first hand was busy with holding him and the other one was shampooing. And my husband was showering. We tried to switch to an adult tub, but as he can't sit yet it was even more uncomfortable: my back ached, the baby was scared, and I was nervous.When my son turned 4 months, he weighed about 20 lb I couldn't wait anymore, and again searched net for bath tubs. All I saw was about same size as fisher price. Finally after googling my baby doesn't fit his bath tub, I found an advice from woman who recommended trying primo eurobath, date of her advice was 2001, but anyway I tried to amazon it and found it to my great surprise. After looking at customer photos I understood this is exactly what I need.So it came, I cleaned it and we tried it same evening: Nick was so happy. He was sitting like a king on his throne in it. Primo is designed so well, like it was created just for the shape of my baby. It has space for his hands, bump doesn't let him to jump out, it's pretty high, and it also holds well.Our bathing time became much longer. The baby was very happy, smiling all the time, and kicking the water. Mommy was relaxed for the first time, and really had fun :)))	
1. 	Great coverage, very pretty colors... It's true what the other commenters said that the pattern distracts the baby... As long as you're not in the sunlight it's fine.... My daughter likes to kick the cover which causes some issues at times, but over all I really like it... Comes in handy when my daughter is hungry and I'm in a pinch	
1. 	These are thoughtfully designed. Our 14 month old uses them easily for snacking on cheerios. He loves to hold the container by its handles. Yes, sometimes he drops a few cheerios, but this still prevents a ton of mess. They are BPA free and seem very sturdy and safe. The munchkin packaging (not the shipping packaging, but the packaging on the actual snack catcher) was a pain.	
- 1	Good idea, however it did not work for me. My oven handle was is in the way. I think it would be a good product if your oven handle isn't too high up on the oven.	
1. 	This Boppy is very comfortable.  I like the asymmetrical design; it allows me to tuck the larger part between my legs while the smaller part is wedged under my belly for extra support.  I had been having hip pain while sleeping at night and this little jobby did the trick.  The only negative comment I have on this is that it does tend to make me a little warm while sleeping but I think anything would.  All in all this was a great purchase and I would suggest it to anyone trying to adjust to sleeping on their side (I am typically a stomach sleeper) or to anyone experiencing hip pain.UPDATE:  I have now had my baby and have used this pillow to help prop him up during feedings!!!  I have gotten my money's worth out of this Boppy; I use it every day still.	
- 1	I started using my Medela Pump In Style Advanced when my baby was a couple of months old to store up milk for when I went back to work full-time.  I used it until it lost suction after ten months, then used the replacement Medela sent me for another seven months.  After my replacement PISA crapped out as well, I switched to the Spectra S2, which is so, so much better! I'll give you a quick summary and some pros and cons first, then more details, for anyone who wants them.SUMMARYThe Medela PISA worked tolerably well for me at first, but it gradually lost suction. It was never that comfortable, or that efficient, and the lack of separate controls for suction and speed made it that much less comfortable and less efficient.  But I liked the letdown mode, and it mostly got the job done until it lost suction.  The Spectra S2 is way better, both in terms of comfort and efficiency.  Given the much higher quality pumps now available in the same price range, I wouldn't buy the Medela PISA again.PROS- Letdown mode gets the milk flowing quickly- Great collection kit - it's easy to find replacement parts, and the design makes it easy to swap in different sizes, styles and brands of breast shields so that you can use one that fits you just right. The fact that the connector piece rests flat on its back is also convenient when you're setting up and when you are disassembling to store your milk.- Customer service is easy to reach and helpful - or at least as helpful as they can be given that this product simply craps out after a year or less. They quickly replaced my first pump at no charge after I called them about the problem, but they wouldn't replace my replacement pump when it died, too.- Can buy with handy carrying tote that includes insulated bag, contoured ice pack, and everything you need (except a hands-free bra) to pump on the go.- Can use included battery pack for when you don't have access to a power outlet.  If you want to have the same kind of suction you do from a wall outlet, you'll have to replace the batteries pretty often (every several uses, and definitely long before they are completely dead), but having that option is so useful when you're traveling or if you have to pump in your car at work.- Quiet enough to use at work or on when traveling.  It's not whisper-quiet by any stretch, but you can use this pump behind closed doors at work or (under a nursing cover) on a plane without making a huge ruckus.  It is also quiet enough to use while watching TV without making it hard to hear your program.  It is louder than the Spectra S2, about the same volume as the Spectra 9, but quieter than the Hygeia Enjoye.CONS- No separate speed and suction controls. This means that unless you want the suction to be inadequate, the pump is almost always cycling too fast - for me, the milk would still be freely streaming out and the PISA would tug again.  This means a LOT of needless tugging on the nipples, which means less comfort, and less efficiency.- Not efficient.  With this pump, it took me 20+ minutes to pump the same volume of milk I can pump in 5-9 minutes, and in far greater comfort, with my Spectra S2.- Pump gradually loses suction in a way that isn't particularly noticeable.  This can be a real threat to your milk supply, and I'm sure it leads to some women giving up on pumping - either because they aren't getting enough milk anymore (and don't know that the problem is the pump, not them), or because they end up cranking up the pump and hurting themselves.- From my experience, this pump seems pretty unlikely to last through a year of breastfeeding. Definitely don't count on it lasting through a second child.  For hygiene reasons, you aren't supposed to use this pump after someone else has, but even setting aside that concern, you wouldn't want to do so anyway, as the pump will probably be useless by this point. It may sound and seem like it's working, from the way it pulls, but the suction will be long gone.  (Don't confuse discomfort when pumping with adequate suction - you can definitely have the former without the latter, and you probably will, with this pump, in less than a year.)MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PUMPThe pump worked pretty well for me at first, though it wasn't all that comfortable, and although, like any pump, it always left a little milk behind.  Always took about 20+ minutes to pump, not including setup and cleanup time. I was able to improve its efficiency and comfort somewhat by switching breast shields and using Pumpin Pal's Super Shields (Super Shields Medium (pair) (23-29mm) (accessory for Breast Pump)).  But after the first couple of months, it began to gradually lose suction, and was more or less completely useless after ten months of pretty regular use (2-3 times per day, weekdays).  The worst thing was, it still *seemed* to be working at this point - it still tugged uncomfortably, as usual, and it still sounded the same.  The only difference was the gradual loss of suction - I only realized how bad it was when I discovered I could hand express more milk, after pumping, than I had gotten from pumping for 20+ minutes, even at a much higher setting than I'd had to use when I first started pumping.  I called Medela, and they did some troubleshooting over the phone, then agreed to send me a replacement pump at no cost - they also had me ship the old pump back on their dime.  The pump worked well again for a couple of months of lighter use (I was now pumping only 1-2 times per day, weekdays only), but then completely lost suction after seven months.  As before, the pump seemed to be working, except that it was extracting so little milk! Medela wouldn't replace the replacement. At that point, I started looking at other pumps, and I am so glad that I did - the Spectra S2 pump I have now is so, so much better - much quieter, much more efficient, and more comfortable, with separate speed and suction controls.The only thing I miss about the Medela PISA as compared to the Spectra S2 is that the PISA could use battery power - the Spectra S2 can't. That was a super-convenient feature of the PISA!  But I'd much rather have a pump that works so much better than the PISA for daily use. (If you need a pump that can use a backup source of power, you might want to try the Spectra S9.  Alternately, a manual pump might be a good backup to use for those situations, if you can find one that works well for you.)	
1. 	This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)	
1. 	I was skeptical with this chair, bc of its price but kuddos to Regalo, what a great product! I can't believe it.I actually bought a traditional high chair and this one, to return the one that wouldn't work. This is a keeper!Pros:It takes ZERO space in the house. I live in a 700sq Ft apartment, so every inch counts. I installed it in the counter and I can actually fit the chair that goes normally there, underneath. (So far with the baby using the Regalo chair, but that won't last long of course).Very, very easy installation. I read some reviews about not fitting thick tables but my counter is 2 so it works perfect and I've to say I don't see why it wouldn't work on a 3 or 4 inches one. It does needs a good 9 inches depth from the edge.Portable (it's on the description, so... true to that).Convenient.Easy to wipe off or wash if needed (no need to uninstall the chair as the pad comes off the velcro). I haven't washed it yet, just spot clean.Comfortable for the child: My daughter is a very difficult eater, so the chair is a huge part of her meals. She puts no resistance when getting into the chair and even after being done with eating she doesn't want to be taken out of it immediately, so, thumbs up!Price!Cons:The straps, like in every other chair aren't all that easy to wipe but if you put the bib after having the child secured, they shouldn't get food ;-)I'm about to get another to have it with me in the stroller or at grandma's!Just hoping it last!Totally recommended.	
- 1	I feel like my son has trouble getting the water out of the spout.So I use this cup without the top on it, and he gets more.Better off getting a normal cup, in my opinion..	
- 1	I bought this cup after hearing how it is supposed to help the baby learn to use a straw.  You are supposed to be able to squeeze the sides and the water goes up into the straw.  However, the design of this cup has recently changed.  The outside is very hard plastic and is impossible to squeeze, which defeats the whole purpose of this &#34;training&#34; cup.	
1. 	This Is a great product. The sleep sheep is very soothing for baby. We love the heart beat sound. It helps the baby settle down in his crib. I would recommend to other parents.	
- 1	This little Flimsy bumper is not only NOT for a standard crib but too small and cheap for the tiniest cradle.	
- 1	We loved our Diaper champ deluxe until it was about 9 months old.  Then we noticed an undescribable smell in the nursery.  Low and behold it was the diaper champ :(  So after cleaning and soaking in everything from vinegar to baking soda to bleach, nothing defeated the grossness.  We followed every instruction and nothing.  Come to find out, it was the plastic seal in the lid of the diaper champ that was causing the odor.  You can't clean these???? (I tried) Which makes no sense to me.  Anyway, we contacted babytrend, the makers of Diaper Champ to get a replacement seal.  They are on back-order??? So they took my information and were going to ship it out for almost $10.00 plus S&H when it came in. Over a month later, and no seal.  I don't understand how a company who makes an item can claim they are on back-order for over a month. According to the representative at baby trend, they don't have to supply replacement parts, it is an extra service they provide for their customers. She then proceeded to agree with me when I said I guess I should just trash the useless diaper champ and look for something else since they could not give me any idea as to when the replacement seal would be available.  Seriously! So needless to say, we are on the hunt for a new diaper pail.  Sorry, but no need to waste money on a pail that does't even last a year.  A trash can with a lid in the nursery would have served us just as well.	
- 1	When the car seat is locked in place, my 2.5 year old's head has to be tilted way forward when sitting on the bench seat in order to make room for it. Even when the car seat isn't in, the front seat's highest position is still leaning so far back that it bonks my toddler in the head. A baby in the car seat would be kicking the toddler in the head, an older baby in the stroller seat would be cracking heads with the toddler constantly. How does anyone else deal with this very glaring spatial issue?If they just made this a little bit longer, it would make more sense. As is, I don't see how anyone can properly use it so the toddler is comfortably sitting on the bench seat. I hoped that the bench seat could be scooted back to accommodate a growing toddler, but it's locked into place.I'm now realizing there are few if any pictures from the side showing a young toddler sitting on the bench with the car seat in the front seat. Probably because they don't want to show you just how cramped and awkward it is for the toddler!Now we want to return it and can't get the stroller to come apart completely, so we'll have a hard time getting it back into the box it arrived in. Definitely regret buying a stroller online without being able to test drive it in a store first. Live and learn.	
- 1	The idea is sound, but the design is poor.An others have mentioned, the leg holes are too far apart. My 8 month is still too small for it. The leg holds are much too far apart for her body. She falls over to one side (leg hole) or the other, with the other leg then in the air.Maybe she can use it at 12 months.Also, the spring design is terrible. It isn't adjustable. Frankly speaking, it's cheap and does not flex (spring) smoothly up and down (the desired effect). For proper function, the spring tension must be adjustable, to adapt to the varying weights of different size children.This is rated up to 24 pounds. So for a girl (my case), I can only use this from 12 months to around 18-21 months. Not even one year. This doesn't make for an attractive purchase. If the leg holes were closer together so that a 6-8 month toddler could make use of it, I could at least get one year's use out of it.Children get bored with this, hanging in one location. A walker is much more attractive to the child as they can move about and have lights and other functions to play with, and they're legs get as much if not more exercise.	
1. 	Perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for!  I put my little Grandson on this in my kitchen sink for a bath and he was comfortable and happy; no slipping around.  When he was smaller he leaned back on it and splashed a little and enjoyed the water.  Now he's a little older (7 months) so he sits up on it and plays with toys.  It's perfect; so easier than a slippery tub/sink, and so much easier that trying to sit on a towel, etc.  I also lay it down dry on my kitchen counter, or anyplace, covered with a towel, and use it for a changing table.	
1. 	I had no problems installing this without even reading the instructions. It's been great now that I'm used to opening it and can do so with one hand. Really helps so I can let her in the bathroom without her trying to play in the toilet. She tries to work it off but so far it's not budging. Good price too compared to what I was looking at in the stores.	
- 1	When my baby was born prematurely, it was important to me to get her breast milk by any means necessary.  I got the Ameda Purely Yours on the suggestion of the hospital lactation consultant.  They use Ameda pumps throughout the hospital and she thought it would be best if my hygenikit matched the ones they had.  In retrospect, I probably should have done more research on pumps before hand.I can use this pump, but I find it very frustrating.  It loses suction every 10 cycles or so, so I need to reset the caps.  The valves are finicky and weak.  They are supposed to last 2-3 months, but i find that if I don't replace them weekly, I don't get any milk.  Since I'm still pumping 3 months later, I rented an Ameda Elite.  It's better, but I wish I would have just gone with Medela pumps.	
1. 	Nothing quite gets my goat more than waking up in the middle of the night covered in milk because of a leaky bottle. Temper, angry words, hurt feelings, the inevitable rest of the night sleeping on the lumpy couch because you blamed your wife for leaving the bottle on the bed after putting the newborn back in the crib. These were the events that followed due to the dysfunction of every set of bottles I have ever owned before receiving the Playtex VentAire bottle set.These bottles do not leak as long as you screw the lid on tightly. I am really glad that these bottles do not contain BPA and relieved that they are supposedly easy to clean but what makes me really pleased is that if the bottle makes it through a night on the bed I do not wake up doused in milk.For the good of your relationship with your SO, for the sake of your back, for the sake of the environment because of all of the laundry required due to a leaky bottle just go ahead and add this item to your shopping cart.	
1. 	My daughter-in-law loves this...even used it to lean her 2-week old for his first baby shoot.  We looked at two other brands, which this one matches in features and THIS one was HALF the price.  I thought it was a pricing error initially.	
1. 	Pros:Interchangeable cards, a more versatile mobile than most availableLightweightNot bulky and obtrusiveReally like the stimulating designs/colors/black & whiteCons:The interchangeable cards can be hard to disconnect and connectDepending on the design of your crib, this attachment device may not work	
- 1	With another baby on the way, we were looking for a second baby monitor but after trying to use this one for a couple days, I am ready to throw it in the trash.Setting up the camera was easy enough. I followed the instructions for resetting the camera, which only took a couple minutes. First, I tried to access the camera from my Macbook Pro. It is running Mac OS 10.7.5, which meets the system requirements. I went to the website and created an account. I first tried Firefox and after logging in, I got the message We currently do not support your browser on MAC platform.... So I tried updating Firefox to the latest version. Still got the message. So I followed the link to download the latest version of Safari. I didn't get much further. I could see my camera Loading... in the background but the message in the foreground said Please Wait.. We are downloading the JAVA Applet. This may take a few minutes depending on your Network Speed. I left it overnight and it still had the same message. I checked my download speed and it is 32 Mbps. I'm fairly certain the download issue is not due to my internet speed.On my iPhone 5 and iPad 2, I had no problem downloading the app and connecting to the camera but I was disappointed again. We have a regular video monitor and in comparison, the picture quality was terrible. It constantly looked out of focus, there was a delay in the feed and usually very choppy. I could take pictures but when I tried to record a video, I got the message Not supported. Video recording is not supported, coming soon.I am giving the product 2 stars because the two way speaker feature did work well. My husband and I could hear each other clearly. The camera did take pictures and I appreciate the temperature feature although I'm not sure how accurate it is since our thermostat showed that the room was at 72 degrees and the camera showed 68 degrees. But in terms of what we were looking for, it just did not deliver.	
- 1	Good Idea , but its glue is use less. It didn't stick plus when I manage to glue them with another adhesive , it didn't work . so it is just a waste of money	
1. 	A friend recommended this blanket to me before my baby was born. I didn't use them right away. One day I remembered I had them and started to use them. They are awesome. I don't swaddle my baby the exact way as the instruction suggest, I modified it a little and it works great. If she is not swaddled, she doesn't sleep for a long time, she wakes up with her own movements. She is now two months.I enjoy this product.	
1. 	I love this diaper Champ. I got it as a shower gift and hadent heard of it before but when I started using it I had to tell all my friends. This will definatly be my gift of choice from now on to all my pregnant friends. As other reviews say the smell isnt that great when it gets full but its not that bad (I see it as a hint the bag is full and its time to change). I also spray the inside w/ febreeze or lysol disinfectant during each change and that nips the problem in the bud. Overall, Its one of those things that I cant live without but didnt know it until I got it.	
- 1	She snags this off each time I put it on my 13 mo old. Guess I should've bought it when she was first introduced to solids. Will try again with the next one.	
- 1	I ordered this thinking it would be a replacement change pad for my Ju Ju Be diaper bag, as in the same/similar quality to the ones that actually come with the bag.  Instead this is basically just a piece of fabric, way too thin fabric.  I wanted another change pad so that I could wash one while always having one in my bag. However, this one is just not good enough.  There is no padding, and is just thin fabric.  It is also a little smaller than I was expecting.  Basically save your money, and skip this purchase.	
- 1	I thought we would love this sleeper and we did at first.  I read reviews prior to purchasing about babies getting flat heads after sleeping in these, so I have been carefully paying attention to our daughters head.  I thought that if she only slept in it at night, that would not happen.  I was wrong!  Our daughter is only 4 1/2 weeks old and I have already noticed her head starting to flatten out.  We have stopped using this product.  Other than that we loved it.  We loved how easy it was to move from room to room.  We now have her sleeping in a cradle and it is much harder to move around and we can't use it while traveling.  Maybe the other Rock n Plays with the bunny or puppy would be ok?  Those look like they have a lot more padding around the head.	
- 1	I purchased this to give my five month old somewhere to sit beside her bouncy seat and am underwhelmed by the quality and construction. The fabric is very course and the toy bar seems rather chintzy, although I normally remove the toy bars so my daughter can see what's going on around her anyway. The seat also seems somewhat jerky when rocked and just looks uncomfortable. That said, it's not terrible and I didn't hate it enough to send it back. I submit this review only to let other potential buyers know that the quality isn't what it should be given the price tag.	
1. 	The bib works great.  My 14-month old is not able to pull it off, which was our only problem with the other Bumkins.  The only problem with this is that it is very big -- so the pocket doesn't sit in the right place and catch the falling food.  But other than that, it does the job.  She'll grow into it.  As with all Bumkins, it's easy to clean off.  I wipe it off or rinse it off in the sink, then hang to dry.  I wash/dry them with the rest of her laundry every weekend, and it's held up fine.	
1. 	We used this for our fire place. There is a raised seat and we used two of the corners and covered the edges. So far it has stuck well and I feel so much better not having to worry about our little guy falling into the sharp edge. Our fire place is tile and the color blends in well!	
1. 	This blanket makes swaddling easy and my baby sleeps great in it!  We bought a second one so we will always have a clean one on hand.  It is a nice, soft, sturdy fabric with just the right amount of give and the pink is a nice baby pink.  The only negative is that we have a very tall baby and at 2 1/2 months she is already too long for her legs to fit in the leg pocket.  But we are still using the miracle blanket without swaddling her legs and she is sleeping just as well.  Highly recommend this blanket!	
- 1	This brush fell apart after only using it for two weeks. The sponge at the very top of the brush completely came off and is now useless to clean the bottom of the bottle. Don't waste your money on this one....it won't last.	
- 1	This ink pad arrived in a plastic bag, and was also wrapped in cellophane, but even with these precautions, it was completely dried out - I couldn't even get a smudge of ink to show up on my finger. I tried adding a little bit of water to the pad to re-wet the ink, which didn't work. This was really a complete waste of money and I will be asking for my money back.	
- 1	We purchased 2 think baby sippy cups & sippy to thinkster conversion kits.  I received them & followed ThinkBaby's instructions for before use care.  My children do NOT like drinking from these cups.  I even tried the conversion kit since they seem to like straws now.  I could not figure out WHY they would not drink from them until yesterday.  I picked up the bottle and took a drink out of it myself.  It tasted terrible.  It tasted like I was drinking out of a smelly garbage bag.  The water tasted like disgusting plastic.  I know it is not the water itself since we used bottled water or filtered tap water.  I am not happy with this product or the money that I wasted on it.  I wanted to return them directly to ThinkBaby for a refund or to receive some sort of compensation (store credit towards something else like their lunch kits).I contacted ThinkBaby directly & they simply DO NOT back their products with a customer satisfaction guarantee.  Instead of empathy OR concern over the taste emitted, the company stated: &#34;One of the advantages of our plastic is that it does not release harmful chemicals.  The emails we typically receive our actually quite opposite. Folks are pleasantly surprised that the bottles don&#8217;t exhibit the typical taste.  Bottled water and filtered water can easily have flavor, and most of the materials used in those devices are completely suspect, especially PET.  The other area that any after taste could potentially come from is from the detergents used.  Washing the bottles with a chlorine based material could provide after taste.  We would recommend boiling the bottles and trying a dish detergent like Ecover or something by Seventh Generation.&#34;Other than the terrible taste, the actual cup is a nice design since it has fluid measurements on the side of it (which most sippy cups do NOT).  One downside is that the handle is hard to get lined up when you screw it all together.  I did NOT have tons of trouble with the &#34;nipples&#34; leaking, but it did leak some when the bottle was laid on it's side. Thinkster straw (conversion kit) is NOT easy to clean.  OVERALL, I would NOT recommend this product simply due to the taste of plastic.  They claim their product is safe, but I would never let my children drink from cups that make the water taste like this!  It is terrible.  AND I KNOW it is NOT our tap water...we drink it ALL the time & it does not have that trash bag taste!	
1. 	it's very cute and useful - from getting the straps into my baby's chubby neck since he has very sensitive skin!  i was worried it would be too hot for him, but it's not that bad.	
- 1	These are a pain for all of the adults involved in my son's care b/c each cup comes apart in three pieces for washing and they are a tight fit (making it so nicely spill-proof I'm sure).Tough to disassemble, and tough to reassemble.  I've also noticed the deep grooves in the spout don't like to come clean in the dishwasher, and instead collect residue and/or soap stains.	
- 1	These were not worth the cost. These were not particularly helpful for me and made my already enlarged breasts look ridiculous.	
1. 	For the most part, I like this product. The first one I bought died after about 15 uses. The second one outlived my son's bottle use, and it worked great. You do have to shake the bottle to distribute the heat evenly and test it, but that's normal for any bottle warmer. Ours worked in about 10 minutes, but it depends on how warm your baby likes their bottle. For $10 I was happy with it.	
1. 	This bib is awesome. We bought two; one for home and one for the diaper bag. They're so easy to clean, and they're still machine washable (hang dry!). They're nice and big: they cover lots and lots of the front of our messy baby. I'm not sure how much the pocket helps, but I'm certainly not complaining.	
1. 	When my son started licking electric outlets, I knew it was time to baby proof!  These work very well.  I have caught my son playing with the electric outlets and fingering the covers, but he can't get them off (thank goodness!).  The good news is, with a little tugging, I can get 'em off for vacuuming and such.  Solid product, good price!	
1. 	Turned out to be a total stink bomb. Read my new review.  It absolutely reeks after 16 months.  Amazon will not let me alter the star rating or it would be only one starDo NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough for visitors to use- too difficult for them to play with.  Many of the grown-ups in my world can't help but tinker with whatever new items are placed before them.  I'm thrilled they can't figure out how to open the DC.  As it emits a powerful odor when the lid is opened, I'm happy they can't figure it out.  I think this lid will confound any toddler, but it's really simple for parents once you get the concept down.I just wish it could empty its own payload.  I'll definitely be first in line for the Diaper Champ robot.	
1. 	I bought it at a garage sale, so I didn't spend much.I thought my 17 months old is way over these kind of toys, but she liked it. She pulls the head out and carries it by the head, and she kicks it around like a ball.I bet if she was even younger she would have more fun with it.	
1. 	Very satisfied with this, my daughter drools a lot and this kept my Bjorn away from the white stains and kept her face from being wet from the drool.	
- 1	this is impossible to use. Its very very very warm . I live in Beverly Hills and we have a very hot weather anyway, but i keep my bedroom cold. However , when you are [prego, you flush anyway, so having this was a nightmare that I ahd to return	
1. 	The Boppy pillow is the one must-nave item for you and your baby. Use it around your waist to help support your newborn while he nurses ... mine is asleep on ours after nursing as I write! At a few months of age, use it under his tummy to work on tummy time. Eventually, he can use it as a support when he learns to sit up! With so many covers to choose from and so easy to care for, it's something every new mom should have.	
1. 	This chair is quite nice.We had the more expensive Chicco chair, but this is just as good for its purpose.This fits our table top because of its adjustable handles and doesn't make our kitchen/dining area look like a childcare.If you are on a budget. This is the one to get.Much better than those big bulky high chairs everyone uses.Only got 4 stars because there is no color choices.	
1. 	I just can't say enough about buying quality items, even if they are a little more expensive.  This carrier lasted me through three of my own babies (within 38 months) and a friend who borrowed it.  My husband could (and did) wear it and it was huge for freeing up my hands for the other kids.  All my kids slept in it all the time when I wore it, and it was great when I could finally turn them outward too.  The only thing I will say is that the instructions said you could nurse the baby in it.  I never figured that out successfully, and ended up with a couple of slings for that trick.  All in all though, this kept all my babies snug, secure, and in kissing distance at all times.	
- 1	If I could give this product 0 stars, I would for this reason. I called Blooming Bath customer service today for product information. I had used the bath about 3 times, and after reading on the package that it was made with polyurethane foam, I wondered if there were any flame retardants used in the foam. Lo and behold, the foam contains toxic and potentially harmful flame retardants, which is not mentioned anywhere on their site. Feeling guilty for giving my baby virtually a chemical bath, I tossed it away immediately and purchased the non-toxic Boon Naked bath. Blooming Bath is just not worth the money. People need to know that this product IS treated with chemical flame retardants.	
- 1	had to return it because i couldn't stand the rubber smell...so sad because i really wanted him to gnaw on sophie :(	
1. 	These bibs are wonderful. Not only are they pretty but they do absorb well and you can embroider on them to personalize them. I got these for my granddaughter. They do have boy colors too in blues and greens. Well worth the price.	
- 1	This product is a mess! It was a pain to fill, it leaked everywhere. So irritated! Would not recommend! Blah	
- 1	these bottles definitely seemed to help with my daughter's colic, but they drive us nuts.First, the measurements are tiny and extremely difficult to read - as are the nipple flow indicators.  I have twins on different flows and they are hard to tell apart - especially in the middle of the night.Second, these bottles leak so badly.  I have followed all of the instructions and have several of the bottles, but each of them drip terribly.  You need to wash your hands and arms after feeding the kid, and they don't travel well, even with the little disks they provide to stop leakage.Lastly, with the caps the bottles are longer than standard bottles, so you can forget about fitting them in any bottle holders, coolers, or standard diaper bag bottle pockets.I actually don't mind all of the parts; some other bottles out there are worse.	
1. 	Our son received the small for his birthday and when I first reviewed it, I thought it was too small for him to use as a walker because the bar seemed too low - he was pushing it around partly bent over. (12 mos., 20 lbs, 29 in) But as he worked on his ability to walk more, he quit bending over so much and it works great for him as a walker now. He loves to push the wheels bug around - it is a good part of his play. It does move pretty quickly if he wants it too, but it is very stable. At first, I'd recommend starting out only on carpeted surfaces until they get used to this toy as a walker. Our son uses it on carpeted surfaces for the most part. He has escaped into the kitchen when the gate was left open, and he loved racing around on the linoleum.The tiger is cute design, and well made. Our son likes to pull the tail and play with the ears and likes moving it around although he hasn't quite gotten the hang of scooting around on it yet. The fuzzy ears and tail might get dirty over time, so you might want to pick an more easily cleaned design like the pig or ladybug if you are looking for a family with more than one kid or a child are setting.::Rob's wife	
1. 	I like the wooden legs as they go with my maple furniture.I like the simplicity of it, as when the kid grows up, it does not sream baby stuff.Nothing fancy and very practical.BUY IT, you won't regret it :)	
- 1	I was looking for a food pouch that doesn't leak. Found this one and was glad that the opening was difficult to open. That's good right? Wrong. After a while of having to tear open the opening and spooning in food purees into the small opening, it got tiresome. In addition, after sipping out half of the contents of the pouch, the rest can just be sipped as well, the food puree has to be pushed up to the top portion of the pouch. This is not the case with other pouches I've used, nor the Plum Organics etc baby food pouches.The only plus I see with this food pouch design is that the cap is large, much like the food pouches sold in stores.	
1. 	I really like this product. It is made of good quality and does the job. I just wish it wrapped around more because I'm always having to use an extra blanket or something to cover my back and sides.	
1. 	I love this kit.  Everything in this kit is a necessity and works well.  My only complaint is the nail clippers.  They are a bit big to use on a newborn...Oh, and I wish I knew what hospital the lady went to that received all of these products...I got diapers and a formula bag...I had to sneak the t-shirt and blanket for memories!!	
1. 	Love these! Thank you....It's a universal color. Wish I would have bought these for my daughter when she was an infant. They aren't took bulky, easy to wash (I throw them in a pillow case in the washer) and they're easy to put on and take off. :)	
- 1	I bought the Discovery 5 because it looked bigger than what we had... It is bigger, and even lighter, but it is too hard to snap into the base to start. You have to push the front in first before the back locks (the other one I had just snapped right on top of the base), so it's quite hard to line up when you're carrying a heavy baby. Also, the straps on my other one adjusted from the front with a simple latch and pull. This one supposedly you can adjust from behind, but no matter what I do.. pull hard, pull light, pull with the buttons pushed, etc.. I can NOT get the straps to budge.I've had the seat get stuck in the base in the front part that you have to snap before locking the whole thing down. It is such a headache, and I hate this seat. I'm considering it $60 wasted, because I've had it 2 weeks and I just can't stand it anymore and I'm going to have to find a new seat.	
1. 	I, and my daughter of course, love these cups. They were smaller than i thought (6 oz) but they are great for juice at snack time ect... My daughter is just transitioning from bottles to cups and these work great.	
- 1	very nice material, but it just doesn't absorb my sons pee. i originally bought these to use as reusable, earth friendly wipes, but to be honest i got lazy and running back and forth to the sink got old. so i was using them as a pee shield for my baby boy (because as anyone with a boy knows, its unsafe to leave them exposed while changing) and it just doesn't absorb... instead the pee goes down right onto the changing pad, which is exactly what i'm trying to avoid. anyway, so now i have 20 of these and use them to wipe his drool. oh well!	
1. 	I use this at least twice a day to sterilize my avent pump and storage bottles. It is fast and easy and I can't imagine going back to boiling bottles again. A must have for working moms.	
- 1	We've found hit-and-miss uses for these chopsticks for our 2.5 year old son. I like that the connection piece helps to teach him proper technique but it's a little bulky for his little fingers to wrap around. I tried adjusting them further down the chopsticks so that he wouldn't have to grip/hold the chopsticks together so hard to hang on to a piece of food. That seemed to help a bit. However, we've found the material that the chopsticks are made out of to be too plastic-ky/slippery to be used with the foods that we eat. He'll use them once or twice at the beginning of the meal and then, he gets frustrated and asks for his fork or spoon. It's very exciting when he does get a piece of chicken or vegetable into his mouth though, so I'm hoping that he'll use the chopsticks more as he grows up and can give a firmer grip to his food. It's so sad when he finally picks up a piece of food with the chopsticks only to have it fall out just as he's about to put it in his mouth.	
1. 	I have Avent bottles, but don't have the Avent pump (so didn't get storage accessories).  Instead of buying a storage kit for $25, this plus the Avent Sealing discs (total cost of $10), gave me the storage bottles I needed.  It works very well and I would definitely recommend.	
- 1	My son loved this toy. Too bad it wasn't made to Fisher Price standards. It didn't last. I guess it just wore out - no more spinning. My 18 month-old was a little rough with it holding down the spinning circles and trying to spin them himself. I didn't give it a second thought because you know, it's Fisher Price. It should be able to handle an 18 month-old! Sigh. He was getting frustrated it didn't spin anymore I had to get rid of it. What a waste.	
- 1	My baby does not like this teether. I guess she finds it big for herself. I suggest you find a smaller one which can be easily grasped by your baby.	
1. 	Didn't know the thing moved around kind of like a snake.  My daughter thinks it's fun for about 20 seconds and then tries to gnaw it to pieces.  Good toy!!!	
1. 	This is the third Cloud night light I purchased for a gift; the other two were for my grandchildren.  The lights are so soft and soothing no matter which color you choose red, blue or green.  It shines stars all over the room (ceiling & walls) depending here you put the  stuffed animal (we usually place it on the floor).  Wish I had this when my children were babies as it's really neat!  Made well and the batteries are securely placed where the children will not access them.HIGHLY recommend this for your children, grandchildren or for a gift.  An excellent gift that will be loved for years to come!  Being that this is the third one I bought, it's obvious I like the product, that's why I gave it 5 stars.	
1. 	There is no perfect solution to window blind cords, but I think these do well. I actually used this kind years ago for pets. I do usually have to open and close them to unwind, but that is okay. What is important is that they put the cord high above a child's reach. I just ordered many more for the rest of the windows. However, for the kid's room we have the kind that is screwed into to the wall and wraps the cord around, so there is no chance of these plastic parts falling.	
1. 	How a parent doesn't own a box of these is beyond me!  So convenient and they really cover up that awful poopy smell!  Just fling them into the garage garbage and done!	
- 1	I had high hopes for this product - it's super easy to swaddle the baby in this product compared to other swaddle blankets, but my son (at 6.5 pounds) was able to get his arm out of the top every time.	
1. 	Unfortunately, if you have the gate... you will probably have to buy the extension.The extension itself, is very easy to install... it pretty much just side in on either side of the gate. So 5 stars for an easy install.Not much to say but it's most likely a must have product, because an average size hallway will need this extension.	
- 1	After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be great but it didn't work with my little one.  The plastic is sturdy and feels like good quality (hence the 2 stars) but it's not easy to put on and once it is on, my baby could easily take it off or just pull on it and chew on the collar.  It's not comfortable and I would recommend to any Mom to just buy some dark Cotton/polyster bibs and throw them in the wash after each use.  They are soft and easy to work with. If you prefer plastic, the softer ones are better.	
1. 	I bought this for cloth diapers and so far its holding in the smell really well. It holds two or three days worth of diapers which is perfect. The lid DOES come up easily so it won't keep kiddos out.	
1. 	I loved having all of the accessories that allowed me to pump and store breast milk directly in Avent bottles even though I didn't have an Avent Breast Pump.	
- 1	Velcro sucks! and it is such a nuisance to open and close. Don't buy this unless you want an extra hassle	
- 1	I ended up using this when I was at home but it looked too frumpy to wear out.  Made me look even bigger than I was after I have birth.  Not worth the price.	
1. 	This gate is a pressure-mounted gate designed specifically for light traffic (that's what it says on the box!).  It's not meant for the top of stairs.  It doesn't have a latch or door that you can open and close.  But it's a great gate to block off an area that has a wide opening.  There are no other pressure mounted gates on the market that fit this wide of a space (up to 60 inches).  The next widest pressure mounted gate covers just under 48 inches and that one was difficult to install.  This one I had installed in less than 5 minutes, and it's quite secure.  The gate is low enough that an average height Mom or Dad can step right over it, so the lack of a door doesn't bother me at all.  (I'm 5'4 and have no problems swinging my leg over it).  And to top it off, the price is reasonable.If you have a narrower space and want a pressure-mounted gate with a door/latch, I recommend the Hands-Free Gate for The First Years.  I've had it for over 3 years now and use it mulitple times a day without any problems.  It's maximum width is 34 inches.	
- 1	The 3-in-1 idea is excellent, this little potty looks attractive and like a miniature normal toilet, but we have found this toilet pretty useless honestly.- You have to buy the specific Arm and Hammer wipes that fit in the slot, as well as the specific air freshener for the top inside of the lid, so that's extra money if you care about keeping up with those features. For starters, you shouldnt need an air freshener on this potty, seeing as it doesn't flush obviously and you would immediately be cleaning it out after your toddler finishes using it.- This has a lot of parts, something that my two year old son just wants to play with instead of use correctly.- There are grips on the bottom of this thing to prevent it from sliding when your child uses it. (That's the lime green rubber strip on the bottom front and back.) Everytime my son sat on this, it still scooted back, and we now use it as a stepping stool for him to get onto the big toilet, and it still moves when he is just sitting on the toilet and his toes are scraping it a little.- On the seat, there is a urine guard that comes up a little to keep pee from splashing. My son is an average size two year old, and this seat opening is just not big enough for him. His junk sits on top of the urine guard unless we reposition him and show him to move himself around...How we have still managed to get our money from this thing:- NOT buying the air freshener or refill wipes at all.- Giving the seat portion, which pops off for easy cleaning, to my mother-in-law for the time being because it snaps onto a regular toilet seat so they can fit on it for a transition stage to the big potty.- We use this entire toilet for nothing more than stepping stool for my son to get on and off of the potty, which like I said it does slide a little on our tile floor and makes me son go Whoa! Whoa Mommy! hah. Or also for him to wash his hands.- I am planning on reselling it once my son doesn't need the seat adjuster at my In-law's house anymore.In my opinion, I don't think these toddler potties are worth the money. Buy the adjusters for your toilets in your home, and a travel seat to throw in your diaper bag. This is an unnecessary baby item, as are so many these days.	
1. 	These are so easy to install and easy to use! We got one for each toilet and love them. My daughter (19 mos) goes up to it and tries to play with it sometimes, but she's never even come close to getting it open.	
- 1	first off it was extremely hard to mount to the carseat safely.  no matter how hard my husband or i tightened it, the slightest tug from our daughter would make it collapse and fall on her.  i can't believe that this was ever tested out by children, because if it was they would have made some huge changes in design!	
1. 	This little seat is great.  Bought it for my granddaughter.  It is so convenient to carry around, my daughter keeps it in the car, so we have it no matter where we decide to eat.  We love it.  and it is easy to clean.	
- 1	This 1 star is simply for the description of the product. The ADEN by aden+anais brand is of lesser quality and is 3 inches shorter in both length and width than the original aden+anais brand swaddle cloths. There is a big difference. I just wanted to make people aware that they're not ordering these: http://www.amazon.com/aden-anais-Muslin-Swaddle-Jungle/dp/B002SW3B0O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1366406922&sr=8-2&keywords=aden+anais	
- 1	It was ok. The fit was very tight on my playard matress and rolled up. I would save my money next time. I did repurpose this as a changing pad cover, it worked for that but not great for my playard matress.	
1. 	First the bad : we have a standard Moen tub faucet.  The Flo doesn't *quite* sit right on the faucet, so we have to play with it a bit to get all the water to go down the slope, rather than out the back of the Flo.  But it's not really a big deal, just takes a bit of adjusting.The good :  My daughter (11 months old) loves to play with the water coming from the faucet.  The Flo allows her to sit a little further back (thus sparing me stress every time she gets a little tippy!), and she also really delights in the waterfall effect.  When she gets older, I think the bubble bath dispenser will be more appreciated.Speaking of which, other reviewers have mentioned the bubble bath leaking out -- I have seen a few drops in the scoop under the faucet, but nothing major.  It's been on a week, and I've yet to need to refill it.I haven't had any problems with mess with this either.  Even when I didn't have it adjusted just right and water was washing backwards under the faucet, it didn't go everywhere, it just ran down the tub side (INSIDE the tub).If it wasn't for the slightly finicky adjustment necessary, I'd have given this 5 stars!	
- 1	I had the urban bundleme infant and I loved it, I got this one for his stroller for the Michigan Winters and the zipper broke the second time I used it. There doesn't seem to be a stopper at the end of the zipper on one side, so I'm sure it was just a manufacturing error but we were out shopping in the outlet mall and we ended up having to leave early because the one side wouldn't zip.	
- 1	Baby would not take this bottle, and husband had a difficult home putting the pieces of the nipple together.  And when I took the nipple off there was still milk trapped between the two layers and leaked out all, over.  I have tried many bottles that are supposed to 'mimic the breast' and have found just a regular nipple with broad base and short nipple is best.  The ones hat come with my pump work great.	
1. 	We've been using these bottles since our son was 1 week old, and they work great. He had no problem with nipple confusion switching between this bottle and the breast. We've had no problems with leaking, and I love the fact that you can convert the bottles to sippy cups later.One note for breastfeeding moms -- your baby may be able to use the #1 nipple for much longer than a formula-fed baby, since it more closely resembles how the milk comes from you. So wait before buying #2 & #3 nipples, because you may not need them!	
- 1	I bought this after purchasing the Bugaboo Donkey but unfortunately it does not sit right on the handles. It flops down & is very cumbersome. I wish I still had to packaging to return it because we don't use it at all. Just attach your diaper bag & use the pockets in that because this doesn't sit right at all.	
1. 	Babies spit up/drool A LOT, and you have to keep it dry or they'll rash up under all their chins.  I had a surplus of baby clothes, but never enough bibs as the baby would go through 7-8 a day.  I liked these bibs so much I ended up ordering THREE sets of these.Pros:-design of the bib is great.  The liner between the terry ensures maximum absorption but no leakage through.  So many bibs get this part wrong: it's either not absorbent enough (so the spit up just rolls right off and INTO YOUR LAP), or it absorbs completely through (and gets baby's clothes wet).  You need the terry to capture the spit up, but you also need the liner to keep it contained.-price is good/cheap considering it's a 10pack-nice bright colors that hold over time-liner also gives/keeps bib in a nice shape (the bibs don't just wrinkle into a mess like some other all-cloth ones do)-machine washable/dryer use is ok.  I think on the instructions they say to hang out to dry or dry on low, but I just toss them in the dryer with all the other items and 4 months later they are still in great condition.  Moms with babies don't have the TIME to hang things out to dry!	
- 1	The mattress came inside a broken plastic wrap. Look dirty and very soft instead of extra form. I returned it the same day it arrived.	
- 1	Not a fan of this product at all. The box was open inside the packaging box and looked like it was a returned product that they sent me. The carrier says it can be used on newborns but there's is so much fabric that it swallows my baby and I'm constantly fighting to make sure her face isn't covered, I was looking for a carrier that was easy to use when I needed to get stuff done around the house and she wanted to be held but this is not the carrier. I will try again when she is bigger and hopefully it will work then so this wasn't a total waste of my money.	
1. 	I did not want a fussy car seat or travel system so I bought this to use with our Baby Trend car seat. I got great use out of this. It was light weight and worked as it should have. It rolled smoothly. It resembles an old pram when the car seat is in it.Now we move on to a larger stroller since baby is no longer in his car seat. Bummer. :(	
- 1	Piece of junk. Dont bother with the Graco version either. Their quilted sheet is horrible quality too but it fits slightly better than this though. A complete joke. Not even CLOSE to fitting on the pack n play- WAY TOO SMALL. I'm not sure what kind of play yard they are intending this for. A doll bed maybe. and I expected much better from Carter's. One star because the pattern is so cute, otherwise I wouldn't give it any stars at all.	
- 1	worked good for short time but my son fell out of it few times!!! I attached everything the right way but it still did not work, i just bought new bed!! its not strong at all for toddlers	
1. 	We got this for the upcoming arrival of our daughter.  But, the first time I used it was to clean the tub after my husband gave the dog a bath.  IT IS AWESOME!  It's very sturdy and has alot of padding.  I love the arm rest, it came loose a couple of times but a quick cleaning of the side of the tub and suction cups solved that.  I was worried when I read the other reviews of this product, but once I gave it a try I was hooked.  Our daughter and dog will never have a bath again without it.	
1. 	These are great - I use them for cleaning Dr. Brown's and Born Free nipples, as well as in the smaller areas of my breast pump accessories. Good buy.	
1. 	This is a good product.  It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc. and does not require any special bags.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck. It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!! If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor.	
- 1	I bought these only to keep in the diaper bag to use when I have my baby in a public restroom and don't want her to touch the communal changing table.  I chose this option thinking it would be better than using reusable vinyl pads that are made in China and have lead.  I should have heeded the negative reviews.I realized these were small, but they are super tiny.  Even my little munchkin who is still around 12 pounds at nearly three months of age will not be able to get away with using just one of these at a time if I don't want her to touch the changing table.  That means I have to overlap two of them, which is double the cost and still doesn't provide enough coverage when she wiggles, scoots, and kicks.  When other reviewers said they are thin, they were not exaggerating.  I have used two ply toilet paper that feels thicker than one of these, except these have some sort of mega-thin plasticized element that must be there to purportedly help make them waterproof.  I honestly don't see how this will hold anybody's urine because I doubt that anything this thin can be that absorbent.If you need something to use for a changing table in your home, I would highly recommend buying some old-school Gerber lap pads.  They have cotton flannel on both sides, with a layer of waterproof material in the middle.  I have used them on top of my normal changing table pad since day one and have never had anything leak through one of them.  I am now considering buying more of them to carry in the diaper bag and just bag them and wash them at home after each use.  They are much thicker and look more comfortable than this tiny, thin, cheap stuff from Sassy.  Plus, one of them is big enough to prevent my baby from actually touching the gross, germy changing table.Bottom line:  save yourself some time and money.  Skip these and find another option.	
1. 	If I knew about this product sooner, I would not have purchased a high chair.  Adjustable height, detatchable tray...this seat has/does it all.  Clean-up is a breeze.	
1. 	sturdy, good quality, nice design. Buyer be aware that it is kind of short, not tall enough for my 3-yr to watch her hands in the bathroom sink, , but good for getting on the toilet to potty.	
1. 	I've been using this carrier since my daughter was about one week old.  It supports her head just fine, and she usually falls asleep in it, making it possible for me to take the dog for a walk, go to the mailbox, or do a load of laundry, things I could NEVER do with a baby who won't be put down!  It took a few tries to get good at putting her in and taking her out, and I wish the adjustable straps had somewhere to go after tightening, because there is a lot of extra strap just flopping around my legs.  But all in all, this was one of the better purchases we made.	
- 1	I received the activity mat today, and it didn't even occur to me that this product would be treated with flame retardants, but it is. The tag says not only that it meets the ridiculous California flame retardant requirement, but specifically that the filling is resin treated polyester. This could have been a fantastic product, but I'll have to find other ways to entertain and enrich my baby without letting him burrow his face into a toxic mat. I would have appreciated knowing about the contents of the mat ahead of time to save myself the trouble of returning it, and I hope other parents will request healthy products for their children as well.	
- 1	Absorbtion is great but If you are planning on closing them with a snappy, they are not wide enough and I don't have a fat baby (she is in the 30%).	
1. 	These brushes are perfect for getting into the small spaces of my Medela breast pump pieces (the little channels inside the elbow-shaped piece, and the yellow piece that the valve flap goes onto). I've used them for over a year to clean the pump pieces, and I also use them on bottle nipples. They're also a perfect size for cleaning reusable straws. I've never used Dr. Brown bottles, but purchased these when I was specifically needing something to get into the smallest parts from the Medela pump.PROS:BPA FreeConvenientDurableEasy to useWashes Easily	
- 1	This hat was just way too small.  My daughter does have a large head, but I ordered this when she was 5 months old and it was too tight.	
1. 	Came on time, color matched the description, fits great. So far, so good. Haven't used yet, but it looks promising.	
1. 	These little boats have turned out to be a good purchase with our grandchildren for both bath time and pool time. They are colorful and cute, and the variety makes for good play time.	
- 1	delivered promptlyproduct is smaller than original coveri had to air dry the cover fear of shrinkagein search of a better fitted cover.	
- 1	DO NOT buy this potty, for multiple reasons.1) The padded seat area is, as another reviewer called it, a glorified sponge.  It basically will soak up anything that gets on it, which in this case, happens to be pee and poop (see #2).  It then proceeds to smell, and that's especially if you try to wash it since it soaks up the yucky stuff with the water you're washing it with.2) The opening of the potty and the way it's designed make it so that my son can't poop in it without getting poop on the back of the seat.  The opening is too small, I think.  It then gets all over his bottom and his thighs as he tries to get up and proudly look at what he's produced.  He hates this feeling and this has been our only complication in potty training so far.  It's making him hesitant to poop at all and he's currently holding it when he has to go.  Very frustrating.3) The pee guard works well, but again because of the size and positioning of the seat, it rubs up against my son's stuff and I'm sure that can't be too comfortable.Before we actually started potty training and were using this as a step stool, it was great.  I would definitely not buy this as a potty though.	
1. 	My baby only used this once.  He did not like to be swaddled.  If you are planning to get this for yourself, I would wait until after you have the baby to see if he actually likes the swaddle.  As a gift, they are nice, just in case.  My friend recommended this, and she loved hers, it just didn't work for us.  It does have easy instructions, but I would practice on a teddy bear or something before trying it out on your baby.	
1. 	For three months, i was using the 2-piece personal fit breast shields that came with the pump and just washed & sterilize them with the medela steam bag after every use. When I went back to work, I purchased 4 of these and my only regret is that I didnt purchase them sooner! I work 12 hr shifts and pump every 4-6hrs. I've been using them for 3 months now and it is so helpful to have spare parts when I'm on the go. They hold great suction (better than the 2-piece personal fit ones) and are easy to clean. I'm thinking of buying a few more and I would definately recommend these to anyone who pumps regularly.	
- 1	I bought a case of these wipes without previously using them. What a huge regret! I've now tried them several times and they always cause a diaper rash. I recommend pampers sensitive or burts bees. I hate these wipes!	
1. 	I live in Massachusetts and wanted to make sure I could keep my baby warm when we went out. I looked at the BundleMe, but then read that it's not recommended by car safety experts because it sits between baby and the car seat bottom, somehow compromising the seat's performance in a crash. So I went with the CozyUp instead, and am very happy with it so far. It goes on very easily. I thought the head opening might bother my baby, having the fabric so close to her face, but it doesn't seem to. Getting her in and out of the carseat isn't any harder, and I feel confident going out that she is warm. I recommend this to other mothers.	
- 1	I bought this toy for my teething 4 month old after reading so many wonderful reviews.  She loved the squeek and loved chewing on this flexible toy. I loved it for about two weeks. Then I noticed to my horror that it was peeling in many different places and pieces of it were coming off. Now my baby has no teeth as yet but this toy could not even hold up to her gumming.Unless you want your baby ingesting whatever that stuff is made from, don't buy it.	
- 1	My daughters are 2 and 4. We've had bath crayon's before so we know to try and keep them out of the water for the most part but lets be realistic. They are kids and the crayons get dropped in the water. They begin dissolving immediately. I doubt they will last more than 4 baths. These are junk in my opinion.	
- 1	A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	
1. 	I've been using this gate for a couple of months now and it has been a great product. We used it first to create a barrier in the living room and now that my son is walking, we separated it into 3 pieces (1 to block electronics) and 2 other sets to block access to the kitchen when we are cooking.  Great product overall	
1. 	Out of the several I have tried, this is my favorite formula dispenser.  The lid seals tightly without being too hard to remove.  It turns better than others I have and is one molded piece.	
1. 	Home from the hospital, our baby hated this rocker. So I didn't use it often. I would force him to sit in it while I showered so he could sit somewhere safe and I could keep an eye on him. I had to talk to him nonstop and pick him up immediately after getting out. I would put him in it when I made the bed... or while getting dressed. (The rocker is in our bedroom). He only lasts for a few minutes in there though. I can't read him a story in the chair.. or leave him in it and start doing something that doesn't involve playing with him at all.He likes the If you're happy and you know it clap your hands melody that plays.. but it plays only once. He hates the way the chair vibrates. I turn it on, he cries and wants out.Had I not received it for my shower, I probably would have been fine without it. But since I have it, I use it. It's okay for what I use it for.UPDATEOnce my son started grabbing things on his own, he really enjoyed this chair. That was around 5/6 months? He liked pulling the toy to make the song go on his own.I am still using the same chair for my twin girls. They're currently 2 months and just started to tolerate this chair for a few moments while I'm alternating them for diaper changes. I ended up taking the toys off because it made them cry. My son still loves the toy though and dances around when it plays.Thus, I have upped my stars and say.. give it a try.	
- 1	Looks like a toy. We thought it was much bigger than it actually is. The rubber is not the softest and the ratteler inside could get annoying. Not as bendy as we thought. For the price it was not worth it...but at least i can give it to the dog...cheaper than buying a dog toy.	
- 1	These are really cute bowls. Unfortunately I find them completely ineffective.Pros:Pretty colorsNo sharp plastic edges or seamsCons:Suction cups are ineffective at keeping the bowl in one place - very easy for the baby to get them unstuckThe bottoms of the bowls are not very wide, so once the suction cup has been disengaged the bowl goes overThe covers don't reliably stay on if you want to put them in a diaper bag or even a lunch boxI suspect that if you don't ever put them in the dishwasher (they are listed as top-rack safe) or even wash them with hot water, they might work better... but who has time for that?	
1. 	The teether just arrived for my ten month old who seems to be cutting his second tooth.He's already figured out how to activate the vibration.  It is soft, yet has some ridges and bumps that he is pulling with his teeth and gums.  I think baby gives it 5 stars!!!There were contradictory reviews on whether the batteries were replaceable or not- the packing says they are NOT.  So unless whoever said they were replaceable is just handier than the rest of us, they do not appear to be replaceable.	
- 1	I was on bedrest at the hospital for most of my pregnancy so I bought a lot of my baby gear online without being able to see the items in person.  I wanted to love this stroller but when I finally got home after delivering the baby, I found that this stroller was HUGE!  It was impossible to load this in and out of the trunk while recovering from a c-section.  Not to mention, it barely fit in my trunk.  I have both a hatch-back sedan and and SUV.  It barely fit in the hatchback and took up most of the trunk space in my SUV.  I saw a lot of the same issues that other reviewers complained about.  The wheels wobble when walking at a brisk speed, the storage basket falls of its supports, and there is very little shock absorbance at all when going over gravel or thick grass.  Purchasing this stroller was a big mistake.  Since it was too late to return it, I gave it away (I posted it on Craigslist for weeks for $80 and nobody ever responded) and bought a Britax B-Agile travel system.  Now I'm happy!	
- 1	Super thin! I returned immediately knowing they couldn't be absorbent at all. I wanted them for burp cloths and found them to be not soft at all. I want something much more comfortable against his skin.	
1. 	My son adores these bath toys, their perfect for little hands and he likes to chew on them when he takes baths as well.	
1. 	Grandma was not ready to give up leather seating in her car and wanted something to protect the leather from damage when a booster seat was installed.  The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver seemed to be what I was looking for.  Not only was it somewhat more rigid than other seat protectors, but it came in tan so that it matched my car's interior.  Additionally, since I live in south Texas, the lighter color is more desirable for purposes of keeping the vehicle's interior from getting so hot.  There should be no issue with the seat saver staining the lighter leather black as, based on reviewers' comments, some other brands do.The Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver was easy to install.  The base filled one of the back bucket seats; the seat saver's back needed to have been about 4 longer to completely protect the booster seat back from coming in contact with the vehicle's seat.  Further, it would have been helpful if each side of the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver had tabs that extended over the seat back.  That would have prevented the booster seat straps from digging into the vehicle's seat when the booster seat was correctly installed.  Because of the vehicle's seat depth, the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver's front flap does not bend at the marked area, but still provides a bit of protection to the seat edge.  Having a little one who likes to drum his feet makes me appreciate this feature; I do wish the flap had been a bit longer and had multiple grooves for bending.There was no sliding of the Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat which was installed on this seat saver; the booster seat held firmly in place.  The backing on the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver is a rubber-like mesh, similar to the material used to keep floor rugs from sliding.  Since I have not yet had the seat in place during one of our very hot Texas summers, I do not know whether there will be a sticking problem.  I will probably remove the booster seat during the summer unless our little one is visiting so that I can avoid this potential problem.I would have rated the Prince Lionheart Two Stage Seat Saver a 4.5, if that rating had been available.  With the exception of the suggested changes, I am very pleased with this product.	
- 1	Its material is thin. The attach part neck area isn't smooth. I put couple napkin to cover it so she won't feel if when she lays on it. This product doesn't give good neck support for newborn	
- 1	I really have no idea why I purchased this product.  I think it sounded like a good idea, and my newborn had such gas and GI issues that I was pretty desperate.  But I think a hot water bottle or a warm towel could have done the same thing.	
1. 	My newborn squirmed and cried bloody murder during her sponge baths so you can imagine how nervous I was to immerse her in water for her first real bath. I needn't have worried. The shape of the infant side kept her comfortably cradled and even when she squirmed she stayed in place, allowing me to focus on getting her squeaky clean. (No need for two sets of hands). When she fouled the water, I used the drain to quickly empty the tub and then refill it before continuing with the bath. Since there is a toddler side I will be able to use this tub for quite some time before she transitions to the bathtub. Also the lack of slings or other cloth pieces eliminates concerns about the tub being fully clean and sanitary. My mother saw the tub and scoffed why would anyone buy a tub when they could just wash the baby in the sink. Then she saw how easy and effortless bath time was and she was sold. My newborn actually likes getting a bath now, hence I now enjoy bathing her. It's worth every penny.Things to know:1) The tub is big. It can't easily be tucked away somewhere out of sight.2) The shape of the tub requires maneuvering to get all of the water out while draining since all areas do not have direct access to the drain.	
1. 	We love this thing.  I read the reviews before I bought it and thought it would be tough to &quot;unravel&quot; but it wasn't bad at all.  I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.  We bought a second one for upstairs and we're going to try to connect them together for outdoor occasions.	
1. 	I bought these for my son because I wanted something that would keep his drinks cool and didn't leak. I have not had any problem with them leaking although they will lose some fluid if dropped on the floor, but it doesn't continue to leak. They do a great job at keeping drinks cool, they are easy to wash and if they do start to leak the valve is replaceable. I use this cup every day.	
- 1	These were a disappointment.  It was much too hard for my son to get any liquid from them at all.  it did turn out to take a huge amount of effort, but without the valve, the spill completely.  I will put them away and maybe try them again when he is a bit older.	
1. 	Probably my favorite baby item ever! These bibs are a soft plastic, so it's comfortable for my child to wear but it holds its shape. It doesn't bend or anything so once it's on, it's staying in place. The lip is the perfect width to catch food. There isn't a gap between the table and the bib for food to fall down. Other bibs similar to this I have tried, the lip is more flat or doesn't hold its shape and therefore doesn't catch any fallen food. The collar is very adjustable, so I can fit it perfectly around my child's neck, and there isn't that gap between the bib and the shirt for food to get on the collar of the shirt.  I always have hated how when i put a bib on theres just a tad bit of shirt collar showing and it always got stained. well not with the baby bjorn! It wipes clean or can be put in the dishwasher. And it doesn't stain... You know how some foods like pasta sauce or carrots always seem to stain plastic containers and such? Well I have left spaghetti sauce on this bib overnight and it still did not stain it. The bibs look as clean as the day I took them out of the package. If you have a kid eating solids, you have to buy this bib. It's the only one that actually succeeds at keeping food off if your kid.	
- 1	I bought this to add to some old panels and was glad they are compatible, as one panel did not get fully assembled.  The first customer service person was downright rude, but the second time I called, I was helped by a courteous woman who agreed to send a replacement panel as it was unclear which part(s) were missing.  I have yet to receive the new panel and that part is frustrating.  The product is well constructed and compatible with a set I had purchased for dogs years ago.  The mechanism used to separate is a tad tricky to do initially, but after a few tries we had success.	
- 1	This bowl DOES NOT stick.  My 10 month old is able to pick it up off of any surface without any difficulty.  The little tray that goes into the bowl doesn't click or lock on so it comes out VERY easy and he figured that out within seconds of putting the bowl in front of him.  The silverware is nice.	
1. 	I have to admit that when I turn on the star, my baby smiles and coos at it, but other than that, it's nothing special.  i was a little disappointed that only one of the hanging toys is a rattle... the other two are squeakers (it's not easy to make something spueak when the baby is just batting at it).  It was a gift... otherwise I would never have bought it.  I think you can probably find something just as nice for cheaper.	
- 1	My wife and I have been renting a Medela Symphony pump for a few months. That pump works great, but it's bulky and the cost of renting it from the hospital adds up. We were excited to try this small and attractive-looking pump, and the first online reviews and promo from the manufacturer all seemed promising. However, as soon as my wife tried it we knew that it will absolutely not do. It took a couple of minutes of pumping before the first few drops appeared. At that rate it would take her forever to get the meaningful amount of milk out. This was the most disappointing as we really liked just about every other aspect fo the pump: its compact size, well-crafted and elegant design, soft and gentle suction cup, and the wide-mouthed feeding nipple. It can even be used with four AA batteries, or, if you have a suitable converter, with the car power outlet. I also liked the fact that the suction mechanism and the suction tube would never be in direct contact with milk. Unfortunately, all these features are moot if the pump doesn't provide sufficient amount of suction.	
1. 	Here is an UPDATE.  Purchased 6 months ago/Broke down 01/30/05 Okay! Maybe I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  All was fine, but then this weekend DEAD! The monitor went out. *Don't waste your money.  You are better off purchasing a system that works with your pc monitor.After reading the reviews on this monitor, I thought purchasing it would be a mistake. Don't pay attention to reviews!  It work great! There are many questions in regards to interference with cordless phone and such. I have a Panasonic 2.4 GHz phone system (4 units) in my home, a wireless internet connection, and many other technical items, and have no interference. The monitor sits in my office on my desk next to the cordless phone system, my pc, monitor, speakers, and there are no problems.  The picture is not snowy.  The night vision element works fine.  I have had this product for 5 months and it has not broken down.  It is nice to be able to see baby.  Now I can let her sleep or stay awake without my presence, and know she is fine!	
1. 	This has been the only one of her toys that she has loved pretty much from the get go... by the time she was about 4 weeks she would last about a half hour on it, looking at the lights and listening to the music. She went from accidentally batting the animals to now, at 5 months, playing with them and laughing until she eventually falls asleep all tuckered out :) I am going to buy a second one for her to have at her babysitter's house. Absolutely LOVE this!!	
1. 	1. My toddler does not mind wearing this harness, which was my biggest concern when I purchased it!2. I can take off the leash and leave on the straps when I need to put my child in a stroller.3. I find it useful to hold onto the straps while my baby is learning to walk. This way he will not fall all the way every time he stumbles.4. This harness can adjust to go over multiple layers of clothes.	
1. 	When we first tried to bathe our infant in the &#34;big girl tub,&#34; she was terrified and cried so hard! A friend suggested we try the boon flo water deflector, and ever since she has loved them! It slows the flow of water and even helps it not sound so loud. Our tub only has 1 water control, so in order for it to be warm water it has to be a higher flow. With this handy little device she now loves playing in the water as it falls out. Totally worth the money spent!	
1. 	We bought this because we have a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old kids. We thought it will be useful for both the kids. While the little one had many nice naps in this rocker, the elder one hardly used this as a rocker. I don't think she really enjoyed it much. That does not mean other toddlers won't enjoy it. But you may want to think twice if you want to buy this assuming it will grow with your child.	
- 1	I'm a bit new to the whole cloth diapering thing, but I just had twins so I'm able to really evaluate the test of these in a short period of time.  The designs are ridiculously cute, I really love them.  The diapers themselves are also very soft.  I in particular love the cheetah print one, it's so so cute!  However, the sizing on this is a bit off, even with the rise.  One of my twins is in the 25% range in terms of height and weight, but none of them fit him at all.  He's a bit on the thin side (still normal range) so I can forgive that.  However, my daughter is 70% on weight, and 60% on height, and it still doesn't quite fit her that well.  I end up using these diapers on her, and prefolds with a wrapper on the boy, but I've already had several blow outs from these diapers when she uses them.  I haven't had leaks, but I also don't use these at night, only during the day.  I have noticed around the legs in particular, it seems to be wide, even though my girl has pretty chunky legs, it still can blow out of there.  I prefer the thirsties wraps in comparison, with the prefolds and snappis, because of the double gussets on the legs that prevent blow outs.  With these, even with chunky thighs, the stitching and elastic is not really tight enough to prevent blow outs, even on the tightest settings for the rise.It is an inexpensive first investment into cloth diapering, and I still use them, mostly because they are the only pockets I have, and I already bought the inserts (these do not come with inserts, so I bought the bamboo inserts also by alva baby, which work fine), but I'm a little turned off by the fact that 1) they dont' fit that well 2) I cannot reuse them (unlike the thirsties wrappers) 3) they dont' come with inserts.  I wish they were a bit better made and came with different patterns besides this and I would be a firm supporter.EDITED: just so you know, when I initially wrote this review, the twins were about 3 months, so not quite newborns, and they were still too big.  Now the twins are 9 1/2 months, and after not using them for a while (I had bought fuzzibunz and bumgenius from cotton babies in the meantime since these didn't really seem to fit), I am using these again.  I have found though, that they don't seem to be quite as absorbent for some reason, even with the same liner.  Perhaps the PUL doesn't work as well with these?  The bumgenius and fuzzibunz generally last me about 2 1/2 to 3 hours with the twins (assuming they don't poop), but these will last me probably about 1 1/2 to 2 hours only, which is a lot of diaper changing then.  They still are super cute, so usually what I do is reserve these for the diaper change right before their nap and then I always change their diaper after their nap anyhow, so then they are only in this diaper for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, which works out fine.	
1. 	They are not white like the picture. They are pink with pink fabric.  They are slightly cheap looking but they are still very cute in the nursery and I am glad I got them.  I use one for toys, one for diapers and the other one is on display on the top shelf.	
1. 	I would recommend these for even adults! They are easy to apply and work well. My only issue is I wish there were more of the sticky tape.	
- 1	I thought these would be a good alternative to the hard plastic rings that are usually used for teething, but they didn't turn out as I hoped. When you freeze them they get rock hard and are not a shape that are easy for a baby to get in his mouth. Also, when it's cold the baby can't hold onto it. All in all, would not buy again, but may work for some people.	
- 1	Ended up investing in silver spoons for our girl. Silver is naturally antimicrobial and some of the silver leaches off into the blood helping the immune system. The rubbery plastic spoons worked ok. They were wobbly and hard to use to get the food out of jars. They can't hold much weight and they just seemed very unnatural.	
- 1	The Pipila seemed like a good solution for sterilizing while outside the home.  Unfortunately, it only sterilizes the nipple of the pacifier.  The rest of the pacifier will remain dirty, including the guard just beyond the nipple.  Baby will soon touch the unsterilized part of the pacifier, rendering the limited sterilization much less beneficial.	
- 1	my mother purchased this gate because she didnt want to put holes in the wall, and it is similar to the hardware mounted gate i own and love. the one she bought is a piece of crap, after trying to put it up for 10 minutes, and it still isnt secure.	
1. 	Maybe you're like me, and you went through 2 or 3 fancy Aden & Anais or whatever bibs every day, and piled up a good 20 bibs that were washed every week.And then you heard about Bumkins.  And you bought some, and you realized your whole bib collection was obsolete, because a single 3-pack is all you need.  These don't need to be laundered.  Just rinse in the sink and squeeze them out after each feeding.Or maybe you're not like me and you got it right the first time.Either way - for feeding, this is the bib you need.  The cloth ones might be better for teething drool, but for messy high chair feedings, nothing beats this.	
- 1	This is the second Yookidoo bath toy we've owned that stopped working only a couple of months after we got it.  Changing the batteries didn't help.  These toys are WAY too expensive for the shoddy craftsmanship they provide.  I've tried to e-mail Yookidoo with no response so I guess their customer service is non-existent as well.  The only reason they get two stars is because my daughter did like the toy while it worked.	
1. 	bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months pregnant.  She loves it and uses it every night to help with her back pain and the pressure of her growing belly. Highly recommend.	
1. 	This is a great musical toy.  I think it's very well made and should last a long time.  It's been dropped dozens of times and it keeps on playing like new :o)	
1. 	I've always used Gerbers and to be honest, I never know what I'm going to get when I open the package, but I do know that I'm disappointed in the absorbency of Gerbers and started looking for something better. I've had the Kushies for a couple of weeks now and I'm pleased with them. They don't appear to be thicker than Gerber, but they do feel denser. They are also larger. So if you fold them down, it's like having a double diaper without the bulk. The Kushies are also softer than Gerber. The cost is more than Gerbers, but I only need to use one of Kushies to two of Gerbers. Less laundry with Kushies as I'm only using one. I will buy more of the Kushies.	
1. 	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.	
- 1	Very disappointed with this product. I am unable to use it because there is not much space to push the buttons in on the sides and turn to open the door. when I turn the handle, the bottom of the lock rubs the door frame & makes it near impossible to turn to open the door.	
1. 	Very soft material, however I do not think it should be described as &#34;sage&#34; in color. It's more of a light lime green. I'm happy with the product and it still works with the theme of the nursery, however it was not what I was expecting.	
- 1	I was so disappointed to find out the hard way that this mattress contains polyurethane foam. I purchased it because it was marketed as safe.  The product description states:Quote made from a natural coconut palm fiber and latex-free foam to create a completely organic inner foundationThis is not true.  If the manufacturer had  disclosed that the foam contained polyurethane - a very unnatural substance and toxin known to damage immune systems -I never would have bought it.  I won't buy MDB products anymore.	
1. 	After my first ride in the car with my son, I found him with his head in a very weird position due to lack of head control.  The poor thing looked so uncomfortable and I swear I thought the jiggling had snapped his little neck!  So I ran out and bought these head supporters.  I have to say, they were helpful.  I put the larger one in the swing and left the smaller one in the car seat.  They did seem to help control the head bobbing until he was old enough to hold up his own head.The cons:1.  the headrest does not really snap in to the seat anywhere, so basically you're just placing it in the seat (similar to what you'd do with a rolled up towel).2.  when we took our car seat to the police station to have it inspected, they didn't like the head rest placed in the car seat because it didn't fit securely (i.e. wasn't secured to the fabric) and because the seat had not been crash tested with the headrest in place.  The alternatives they recommended were either to contact the manuafacterer and buy a head rest that HAD been crash tested in our particular seat model, or to just use rolled up towels.  (I'm not sure what difference a towel would make in a crash, but I'm just repeating what they said)In the end, we disregarded what the police had recomended and just used the headrest until our son no longer needed them (which really wasn't all that long).  The product worked fine and luckily we didn't need to test out the whole crash test theory.Having said that, would I buy this again?  Probably not.  Like I said, the product worked well and I gave it 4 stars because we really didn't have any problems with it, but all things considered, why not just roll up a couple of towels?	
- 1	I haven't tried any other breast pumps, but from what I read on the internet, there are better alternatives. I cups, I guess you can call them horns do not come in bigger sizes like medela for different nipple sizes. I took out the plastic inserts for it to be relatively more comfortable. I got a lot of painful, plugged ducts from using this.	
1. 	I switched these from the basinette, to the infant carrier to the stroller all the time.Really cute how my son would focus on them.	
1. 	We registered for the Ocean Swing and the Link a doo swing. We received both for shower gifts. The boys immediately loved the mobile.  We now have a baby girl and we have passed it on to her.  It has held up through a set of triplets and is still going strong for our new baby.Whenever one of my boys were cranky or refused to go to sleep I would place them in the swing. Within 15 minutes, sound asleep. No baby can resist the side to side rocking action. This swing saved me many times when I was reaching the breaking point. This swing gives you those If I only had 20 minutes. I could actually get 45 minutes worth of stuff done.This swing gives you the option of swinging like a cradle or a regular swing. Since we had the other swing we left this one in cradle position.We have triplet boys and one of our boys would only nap in this swing. He refused to sleep anywhere else. He would cry and fuss till he was placed in this swing. We started weaning him off the swing when the weight limit started to draw near. It was a tough challenge but we did it.Not only was the weight limit an issue but as the boys got older, they would drop items over the side and lean over to try to pick them up. This is when we knew it was time to say good bye to our lifesaver.They seem to enjoy the mobile and light show. When they reached about 9 months they would grab for the items above. One of my sons was fascinated with the star and would follow it around and around and would cry when it went behind his head.The tray was a nice size and had a wavy bar with a few beads on it. We would clip link a doo toys on to the bar for more amusement.The swing takes D batteries. Go to BJ's and buy a case. We were going through 4 batteries a week. It may be because this poor little swing only rested at night. Since we had three infants the swing was working all the time. I wish there was an option to plug it in.As the batteries becomes weaker the light show goes first, then the mobile and then the swinging. There is no warning that the batteries are going but you can pick up on if the mobile is not working.The controls are on the top. You can choose various speeds for the swing. You can also choose, Mobile only, Light show only or mobile and lights. Then you can add music too. There is a couple of different sounds and music to choose from.There is a piece of material that holds the legs together and has pockets in the back. The pockets are great for putting burp cloths in. They are not that big for putting toys. They may fit some bottles.The legs do need to be spread apart and placed on a flat surface to get the full cradle swing. It does take up some floor space but can be pulled together and flatten when not in use.For the money this swing is worth it. I would highly recommend any of Fischer Prices dual Swings and Cradles.	
1. 	these bibs are a little big & bulky & a little pricey, but they work great at catching almost all meeses and clean up great.	
1. 	I have several baby carriers and I prefer my Mobi wrap and my Infantino Flip because I feel they are more secure, but this one is great for the hip carry.  My daughter jerks back a lot though, so I still always have one hand on her at all times.  I like it to carry her around when she's cranky and I don't need both hands to do something.  It's great for going for a walk, but not when you need both hands for something else like pushing a stroller or carrying groceries.  If your baby doesn't jerk back, then it's great!	
- 1	I loved these towels when I got them. I bought the bear and the cat. There are fuzzies everywhere!  I really do not think that these towels are worth the price.  They are really cute though.	
1. 	I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them. They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly. You HAVE to remember that. When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken. My husband and others in the family have had this problem. It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.I like the plastic they use. It has always felt extremely sturdy. They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean....and you are pretty sure they are clean!!I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!! I really like dthat you get the brush, pacifier and two sizes of bottle in the newborn set. Made my life easy.All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it. I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.	
1. 	We read the reviews and happend to find this along with the two exstentions at our local open box/overstock store unopend we paid about $25.00 for both! I bought a tadpole play mat for the bottom agian at a overstock store and he loves to roll around and play in it. these are sturdy and well worth the full price. only downside is it does not have a door. but the play yards with doors are not as sturdy so it's give and take. The best part is i know he can't get into anything so i can clean, and do the things i need to while he plays and explores saftly!	
- 1	As soon as I got it and used it, the handle broke off. Not worth the money, even though it is really cheap.	
- 1	I ordered and currently use the original version of the Adiri Nurser bottle, as that was the only bottle at the time my exclusively breastfed baby would take. Thank goodness he has grown past that phase and now will take the Born Free bottles I had purchased and received as baby shower gifts. This NexGen bottle is too much trouble. All the different pieces and steps to fill and heat it are so cumbersome and time consuming. As a busy working mom, I do not have time for all of that. They really need to rethink the design on this thing. It's also hard to read the amounts. I thought I would love it, as I like the look and feel of it but boy am I glad I didn't have to actually use it too long.	
1. 	I've owned this for about a year now and here's what I like:  LOVE the projection on the ceiling, music volume levels, music choices.  My son continues to love it and use it to calm down to fall asleep.  The only thing I would change is I wish it had a remote to start it over again.  Also, we ended up buying a battery charger because it does use the batteries pretty quick.  But I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.	
- 1	I have been using this crib for my daughter for about 5 months now. She is 10 months old but used the Monte bassinet for the first 5 months in my bedroom. After about two months of using this crib the paint started chipping off! I don't understand how a crib that has barely been used is already chipping. Invest in the Oeuf.	
- 1	I hate stuffing these. Seriously, save your money for better quality, made is USA diapers. And I'm now ashamed I own alva diapers. The one print is copied from bumgenius, Lovelace pattern. Companies like this should not be supported and be put out of business.	
- 1	My 15 month old daughter was able to pull this thing apart with little effort. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	I have owned several umbrella strollers and this is by far the nicest one yet.My favorite things about this stroller are:1. First off the quality of the material is top notch unlike other cheaper umbrella strollers I've owned before.2. The product functions very smoothly. The wheels and the shade are very smooth and easy to operate.3. The color is right on. It's the perfect shade of orange to me, I love it. Orange is my favorite color. :)4. It's the perfect size and height for me. I never step or trip on the wheels like I have on others and I am 5'4.5. The seat is wide and my daughter fits very comfortable along with the small reclining ability. It's not much but it's enough so when they fall asleep their head wont fall forward.6. The carrying bag.  I won't use it but it's there. Plus it comes in a nice plastic small bag that I will use for storing diapers in.7. Let's see what else... it came almost completely assembled. :) I only had to put the shade on and took a couple of minutes.My not so favorite things:1. The harness is more on the hard side to click in. I pinched one of my fingers and it hurt bad. Maybe it will loosen up as I use it but it's OK.  A different style that was easier to click in wouldn't been better.2. The only other thumbs down was the basket. I wouldn't even call it that but it's there.  I'm thinking maybe only some diapers would fit in there. Not a biggie as I already ordered a stroller storage and comes with enough compartments to keep me happy.These two reasons are not enough to keep me from not loving my new stroller. My daughter is finally getting out of the huge travel system stroller stage that takes up almost all of my trunk space so I'm so ready to have my space back. This is definitely the best and prettiest umbrella stroller I've had after three daughters so I'm going to enjoy it.	
- 1	I was excited about this changing table, with the perfect color and adorable shape - until we opened the box. The material is VERY flimsy. The sides and back are a thin composite bendable board, which was a disappointment, but not altogether a deal breaker. What is a deal breaker is that the very thin bendable composite material also makes up the top of the item - where you change your baby! I am really hesitant to place my baby on any surface that I can bend easily. Also, the wood grain on the composite material doesn't match the pieces that are actual wood - they look like they are from an entirely different piece.As if that weren't bad enough, the assembly is ridiculous. My husband is great at putting things together (lots of IKEA furniture in his past!) and he put the crib together in under an hour. This changing table was so frustrating that it took him forever and he had to leave it and come back to it out of frustration.We are trying to decide if dealing with getting this thing back in the box and paying for shipping is worth it to return it. Bottom line is that there are a lot of changing tables out there so you should do yourself a favor and keep looking  - at least for one without a  flimsy particle board changing area.	
- 1	These are impossible to clean.  I gave them to my baby with banana and after soaking it for days and multiple wash attempts, there is still food in it.  Its a great product in theory, but the mesh just doesn't work.  We ended up throwing the one away and just using the other one for ice chips for sore gums.	
- 1	The product serves it's purpose, but it's far too large. Since it extends out past each side, if a drawer is opened without moving the guard (ex, open a drawer to the left or right) the oven door comes flying open and the guard crashes off loudly. I guess it's not meant for leaving on full-time? It hit my baby last night (luckily not too hard) but gave us a big scare. It should come coupled with an oven latch and/or in unique sizes.The plastic pieces affixed to the oven door has turned dark in color and it concerns me that toxic chemicals from the plastic are leaking into the air when it gets hot.The plastic edges are sharp, and my husband cut his finger on it fairly badly.I feel better that my daughter can't reach up to grab a pan, but all the other problems are dangerous in themselves. I'm not very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I purchased this for use while my grand daughter was visiting.  The bed rail was easy to assemble and fairly easy to install, I was putting it on a double bed so I needed help moving the mattress.  As an adult I found it uncomfortable to sleep with because the feet are a higher profile so that the rail itself can slide into them and 'hide away'.  I did not have a comfy nights sleep with it installed.  However, this would be fine on a child's bed but should I ever need to purchase another bed rail, I would not select a 'hide away'.	
1. 	These are fantastic for freezing/storing/reheating breast milk.  Unlike some of the reviews I read, I have experienced no leaking thusfar.  I use a Medela pump and transfer my milk into these containers because they have proven to be so wonderful (and they are acrylic, so reheating is much easier).  My only complaint is that they are slightly too small.  I usually pump more than 4 but less than 8 oz. and so I am forced to either use two containers or sacrifice my milk (which is too precious!).  However, I can deal with the smaller size because overall it is such a great product!	
1. 	I have a newly remobled bathroom and we went with the big fat faucet spout this sharp looking modern designed cover doesn't even go all the way over it. But if you have an average size faucet it would be great!	
- 1	Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating.	
1. 	Love that I decided not to spend $80-100 on a highchair. It would have just been in the way anyway. This chair is perfect for my little one and she will get years more use out of it!It is true, like others have said that the white tray is very easy for your toddler to learn how to remove. Now my baby tries to remove it and dump her food all the time. I wish it clicked in better or had a latch of some sort. Also wish all parts were dishwasher safe.	
- 1	Well, to be honest, I had a love-hate relationship with this glider. I loved how comfy and suggly it was. But I hated how my head could not rest on the back (I'm 5'4) when seated with a semi good posture, and only could when I was scrunched kinda low or snuggly with my legs bent in the seat.But the reason I disliked it the most was because of the horrible creaks and clicks the gliding mechanism would make when I tried to rock/glide. I even found a metal piece that had fallen off the mechanism. And to make it worse, the noises inhibited the process of trying to get my baby to fall asleep...I honestly was trying to forget the negative aspects, but the thought of nursing my second child in this chair made me contact Amazon for a refund. I'm very thankful that they have such a good return policy!!!	
1. 	Ok gate, my son figure it out how to open it at 18 mo old, so went to plan B and did tie a scarf on the lower part of the door to keep it shut! Overall sturdy but you can find better considering Customer Service does not exist in USA, Canada only without toll free number, not good!!!!	
1. 	This is a nice tub!! I am very clumsy and very uncomfortable washing my baby in the kitchen sink so I bought this tub that I can sit on the carpet to rub-a-dub-dub my baby. Very Pleased and I look forward to using this.	
- 1	This thing is impossible to use. You can hardly squeeze it at all. Trying to use it on a squirming baby is pointless as it provides little to no suction. A total waste of money.	
- 1	I thought my daughter would love this and it would be great for night time. I don't think she has used it once, she want's nothing to do with it. It would be better if you could change the pacifier out on it.	
- 1	To short for the baby to play with, and difficult to get to make noise. Not a good buy for us.	
- 1	Like another reviewer, I felt elated when I saw this high chair, thinking it was going to surpass all others with its EZ Clean styling. Then I got the chair and put my 8-month old (50th percentile for weight/height) in it. I couldn't believe how little room there was on the bottom of the seat! The divider that comes up through the crotch is huge and only provides a mere 3 1/4 of depth from the back of the seat to the opening provided for the strap.  Even if you extend the crotch strap farther, looping it through the opening at the front/back (depending on your perspective) of the divider as opposed to the cut-out, you only get 4 1/2 of depth.Compare these measurements to the Graco Contempo high chair (which just happens to be the chair I am trying to replace because of the difficulty of cleaning the straps) where you get 4 1/2 of depth with the cut-out for the strap and an additional 2, making 6 1/2 total, if you loop the crotch strap through the opening at the divider.I don't know what Fisher Price was thinking when it designed the seat for this chair, but once again, I am extremely annoyed with the company's lack of foresight. Yet another great concept; poor execution. I felt the same kind of frustration with their space-saving high chair that is replete with impossible to clean crevices.Perhaps FP believes that all parents make buying decisions based solely on price, so it purposely doesn't spend a few extra bucks to get a product right in order to keep the price of the product relatively low. I'm sure there are many parents out there like me who would gladly pay another $10 for this high chair if it meant we got the perfect high chair or at least something close. You could have had a real winner here, Fisher Price, but once again, you blew it. I'm returning my chair to Amazon.	
- 1	This unit was pretty good until the toggle power switch broke. It is fairly intuitive to use, picture was decent (a lot of people have complained about the video, but I thought it was good enough), but the battery life, even when new, wasn't remotely what is advertised. When I purchased it, it promised eight hours on battery but was beeping at us after four.A little more than a year after we bought it, the toggle power switch broke. Motorola offers no support after one year. For a monitor this expensive to break at a year of normal use is ridiculous, and that Motorola clearly doesn't stand behind its products (don't get me started on the Razr...) is pathetic.At this point, we can still use it, as at least it was already on when it broke, but it has to stay plugged in, because when the battery dies and it powers off, we won't be able to turn it on again.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.	
1. 	This chair is so great, as I said, we got rid of the regular high chair we got. We have yet to go out to dinner somewhere is doesn't work, and haven't had any issues at BBQ's and other peoples houses. We tried another brand before this one and it just wasn't as sturdy and didn't break down for travel easy. We hve one at home and now keep one at grandma's house too!	
- 1	This did not work for me at all.  I wanted something to carry my son around the house in when he was just a few months old (under 12 pounds).  He was not comfortable in it, and it did not feel good when I was wearing it.  I would not buy this again.	
1. 	I was happy to try these Playtex VentAire Natural Shape bottle's for my daughter. Although she is older now (not a newborn) I have been quite tired and upset with Dr. Brown's bottles that we were using since her birth. They have discolored greatly, yucky stuff was caked on inside the inner tubing, very hard to clean out, but most of all they constantly leaked after a month or two of owning. I replaced them twice and each time they have leaked from the screw cap area. If you make them to tight they leak, to loose they leak, very fine line.... soo when I had the opportunity to try these out and had something to compare them to I was quite happy to do so.Right off the bat I liked the design of them, and the way the top was angled. The nipples are natural shaped and my daughter went from the old bottles to these without any hesitation or trouble to the nipple. In fact she likes them better and seeks them out when wanting her bottle. The state 2 nipples are fast flow and for her were perfect. I like how the bottle and the top come off so you can clean the entire bottle with easy, rather then a fight. Most importanly though they did not leak at all. The last thing you want is to travel and have your bottle leak, or spill coming out of the cap areas. Of course flip a bottle upside down most will leak from the nipple. But none should leak from the screw cap area, and I was happy these did not leak. We have used them well over a month now, going on two and love them!feeds your baby with virtually no bubbles and less gas and spit ups.

This is the only nipple my new baby likes. She didn't like the nipples that her older twin brother/sister used. Making the transition from breast to bottle was fairly simple, as long as I heat the bottle of milk up first! lol2. Bottle is easier to clean. Sure it comes in pieces, but I like the fact that because the bottom comes apart, I can really get the bottles clean. The bottom of the conventional bottles would never get quite that clean, even when I use those bottle brushes. The brushes don't get into the crevices on the bottom so there's that thin layer of dried milk or something that's always there.3. Ergonomically correct in shape. Easy for me to hold, and for the baby to hold as well. Since the bottle curves upwards, the weight of the bottle is dispursed centrally so the baby has an easier time holding it.4. It seems like I don't have to burp her so often, and she doesn't spit up.5. Doesn't leak if you have it screwed on correctly.	
- 1	Love the colors and design.  Easy for my baby to use but it leaks so badly that I threw them out.  Save yourself the hassle of buying this bottle  and just pour the liquid directly on the baby, carseat, or floor.	
1. 	I hated switching from a standard bottle to the avent bottle and now I can just pop an avent bottle on my original pump. I am going to clear out all of my normal bottles and only have the avent bottles in the house. This is going to clear up so much space.	
1. 	I absolutely love the bumkins brand bibs and have found them to be a must have for my kids.  They are nice and light but waterproof and wash up in no time! The pockets are great to catch anything the kids may drop, I hang them on the bottle rack by the pocket to dry so that it stays open better when they are wearing it and that seems to work great!I will say that the neck opening is fairly large and some babies are able to easily pull the bib off.  My niece is 7 months and is a pro at ripping it off but my 2 (1 and 2yrs) have never messed with it.They hold up great some of mine are almost 2 yrs old and look as good as my new Dr. Suess ones! I will continue to purchase these bibs as long as I (or friends/family) have kiddos who need them!	
- 1	poor rating because my baby sucked half air half milki liked it because i thought it was going to come in handyi would probably not recommend it	
- 1	My son is 6 months old and can barely reach the floor.  He is normal height and weight, but has a longer upper body (like me!)  I bought this thinking that since you can adjust the height, it would work.  The lowest setting is still slightly too high.  Not impressed.  Kinda boring.  Maybe we can start using it in a few weeks, but for now, I wish I had bought something else.	
1. 	We bought this potty to train our daughter off diapers. At first she seemed like she was avoiding it. Then one day (just about 2 years old) she started asking to go to the potty by herself. It is easy to clean. It is stable. It is easy to move around the house and most importantly she likes it.	
- 1	First, the Soothie pacifier which is attached to the monkey is not as well designed as the Gumdrop pacifier.  The Soothie has a circular disc which smooshes my baby's nose as he sucks on the pacifier, whereas the Gumdrop is designed around the nose.Second, the Soothie is at an awkward angle because one end is sewn to the monkey.  This would be only good to enable the baby to push the pacifier out if he didn't want it anymore.  But my newborn doesn't have the ability to keep the pacifier in his mouth, which is the whole reason why I bought this product.  I found it actually works better to place the puppy UPSIDE DOWN then insert the pacifier into my baby's mouth.Third, the monkey is very light.  I wish it were weighted down with a bean bag of some sort.  My son is big and strong (15 lbs at 2 months) and twists and wriggles in his crib so the monkey doesn't stay on his chest.  We no longer swaddle him.  The only time the Wubbanub works is if he's wearing a zippered sleep sac or hoodie so we tuck the monkey into his hoodie/ sleep sac so it actually stays in place.	
1. 	This was a lifesaver especially during the first couple of months.  Being a new mom (and dad) we were exhausted and I can't imagine trying to remember when the baby was last fed, changed, etc. without something like this by our sides 24 hours a day.  It is a good size and plenty of room to write everything down that you need.  It is laid out very well and easy to read/understand when handing off care from parent to parent (or whoever).  Once this ran out I bought another type of journal and am wishing I had just bought this one again.	
- 1	I tested out three different kinds of cloth wipes, since I decided that using disposable wipes was silly if I was already cloth diapering. Initially I loved these ones FAR more than the other two (Grovia and the other kind of Charlie Banana wipes, the thinner version). Straight out of the box they were SO soft, so thick, and so luxurious, I just couldn't imagine using anything else for my wee one! I ended up using them quite a bit more than I expected so I bought another box of 10 to have a good stash.Well, my baby is 9 months old and it has been several months since I've used these for wipes. After just a few washes, the soft microfibre side had pilled up horribly and actually became MORE scratchy than the other two kind I initially hated. I was so disappointed because these were not cheap. I was hoping they would last for *all* my babies, and they haven't even lasted for one.What's more, upon washing and drying even once, these became misshapen and annoying to fold. It appears that the smooth side has shrunk while the fuzzy side has stayed the same, thus distorting each wipe and really just making an ugly pile. People spending the money on these fancy cute wipes are clearly the kind of people who care what they look like folded in a stack, so this was very irritating to me. If I'm going to spend that much on double-sided baby wipes I expect them to be pre-shrunk.Also, the blue contrasting tags are cute in theory, but WAY too big and in the way. I cut them off and was left with an ugly scrap piece on the edge of each wipe. Too bad they couldn't have been cute tiny tags.I give it two stars because I still think the embroidered logo is adorable and if they could get their material problems sorted out these would be amazing. Too bad I will never trust the company again so I'll never find out.(FYI, the brand I now prefer is the GroVia, which has actually gotten softer with washing, and still has a good texture for getting those solids wiped clean. The other style of Charlie Banana wipes, the one-ply style, are completely worthless. Too thin and floppy to wipe up anything. I gave them to Goodwill months ago.)	
- 1	It's very uncomfortable and not big enough to cover the baby.  I wish it was a little wider than it is	
- 1	This potty looks wonderful and it worked wonders in getting my little girl to sit on it, she loves the pink color. Unfortunately, it leaks all over and there is always a huge potty mess on the floor to clean up every time she goes in it. Several things cause this. The back of the potty is shaped so that my little one can lean slightly back when she goes, and the front, even with the splash guard up, does not do much to prevent the pee pee from  splashing out. The bowl part also leaks all around the edge where it meets the color part of the potty. granted, this could all be from the way my girl sits on the potty, but she is learning for crying out loud! a good potty should be able to contain pee no matter how a little one sits on it. It is hard enough teaching her to sit and go. I would like a potty that does not require extra work.Grandma purchased the Fisher Price Precious Planet Potty ( also known as the froggy potty) and it does it all! looks cute and no pee pee mess at all. Do yourself a huge favor and get a potty chair that does not leak.	
1. 	I recently purchased this for my 2 year old son. So far we love it. I didn't want to get one with characters all over it as it would probably distract my son from using it correctly. He's still in the training process but he's headed in the right direction. It's the perfect height and easiness for him to use. I also like how it can be used as a step stool and you can put the seat on a regular toilet. Perfect!	
1. 	The packaging on one of the items seemed to be old and worn out a bit compared to the other two that I received. But the product was not defective so it still works fine.	
1. 	My little man has just gotten his first teeth, so of course we needed a baby tooth brush!  This item is awesome.	
- 1	Very flimsy, they come apart easily after only one use. Would not buy again and would not recommend. They do work, just not well, and as I said, they fall apart.	
- 1	I'm sure this is a great baby monitor but it wouldn't turn on for us at all because our router interfered with it. Out of Signal Coverage is all we saw so we have to sell it since we are outside of the return range. Before you buy, confirm your router is not performing at the same ghz level. Customer service called  us back within 24 hours and was very helpful in letting us know the problem though.	
- 1	I like the safety of these outlet covers, but the casing is too thick so plugs will not work unless it is perfectly flush with your walls.  We live in a 20 year old home and these outlet covers work on 1/3 rd of our outlets.	
1. 	I PURCHASED THIS WARMER AND THE FIRST YEARS NIGHT AND DAY BOTTLE WARMER FOR MY BEDROOM. SO FAR THEY WORK REALLY GREAT AT HEATING THE BOTTLES TO THE RIGHT TEMPERATURE. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE NUMBERS RUBBED OFF THE WATER VILES AND WE HAD TO PUT THEM ON WITH A PERMANENT MARKER.	
1. 	My 1 month old baby wants to be hold all the time, but the thing is I cannot do anything when holding her.  That's why I decided to buy a baby carrier.This carrier is a bit expensive, but I think it worth it (actually I was thinking of buying Baby Carrier Synergy but that one is really expensive!).  You can put your baby in and out of the carrier without waking him/her up.  Now I can carry my baby around while doing other stuff.The only thing I don't like is the position of the head support knots on the straps.  Usually I would wear the straps, and hold the baby on my chest, calm her a little bit first before putting her into the carrier.  But the knots are on the way and can press on baby's face/eyes if I'm not careful.  The Baby Carrier Synergy (or Active) has those knots in higher position and probably won't have the same problem.  But I'll still give this carrier 5 stars.	
- 1	They don't really fit to your breast, so when I wear them under a thin tank top or bra you can see the edges.	
- 1	I put this gym on my baby shower registry and regret doing so. It might be a good gym till a baby is 3.5-4 month old but once the baby starts mouthing objects, its just a waste of money.Pros:Soft playmat.Musical bird is fun.Cheaper than other gyms.Bright Starts customer service is good.Cons:Playmat ripped off in one wash.Poor soundbox in bird. I had to replace it twice in 3 months. First time it went bad within 15 days of use. I called customer service and they sent a replacement within 3 days,free of cost. Second time, they were out of it and said to wait for 4 months. When I asked for alternative as my baby will outgrow the gym in 4 months, they sent me another similar toy.Pastel colors do not attract baby's attention.The bird is the only useful toy. My baby is 5 months now. She has never shown interest in bead rattle. She tried the lion teether but never enjoys it. The toy with textured beads always frustates her. She puts it in her mouth but it is too wide, she always ends up crying in frustation. The water filled teether was missing from my gym.Mirror is poor quality. You can barely see your face in it.Overall a bad product. My baby enjoyed it for a while when she learned to bat at objects. But as soon as she could hold and mouth objects, she ends up crying within 5 min in the gym. Buy it if you want to hang your own toys and don't mind calling again and again for replacement.	
1. 	Yes, the shampoo seems pricey.  But you only need a couple of pea-sized drops to get a rich lather.  Plus, you don't need to worry if some accidentally gets in your toddlers eyes.  An added bonus is that it smells lovely -- no obnoxious sugary/fruity scent that is common for kids shampoo.	
1. 	My son absolutely loved using the feeder. But its a pain cleaning it after putting bananas or something mushy in it. The handle also doubles as a teether. Worth buying!	
- 1	This stroller bag gets the job done for a couple of flights, but ultimately, you get what you pay for.  We had a few round-trip flights with our baby as we were moving across country. I got this umbrella stroller bag for our Chicco Liteway Plus stroller, just so that it would have a little protection from being thrown around onto the plane.  We gate checked the stroller every time, and although it was usually just going from the end of the boarding ramp to the plane, it still got pretty banged up.  I think the bag afforded it some protection - I can only imagine what it would have looked like without it. But after three flights, it had seen the last of its life.  There was a giant hole in the bottom that had started after just one flight. By the end of the third flight, it wasn't salvageable.The bag fit our slightly larger than a normal umbrella stroller really well, and it was easy to quickly slide the stroller into it before boarding the plane.I did spend a little extra money on the car seat bag - buying the more expensive JL Childress padded version, and that one has held up - so I'll see if I can find a comparable stroller bag in that quality.I am not super disappointed in the bag - again - as it did provide some protection to my stroller and it really only cost about $15 - but if I can pay a little extra for a bag that will hold up longer, I will.	
- 1	The stuffed animal is super cute but it's not as practical as I had hoped. It has several noises and I thought one of them would be similar to white noise which is what I use at night to help my baby sleep. Not crazy about the sounds.	
- 1	My son can't keep this paci in his mouth.  He sucks on it if I hold it in his mouth, but he can't get enough suction to keep it there himself.  I bought it for him when he was about 3 months old, but I think he may have already been ready for a bigger size.  He loves his Nuk orthodontic paci, so we might just stick with those.	
- 1	This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers. Not true, I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit	
- 1	My 9-month daughter loved a friend's teether that looked similar to this. I bought it in a store, but it turns out that she can't get the teether nubs to her back teeth. The ball is too hard. We were at a BBQ and everyone was laughing at how disinterested she was in this toy. I should have waited and looked on Amazon for the same one. Now I'm buying the second teether. This was a waste.	
- 1	The guard is held together with plastic screws that can easily be loosened by my 15 month old twins, but this isn't the biggest problem.The plastic guard blocks the vents of the oven. So if I am baking something hot condensation forms against the plastic and drips.My oven door stays cool even when the oven is on, so it is normally safe for the kids to be in the kitchen. The condensation problem this guard creates, makes it unsafe for my kids or even me to be around it.	
1. 	We bought this to replace the flimsy old pad that came with our used changing table. We were sure to measure it before ordering, since changing pads come in various sizes. This fits the table perfectly, and I love that this is the nicest one we found here on amazon. Many of the others looked flimsy & not as durable as this one. They all seemed to be very thin in the middle, unlike this one. I also love that this particular pad doesn't dip way down in the middle like all of the others, it's just a nice gradual indentation. I also like that it has the belt to ensure that baby won't fall. The only thing I didn't like about this was the stinky smell of chemicals that the bag it came in had. The pad itself smelled a tiny bit like that, but once I had it out of the bag and allowed it to air out for a few days, that was no longer an issue. I would suggest doing that either before baby arrives, or allowing it to air out for a few days before using it at the very least, so that baby doesn't come into contact with the chemical smell. Overall a very great changing pad, and the nicest one we could find here on amazon.	
1. 	I LOVE THIS!Why? Because my prego wife loves it.I first got her the famous boppy, but it wasnt that great. It was too thin and when she wanted to move to her other side it required her to pull up the pillow and reset it. So we bought this one. I was worried it would be too short (the ad has what looks like a short lady) but that was not the case.It was MUCH thicker and it made my wife much more comfortable, especially when she needed to flip over.The only drawback was it didnt come with a soft slip cover. I guess you have to buy that separately. We decided to skip it for now.You cant go wrong with this.Frank	
1. 	We had been using Dr. Brown bottles exclusively, but our little one was getting gas and seemed fussy after meals.  We bought one of the Ventaire bottles- just to try- but ended up with a fast flow nipple- much too fast for our three week old.  So, the bottle sat unused on the bottle rack for a week or so until I found slow flow nipples at a local store.  I brought them home and we tried the bottle out again- what a difference!!!  First of all, it is so much more comfortable to hold compared to the Dr. Brown!  Secondly, there are much fewer parts to assemble- and wash.  Thirdly, and most importantly, our little one is much less fussy and gassy after meals.  I went out today and bought 3 more of the 6 ounce bottles- they were the only size that came with the slow flow nipples.  We are going to keep the Dr. Brown bottles, but the Playtex Ventaires are our new go to bottles!	
- 1	This product would be genius if it actually worked properly!! I installed the thing perfectly, following the directions to the letter.  My issue is that whenever I depress the pedal to open the lid and insert the diaper, the next time the pedal does NOT work.  I have to actually open the whole darn can and re-shut it to re-engage the pedal, several times, to get it to work again.  You can't just pry open the lid b/c the clamping mechanism will not work. If this unit worked perfectly it would be the best diaper invention ever. I think Diaper Genie was just too inventive with this one without it working properly all the time. Its a real hassle to use because of my above listed issues with the product.  Its beyond frustrating.  Buy at your own risk. Your's might work or it might not.	
- 1	Can't beat the price and the washcloths are pretty soft. However,they are extremely thin and I have to put it in my washing basket after wiping the baby a couple of times (they are soaked). So buy at your wish, but be aware of this. :)	
1. 	Well we bought one of these about 8 months ago and LOVED IT!  We decided to take it over to the grand parents and there it stayed!  lol  We've bought another one for our home because we liked it so much.  We don't even use the strap to hold him in unless the front tray is removed.  Our son is pretty laid back though and not much of a squirmer. lolOne word of warning...  The off white removable tray WILL stain with red sauces like spaghetti sauce, so I recommend removing it and using the brown main tray if that's an issue for you.  It will stain the brown as well, but it's not as noticeable.  Both will become more and more faint over time if you don't reintroduce more red sauces.  Honestly, it's not an issue to worry about IMO.Well made, safe and looks good!	
1. 	Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It's basically like a really high deadbolt.	
1. 	Buy this Pack N Play!!  All pros and no cons on this.  It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags. Only three parts, just the frame, the folding padded floor, and the carrying bag.  It is roomy, has plenty of padding, and has 9 legs for a strong and even base.  It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these for twin grandchildren. These were very easy to put together. I am a 65 year young grandmother, and put both of them together in one evening. The instructions were a little technical, but with the pictures I found them to be excellent, even though I didn't know all the terms, I was easily able to figure them out. All you need is a screw driver, and a little muscle. They seem very well made, nice wood. They seem sturdy. They are very cute!	
1. 	This is nice accessory, I'm happy that I ordered it. It makes the seat more comfortable, and also protects the seat, it's easy to wash. The material could be better quality, it feels a bit cheap... And for the steep price, I would have expected better. Still, it's the only one designed for this seat and it fits perfectly, for me it's an essential with my BOB. Bottom line, I would recommend it.	
1. 	I bought this because my daughter liked to explore, but our house isn't very big. I was able to set it up like the picture while she was still crawling, then straightened it out and blocked off certain areas of our living room when she started walking.  It worked phenomenally.  It's put away for now, but can see it being very handy for future kiddos.	
1. 	I am on baby boy #2 and I wish I had these from day one with #1. No more balled up babies clinching anything due to tummie pain. Worth the money!!! Avent, Evenflo, Gerber, Playtex all have nothing going for them... Go ahead pay for something that actually does what it claims and throw the gas drops out the door!!! You will be amazed at the change in your little one... The word colic wouldn't exist if everyone used these!We are a one income family &amp; money is tight but this makes for a happier mommie and daddy when baby is not in pain and sleeps better! Just buy three like we did and clean and rotate them out. We keep a bowl by the sink and clean all the parts.. Bought a Avent microwave sterilizer off of ebay we sterilize the parts. It's so worth the extra time... Think about your worse gas pains... your poor baby is suffering cause you can't save a buck here and there and get the good bottles...ask grandma...:-)	
1. 	The three level settings made this tub last for a whole first year for our baby. I have a small tub and it fits well in that. The sling was little difficult to attach but once we attached it, it never slipped. My new born was very comfortable in the sling. we graduated to the actual tub when she was 2 months old. over all its a good product.	
- 1	I liked these and still use them sometimes, but they do not absorb as much as the disposable kind, especially at night time when you tend to get engorged. I would leak right through them, my sleep bra, and my night gown. Not fun to wake up covered in breast milk. :/	
1. 	My now 8-week old loves to look at the star's flashing lights and she kicks her legs, smiling and and cooing like crazy while she watches it.  The downside is that there are only three melodies that the star plays (but they're definitely tolerable and not too loud), and when it is set on the continuous setting, it still stops after 2 1/2 cycles of the music.  That means that if baby is still interested, you have to keep resetting it manually every time it stops.She's not really interested in the other toys yet, but the mat itself provides a great place to practice tummy time.  I do agree that the mat isn't very large - her feet already hang past the edge when I lay her with her head under the star so I'm sure she'll outgrow this quickly.  However, for now, this is one of her favorite toys and a safe place to let her play while I do chores in the room.PS - The rabbit picture that a lot of reviewers commented was a waste is actually meant to be taken out and replaced with your own photo.  A great idea in my opinion, as babies love to look at pictures of faces and loved ones.	
1. 	I bought this for travel and it worked well. It's a lot of work to manual pump when you are used to a electric but it worked for the time being and is handy in case of engorgement while out and about.	
1. 	You can't live without one of these with a newbie! It saves from the shock of something cold on your babies tush! Think about it do you use something cold on your tush...so why should your baby!Make sure you stock up on replacement pillows...you will need them about every month or two! Highly recommend for all new parents to be!	
1. 	Finally I found a potty insert to fit our smallish round toilet lid. Other inserts that claimed they were for a standard size were just too big. It came with a simple peel & stick hanger that makes storage convenient. It is nice & cushy for our skinny 2 year olds bottom & there is no fear of him falling through. Wish it was not made in China that is my only negative comment. For that reason I only gave this product 4 stars.	
- 1	Maybe other people just think cloth diapers and fabric covers are suppose to leak, but that is not the case. These were good when the baby was 6-10lbs but after they just leak all the time. Also the inserts never dry! in the dryer with only diaper cloths for over an hour and they will still be wet. We have since switched to FLIP covers and couldn't be happier.	
1. 	...or so my older friends tell me.  We were given a Diaper Genie for a shower gift and it proved so invaluable in the baby's nursery upstairs, we bought a second one for our downstairs changing table.  (we had been wrapping each diaper in a plastic bag and throwing them in the garbage - yuck!)Keep the instructions until you get the hang of loading your Genie - the Genie comes loaded with the first roll of plastic, and we had some trouble figuring out how to load the next roll because we didn't have the practice from the first roll and had misplaced the instructions.  It is easy to load but not so easy to figure out how it loads if you aren't paying attention or are sleep-deprived.	
1. 	Wonderful bottle for breast or bottle fed babies.  My first daughter likes these and was bottled fed only. My second daughter only liked these, if it wasn't mommy (if ya know what I mean).  You can find generic liners that work and fit just as well, to cut back on cost. Another bonus is there is less clean up.  Just wash the nipple and nipple ring and your ready to go for you next feeding.	
1. 	I only use these to put ice chips in when my little guy's teeth are hurting him. He loves it. I literally get screamed at when I take it away to refill(he's only 7 months, so I will let him slide on that). I tried teething rings and other teething toys, they helped but not half as well as these.	
- 1	you must adhere these to the glass for a full 48 hrs before you use them. we did that. followed the instructions precisely. and then what happened as soon as we tried to use them? they popped off the glass! they need a better adhesive to actually work.	
1. 	Our two year old has been using this to reach the potty and it is working very well for him. Its a good height to reach the toilet, but not really tall enough for a 3 foot tall kid to reach the sink and wash his hands.	
1. 	I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old... She really love it !!...It's was very difficult make her to sleep... but the first day that we bought this I turn on the toy on her crib, and when the toy turn off I came to the crib and she was REALLY sleeping....I recommend to use this just one time a day, and when your daughter (son) is sleepy...but if you use it more than 1 time a day, BELIEVE ME, she or he will get tired of it quickly.  The only reason that I didn't put the 5 stars is because the images have poor quality, and now that my daughter is 7 1/2 months, she doesnt like it that much!!	
- 1	We did not feel safe using this in chairs. Despite the rubberized bottom, our six month old continually slipped down into a reclining position while in the chair. We tried it out at home before travelling with it and I'm glad we did. Maybe it would work for laps, but not in non-upholstered chairs.	
- 1	I have bought this pillow after reading and viewing several videos about nursing pillows.  I think this is a functional and useful design and a useful item to have with a baby (my baby is due in two months, so I only speak from reading and talking to other moms).  However, I don't think I will be using this pillow!  Here is why:  I read up on polyurethane foam (overloaded with dozens of noxious and toxic substances that DO eventually end up in your environment, your body, and your breast-milk) and I did NOT want to use this product!  Instead, I paid for the ridiculously over-priced blessed nest organic nursing pillow filled with buckwheat hulls.  I then removed the latching belt from the brestfriend slip cover that came with the pillow and had it sewn onto the blessed nest organic nursing pillow slip cover... Who wants to be poisoned in their own home, while nursing an innocent baby, with things like polyurethane foam and noxious flame ratardants?  I wish the chemical industry would just stop using us as their guinea pigs for the tens of thousands of chemicals they need to push...	
1. 	We purchased this gate for our 17 month old.  It works great for stairways and is easy to adjust.  Must have for stairways and no need to screw into walls.  **added** She is now 2 and we are still using and loving this gate.  It is sturdy and works well.  Great for people who don't want to screw things into their walls/stairways.	
- 1	I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item	
- 1	I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. What they say about the center being weak is true. I have twins and they where born of 3 and 5 lbs and the bassinet started loosing its form. I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard. If I knew that was the use I was going to give it, I would have bought a cheaper one.	
- 1	We received this as a baby shower gift and loved it while it worked. For the $250 this costs the reliability of this monitor has been a major problem.We ended up exchanging the first one within a month of receiving it because the sound stopped working. The replacement unit worked for about 9 months before the sound on that went out as well.I contacted Motorola and they had no problem sending out a replacement unit, but turnaround times are 1 week + with a receipt and 3 weeks + without a receipt. It seems like this is a fairly common problem related to faulty wiring within the parent unit. For something in this price range it is unacceptable and ridiculous that a warranty replacement take this long. A working and reliable baby monitor is critical.We ended up buying an Infant Optics DXR-8 since we couldn't wait. So far it has been excellent. From what I can tell the menu structure on the parent unit is almost identical to the Motorola. If you didn't know your were using the Infant Optics you would think it was the MB36. The display on the infant optics seems to be much sharper and the overall build quality seems better. The micro USB charging port on the parent unit is a big plus. We can use any of the other cell phone and tablet chargers we have.I would stay away from the Motorola and consider the Infant Optics DXR-8 instead.---Update - 19 days since calling---Called Motorola for an update and was told I should be receiving the replacement tomorrow. I informed the rep that I was unsatisfied by the time it has taken and feel it unacceptable for it to take so long to replace a $250 monitor that most parents would find difficult to be without. The rep was nice enough to inform me that it is only meant to be a tool and I shouldn't be relying on it to monitor my baby. The rep also informed me that they are the only office in the country that handles returns for the US and Canada and are extremely busy and she didn't see a problem with it taking this long.Definitely would recommend staying away and spending your money on something else. We are still loving ourInfant Optics Infant Optics Dxr-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5 Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lenswe bought as a replacement since we couldn't wait.	
1. 	Forget to see the model, it can only be used for 3 months. But it is still very useful.It is very soft.	
- 1	Not really a fan of these.  It is nice that they bend, however the spoon/fork area is not even big enough to hold food on. My daughter couldn't actually pick up any food with these.  I'll be sticking with the other brands from now on.	
- 1	We received this as a gift for my second child, but I can't imagine ever paying $20 for a stupid teether.  There is nothing special about it whatsoever.  I really don't understand what the hype is all about. It is soft, and cute and it squeaks, but there are other teethers that are soft and squeak. My son had no interest in it - he preferred chewing on his blankie or basically any teether we gave him. I gave Sophie to a friend and I don't think her daughter cared for it either. Save your money and just buy something else. Also, while my child never choked on the legs, I can see how that would be possible.	
1. 	The kit came with two sets of adapters to connect directly from the Medela pump to most bottles, the one pair fits Avent (old & new style Natural) bottles perfectly. So much more convenient to pump directly into normal 4/9oz bottles!	
1. 	My daughter began playing with this toy at about 6 weeks. I play with my daughter often and most of her toys provide her with entertainment for a good period of time, and for a little while this one did too. However she seemed to grow bored of it sooner than I thought she would. I would wind up changing the toys around in an effort to hold her attention and if that didn't work, she'd roll over and peruse the mat for a bit but that wouldn't last long because she would get frustrated. I'm not sure why there is a picture of a rabbit by the way..it almost seems like an after-thought. I gave it four stars because there were plenty of times where she genuinely enjoyed this playmat, but it is unfortunate that she grew bored fairly quickly and frankly, the rabbit is useless.	
1. 	I tried every bottle imaginable for my daughter. She started at 3 weeks after i tried breast feeding. There were problems with all the other bottles....such as leaking, having to buy liners all the time, unmarked nipples, suction, etc. Once i tried these bottles, we were home free! They are easy to sterilize, use and clean. I like the angle of the bottle. But the best part are the clearly marked nipples. My daughter had to have rice cereal added to her formula and these nipples are clearly marked Stage 1 (Slow flow, formula only for infants) and Stage 2 (Fast flow, for cereal and/or older babies). All the other nipples i tried with other bottles weren't marked so i had no idea which ones were slow flow and fast flow after i had sterilized them all. I had no problems at all with these bottles and i would highly recommend them. In fact i bought extra sets to leave at the grandparent's houses!	
1. 	I highly recommend this mobile.  Our baby loved it.  It got her attention and she followed the mobile as it moves.  Good 1st toy to stimulate her brain and help build eye coordination.Suggestion: Purchase this mobile as early as possible (e.g. before the baby is born) and use it immediately.  Baby grows so fast that in couple months, baby will outgrow this toy.	
1. 	was this supposed to be one hand usable? I don't think it really is. I also don't really bother to roll it up between uses. but I like it and it fits shopping carts and smooshes into restaurant high chairs. It has a toy loop and little pockets. You do have to remember to buckle your buckle so you don't lose it, but that's easy enough to do. I'm happy.	
1. 	The stool can be adjusted to two heights. It also stores alot of toiletries. I would recommend this.	
- 1	I wanted something to put over my daughters eyes so she wouldn't get soapy water in her eyes. This doesn't really contour her whole head, so water leaks down the sides. Also, you have to hold the cup with one hand while you rinse with the other..leaving no free hands to hold your child or help them tilt their head or anything. I don't think this is very practical. My daughter is now two and we never use this thing. Waste of money.	
1. 	I purchased this while pregnant because I could not see spending $40 for a Boppy.  I was not able to use this as a nursing pillow because it was too bulky for me, but I did use it for tummy time when my son was a newborn.  He is now 10 months old and I use it for play time, I plop him down on it, let him crawl over it, etc.  I never used the strap because it is a U shaped pillow and is already self-containing so I don't know why you need a strap?  Anyway, there is a pouch for the strap to go in and my son makes a game out of pulling it out after I tuck it away.  Overall, I like this pillow and I would recommend it for anyone interested in a Boppy.  I do have to say that I purchased my pillow at Wal-Mart for about $20 and it has a brightly colored jungle theme, so I cannot comment on the specific color/style being sold on Amazon.	
- 1	Let me preface this by saying I don't usually write such harsh reviews and it's unfortunate that this product missed the mark.  But I also worry that the reviews may be misleading and perhaps even false- something I've heard about before but haven't encountered in many years.I am always looking for ways to organize my home since I like it neat.  So when I came across this product, I ordered immediately.  Especially when I saw all the great reviews.  BUT, I'm not so sure all those reviews are fully accurate and have reported this to Amazon.  Notice how most of the reviews are not verified purchasers, entered within the month of April within a span of a few days, and if you click on the see other reviews by that person many of them only review this or this and the other universal product.  That makes me wonder- not making an accusation, but seems odd doesn't it???Now, when the product arrived I was actually quite hopeful because it seemed like good quality.  Decent plastic (another reviewer said it was flimsy but I thought the opposite), VERY EASY to adjust to the three different sizes, came with an additional basket for storage that could be useful, and was about the right size to fit in a cupboard shelf (maybe a little big for the fridge or freezer though).Make sure you note that if you try to put assembled sippy cups in there, the lids will make it all get stuck.  The same with bottles- you'll have to store them in pieces if you want to use this product.  This might be a personal preference but I always take the extra few minutes to roughly assemble things so I can just grab and use.  If you use the basket to separate this might not be a big deal, but you'll have to use the same brand to avoid extra effort.BUT, even when I took them all apart, things just don't fall down smoothly at all.  I tried bottles, sippy cups, cans, baby food, etc. and NOTHING flowed smoothly.  I made sure to have all the same brand and it sort of worked here and there.  However, at least 75% of the time, when I got to pulling two things out, it would get stuck behind the big center column.  There's just too much space right there for it to really work.  This appears to be a design flaw- instead of being so vertical, it probably would have worked if it were more horizontal.With my first son, I hated all the equipment just being in the cupboard so now that I've had a second I want more efficiency since I have less time.  This is a GREAT idea.  It reminds me of the old soda dispenser/stackers that a large plastics company used to sell and my mom had.  Those worked well but were annoying to fill up (now they aren't needed since the soda companies are making those boxes with the flap to remove).  Too bad this didn't work as well.  I'm printing my return labels now.	
1. 	Can't recommend this enough.I had a horrible case of thrush. This was the only thing that helped me honestly.	
1. 	This stool is great! It is the perfect height for me to nurse my baby comfortably. I use it with a boppy pillow. The only problem is I get so spoiled at home, its hard to feed my son while we're out! My husband put it together easily in a few minutes. Slightly slante but I guess we can still use it later as a step stool. I also use it while pumping for comfort.	
- 1	The idea of this is fantastic- but the actual item is poorly made with really cheap materials. I read the reviews and decided I didn't care- the plastic the holds the photos is really shotty and sticks to every picture- like you put in in a hot car and let it melt- but it did not- it's just cheap.  I think the idea of this and the number of photo pages is amazing- it's too bad they charge $14.95 for something that clearly cost .$50 or less to be made in some third world country. I am using it anyway- but wish I had paid 1/10th of what I did.	
1. 	My 6 month old got this for Christmas, and she likes to play with her fishies! Was a little hard to get the water in but it hasn't leaked so it's worth the trouble.	
1. 	I got this for my son's first birthday and it was an instant hit. He loves to chase this ball around the house! The little people that pop out as it rolls makes it more exciting than a regular ball.	
- 1	Like another reviewer said....when my 14 month old drinks from this spout , it collapses.... not sure why but it is quite aggravating...I've thought about puncturing the hole in the spout bigger but then I am afraid it will flow too fast and she will choke on the water......The bottle itself is great... agree with another reviewer as to why paint them...perhaps just do a silicone holder or something instead of painting it.... Again, every time I try it , the spout collapses....Just not working for us!!!	
- 1	I bought this instead of a high chair for the convenience factor and it is really cute.  It is a HASSLE to assemble the straps, and once they are assembled, they don't securely lock into place.  The straps hang on my a tiny hole, and at the right angle can be pulled out, which I find dangerous for baby.  The point of straps is for safety, and they should not be easily removed from their base.  We kept it anyway, but had to rig it ourselves by locking the straps in with our own invention.  Good Luck figuring this thing out!	
- 1	Worked for the first 10 months and then could only use it when plugged it.  After 18 months, it completely died.  Such a shame because I loved the features but who wants an unreliable video monitor?	
1. 	I first want to thank Amazon for offering this product with APO shipping!  I live overseas with the military and we've had nothing but trouble tring to get our baby gear (it's our first, so we have aboslutely nothing to start with).  Secondly, I must thank the other reviewers - especially those who've had this mattress for a while or are purchasing 2nd and 3rd ones.  Thank you for sharing your feedback!I've only had the mattress for a few days and we're still waiting for the baby to arrive, so we've not put it to use yet, but Amazon was able to ship the item to our APO box in about six days! And the mattress was so very light I had no trouble moving it around myself (at 9 mos. pregnant).  It fit perfectly and snugly into our Million Dollar Baby (Da Vinci) Kalani crib.  The square shape left no gaps.  I expect it to be easy to change sheets due to the lightness of the mattress.  I will be recommending this to any of my friends.	
- 1	I really wanted to love the tummy tub for my then 5 month old to play in.  However my baby just won't stay in the fetal position.  He keeps wriggling around and moving his feet to the top of the bucket/ tub so the level of water is always changing and wrong.  Basically I need to put less than half the recommended amount of water so there is less water to keep him warm and to play in.  Otherwise I constantly need to adjust him and put his feet back under.  At 7 month old,  currently I use it for quick baths.  I'll try using it again for play time when he gets older and realizes he shouldn't let his mouth go under the water.	
1. 	Oh these are awesome!  These fit the (wide) Ventaire bottle as well as Drop-In bottles.  The Ventaire bottles come with silicone nipples, but our daughter really prefers these latex ones.  They're a bit softer than silicone.  We might have to look into the fast flow ones soon though.	
1. 	leaves you with both hands free for bathing a little one.  DO NOT USE if you baby can roll over as the sides are not high enough to keep the baby in place.  The sponge will sort of float so don't put too much water in the tub.  I have washed this in a front load washing machine but low the &#34;spin&#34; speed.	
1. 	I had some personal recommendations on the Diaper Dekor, I read the reviews and decided to get it.  Overall, I am very pleased with it.  It has a foot pedal to open the lid and you can drop the diaper through the trap doors.  The pedal does not work exceptionally well on plush carpet because there is little firm support underneath it, but it's good enough.  You can always put some plywood under the pail and pedal for extra support.  Also, if you have a dirty diaper, the mess could get on the trap doors if that part of the diaper hits them.  When full, the pail is very easy to empty.  Open the bottom compartment, pull out the plastic tube/bag with the dirty diapers, cut it and throw it away.  Then pull the tube/bag down, tie a new knot in it and the pail is ready to fill again.  The refills are a bit tricky to replace the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it's very easy.  The refill bags last a long time.  There are three to a box and we've only used two boxes in eight months.  There is no way of knowing when a refill bag is near the end though, so you may not be left with enough to hold the diapers and the dirty diapers may be loose in the pail.  This has happened to me a couple of times and it's not a big deal to clean up.  It would be nice if the plastic had a red stripe toward the end of it like cash register receipt papaer does, so you'd know when it's about out.This diaper pail does not do anything fancy with the diaper, such as roll it up into a sausage, but you can roll it up if you want to save space and fit more diapers in the pail.  When your child is eating solids though, you will probably want to empty the pail daily.  Each time you open the lid to put a new dirty diaper in, the smell of the previously discarded diapers wafts into the room.  I've tried adding some baby powder or baking soda to the bag to help absorb the odor.  I also got some diaper pail deodorizers from Babies R Us that seem to help mask the smell.	
- 1	This product is very misleading. It seems from the photos that it will spin nicely from the dual layer of toys; however, it does not spin at all. I'm returning it.	
1. 	This was great in when we traveled in the hotel.  I just wish it was a little taller since some of the chairs were short and the tables taller but wonderful idea and product.	
- 1	We purchased this in hopes that it would get our reluctant potty trainer to get interested. It leaked from the first 'use' all over our floor. I did check to make sure all parts were pieced/fit together correctly and tried it a few more times. It leaked each time.	
1. 	I got this for my son's first birthday and it was an instant hit. He loves to chase this ball around the house! The little people that pop out as it rolls makes it more exciting than a regular ball.	
1. 	These are the first VentAire bottles I've used, and I'm impressed!  The air bubbles really do vent out!  My baby wasn't too great about taking a bottle before, but he actually started drinking from these.  He seems to like the nipple.  I like the angled shape of the bottle because it makes for a more comfortable feeding.The one draw back to these bottles is that there are two extra parts to clean.  But if I'm washing a bottle anyway, it's really not a big deal.  I also like that the bottom comes off because It allows for better cleaning.	
1. 	These are great baby bottles. My child has not had much gas since using this product. It is easy to clean as the parts come apart simply. The angled neck is easy for me to hold while my baby is sitting up and prevents excessive gas in her stomach. 9oz is a good size bottle for growing babies and their tremendous appetites. Also, it's a great price compared to other well-known BPA free bottles (some of which were $10 per bottle).	
1. 	There is a reason why Medela is the leader in breast pumps and this is no exception. This is the best manual pump on the market. The two modes of pumping, let down mode and expression mode, make it unlike any other pump. It makes pumping quick and efficient. I could easily get 6-8 ounces in 20-30 minutes. The manual design also makes for discreet pumping that can be done anywhere. If you plan to pump full time, I would suggest an electric pump, such as the Medela Pump in Style Advanced. But for occasional pumping, this is a wonderful product. It is also one of the least expensive pumps you can buy. You are getting more than what you pay for.	
- 1	I do not like this cup because the straw leaks after it has been sitting for a little while.  It just starts to come up out of the straw and drip down the cup.  Very messy and not worth it.  I like the Zoli cup better although not a perfect cup.	
- 1	mi hijo lo odia, y yo como mama tambi&eacute;n, no tiene tapa es una falla importante, a quien se le puede ocurrir hacer un articulo para bebes y no ponerles tapa, por dios, la v&aacute;lvula es muy dura y tiene que hacer mucha fuerza para que salga agua, decid&iacute; no usarlos y ya, dinero perdido.	
1. 	What more can you ask for? This is one of those baby products! It's VERY easy to use: so easy to use, you will learn to use it (believe me, this is important) &quot;in your sleep&quot;. It is inexpensive too: just shop around for other sterilizers and you will see this is the best one you can get for this price. Finally, and perhaps most important of all: this is an essential piece of baby gear. Sure, you can boil those bottles and those pacifiers, but let's face it: this is the 21st Century, and you might as well make use of your microwave.	
1. 	Adorable and has held up well over the past 10 months. The liner for the inside is easy to remove and replace so I just pull the whole bag out when full and carry it to the laundry room. Perfect for a baby/small child's room!	
- 1	I don't even know where to begin - basically, it is a horrible car seat. I would like to slap myself for ever falling for the bells and whistles of the swivel/dock feature Orbit is so proud of. I recommend you to stay away from Orbit, the toddler car seat in particular. Your wallet will thank you and you will save yourself a headache. If you feel like reading why, go ahead.We have the Orbit Baby G2 travel system (the frame, the base, and the infant car seat) and felt somehow trapped as we thought since we already have the expensive base we should get the Orbit toddler car seat to put it to further use (our 12-month old baby is getting too big for the infant seat). Unfortunately, we were unable to see the toddler car seat in person because no retailer seems to have a floor model of this thing. I was hesitant to order it online so we went to a store hoping we would be able to take it out of the box to further examine its functions because I wasn't sure whether it has a recline function (Orbit website does not mention this function at all). So we went and were told by the shop that they do not have a floor model (surprise) and that the box cannot be opened. So I asked a few questions and was assured and reassured that it does, indeed, recline into a very comfortable position to accommodate babies and small toddlers. We paid almost $400 ($360 + NYC tax) and brought this thing home where we discovered that it DOES NOT RECLINE!!! I was furious because I asked 3 different sales persons and all of them assured me that it does recline. Every other convertible car seat on the market has a reclining function, especially at this price point. And frankly, for almost $600 ($360 seat + $220 base) it should recline automatically when I say recline.  The seat is so upright I do not understand that Orbit says it is designed for babies from 15 pounds! No way. My son was 15 pounds when he was only 3.5 months old. There is absolutely NO WAY a 3-month old baby would ever be comfortable in an upright position when they can't even sit. Actually, they shouldn't be in an upright position this early at all! I tested the seat with my 12-month old son who weighs 22 pounds now and measures 31 inches (BTW, the infant car seat is for babies up to 30 pounds or 32 inches, so he's only 1 inch away, and frankly, he's not very comfortable in it anymore). Do you think my 12-mo/22-lb/31-in baby was comfortable in his new toddler car seat? ... No, he was not. We drove for about half an hour (we couldn't take it longer), he slept and his poor head was literally resting on his chest. It looked horrible and very uncomfortable. For those who think it is normal, let me assure you that it is not. I have used Chicco and Maxi-Cosi convertible car seats in Europe and they all recline, so I have never experienced this problem. I knew instantly I would be returning this seat. Which is exactly what I did.I only owned this seat for 4 days, therefore I didn't get a chance to experience any problems with the belt twisting as reported by other reviewers.Another major con is that this seat has only 4 harness slots to adjust harness height (of which only the lower 2 are allowed for rare facing installation)! That's totally inadequate - other convertible car seats offer more than double (Britax Next Generation: 10 slots, Maxi-Cosi Pria: 11 slots). This important detail (along with the fact that it doesn't recline and that you can't use the swivel base while forward facing) is conveniently not mentioned at the Orbit Baby website. You'll discover this when you take the seat out of the box and read the manual.I contacted Orbit because I am still in shock that such an expensive car seat from a company that claims to be so innovative lacks standard features. I wrote an email which included the following:... What is a consumer supposed to do if his/her baby's head is literally resting on its chest while sleeping in the seat - this looks super uncomfortable for the baby and seems unsafe too. Normally, I would recline the seat. But Orbit does not allow me to do that. Why not and what is supposed to be done instead to make the baby comfortable? I tested the toddler car seat with my 12-month old who weighs 22 pounds and measures 31 inches - the toddler car seat is too upright and the poor baby was sleepy and his head was falling on his chest all the time. We have your infant car seat, which has a good angle, but he's outgrowing it and we need a new seat for him. The current seat angle of your toddler seat seems sort of OK for bigger toddlers, maybe around 2 or 3 years, but what am I supposed to do during the in-between stage from 12 months up to 2 or 3 years, when he's too big for your infant seat, yet too small for your toddler seat due to the non-existing recline...Brace yourself for the response and suggestions I received from Orbit...We are not aware of any convertible car seats that have a recline position. ... Really??? How about Britax, or Maxi-Cosi to name a couple (they have the same safety features like Orbit, such as the EPP foam and side impact protection). Britax, for instance - all of their convertible car seats allow 3-position recline both while rear and forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIORI model has 4 recline positions when forward facing. Maxi-Cosi PRIA 70 has 3 recline positions - position 3 (most reclined) and 2 (medium recline) can be used while rear facing. Position 2 (medium recline) must be used while forward facing for children up to 40 pounds. Position 1 (upright) must be used while forward facing for children over 40 pounds. Interestingly, Maxi-Cosi seems to believe (just like me ... or maybe it's just common sense) that toddlers/children up to 40 pounds should be seated in a more reclined position. Their website explains it as follows: These recline positions allow a more reclined riding position for younger children and a more upright position for older children. Not only does this provide an appropriate riding position for different sized children, but the required recline angles also improve crash energy management.On the head falling forward: We understand your concerns and see the same phenomenon when our own children nap using the Toddler Car Seat. ... Phenomenon?!  More like a poorly designed, overpriced car seat that lacks BASIC features!We have never received any information - from pediatricians or otherwise - that when children sleep in these seemingly awkward positions, it is somehow bad for them. - Uh, how about just incredibly uncomfortable!?There are many general techniques that you can use so that your child is more comfortable. Some include a towel, foam wedge, or pool noodle that can be used to prop the Base. - A pool noodle???  Are you kidding me? No, thank you, I will not be sticking any towel or pool noodle under the car seat base. The towel/pool noodle option doesn't seem safe and frankly it is a very sloppy solution for a $600 ensemble and to be honest I am appalled by their suggestion.Rather than a pool noodle, I will get a different car seat. I am extremely disappointed with the Orbit system due to its lack of otherwise standard features. The fact that they are not aware of the reclining function tells me that Orbit is way behind its competitors.FYI: If you think the rotating feature is cool and you are planning to buy it for that reason, please don't. This function does not compensate for the many disadvantages of the seat and frankly, you can only use the rotating function when rear-facing. Once forward facing, the rotation-allowing base cannot be used anymore, nor will you be able to dock the seat into the stroller frame (unless you want to install it over and over again which is beyond annoying). Hence, once forward facing, the famous swivel feature cannot be utilized.And if you think you can just grab the toddler car seat, lift it with your sleeping child in it and dock it into the stroller frame, then trust me, you can't unless you are the Incredible Hulk. The seat is very bulky and heavy (22 pounds), I struggled with it alone, I would never be able to lift it from the back seat (a very awkward angle) with a toddler in it. Never.Update 02/2012 - after an extensive and exhausting 6-month research we finally purchased a Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat in Walnut Brown and we are very pleased with it. In fact, I am so happy with it I gave it 5 stars.	
- 1	She hated it. I have no idea why. I thought it would be a good transition from bottle to sippy cup. The only ones she'll even go near are the Nuk Learner cups. I guess every kid is different.	
- 1	I tried to like it but I didn't...I ended up returning it and replacing it with Dr. Brown's and I'm much happier	
- 1	I purchased this product thinking it would help with the diaper pale smell and even freshen up my babies room a bit.  They don't work, they smell great but only if you stick them up by your nose and take a deep breath.  I put one in the diaper pale, one on the changing table and on in her small walk in closet.  They have done nothing for the dirty diaper smell and you certainly can't smell any lavender scent in her room (they are lavender scented but only if your nose it to the plastic).  I paid $5 for 5 of them, a waste of $5 but at least now I know not to buy them again.	
1. 	Simple and good. Difficult for little fingers to remove and, perhaps more importantly, they don't attract his attention because they are small and neutrally colors.	
1. 	We registered for this diaper pail after a lot of research online. Now that our son is 8 weeks old, we've loved it so much we purchased another one so we have one on both floors of the house. It's very easy to use - just flip the handle - and allows absolutely no odor to escape. It's very easy to empty and change the bag. What I love is it uses regular trash bags so there's no expensive refills to keep purchasing. This is what I'm going to buy for every baby shower I go to from now on!	
1. 	I'm so glad I bought this monitor with the larger 2.5 screen. We are able to see our daughter clearly even in black-and-white mode. Note that there needs to be good bright lighting in the bedroom for it to show color mode clearly.This monitor has great reception, as I can take it down to the garage to do laundry or out to our patio to water the plants. It does generate some interference when we set it near our computers or tv.You do have to keep it plugged in for it to show the picture constantly, otherwise it goes into standby mode with only sound (you have to press the top button to get picture).I do wish that they had numbered volume settings on the side so I can always set it at the same level every night. I find myself fidgeting with it each night to get just the right amount of sound. We have a sound machine that runs in her room at night, so we try not to make it too loud.All in all, this will save you the hassle of running to the baby's room all the time. Good quality and effective!	
1. 	I wish I had this when my first born was in the infant carrier!this stroller is so light weight & easy to handle.  I bought it when my son was born & used it daily!The large basket under the seat is pretty easy to reach.. compared to my regular metrolite stroller.I wish Graco could keep the great features of this frame (easy to open & close & easy access to basket & great stearing, not to mention light weight) in other model strollers!	
1. 	These snack cups are AWESOME! I can put all sorts of small snack items (dried fruit, crackers, cookies, etc) in here, and my toddler can't get the lid off to make a mess. He can get his hand in all the way to the bottom to get the last few pieces (a problem I've had with other snack containers). Yes, if you have small crumbs and your child turns the cup upside down and shakes, you might have a little mess. However, it wasn't that big of a problem for me - just make sure you have fresh, whole pieces of your snack.	
1. 	Love, love, love this cube. My 8 month young daughter loves it too. It never gets old and it's so much fun to hit all the different instruments, then listen to them all play in sync. Great buy!!	
- 1	I was really hoping and praying that this would work.  If your babies are like mine, and they like to roll and go to sleep on their sides, this sleepsuit will just frustrate them, because it impedes their movements.  I bought this to transition my babies out of their swaddles and cradles into their cribs when they were about 5-6 months old.  I ended up using them only a couple of nights. Will be returning them.	
- 1	I don't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are. It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device. I've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once. I prefer to just hand wash our bottles, pacifiers, accessories, and breast pump parts. It's a good idea but ehh, not a hit.	
- 1	These bottles have always leaked for me. It was a good starter set though. It is easy to clean and seems to replicate breastfeeding.	
1. 	We did a lot of research when shopping for a stroller.  I knew that I did not want a big bulky travel system.  I thought I was going to register for the snap and go frmae, but when I tested it out in the store with a graco snugride car seat it seemed loose, not really very secure.  We tried the snugrider car seat frame and it was awesome.The only 2 drawbacks I have found is the only canopy you have is on the carseat itself. With the travel systems you can pull the carseat's canopy up and the stroller's canopy up shielding your baby from the sun.  Also I wish that it folded more square.  It folds flat, but takes up a lot of room in your trunk.  It has a large mesh storage area, but it you load it like I do it's sometimes hard to get to your stuff witht he carseat on top.Is great for getting through narrow aisles when shopping.  Overall a great product.  If had to buy again i would compare to the new Graco Mosaic stroller.  I think it's probably a better but as you don't have to get a second stroller for when they outgrow their infant carseat.	
1. 	This was perfect for our needs. We needed something small and light-weight for quick trips to the store, restaurants and travel.If your baby falls asleep and you need to run an errand, no problem! Now that our son is too big for this I dread having to go to a store that isn't walking distance near nap time.If you want to go out to dinner and eat with two hands, just put your baby in this thing. Even if he's awake you can still talk to him and engage him.And for those airplane trips to introduce him to the family, you can use the stroller to carry the carseat and your baby through the airport.  (I would recommend making sure you have read the directions and done a trial run of using your carseat without the base before you go.)	
1. 	This bag is great for me to carry things I need for my son it comes in so many difrent designs and has lots of room to be perpared	
- 1	These are just 2 pieces of Minky fabric sewn together. No padding. The velcro sides are stretched out so they are longer than the rest of the cover. This causes the edge of the velcro to stick out and be scratchy.	
- 1	This product does not work.  If your door nob is not really small, the rubber on the inside will catch on the door nob with even the smallest pressure, or even just turning of the product, and it will open.  My 2 year old opened this in 1 night.  We even tried to carve out the rubber on the inside completely, but again, she could open it.  Our door nob isn't huge or anything, I'm not sure what's going on.  Even my 1 year old who can barely reach the door nob can open it because he pulls on the product enough to turn it.  Useless in our household.	
- 1	These crib pads do help keep sheets dry but they wear out quickly.  They looked awful after the first time I washed them and have started falling apart after 6 months.  I wash them with natural baby detergent and hang to dry so I am surprised that they have worn out already.	
- 1	It leaked just as soon as I filled it with water, turned upside down to test -- water came POURING out of the top hole that serves as an air vent.  Many sippy cups and toddler cups have them, but not one of them leaked as this one -- a river of water!!  There is no way they did not know it, right?  What do they think? That it will never fall down with open lid?It will not leak ONLY if the cap is shut close -- the plastic cap has a little piece that goes into the air vent hole and thus stops the leak. But again, it expects that my toddler will be responsible and careful enough to close it every time -- not realistic.For this price, I can't decide if I even bother returning or just donating to some store ... poor soul who buys it for $5.	
1. 	So I struggled for a while finding the right blocks to buy. I was very happy with this set. Although there are a few things I kind of wished for :1 - There are 28 blocks in this set - all uppercase. So if you want the lowercase ones too - prepare to shell out another 30 bucks or so.2 - The blocks do have somewhat sharp corners - they are not rounded at all. My daughter is 15 months old, so I'm not concerned about her getting hurt.3 - I know someone people talked about splinters in their sets - but I haven't come across that with mine.4 - They are in fact made in the USA - how rare!5 - The blocks are very nicely sized. They aren't huge but they are the size I would expect considering the price.6 - As someone mentioned in their review - not all sides are embossed - but honestly that doesn't take away from the design and/or usefulness of the blocks7 - The animal pictures are somewhat classic in design  - but that's neither a pro or a conAll in all - I love these blocks. I wish more came in the set - but I've gone ahead and purchased the lowercase set to add to this batch. With a total of 56 blocks - we should have no problem making words. If you're looking for some blocks that seem like the type you keep for the long haul - I'm convinced these are the ones!	
1. 	For our review, we choose the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. This is a wonderful choice for babies and even older children. He is an adorable little plush turtle with a hard shell. Kids can play with him by day, and at night he turns into something truly amazing. A night light that not only keeps all the scary monsters away, but turns your child's bedroom into a whole new world. The back of the turtle's shell has a star and moon pattern and when the light are out, that pattern is reflected on the wall or ceiling. You can choose between white, green and blue stars. My  toddler was amazed by it, and even my older kids loved it.***I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review on my blog, New Age Mama***	
1. 	For the first few days of my son's birth, we had the wide-neck Avent bottles which leaked, the nipples gave him suction blisters on the lips, he needed extensive burping and he would find it difficult to suck against the negative-pressure that builds up in those bottle.  Dr Brown's bottles solved all these issues.I have six bottles and it takes me less than 20 minutes to wash them by hand.  It takes some getting used to washing the small parts, but it's worth the extra effort.  The small brush which comes with the starter kit is essential to clean the small parts.  A regular bottle brush is fine for the bottles themselves.  Save yourself the money and go straight for the 8oz bottles.  The starter kit comes with Level-1 nipples.  You will likely need to graduate your baby to Level-2 niplles at 3-months of age and Level-3 nipples at 6-months of age.  Y-cut nipples are also available for thicker liquids (cereal mixed in milk).If you leave expressed breast-milk in these bottles in the refigerator, the fat tends to stick to the vent (just as a FYI).  Use the travel-discs when transporting milk and there will be no leaks.  My baby hardly needs burping with these bottles, they are that great (he doesn't have reflux by the way).  The caps snap on loudly which is the only con I can think of.I highly recommend these bottles. I've suggested these bottles to two of my friends whose babies have refulx and they have seen an improvement.  Try some other websites, which have better prices and offer the 9-pack variety.  If you're paying shipping, might as well get some extra small brushes, you'll need them.  One lasts for about 6-8 weeks.	
1. 	we been through 5 different potty seats. This one is our favorite. We bought two. Very easy to clean and its comfy for our toddler.	
- 1	This product was simply too bulky and ugly for us to keep in our home.  Although we really loved the concept and our daughter loves to use her kickboard in the crib, there was no need for this additional purchase so we returned it.	
- 1	...I expected far better.  This is a great space-saving, travel pack n play, but all that these 'sheets' are is an EXTREMELY thin pillowcase with the back ripped off.  No, I'm not kidding... I opened the package and stared in disbelief.  Honestly, after doing more research, it's better to just use a standard/queen sized pillowcase and tuck the ends under.  Oh and don't even remotely expect these 'sheets' to contain a blowout or pee... it goes right through to the pad.	
- 1	It'd be great if it wasn't so easy to tear off. The Velcro straps that hold toys doesn't do a great job of holding toys either. My ten month old rips this off the rail and rips the toys off the Velcro. Snap buttons might work better.	
1. 	it moves around a lot.but it does what it's supposed to.having a wipes case on top weighs it down a bit, which is good.all in all, not a great idea to have all this stuff on the counter where the baby loves to reach for it and play.	
- 1	Pros:perfect size for any size diapers and wipesHas a little side pocket for smaller itemsHardware seems pretty sturdyCons:Fabric quality seems poorOverall structure seems poorly designed- shape is sort of irregular.Overpriced for what it is.	
1. 	Worked as expected. Easy to place on the pump and bottles.	
- 1	Update: Changed my rating from a four to a two. My baby just outgrew these at a measly 12 lbs. By that I mean that I cannot snappi them using the jelly roll fold anymore--they are shrinking with every wash, so I would have to trifold them and lay them in the cover, which isn't ideal because my baby is still quite young and exclusively breastfed. This means I'd have poop exploding everywhere, and I cannot keep changing covers constantly. I'd say just go for cheap but durable SIZED prefolds from cottonbabies, diaper-rite or green mountain diapers. These covers are still great, though, even for smaller babies, so spring for some used ones.Ignore everything the tag says and wash these at least 10 times (with regular laundry, if you want to save water) before using and they are the SOFTEST prefolds. They do NOT fit newborns, however, since they are ridiculously large. I started using them comfortably after my skinny kid hit 9lbs. There is still a lot of bulk/folding down in the front/back. The covers are of extremely cheap quality, but they do the job. Double leg gussets would have helped, but they keep clothes dry, so that's all I care about. I bought four of these trial packs, as another reviewer suggested, and they are serving me well.	
1. 	They are good. But i like Especially for baby sacks better only bcoz they smell nicer but Sassy are not bad at all. I am just being a little picky.	
1. 	My son loves this swing now at 7 weeks old. He actually took his first two naps in it yesterday. I normally hold him almost all the time, but yesterday was in the upper 90s and I just needed to set him down for a while to cool off. He fell asleep.He loves how the swing goes from side to side, and about 2 weeks ago, he started noticing the mirror and mobile up above.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the swing is just a little too fast. We still have it on the lowest setting at 7 weeks old. He hated it at first, and I didn't like him being in it anyway since it was so fast.It's perfect now.	
1. 	I'm sure I can't come up with anything new to add to the other reviews of this product, but I just wanted to commend cloud 9 for the AWESOME product!I want one for my room!	
- 1	If I weren't so lazy and hadn't destroyed the packing when opening these toys, I would have returned them.  I got these for a one-year old who loves to push buttons.  The only one of these toys she can &#34;work&#34; is the remote.  The other two toys have flat push buttons which she can not do - but even my three-year old has difficulty with those.  Very disappointed in these.	
- 1	The plastic screen portion of this product is so flimsy that it ripped a bit while I was attaching it to the window.  After just one accidental opening of the window with this in place it was destroyed.  I replaced this withEddie Bauer Deluxe Roller Shade 2pk. Although the Eddie Bauer version is significantly more expensive, it has lasted for almost six months (with MANY accidental openings and closings of the window) as compared to less than a week.	
1. 	This little item solved two problems:  Introducing oral care/hygiene, and teeting pain.  She loves how this feels on her tender gums and it takes a beating with her biting and pulling at the same time to relieve some new-tooth-pressure.  All the while she is cleaning her teeth and gums.  I like how it easily cleans up, it's durability, and portability- just pop it into the diaper bag to take along with us.  Other reviews spoke of a choking hazard... you must always supervise children with food/objects in their mouth.  That said, perhaps if their baby was having difficulty, the child may have triggered their gag reflex???  Anyway, we love it and am ordering more!!	
1. 	We got this item to use mainly as a step stool for our 14 1/2 month old daughter.  She is working on potty training and we opted for one of the seat instead of a potty.  The step up is still a bit high for her to manage on her own but with a little help from mom or dad she able to manage it.  We were just lifting her up onto the seat but our doctor suggested a step stool just to aid in the process.  She was always proud of herself as were we when she used the potty but this simple and inexpensive item made her 10 times prouder of herself.  WE can tell she really feels like a big girl when she uses it and her potty seat.It's also GREAT for bath time.  We had one of those hook on tubside kneelers and it worked great for us but with age we needed more of a seat than a kneeler.  She loves to play in the water so we were usually sitting on the counter and letting her play.  Well this gives us more height and it wider than the other thing so we're able to sit beside the tub (without sitting in the wet floor) and play with her.  Plus there is room inside it to store a couple of her favorite books for potty time.	
- 1	This grinds food fine EXCEPT for the huge space between the top of the plunger and the blade - it wastes a ton of food.  I've used others that don't do this and cost less.	
- 1	I originally loved this when I first got it and used it to store an emergency diaper kit in the car. However, there really isn't much you can fit in the outside pocket without making the bag look lumpy and stretched (for example, diaper cream tube). The material is also heavy duty, which is a good thing, but makes it clunky when you wrap everything in.Also, after repeated washes on the gentle cycle in my front loading washing machine with cold water (and air dried), something happened to the zipper making it impossible to zip back in the change pad and rendering the bag pretty useless.I love the Jonathan Adler pattern though - super cute!	
- 1	We got this when our little one still preferred to be swaddled but was now occasionally rolling on to his stomach. We were hoping this would prevent him from rolling. Learned how to use it to keep baby on his side which he preferred however he did not like being restricted to one place. He fought it each time he realized he was in it. Like the idea and hoped it would work for us. Probably would work for younger babies.We had to go cold turkey with not swaddling real quick.	
1. 	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.	
- 1	I bought this with intentions of using the suction cup on the window in my back seat to see what my grand child is up to as her car seat faces backwards while I'm up front driving. It might work if the suction cup would actually stick. It falls off the window within a few minutes and I cannot get it to stick. This is not due to cold weather. Its just not suctiony enough... if thats a word :)	
1. 	My daughter had the munchkin duck tub for awhile until it broke. Well...she is almost two and I was thinking of getting another one or bath mats. Our tub is very slippery. So I found this one and the age limit was past 2years old so I thought I would try it out. I really think it is a good transition to the tub. It is not real deep and she has lots of room but it still makes her feel safe and secure.	
1. 	We researched baths and finally settled on this one. It seems it will serve her well until she's ready to go into the regular bathtub. We have a 6 week old and have no problems with this, it is made well and there's a nice piece in the middle of the tub that keeps her from slipping down too far.	
1. 	These are great cups.  My toddler loves them and they appear to be a great quality.  I don't put them through the dishwasher becuase I am not sure if the print on the outside would come off.  Easy to drink from but doesn't spill easily.	
1. 	This is by far the most used single item I bought for the baby. She loves to hang out in this so she can see the world.	
1. 	I only found couple reviews on this product but I thought I'd risk it and order it. It was bit tricky at first to assemble, but after the first couple times it's so easy. I think it's awesome. I throw this in my purse in a quart size ziploc bag and carry a bottle with a lid to store for when I'm out and need to express myself or when I'm traveling. It's so much easier than carry my double electric pump and looking for a place to plug in and hookup. I never used the flexi shield and it works fine for me that way. I feel that the hand pump has stronger suction than my Ameda Purely Yours electric pump!It's great to put it in your purse or to use when you can't be hooked on to the pumps. I would totally recommend this product and I have!!	
- 1	It was ok. The fit was very tight on my playard matress and rolled up. I would save my money next time. I did repurpose this as a changing pad cover, it worked for that but not great for my playard matress.	
- 1	In theory this is a great item. However, if you are over 100 pounds and 4 feet, this thing is useless. I wasn't huge, but come on! This needs to be double the size to support a pregnant belly or back. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	I ordered an extra set so I could leave one at work and one at home.  They fit just like the set that came with the pump and have worked well.	
1. 	We absolutely LOVE this product.  We had one with our first son, but donated it to charity when we moved.  When I had our second son we purchased one right away.  It is great when they are tiny little guys, and the toddler &#34;seat&#34; side is great for when they are bigger.  As he got older we set the tub into the big tub so he could splash around and I wasn't mopping up water every day.  If you have any questions about what tub to get, this one is by far the best we've tried yet!!!	
1. 	Initially we bought our new little daughter a simple green bouncy seat that has some spring to it when you push it back but we returned that one quickly because our little one was so bored with it so quickly and didn't like sitting in it. I'll mention some reasons below that we really like this seat.Assembly: this was very easy, the cloth fit over it perfectly, and the toy/accessory snapped into place without problem.Recline Mode: If you look at the photo, you will notice that toward the front at the bottom there is a bar that goes from side to side. This is a kick stand that can be pulled down to lock the seat into a sturdy reclining mode which also prevents the rocking. It made such a huge difference for her to lay in a reclined position, especially if she's taking a short nap, it added at least another hour of well needed rest. Additionally its nice to let them lay back as they can't support their neck very well early on. The rocking position however is very nice when she is in a playful mood.Seat adjustment: Not only does this allow a stabilized reclining position, but the back of the seat itself is also adjustable, although not by much. You push the two large green buttons on the sides at the same time and the back can move one unit forward or one unit back. What I don't like about this is that if your using both hands already to push the buttons in, how do you move the back of the seat at the same time to position it ? Well somehow I'm able to get it but kinda strange, should have it only on one side to free up one of your hands. We use mostly the reclined position when thinking to change posture.Toy: comes with a nice attachment with toys that suspend from above that your little one can play with. It also has a little handle that when she pulls it, a short song is played. This helps her learn cause and effect.Vibration Mode: The seat does have a similar button that allows the seat to vibrate. I don't know why but this calms them down and gets them to sleep quickly. She loves it.Cloth: The cloth is very easy to remove and wash. This is super important as you can imagine. It also has the usual safety straps (seat belt) built in to secure your child.Mobility: The seat is not that heavy and easy to lift. You can also slide or push it easily across the carpet to move it however note that you cannot do this while its in the stabilized reclining position because the white rubber at the bottom prevents this.Overall: This is a great seat. We returned the previous one that we purchased which was slightly smaller and only had a little bit of a bouncy/springy effect and purchased this one instead. The quality and features on this one make it way better and if you have tried other seats, i'm sure you'll understand why.Happy shopping for your little one,George	
- 1	My kiddo kept pushing them off her hands. Once I figured out how to cut her little nails, we didn't need these anymore. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	My son got A LOT of use out of this play mat. He used it for about 6 months or so...just till he could start scooching off the mat to check out other things. What I really liked about this is the removable toys. I took them off and attached them to his stroller and walker, so while he's now too old for the mat, he's still getting use of the little hanging toy that come with it!My only complaint is this doesn't fold up, so it does take up a bit of room when not in use. I also had a Baby Einstein play mat, but my son didn't enjoy it as much as he did this one...however...the Baby Einstein mat folded in half, so storing it out of the way was nice. Overall, I absolutely recommend this mat! My boy just loved it, so it was money very well spent!	
- 1	I had a couple major issues with this outlet cover.#1: The screw that probably is in your existing wall outlet covers is not long enough to accommodate this outlet cover. They made it much thicker than the outlet cover it replaces so for me, I need to go purchase a handful of screws.#2: Box is not big enough to accommodate ANYTHING except basic, small, two-prong plugs. So what won't fit? Our laptops, our phone charger (Samsung Galaxy has a small box that plugs into wall), iPod chargers, computer charger, power strip plug, light dimming plug attached to lamp, DSLR charger, baby sound machine, Verizon Fios plugs. Well crap... what appliance plugs DID fit, you ask? A lamp. Just one lamp. Oh, and the electric toothbrushes.Useless, sending them back. The Safety 1st units are square (not pyramid shaped) and hold various plugs.	
- 1	We got one of these when our son was a newborn in part to avoid interference with some 2.4 GHz devices around the house. It worked reasonably well until just out of warranty, when the parent unit broke (the switch,  apparently). We couldn't return it, and couldn't repair it. Stuck with a child unit, and figuring it was just one of those things, we decided to buy a replacement pair, and just have an extra child unit we could swap in and out as a replacement. Gosh, what do you know, the new child unit broke down, and we had only one parent and child unit, and then the second child unit broke down.We didn't drop, wet, or otherwise abuse any of these units, and followed the recharge and usage instructions to a T.Whatever the reason for the breakages, and however much the features may appeal, I don't think 12 months of combined use for two units is what you would call reliable. In fact, I call it awful. Avoid at all costs.	
- 1	It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid. It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids. For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably. Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss. If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance. But should not have any issues in carpet. Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product. Going back to fisher price bouncers.	
- 1	Terrible gate!  It's have and loud.  Also, they damaged our walls.  The pressre on the wall  brackets was too much.  The brace actuallly  punched a hole in our wall.  We lost the brace (through the drywall).  much kin doesn't sell replacement  parts so  now we have to buy a whole new gate.	
1. 	I love these dispensers, time and space saving.  easy rotation and cleaning.  i need to order more, wish i could pick my colors.	
- 1	I gave this to my toddler to help her transition into a big girl cup. She chews on most everything, and the products I purchase need to be able to hold up to the fact that she's hard on things. She was able to chew on the spout opening to the point where there was a big hole where the spout was within a day. In order to wash this cup, you need to remove the top silicon cover, which I found to be very thin, but it did wash okay. However, you need a back up cup while the other one dries. If you use this cup when it's not completely dry, the silicon cover leaks. Plus, my toddler can easily remove the spout on her own. I won't be buying this product again.I checked with my daughter's daycare, and they've experienced the same issues.	
1. 	Great product, we use it quite often. Its easy to put on and take off. Baby falls asleep in it. Small quirks though, the only issues I have is with the bottom part where the babys bottom sits. It just doesn't seem ergonomic to the babys legs. It spreads them apart and is tight on the legs, especially when hes facing forward. Also, the top part that folds down is another issue, he puts his mouth on the fabric, which is fine but also on the plastic part that secures him to the chest, another design flaw. Other than that, I've been pretty happy with this carrier.	
- 1	This just kept tipping over and/or falling off, so we returned it. The fastener just isn't very strong. When you would fold up the stroller, this would get tweaked. Not a good product.	
1. 	I'm doing the cloth diaper route with my GF for our son and these are great in keeping with the whole &#34;green&#34; movement.  I use these as reusable wipes and they are still going strong after 7 months of use.  I saved a disposable wipe plastic box to store these, using a mix of some soap my GF prefers and filtered water.  After washing these, I place them in the sun to remove the stains.  I assume I have saved some money not buying disposable wipes but I have no hard figures to post.  Happy overall.	
1. 	Here's a tub that makes both baby and parent feel secure at bath time.We got this tub about two years ago for our son. We used it for about a year with him. Now we are using it again for our newborn daughter.This tub has two outstanding features. First, the hammock holds a newborn or infant snugly. This makes the baby feel secure and gives you the ability to have a hand free. Thus, it's possible for one person to bathe the baby solo without worrying that the baby will fall into the water.Second, because the hammock has adjustable straps, it can be raised or lowered. This allows you to have baby out of the water for a sponge bath prior during the first few weeks when they're not supposed to be submerged. Once their cord stub falls off, you can lower the hammock so that they are in the water as little or as much as you want.As the baby grows, you remove the hammock. Baby can lie against the inclined side until he or she has the strength to sit up. Then, once sitting well, they can use the straight-backed side. Because the tub is small, it's easier to keep baby upright even when they haven't mastered sitting up. Also, another advantage over a bath seat that goes on the floor of the bathtub is that this little bath doesn't require so much water to fill, making bath time simpler and quicker.Some reviewers have complained that the tub does not drain completely when you open the drain plug. This is absolutely true; however, I think the drain plug is merely intended to drain out the vast majority of the water -- which it does -- so that you can turn the tub over to rinse it and drain it completely.  Without this drain feature, the filled tub would be incredibly heavy, making it nearly impossible to turn over to pour the water out (not to mention the mess you'd probably make trying to dump all that water down the sink!).	
1. 	These toys are adorable and functional. They'll attach to other toys, including playmats, stroller toys etc. Not so sure why they're so expensive though.... still fun and unique!	
1. 	By far the best bib I have found to date! Excellent quality and the most adorable prints. I know others complained about the quality but if you wash and dry by hand per the instructions they will last forever!! They keep my children dry and food, drinks, markers, playdoh, etc... Off my child. They wipe off very easily. My child would get sick in the car and we would put the bib on before leaving the house and this would catch most of what came up. We are so thankful for these bibs and highly recommend them.	
- 1	Nearly every one we had must have been defective. The frames bent easily and stayed bent (and yes, I know the sides are supposed to bend and then snap into position but it was more than that...they stayed bent).Also, if you put this up, plan on keeping it up. I would describe this more as a permanent solution rather than an easy to remove and put up travel gate. From the reviews here, it is clear that some people love this but it just didn't work for our lifestyle.Pre-tested before baby came as well as with a friend's baby. Totally frustrating and we followed the directions perfectly. As others have noted, the directions are not easy to follow and you have to practice to understand how to get this to work. Even so, after extending the top and bottom sides, placing the gate on the floor (a required step according to manufacturer instructions) and then locking it in place, we were extremely...well, grumpy. Further practice didn't make things any better. I would never use this as a portable baby gate!Uh-uh. Looking for something simpler. I would avoid using this after going through so many steps each time! Again, for a permanent or long-term gate (for crawlers to first walkers), this might work...as a travel gate, nope...not from what I experienced.	
- 1	This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature.  In a tub full of ~100 degree water, he consistently read 72-74 degrees.  Tried resetting, no luck.  If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp, I could have really scalded my kids.  Cute, but unsafe, unsafe, unsafe.  Returning it immediately.	
- 1	These are simply too loose and easy to slip out.  My 14 month old easily removes them from the wall and then starts to chew on them.  Ahhhh! A better solution are the covers you actually screw into the walls.	
- 1	Within a few minutes of using this, the wire that holds the bristles and sponge on the handle bent.  It then twisted around in the handle so I wasn't able to clean bottles well.The plastic end meant to clean nipples was a joke.  It didn't clean anything.  Needless to say, I quickly purchased a different brush and discarded this one.  I recommend the Munchkin brand bottle brush.	
1. 	If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.  I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).  The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.  It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.  I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.  The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.  I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.  It worked great!  I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!  :-)	
1. 	The Dr. Brown's bottles come with a cleaner but its nice to have extras on hand in case one is lost. These cleaners work well at cleaning all the parts that come with the bottles.	
- 1	This fits the B-Agile on a slant, so beverages with holes (e.g. hot coffee) spill out onto the stroller.  Drinks with lids are ok, but the cup holders are a little small so you have to shove them in there.  It also has a weird chemical smell, like other reviewers said.	
1. 	small. simple. easy. love it. used it in the bathtub and in the kitchen sink. after a few babies and lots of expensive tubs, this is by far the best!	
1. 	I purchased this potty strickly on the customer ratings and was not disappointed. It's very sturdy, enough so that even my husband can use it as a seat when sitting with our daughter. All parts are very easy to clean. I started her training at 15 months, just by keeping her potty in the bathroom and having her sit on it (with her clothes on) every time my husband or I went to the bathroom. She soon got the idea and was sitting on it without a diaper. Because it took so long for her to go, we used the entire unit, but it didn't take long until we started just carrying around the padded seat for her to use on the adult potty. PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WAS WORTH IT, EVEN IF WE'D ONLY GOTTEN THE PADDED SEAT. I bought a second seat from another manufacturer to keep in our other bathroom so we wouldn't have to go up and down stairs to fetch it every time she needed to go, but it isn't NEARLY as nice. The Primo seat isn't just a piece of plastic with a hole in the middle. It's thin and contoured to the shape of a little one's bottm. It fits snugly on the adult potty. It has rubber pads and plastic pegs on the underside to keep it from slipping when she sits down. I also like that either a boy or girl can use it, without extra parts to assemble or disassemble. There's a small rise in the front for boys, but it isn't so high that it gets in the way when the child sits down.Very sturdy, very easy to use and clean. Can't say enough about this product.	
1. 	Works great!  Used it on a 5 hour road trip. Need to pump every 3-4 hours. No problems, very convenient, works great!	
1. 	I like the suction cup base.I've ordered this 2 times now, colors may vary.I've gotten pink both times (I was hoping for blue).But these are disposable, so it wasnt a biggie.	
1. 	This blanket is so soft and keeps my baby feeling secure. Only one is necessary because it adjusts with your baby's growth. My baby is 6 months old and we are still using it just to swaddle her bottom part. (Her arms stay out because she is so long) My baby has always been in the 90th percentile for her weight and off the charts on her heighth and the blanket still worked great for her. I will mention that I've recently noticed a little hole where the wraps are, but it's nothing we can't fix by sewing.	
1. 	I like the look and feel of this gate and the concept that it's a hands-free design for opening, because let's face it--a gate that requires that you use your hands to open is worthless for a mom holding a baby.  It seems to be a pretty solid construction, and for a tension gate, it actually holds pretty well.  Not only does this gate confine pets and babies/toddlers/little kids, it seems to be adult-proof, too.  Every single adult that has come into my house has hesitated at this gate because they couldn't figure it out.  HA!There are definitely some downsides to it, but it has been serving us well as a dog and baby gate for close to two years now.Pros:- Hands-free opening- Clean, simple, solid design- Ability to add extenders which work great for wide hallways (I use one on each side of the gate)- Tension-mount system so it's movable and you don't have to put holes in your walls.Cons:- Beware if you have painted your walls recently (Recent for us was maybe a few months prior).  The rubber grip pads just ripped the paint right off when I released the tension in the holding rods.  I'm not sure if the paint on our walls is cheap or if it's because there are just too many layers of paint or what, but I ripped a large chunk out of the wall upon moving the gate.  So yeah, having to patch that sort of defeated the purpose of avoiding a gate that required mounting hardware.- Pedal can get stuck and become temperamental.  I think this also causes problems with closing.  You should be able to close this easily by just pushing the gate back, but it always sticks in one of the directions and requires more care to close it properly.- I don't know how, but my now almost 21 month-old has managed to open this gate maybe 10 times by now.  She refuses to tell me how and every time I try to watch her try, she acts all helpless and can't open it.  So yeah, she's apparently a step ahead of all our visiting adults who can't open this thing.Despite the fact that she can open it from time to time, I still like this gate and it has really been an important feature in our home.  Even before she was crawling or walking, it was perfect for keeping our two big dogs confined to one side of the house.  If I had to purchase a replacement gate, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these.	
1. 	Hold up for multiple children. Do well in dishwasher in a kid container / rack that we got from Target.	
1. 	I personally love the gummi rail. I bought it 3 years ago and put it on my daughter's crib. It stayed put and protected her crib. When my son was born he used the same crib. He was a chewer. He destroyed everywhere that did not have the gummi rail. He is now 1 1/2 years old and only one part of the rail is starting to come up in the middle. But seeing as it lasted 3 years, for me, it was definitely worth it and I will be buying a second one to fit an entire crib after our third is born.	
1. 	I like this sleepsack.  It's soft, and not too thick and not too thin.  My son sleeps really well in it.	
- 1	These covers were the only ones that I could find that would fit my changing pad (LA Baby 4-sided changing pad). They are made with poor materials, are too thin, stain, and both of mine snagged on my wedding ring every time I would pick up the baby, so there would end up being long strands of terry cloth hanging off of them everywhere. I cut one up and used it as a template to make my own changing pad covers out of old towels, that was the only good thing it did for me.	
1. 	i couldn't make up my mind about which rearseat mirror to get, so i ordered a few at once to try.  this was the winner.  we have a jeep, with the rear facing carseat in the center of the backseat, this was the only mirror i could position off the back drivers side passenger headrest and get a good angle to the middle of the backseat where the carseat was.  the adjustability is great with it, a much better system than the others had, if they had one at all.minus 1 star because i think the mirror could be slightly larger, or slightly magnified.  my eyes aren't that bad off, but you have to look up for a good long second to focus and really get a good look at babies face	
1. 	I also almost didn't buy these sheets because of the reviews on this site, but I couldn't find another brand either, so I picked up two of these in navy.The sheets are a bit on the thin side (they are the thinnest sheets we own for him), but since our son has been sleeping in the bassinet in our room since day one, they are the only sheets he's ever slept on. They are okay sheets that are holding up very well, even through numerous washings. Oh, and they aren't elasticized, but it is so tricky to get them on the bassinet, I have no worries that they will come up (we haven't used the play yard feature yet).By the way, we've been using them all through a hot Colorado summer; if this were winter I would definitly be looking for something softer and cozier.	
1. 	The fridge latch works well. It has stayed on the fridge for the 2 months its been on. My only complaint would be that the little button on the side to keep it from locking has a mind of its own. It doesn't stay put so the fridge isn't always locked. My toddler doesn't seem to get in the fridge much cause he thinks that its always locked. He only wants in there when its open.	
- 1	OK, I got this at my shower, and I thought it was pretty neat. But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box, because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part.  There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist, and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water.  So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that, with no warming.  It looks really nice in my nursery, nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something, but not worth the money to use just like this.  I wouldn't have bought it myself, so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus, I like having my baby used to room temp wipes, because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes, she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit.  She didn't like room temp wipes at first, but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!	
- 1	These clings, just never worked for me.  They ended up clinging together and just never performed as desired.  I would not purchase these again nor recommend them.	
- 1	My baby is only 2 months old (weighs 14 pounds) and the infant insert is already so difficult to use. As a petite woman, it is difficult to lift the baby entirely over my head so that I can slide him inside the infant insert... and when I do, the infant insert keeps folding up or his legs keep getting caught, which requires me to do it over.  I had to do this so many times that my baby even threw up.  It may be easy to put the infants in if they weigh less than 7 pounds because they are small but I had difficulty putting my baby in even when he was a newborn at 8 pounds.	
- 1	Well I did my reviews and this is the first thing I am giving a poor rating to. I went to use it in the car and its awful. Hardly enough suction to do anything. Had to manual pump. I used it for 3 minutes once and now its useless. Don't waste your money.	
- 1	I'm 5 months pregnant and was looking for a body pillow that would help me sleep comfortably on my side as I'm primarily a back sleeper. After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back.  Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams.  I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body.  It did do the job in keeping me sleeping on my side but I just wish it was softer and more comfortable.	
1. 	These storage bottles are great because you can use them to store breast milk or formula. I like making a few bottles at night then later at night as I need them I warm a bottle take storage top off and add a nipple and I am ready to feed my daughter. I love all the avent products because of how easy everything is to use.	
- 1	I have a advanced on the go medela pump which I love, I bought this thinking it might be worthwhile to buy a manual pump that is more portable and less bulky, not needing electric power, adapters, tubings etc...in case I needed to be on the go. I was planning a quick trip to NYC and was hoping to be able to use it quickly, I barely pump out 1 oz when I am usually able to pump 3-4 oz. the handle is awkward.	
1. 	These really are the greatest things ever.  So much easier than getting your little one into all sorts of outerwear every time you need to run an errand.  I purchased it in Stealth.  Highly recommend.	
- 1	Food gets stuck in the masher part, and in the grooves on the bottom.  Also, the product details say it is 'imported' but doesn't list the country of origin.  I should have known that it was made in China.  :(	
1. 	We started using this at about 12 months old. We used the newborn Mustela shampoo prior to 12 months.  We have yet to have a scalp issue with any Mustela shampoo product. Very mild but sudsy.  Does not irritate the eyes.  Our daughter has a habit of trying to drink the bath water but if she gets a gulp she hasn't had any bad reactions to it with the leftover suds!  No plans to switching to another brand anytime soon!	
- 1	My son licks and chews the string so I rinsed it off in the sink. I dried it off and then let it air dry on a towel. Well, wouldn't you know the metal rusted. What an expensive piece of trash! I wish there were a better product, since the other ones are too bulky. Sad about this one!	
1. 	If you question how often you would use a pump (in order justify the expenditure to yourself or a reluctant husband/family member) here's why YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THIS PUMP:You can pump a bottle so that your husband or family member can help you with the numerous night feedings or give you a much needed break to take a nap or go do something for yourself.You can pump a bottle to take on the go in case you are going somewhere you cannot easily breastfeed.If you get mastitis or a clogged milk duct, you will need to pump that breast empty every feeding so that you will heal quickly.  It was so painful for me but this pump gave me much needed relief.When the wonderful time comes that your baby sleeps long stretches at night, you will get engorged.  When you wake up with very full breasts, this pump can quickly relieve you and not risk you decreasing your milk production when they start sleeping through the night.You can pump ahead to freeze your milk in case you get sick and need to take medication that is not good for your baby.  This will prevent you from having to give up unnecessarily on breastfeeding too soon.ALL OF THIS CAN BE DONE SO QUICKLY WITH THE MEDELA BREAST PUMP.  It is the only machine on the market that can accomplish what it does in the amount of time it does and it is worth every penny.  So if you need help in justifying why the expensive machine is worth it, those are a few of my best reasons why I can't live without it and you shouldn't either.	
1. 	bought this as a replacement for my son's first potty seat, this one is much better. not as padded, which means it won't rip open and harbor a bunch of bacteria. my son's old one used to collect urine underneat of it in the plastic part, this one doesn't at all, it's perfect	
1. 	I am surprised that all reviews are not all 5 stars. This sunshade is perfect for my Graco Stroller (Travel System).  I read some reviews that it is too much work, NOT AT ALL. You just tie it to the stroller and that is it. Yes, you have to take it down, but really it only takes 1 minute and that is it! I rather take the time (which really is not much at all) to put it on the stroller and take it down so my son can be protected from the Sun. I am so glad I purchased this. Simple, easy to put on, and your baby IS protected and shaded. :)	
1. 	Initially, we had purchased the Munchkin 6-pack Soft Tipped Infant Spoons and loved them. Once my kiddo got up to three meals a day, we were going through the spoons so fast we were constantly running out. For the same price as the Munchkin spoons, we got 16 of these! They aren't as pretty or quite as sturdy, but they are great. These are smaller so they fit better in his little hand. The colors are wonderful. And with the amount that you get, if you lose one or two, it's no great loss. If we'd started with these, we'd have been fully stocked from the start!	
- 1	This rack turned out to be much, much less useful than I thought it would be. A few reasons for it:1) C-size batteries (really? I thought those were for watches only) which are not included and no adapter, although the base of this rack allows for bigger batteries2) very short rods to hold bottles; barely fit 6 oz bottles3) no way does it hold accessories for 8 bottlesI say, look for something better.	
1. 	I had a HARD time finding a fan like this. I wanted it for our trip to Disney World to keep my 10 month old and four year old cool while at the parks. I believe that this is the only fan that is small enough, battery operated and safe enough that you can use with small children. It amazingly kept them cool in 100 degree weather. The manufacturer was right, the fan is built so that little fingers can't get to the blades which is what my 10 month old tried to do. One thing that would make this fan a lot better is if the neck was more flexible. It does bend to allow you to adjust the direction of the air flow but not enough. Another thing that would improve it would be if the head rotated. I might be asking for too much but as a mom, you tend to think of every possible solution that would make life easier for your child and yourself. It's a great price and pretty durable. I would recommend it.	
- 1	These sleeves are so tight, it is such a hassle to put on.  I'm also not sure that they would really help avoid breaks b/c very little is covered the sleeve.  I prefer to carry my glass bottles in one of the long neck bottle koozies.  They are cheaper, effective, and you can use them for beer once your baby is finished with bottles.	
1. 	this is such a good price for this base. It was easy to assemble and I love how easily it folds to fit in my car.	
- 1	Since the first time I ordered these there have been some changes and none of them for the better. The ones I bought in 2011 are still going strong. The ones I just received are already annoying me.The plastic on the new ones is smoother and less stretchy. This means that not only is it harder to grip the end of the tab, it's even more difficult to get the post into the hole to fasten the closure because the hole doesn't stretch around the post as easily.I'll be putting the newer ones on cabinets that are rarely opened so that I don't have to deal with them very often.Packaging: Previously just a slim box, now the slim box has a cardboard front with a plastic insert inside. Unnecessary and wasteful.Great original product, bad changes. :(	
- 1	The idea of this is really good. It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib. Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it.	
1. 	My 6 month old son was getting too big for his infant tub.  He wanted to be in deeper water. This tub is great.  It is the perfect size for him and yet has plenty of room for him to grow into.  We have only had it for 2 weeks but it has made a big difference in bath time.  He is having fun in the bath again.  The suction cup is a nice feature.  We use it to hang the tub on the side of the shower to drain and dry. Great tub for the price.  Highly recommend.	
- 1	I purchased and returned because it was defective. Even when it was functioning &#34;properly,&#34; I found it not worth the hassle. It took quite a while to cook anything, and it was far easier to just cook it on the stove and mash it up with a masher or fork. Perfect example of our fatuation with gadgets.	
1. 	and was afraid this wouldn't work with the model I had. After some online research I was fairly confident it would and am happy to say it does. It is very different from the original base, but I actually think it is better. Good value for the price.	
1. 	I was really impressed with this product.  Having read some of the other iffy reviews, I wasn't expecting much.  In reality, the mirror is large enough to see not only the baby's face, but also the surroundings.  It mounted very nicely to the side of our Pathfinder headrest, and the tilt mechanism allows for easy angle view.  (Note: You do need a headrest that can lift up so that you can attach the mirror with straps.  If yours is a one-piece construction with the seat back, you won't be able to attach the mirror.  I am out of luck with our other car...  Otherwise, I would have absolutely bought the second mirror.)	
1. 	When I first starting breastfeeding, my daughter couldn't latch onto me.  I still wanted her to get my milk, so I opened the playtex pump that I had put on my registry.  It was WONDERFUL!  My nipples were bleeding and bruised because of trying to nurse, and I was scared to death that the pump would make it worse.  But, it didn't hurt like I thought it would.  It was uncomfortable at first, but breastfeeding is uncomfortable at first too.  Once I got used to the feeling, I didn't even feel it pumping.  I chose this pump over the medela because it worked with the Playtex Nurser System - which were the bottles I had decided to use.ADVANTAGES: 1 - It has a nice carrying case that's fashionable.  It holds everything you need to pump.  The pump itself just unzips out of the bag, so you don't even need to take it out.  There are some extra parts in the bag and it also includes a freezer pack for storing expressed milk.  2 - It has a car adapter, so you can literally take it with you anywhere.  3 - It's comfortable.  4 - The Playtex bottles just screw onto the suction pieces so you don't have to worry about transferring milk.DISADVANTAGES: 1 - After 6 wks of just pumping (I was never able to nurse my daughter), the pump motor starting acting funny.  I was pumping about 6 times a day for a half hour at a time, but the pump is supposed to be capable of everyday use.  It never stopped working, but I was afraid to see what would happen because it was the only way I could express milk.  So, I called Babies R Us even though everything says you can't return personal care items.  They were great.  They switched out just the pump mechanism with a new one, and the second worked well.  I slowed down on my pumping though, so I wasn't using it as much as before.  And I stopped pumping at 12 weeks.  So, the 2nd pump didn't get as much use, but I never had any problems with it.  I would assume that Playtex would do the same as Babies R Us did for me.Overall - an EXCELLENT pump.  I don't have anything to compare it to.  But, it's worth spending the money if you are going to be pumping on an everyday-basis.	
- 1	We had these for about a month and loved them until I tasted my toddlers food. It tastes strongly like plastic when ever we put in any type of food that has fat it it. Like milk, butter, meat etc. Too bad....very disappointed. I did put them in the dishwasher...not sure if that changed them.	
- 1	On recommendation from a friend, and based on so many rave reviews, I registered for the Moby Wrap.  I'm glad I got it as a gift and didn't spend money on it myself.Complicated to figure out/not convenient to use:Putting it on was easy enough to figure out.  As other reviewers mentioned, the long piece of fabric drags on the floor when you are trying to put it on.  When I do finally get it on, it never quite looks as neat as in the photos or videos.  The fabric is more bunched up and twisted by the time I'm done. Taking it off is a chore and a half. And, as others have stated, storing the wrap when not in use is not easy either.I had to watch the instructional video online several times to figure out how to put my baby in, and never really got it down to memory.  This thing is super frustrating, not convenient to use, and I have never successfully used it with my baby.Baby's not comfortable:When I *think* I've figured out how to put my baby in and try to put my baby in the wrap, he hates it, and looks uncomfortable.  But note that I've only tried the newborn hug hold.  I didn't try the regular hug hold because he was too small, and now that he's big enough, I don't even want to bother with the hassle of putting the wrap on because I've moved on to other more convenient to use baby carriers.One size does not fit all:As long as the fabric is, this wrap is still more ideal for people who are of smaller build.  I am 5'3, and postpartum currently about a size 12.  I can get the wrap around me once, just barely (it'd be better if I could do an extra wrap around my waist, but I'm currently too big for that).  Right after birth it was worse.  I could only knot in the back, I couldn't even bring it around to the front even one time to knot it in the front.  I don't see how an average man could wear this wrap.  I'm not sure if my husband would be able to put this on-- not that he would ever have the patience to.In terms of a wrap type carrier, I much prefer to use a Mei Tai style carrier-- it's much easier to put on, and my baby prefers it as well.	
1. 	if you use avent bottles, this is soooo convenient :) I highly recommend this product, I can pump directly to my PES bottles.	
- 1	I wanted to like this bottle but using it was a nightmare. It leaked all over the place, from every seam, no matter what position it was in. I thought I was going crazy. Who would make a bottle this poor in quality and at this high cost per piece? I asked my iron man of a husband (6'4 and a professional firefighter) to tighten all parts to make sure I wasn't going weak and it still leaked everywhere. My mom tried it too, but formula dribbled horribly, even with the warming cap still on the bottom. Once its off, just go ahead and get your mop out. Geez Louise. We never actually fed our newborn son with the bottle, so I cannot even comment on his acceptance or rejection of the nipple. I would give it ZERO stars if that were a rating option. Very disappointing, especially at this price.	
- 1	I am so surprised by all the good reviews for this swing!I think it's terrible. First off, it's HUGE and there is no easy way to move it around. So you won't be moving it into a quieter room or taking it to Grandma's. Second, the mobile is too bland for the baby to see and enjoy, there's a reason why most baby toys are neon plastic, because neutral colors do not excite the baby. No baby will be entertained by the three brown birdies on the mobile, the mirror helps, but bright contrasting colors really keep baby happy. Third, it's hard to get the baby in there! The giant mobile and controls sit right above the  cradle and you have to maneuver the sleeping baby into the cradle and it often wakes them up. You can get a compact portable swing that will do the same thing and your baby will like it just the same.	
- 1	I got this as a shower gift. The first time I used the tub my baby kept slipping around in the tub. She wound up sideways in it during the entire bath and I never used it again. I would just as soon put her into the bathtub and put a couple of inches of water into the tub and bathe my baby that way rather than put her into this contraption. I am a RN and quite used to giving baths in different settings so it is not inexperience talking here. I currently put her on the safer bather (read my review) or put her in the tub alone. Baby loves bathtime and is 6 months old.Lets just say that this tub is downstairs with the rest of the lawnsale stuff for this year.....	
1. 	Perfect! Folds up easily and I take it everywhere. Even use it in my own back yard.	
- 1	This product really doesn't seem safe.  Our 10 day old daughter is not that strong yet and managed to pull it over her face within minutes.  We tried tucking the neckline under a bit but she wa able to squirm her arms so much under the fabric that it hardly seemed worth it, she was able to wake herself up AND then get more and more mad at being contained.  Too bad, because the zipper seemed like a nice, easy alternative to bulky blankets.	
- 1	My son never liked pacifiers. He is bottle fed and for some reason, I thought he might take to this. He didn't use it the way I placed it in his mouth, he just took it out and munched on the sides. It didn't occupy him long. All babies are different, and I suppose my little one just prefers to chew on sticks, plastic, & other hard solid objects. It's a great idea, but it didn't work out for me.	
1. 	When we first had our baby we were living in an apartment that did not have a dishwasher.  It was a PAIN to have to sterilize in boiling water, so we bought this.  WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!!  I was able to sterilize a few bottles, nipples, pacifiers etc at a time, right in the microwave.  I don't know how I lived without it!  Now that we own a home and have a dishwasher I no longer use it, but it is GREAT if you do not have a dishwasher!	
- 1	These clings, just never worked for me.  They ended up clinging together and just never performed as desired.  I would not purchase these again nor recommend them.	
1. 	I have two of these.  One in black (onyx) and one in brown (huntington).  Most of the britax's are plush (fuzzy and hot).  The onyx is better than most.  The huntington is cozy but I do find it a little hot.  We just got a new suv that has rear air so the hotness is not quite a problem now.  With the rear air I will probably not get a replacement cover that is cooler.  In my other suv which was a darker color and did not have rear air I probably would have gotten another onyx cover.  The onyx has a little plushness on it but mostly it is smooth (once you take out the extra padding for small babies).Overall a great seat.  Probably better than any other but it's not perfect.  The side-impact protection seems flimsy and I could see that it might break easily (which is mentioned in other reviews).  And some people rave about the straps.  I find they get twisted up pretty frequently.  And I dont like the tightening mechanism.  It is difficult to pull.  The ratcheting action is not as easy to use as the smooth pull that I loved on my infant graco safeseat.But I do feel that my child is safe.  Installation with the latch system is pretty easy.  Installation with a seat belt is quite difficult and will likely require 2 people to get it tight enough.  I can put in the seat with latch and tether in probably 5-7 minutes.  Not something you'd want to do everyday but not too bad.  I really like the tether.  It adds alot of stability.Note: I am using this seat rear facing, center seat, in a Toyota Sequoia for a 22 pound 19 month old.	
1. 	I haven't tried this with my newborn yet, but I used this sling ALL THE TIME with my other baby!  I had my last two babies close together (13 months apart), and toward the end was stuck with a baby who couldn't walk while I was in my very uncomfortable third trimester.  This sling was a LIFESAVER.  It has enough length/slack that I could put my baby in (she was about 10 months the first time I used it)and adjust the sling so that she was not sitting right on my stomach. It's also VERY easy to get on and off, especially off.  Removing a baby sling, whether a baby is in it or not, seems to always be the hard part.  This sling comes off easy as a wink, and if you have your baby in it, it's just as easy.  The padded shoulder is also a very nice perk, and it pads nicely without adding a lot of bulk.I am looking forward to using this sling again, and will be getting on the maker's website soon to see how to carry my newborn in it safely. I'd absolutely recommend it to a mom needing a sling.  I've tried several different styles and brands, and this is so far my favorite!	
- 1	I measured 8 ounces in a measuring cup, then poured it in the liner, and it was a little below the 8 ounces mark on the liner. I tried it again with a different measuring cup and received the same result. You can not put the liner in the bottle first to fill it up, because the measurements on the bottle do not match up with the measurements on the liners, My husband always has a hard time filling up the liners because it is hard to hold it and add water since they expand. Also, the numbers on the liner are very hard to read.	
- 1	I love the design, idea, and feel of this cup BUT.....it leaks like crazy!! My son 1 & 1/2 loves drinking out of a straw so when i found this I was excited to get it and it work for one day then the next day the fluid just keep leaking out of the straw even if the cup is sitting on the table. We found out that the air builds up and then it pushes the liquid out so you have to constantly release the air pressure in the straw and it's a pain to keep checking the cup to make sure it's not leaking so as we all know messy cups and not fun to keep cleaning up after! I would not recommend this cup!	
- 1	I really wanted to like this product but it's just way too long for my 6 month old (who is in the 95th percentile for height). She moves and rolls around a lot in bed and I can imagine the excess fabric getting caught up. But otherwise it's a lovely fabric. I still find it hard to understand how you can dress your baby in wool in Summer and Winter. I know I definitely wouldn't want a woolen sheet/blanket on top of me in Summer.	
1. 	I transitioned my daughter from the potty to the regular toilet.  I wanted something that would draw her attention to make her want to sit on it and this seat did it.  Day1 I thought she would be scared but she said &#34;Dora&#34;!  And sat on it with no fight.  Great seat!	
1. 	Love this bib!  Great for catching crumbs and puke (ich, I know, but this has saved me from cleaning high chair straps many, many times!).	
- 1	The pillow is nice and fluffy. My biggest problem with it is the seam by the neck area (as previously pointed out by others also). The seam digs into my neck/shoulder which makes it uncomfortable during sleep. I like that it's just about my body length - I'm 5-ft tall. However, I do wish that the seam were maybe stretchy or more contoured - more comfortable. I honestly barely use the pillow. I only use it to lean on when I'm sitting on the bed. It gives great cushion for the back while seated.	
1. 	For those of us with long gaps between children this is a great invention from having to twist your body around to check on your child.Yes pulling over would be something that every cop would tell you to do. But honestly how many of us would. This little device lets you see your child while also checking out normal driving conditions such as how close someone is behind you or if you have room to move over. Common sense should always prevail over any product but this is a helpful tool for moms on the go.	
- 1	I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco.	
- 1	UPDATE: My horrible experience with this dresser keeps getting worse. Just when I thought my saga was over...... I got my phone bill. The area code for customer service was 604 which we called quite a few times over this issue. Turns out that is located in CANADA so now we owe $15 in long distance charges to a crappy company that never helped us. DO NOT BUY!!!We had bought the matching crib so it made sense to buy this dresser. We should have be warned when part of the crib also arrived broken. It took two hours to put this dresser together, which was not a big deal.... but when we lifted it to put it in place, both sides crumbled away from the screws in the center. We were so disappointed. We called customer service at Stork to see if they would send us another. We got a run around with several rude people answering the phone. They seemed angry that we didn't know the manufacture date, when in fact, that section on the label on the item was left blank! They told us we had to send pictures of the damage so they could determine if it was our fault or their fault. We sent the email several times and it always bounced. We called them and they verified the email address. We tried again a few days later and it still bounced. We called back and they told us to just keep on trying to email them since their email system had been down. At seven months pregnant I dont have the time or energy to keep chasing this. I got in touch with Amazon and they are going to send UPS to come pick it up. They swore we don't have to take it apart so we will see how that goes. Can't wait to get my money back.	
- 1	I bought a couple of the Halo 100% organic cotton for my son when he was under 1yr old and the worked fine. Too bad Halo do not make these walker 100% cotton. These are not breathable for my sweaty toddler. They do not work for him :(	
- 1	Just as everyone says:Cons:-There are three temperature settings but the instructions really only tell you to use the highest one. What's the point of the three then?-There's no on/off switch, you have to unplug it to turn it off. And when you have a hungry crying baby sometimes you even forget until you smell it burning all the water to nothing.-There is NO AUTO SHUT OFF. This means that if you don't unplug it after you're done it'll evaporate the water and could burn out. This is our biggest compliant by far.This was just a horrible bottle warmer, Dr. Brown's is so much more amazing and my #1 choice.	
- 1	As plates, they're just fine. The 4th compartment is miniscule and not really useful. The main reason I gave it two stars is because they don't stack flush in the cupboard. So while they're fine for eating, they're terrible to store. I can only stack them 6 high before running out of space.	
1. 	cute cot and easy to set up. has a washable cover too.	
- 1	We are on our second one; the first one the charger didn't work but they quickly sent us a new one. The second one we have now has separated the button part where you change the colors and turn it on is floating around inside the elephant and cannot be fixed. Don't press the button too hard or it will sink in; never to be retrieved. We have only had this item for about a month.	
- 1	I really wish these wipes are what they are advertised to be, but to me they are just regular natural wipes packed for Medela and with a ridiculously high price.	
1. 	Once you get used to this, you can operate it with one hand in the dark. That's a definite bonus with a commode seat lock!	
1. 	The free one we got from the hospital at delivery final wore out and I was looking for a replacement. This one is perfect! Holds two large DrBrowns bottles. Definitely recommend	
- 1	I can't really comment on the product itself as I never got to use it, but I do highly recommend not to buy from Dorel Juvenile Group.  After waiting for over two weeks for the delivery, I gave up and went to a nearby store and bought another walker.  It never occured to me that Dorel Juvenile Group may not accept returns (I did not see anything indicating this at the time of the purchase).  We had sort of a fight over email, and they finally agreed to accept the return, but guess what?  It's been three months now since I sent the item back to them, and they never returned the money.  When I contacted them, they claimed they never received it...	
- 1	We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great...for 24 hours.  Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying.  To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted.  My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static.  Don't waste your money - buy another one.	
1. 	I bought the fisher price on-the-go potty first because there were a few negative reviews about the much smaller potette (claims that it collapses, is flimsy, hard to use, too small, etc.)and the FP had a higher star rating. I later bought the potette for a trip and am so very glad I did! When it comes to travel it is FAR SUPERIOR than the big, bulky Fisher price travel potty!The potette is very sturdy if you set it up correctly. You have to click the legs into place. If you set it up without them snapping into place - of course it will be wobbly and possibly collapse! It was set up wrong! When clicked into place the legs are super sturdy and the potette will hold up to 50 pounds. My daughter is 3 and weighs 36 pounds. She had no problems at all using this and I anticipate she will be able to use it till at least kindergarten. I don't get the previous comments about it being too small - perhaps if you have big, big kids it might be too small, but otherwise it's just fine!We recently went on a cruise from Puerto Rico through the Southern Caribbean and this potty was a life-saver!! We went to many national monuments, botanical gardens, a volcano and other outdoor excursions where there were either NO public toilets, or they were super gross hole in the ground toilets. The pottette was the perfect solution in those situations! It is small and lightweight, so it fits in your purse or pack, sets up quick and stays clean. disposal of the used bags is easy because they have absorbent pads inside and you can tie them securely so that they won't make any messes until you find a trash can. The potette has a thick plastic bag it comes in, so you can even stick the used bag inside that with the potette till you find a trash.A comparison between the Fisher-price on-the-go potty and the Potette:This Fisher price one is big and sturdy, has it's own case, you can use plastic grocery bags or trash bags in it, etc. and it's great for keeping in the car for kid potty stop emergencies. However, it is pretty bulky and would not be handy for any walking, hiking type excursions (I'm talking about walks and hikes in places where it would be inappropriate to let them potty in the grass/nature areas & where public toilets are either absent or gross).The potette however, is perfect for such things - it's much smaller & lightweight, has handy bags with absorbent pads, and comes in it's own little bag. The pottette is maybe 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick and 7x7 inches when folded into its bag - easy to stick in your backpack or even a bigger purse. The Fisher price on-the-go potty is significantly bigger! When folded up into it's case it is about 12-14 by 12-14 inches in size and 5-6 inches thick. Won't fit in a purse at all, and would take up a lot of space in a backpack or suitcase if traveling. It does come with it's own handle and shoulder strap, but why lug such a big thing around when the potette will fit directly into your purse or pack? And the potette doesn't weigh anything at all while the fisher price might add an extra pound or two to your load.If you're a stick to town & always use a stroller type person, the Fisher price may be great for you. If you're more of an active, get out and about, carry light & no stroller type the pottete is a much better choice for you. If you're a traveler the pottete is absolutely the best choice!TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The FP potty-on-the-go is great for in your car and people who stick around town, but buy the potette for travel when it would be better to carry a lightweight kiddie potty on your person wherever you may go!	
- 1	This product was well reviewed, so we tried it. There were 3 in the packet and the first one we tried did not even warm up, so I am not sure what happened. On top of that, it was impossible to fit over our Doc Brown's bottle. Granted, we use the larger  Doc Brown's bottle, but when doing our research, it said it would fit it.Unfortunately, even if we did received a def heat pack, the difficultly we had with putting it over the bottle is a deal breaker, so I would not recommend it	
- 1	I wanted to like this but it's going back. I already have a Foscam monitor for my older child but I wanted one that I could have a separate handset for my baby. This monitor does not work well for us. The night vision, while it allows you to see the baby just fine, tries to compensate constantly causing the monitor to flash every few seconds. This is very disturbing to a light sleeper. Additionally, if you use the VOX with the sound on, the monitor beeps every time it detects movement.Another note on the VOX is it is useless if you use a loudish fan like we do. We use the fan to help drown out noise in our baby's room but this fan sets off the sensor leaving the monitor on or beeping on every few seconds.My baby's room is next to mine and I still constantly get the &#34;out of range&#34; notification. If you use a cell phone near it, forget it.  I like the idea of the magnetic base but it does not seem to function as it's supposed to. Throughout the night, it would shift slightly and make it so that I couldn't see my baby at all. I would prefer if it had an attached base and even better, remote tilt/pan feature.Some positives: I actually do like the lullaby feature. However, I can use my iPod with the same effect.  I also appreciate the nightlight since my baby still wakes throughout the night and it's nice to be able to see without turning any lights on. Again, this can easily be achieved with a nightlight.Unfortunately, I am sending this monitor back and going back to my trusted Foscam.	
- 1	My 1.5 yr old son loves this cup.  For whatever reason, he sees it an always wants to drink from it.  But it takes him about 3x as much time and effort to get anything out of it so he eventually just gets sick of it and quits.  It's too leakproof for its own good	
- 1	Wish i could return this item. Not useful at all. Waste of my money. Doesn't even fit in my car lighter	
- 1	Ugh, where do I start? The thing is complete crap. The suction cups stick for about 5 seconds, and since it's designed in flaps to fold up, not only does it unstick, the different sections actually flip straight up onto the plate. The pocket doesn't catch much food because it is angled *towards the table* instead of towards the kid. The texture is hard to clean, it's also bulky. I couldn't imagine toting this around to restaurants, those sticky plastic ones with the graphics are cheaper, disposable, and honestly much more convenient. I'm now still in search of a GOOD toddler placemat!	
1. 	These plugs are easy to use and do the job.  The new fangled products look like a pain and are probably no more effective than these.  These are a good value for your money and you don't have to waste precious time figuring out how they work and how you are going to install them!!	
1. 	Hands-down one of the best purchases we made.  My son fell in love with this around age 6 months and still plays with it at 1 1/2.  The music is lovely and it teaches kids cause and effect, and then how to combine melodies.  A really fantastic gift.	
1. 	I like these for several reasons.  The low price for a large supply.  The opaque color that blends with outlet color.  The quality of the plastic is sturdy but still flexible.	
- 1	I can't comment on the carrier itself. I honestly was disgusted I actually touched what was sent to me. I ordered the gray and white mesh- and sent to me was a very used black bjorn. I'm allergic to cats and the item was covered in dog or cat hair. This product is for my 8 week old son, I would never have purchased this if I knew it was gross and used!And yes- I ordered the new Bjorn Mesh, prime (which of course was on time). Not happy.	
1. 	Not as soft as the fleece ones I usually use, but at least they're all cotton. When I'm especially leaky, I do have to swap these out for fresh ones now and then, as they get rather damp.	
1. 	These do a good job keeping me dry during the day, but constantly move around at night, which is when I really need them.	
1. 	Simple and good. Difficult for little fingers to remove and, perhaps more importantly, they don't attract his attention because they are small and neutrally colors.	
1. 	I don't know what I would do w/o this, my baby can kick out of her button-down-the-leg-pjs let alone blankets, but this solves that! This offers peace of mind in knowing that your baby is sleeping warmly and safely inside this cozy wearable blanket.  I only got size medium because my baby was born in the summer (and born small) so her room wasn't as cold, AND newborns stay swaddled anyway--thus I think medium is a very versatile size and makes size small almost obsolete.  I will buy a larger size when she finally outgrows the Med, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  You and your baby simply can't live or sleep w/o this product!	
- 1	This montior does work well. I can hear my son breathing, and dogs barking and all of that very clearly. It works outside, upstairs and down. The problem is that I am spending a small fortune in batteries. When you plug it in it gets all fuzzy and has this terrible buzzing sound. I have tried both monitors and all the plugs in the house. So I have to replace the battery every day to use it through the whole night and that gets pretty expensive.	
1. 	I thought baby bottles were pretty basic, but the improvements Playtex has made do seem to make a difference.  When Sarah, my daughter, recently gave birth, she received an earful of advice from well-meaning friends and relatives who were also new moms.  Many used and recommended Playtex VentAire baby bottles.  Sarah listened, starting out with the newborn bottle gift set (wide bottles).  The newborn set includes two type nipples (slow or fast).  Baby eagerly accepts both bottle or breast.Of course, that wasn't the only advice that went along with these bottles.  Sarah was warned they might leak if improperly tightened (don't overdo the bottoms), or if the pieces were wet while assembling (particularly the vent area).  She has never put them in the dishwasher (more motherly advice) even though Playtex information says pieces are top-rack dishwasher safe.  As a result, the bottles work well and baby rarely has spit-up, burping or gas problems.  Mom and baby are happy.	
- 1	We have been using these for 8 months now and I've still bought Plum pouches when I don't have the time to clean and fill these pouches.  Its as if the company didn't product test or put it before a panel of their target market prior to putting them on the shelf. Main problems:- The creases of the pouch on the bottom get food stuck in them and its almost impossible to get the gunk out. It does say dishwasher safe, however, it is impossible to get clean with a dishwasher since the opening on the top is so small.- The zipper lock at the top will get food stuck in it and will mold as well. I've scrubbed like crazy and still can get it out.- The spout placement also creates a little pocket where food gets trapped and the pouch can fold on itself in such a way making it hard to suck from.- I could spend about 10 minutes rinsing and scrubbing just one pouch- filling them is difficult because they are hard to stand up on the counter and pour your contents in while keeping the small top open. The company says to spoon in, however, the opening is so small that a spoon full of food scraps off on the opening.  They also say to put your food in a pitcher and pour in but if anyone is familiar with baby food, it isn't liquid. Blended peas don't pour.  So picture trying to stand up this light weight pouch on its own on the counter while you have a pitcher of food that doesn't pour so you have to give the food a push with the spoon meanwhile holding the pouch up from falling over as the food falls in and keeping the top open big enough. 1 hand pitcher, 1 hand spoon, 1 hand pouch?Next time I think we will try the throw away pouches...UPDATE: A representative from little green pouch contacted me to help with my situation which I thought was great customer service, no one wants a negative review on Amazon, right?... So she sent me a scrub brush that they recommend to get into the creases, a pitcher and a pack of the newest pouches, which is really generous.  I would LOVE to say that it all worked out and now I love the pouches but I would be totally lying. The special scrub brush they sent broke first use. It's also L shaped and swiveled in the middle making it difficult to push that brush and scrub the creases. The pitcher had a long slender little spout which is great for liquid but not baby food, so that didn't work either.  The upside is that the material on the newer pouches with the tabs on the top are alot more durable than the ones I bought a year ago.Sorry it had to be this way little pouch but you need to go back to the drawing board and TEST your product or I'll come out with something better.  Your product could be great with a bit more love.	
1. 	I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.	
1. 	My son loves the Woombie.  My daughter loved the Miracle Blanket.  As a parent that has now used two of the most popular baby swaddlers, here are some pros and cons of each.Woombie - We used the Houdini woombie in pool party and in vanilla crea (have one of each) and one Original Woombie in Raspberry color.Pros:Allows the hands to be across the chest or up near the face - this was the main reason my son hated the Miracle Blanket and loves the WoombieSnug - I haven't really noticed a difference between the Original and the Houdini versions although the Houdini is supposed to be a slightly firmer swaddle.  Both are snug.Nice colors - All the colors we have are nice.  None have faded or bled in the wash.Cons:The Big Baby and Mega Baby sizes are too long.  There is so much excess fabric that hangs down.  My two year old can still fit in the Mega Baby size, lengthwise, because it is sooo long.Does stretch out after many uses.  You can fix that by tossing in the washer and then tumble dry.  (It says line dry but who has time for that?  We've always tumbled dry with no problems.)Fingers can creep out the top and scratch the face.  He's never managed to get anything more than his fingers out, but just a warning that it can happen.**Biggest con - You have to keep buying bigger sizes if you want to continue to use it as they grow.  If you buy two in each size (so that you'll always have one handy if one is in the wash), then that's over one hundred dollars in swaddle blankets.  Yikes!!**Hard to use if you need to put baby someplace with straps - like a bouncy seat or swingTerrible return policy from Woombie - only unused and unwashed are accepted for returns with a 15% restocking fee!!The Miracle Blanket - We have two - one in pink and one in blue.  We used these with my daughter until she rolled over from back to front, at about eight/nine months old.Pros:Fits any size baby.  It's a super long wrap, so there's no way that your baby will ever be too big to fit width-wise.  Lengthwise our daughter outgrew it around four months.  Then we just stopped putting her feet in the pouch but keep wrapping her arms.  Still worked great!!  Also if you leave the feet out, it's easy to put the baby someplace with a three point harness like a bouncy seat or a swing.Can only purchase two and lasts until you need to stop swaddling!Colors are nice - never faded or bled in wash.**Best pro** - Miracle Blanket has amazing customer service.  One of ours got a hole in it after three months of use.  Miracle Blanket replaced it free of charge, not even charging for shipping the new blanket or return shipping.  Doesn't matter where you bought it - they will replace it for you and fix the old one and donate to kids in need.  AWESOME!Cons:Learning curve - Babysitters and grandma had an extremely hard time learning how to use this.  The first time, despite a demonstration before we left, our babysitter put it on our daughter upside down so that the foot pouch was like a little hood!The blanket has a weakness where the foot pouch is sewn onto the main piece.  After much use, it develops a hole from being pulled on by baby kicking or moving the feet in and out of the pouch.  Both our blankets developed one.  We had Miracle Blanket replace one, but decided to just keep going with the other one.  The hole never got bigger that the radius of a straw but it's definitely a weakness in the fabric.Hands are down by the side - This was what our daughter liked, but our son hated it, so I guess it could be a pro or a con.Overall, I would recommend either.  You just have to think about what your baby likes.  I think the Miracle Blanket is better for a baby who really needs a firm swaddle with very little movement.  The Woombie is for babies who like their hands up.  Our daughter, who required a firm swaddle, just couldn't handle the amount of movement the Woombie allowed.  She needed much more restriction.  Our son prefers the freedom to arrange his arms around his chest or thighs as he likes.  If you want to try one, start with the Miracle Blanket first since their return policy is better.  If Woombie would change theirs, I would equally recommend them.	
1. 	My brother and his family are a very green family!  They loved this gift.  They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!  My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's green test!  YAY!  I recommend this gift!	
- 1	I returned these snack cups because I didn't like the lids. I bought these for my son when he was 11 months old, and I thought the plastic was a bit rough for his hands. I found another snack cup with a fabric opening that I liked better.	
1. 	Perfect clutch toy.  It was one of my baby's first teethers and perfect because she could hold onto the round shape easily.  One side is solid wood and the colorful part is made of pieces that fit tightly together.  The change in texture was very interesting to the baby and the colors fun to look at.  The two loose blue circles move around and when baby shakes the toy, they clack satisfyingly.  It's perfect simplicity.  She played with it for a long time and it has been a favorite.  Held up beautifully.  A quality toy and I like that it's wood.	
1. 	We got this wipe warmer from my aunt for a shower gift. We had a different warmer on our registry. I read all the reviews for this warmer and returned the one we wanted originally. I couldn't be happier with this warmer. Yes, water does gather on the lid, but runs down the inside of the warmer, thus rewetting the pad in the bottom of the warmer that keeps the wipes from drying out. Zac doesn't get a surprise with a cold wipe and we don't get a surprise from, well, those surprises boys &quot;spring&quot;  on you! This is a must have and I recommeded it to many expectant mothers I know!	
1. 	Those big plastic tubs took up my whole bathroom and were hard to store. I LOVE this bath mat. It is so easy to use and store. It is soft and my baby loves laying on it.  When you are done with the bath, just squeeze the water out and hang it on the shower head to dry. Done and out of the way.	
- 1	Don't waste your money	
1. 	We have tried all types of swaddle blankets from simple folder it up yourself types, to swaddleme, to this.  This blanket does a particularly good job at straitjacketing our son so that he doesn't get that little bit of movement, which ultimately turns into pulling a Houdini.  As he got to around 3 months, he started to kick at the bottom and would catch the seam, and ultimately get his legs out and work the blanket up around his head.. so we don't use it anymore  I wish that seam wasn't there, because otherwise he would probably not escape without it.  Regardless, we got a lot of good use out of these blankets.	
1. 	This is the best thing I've found in a long time.  I tried one of those cheap sponge things from [a store], and it just mildewed and was disgusting after a VERY short period of time.  I went to babiesrus which is where I should have gone in the FIRST place and there this was.  The last one too!  Boy, I just don't know what I would have done without it. Especially for a first baby and you're nervous about bathing anyway.  This thing keeps the baby warm, snug and safe in the baby tub or sink.  It just is a great thing and the baby loves it!  I try to buy one for every baby shower now but they usually run out at babies rus!  Great, great item!  One of the BEST parts is that it's WASHABLE!	
- 1	I hate these. I much prefer the  NUK shields.  These don't stick, they slide around all over the place and are really hard for the baby to use.  It got SO messy feeding my baby with these, I felt like it wasted milk because it got everywhere.  Hated these.  The NUK ones are so much better and the nipple part is exactly the same shape, but the silicone is softer for baby and sticks better to mommy!!	
1. 	I think the worst part of safty shopping is for the gates. So many out there boast that they are the best; so I started to read customer reviews. We were moving into a two-story house and needed a great pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs. First I got the hands free one from I think it was safty 1st, with the pedal at the bottom...my daughter figured out how to open it, so it had to be returned! After a few more misses, I bought this one and I love it! The opening is wide, but not too wide. I am a bigger person, and I have no problems getting through this gate with child in tow! It works perfectly in our home and I am completely pleased with it!	
1. 	These are replacement parts for the memranes that come with your Medela pump. It's recommended that with everyday use you replace your membranes every 3 months or so. The membranes wear out, get tiny tears, and warp so they don't make a complete seal.	
1. 	A lot of the reviews of this product here are very good and have good ideas about mounting the gate.  I am really surprised that one key piece of information is missing from all of them.  This gate does not come with screws to mount this on a wall with dry wall - even WITH a stud behind it.  A one reviewer mentioned the directions themselves say that the screws included are meant for mounting this gate directly into wood.  However, they go on to talk about mounting this into a stud behind dry wall.  The screws included are 3/4 long at most.  Dry wall is 1/2 thick on most interior walls.  Add the bracket to that and the screws that come with the product will not even hit the stud even if you do mount it over one.  The fix is easy:  Go get #6 screws that are 1 to 1.25 long.  But can I just point out how friggin annoying that is?  COME ON KIDCO!!!  That is just ridiculous.  90% of customers are going to be mounting this into normal walls with drywall on it.  That said, the gate is very sturdy and of high quality.  I was in a situation where I did not have studs that directly oppose one another on the walls I was mounting it to.  If that is the case, put the hinge side on the stud.  Contrary to the other reviewer, Toggle bolts should be sufficient to hold the latch brackets in place and be quite safe - as long as the hinge side is in a stud.  Ironically, most of the reviewers here probably used the boxed hardware and are not mounted into a stud at all but find the gate to be quite secure anyway.  one final thing to keep in mind is that the bottom brackets are all the way at the bottom of the gate.  If you have a rather tall floor molding that does not have at least a 2 flat surface for you to mount the lower brackets on, this gate may not work for you because it will be mounted too high.  My molding is 4.25 off the ground and is not as safe as I would like it to be.  As my daughter gets older it will be less of a problem but this is definitely something to consider before purchasing.4/5 for not including the standard hardware needed to mount this gate.  Really dumb Kidco.  You can do better.	
- 1	This is shit!! I return it. It doesn't fit my spout at all. Way way too small. I found no way to put it into my spout. Return it and I need to pay for the shipping. Regret x 10000000.	
- 1	The first negative is that this potty is cheaply made in China using low grade plastic. Ours came with cracks already in the plastic where the two halves join. Not enough to ruin the potty, but enough to suggest it won't last long and wasn't made with quality in mind.By far the worst thing about this, however, is the extremely poor design choice to join the two halves (the colored top and white bottom piece) with the seam open UPWARDS. (Look closely at the piectures and you'll see what I mean.) Think about it: you've got a potty made for kids who are just learning to use one, and you design it so that any liquid that spills on the outside will get trapped in a tiny seam that you can't separate? Brilliant. The two halves aren't designed to come apart to clean it. Good luck getting urine completely out of this unless your kid is some sort of urinary genius that never has a miss. You'll need to spray it down in the bathtub to get everything out of the joint between the two plastic parts. We've had two other pottys, and neither was so poorly designed as to have that problem. I recommend the Baby Bjorn, the potty we used with our first-born, but pretty much any other company you choose will probably sell a better one than this. The Bjorn, for example, is made with a one base piece, and no parts have difficult to clean crevices.I'd think you would have to try hard to screw up the engineering of a piece of plastic to pee in, and yet Prince Lionheart has managed to. Royally.	
1. 	This is a great product, works as advertised, but is pretty slow heating.  This product works best if you're going out with a cold bottle and know when you're going to feed your child.  For example, our town is 25-30 minutes away, so we start warming the bottle in the car on the way to town so that it is finally ready once we get to our destination.	
1. 	I had one of these and bought a second one. It is easy to clean and a comfortable seat for my 2 year old and 4 year old. Sometimes when I remove the seat from the chair and place it on the floor my daughter we go take a seat in it on the floor and read a book. I bought 2 green ones so I wouldn't have constant arguments over who got which color. The seat does show some discoloration from crumbs and food that were left behind and not wiped away immediately. the seat part is a little porous but the sides are smooth and easy to wipes clean.	
1. 	We love this chair. Our 18 month old daughter has been using it since she was 5 months old. We bring it with us everywhere, and we use it at home all the time. I didn't think it was that much of a novelty, but literally every where we take it, people comment on how neat it is! It stays hooked to our home table until we go out to eat. We use it with a Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, which has a handy trough that fills in the small gap between the chair and the table.Best things:*No germy public high chairs! The times I forgot her Chicco chair, I've used baby wipes on the public chairs and YUK!*The chair is familiar to her even in unfamiliar environments. Because she got used to using table manners at home, she knows how to behave at restaurants.*We love it because she sits right at the table with us instead of in a high chair next to the table. She is a great eater, and I think part of it may be that she's always been a part of our meals together, just another person at the table.*Compact--We had a small kitchen in our previous house, and a typical high chair would make things pretty tight. This is easy to clean around/under because it's part of the table. This also folds down super small for travel, whether right down the street or on a long trip.*Easy to fold, unfold, and attach.*Easy to clean and quick to dry. Ours gets pretty funky pretty fast, so we're always cleaning it with a scrub sponge and some dish/hand soap. It still looks like new after much abuse!*Inexpensive--try it! What have you got to lose? If you buy some big high chair and it ends up not working out, you're out $100!Cons:*There aren't many, but one would be that there is no tray to catch spills. Our daugher learned not to spill quickly, probably because it ended up all over her every time. So maybe this is a pro?!*Tips flimsy tables in some restaurants. We have had to put a chair under her and a couple of times, not use it at all. This got to be more of an issue when she got bigger.In response to other reviewers, we have no trouble fitting it to our large table, with multiple leaf inserts and a wide skirt. We have only had it not fit 2 other tables at restaurants. I don't think it's heavy, and I'm kind of a wimp. I never take it apart to wash, I just stick it in the sink and scrub it off with a sponge. I don't find the harness an issue because I never use it. I don't have the kind of child who will agree to be harnessed into a chair when she is ready to get up. If she wants up, we get up! This is why I am shopping for a booster seat now--I take my child's constant getting up out of this seat as a cue that she has outgrown it, not physically, but ability-wise, and don't think Chicco installing a 5 point harness on the chair would change that.	
- 1	The lids are so hard to screw on straight. You think they are on tight, then when you hold them up at eye level you will often find that they are on crooked. Also when you twist the lid open or closed, it is hard to get a good grip because the gripping area is very thin.They are expensive too, a total waste of money. Who wants a disposable system where you have to keep (and wash) the lids?	
1. 	This bath pad is perfect for bathing a newborn. It dries easily and is convenient to store (there's a hook for you to hang the bath pad). It is thick and soft and feels comfy. I did put this in the washing machine, which I shouldn't have because after that one time machine wash, it started showing wear as if the bath pad has been used for a long time.	
1. 	Great delivery time! I choose this pillow over boppy every time because of the straps it has for baby to be secure, it's multifunctional.	
1. 	I bought this to clean my son's straw sippy cups.  They are perfect, I just wish they were a tad longer.  I know that these are made specifically for Dr. Brown's bottles, but I have yet to find them made by anyother brand.	
1. 	These nipples worked perfectly and wore well.  Easy to use and easy to clean.  Never developed any stains either.  It helped that they came in different sizes for varied flow.	
- 1	If you're a first time mom you're probably going to want a bottle sterilizer.  They're suppose to be fast and convenient as opposed to the tedious process of boiling your baby's bottles and pacifiers in water for five minutes.  The reality is, a sterilizer really isn't necessary.  It can be nice to have one, but you don't NEED it.If you do decide that you want a sterilizer, I would not recommend this one.  For one, it's a pricey sterilizer which you will have to store somewhere.  I find the contraption to be rather bulky.  Even with ample countertop space in my kitchen, I'm not willing to sacrifice the amount of space that this sterilizer takes up.  As big as this sterilizer is, you can only fit a maximum of six Avent bottles, nipples, collars and caps in this device at one time.  If you have more than six bottles to run through this you'll have to do more than one cycle of sterilizing plus you'll have to wait for the heating element to cool before you can use it again.The sterilizer does complete the cycle in approximately seven minutes as promised.  That certainly is quicker than waiting for a big pot of water to boil on the stove, but it's not any more impressive than the microwave bottle sterilizers.Personally, I think Avent should stay away from electronic devices that heat things up.  Their bottle warmer performs badly, and this sterilizer worked for me one, and only one time.  I had to call customer service after the device died after the first use.  Fortunately, their customer service is great and they offered to send a new sterilizer out to me within 7-10 business days.  I'm still waiting on the replacement, but I don't have high expectations that the new one will be any better.If you are serious about getting a sterilizer, I'd strongly suggest you buy the Avent microwave sterilizer instead.  I happen to have one of those and I can fit just as many bottles in the microwave version as I can in the electric one.  Also, I can sterilize bottles in the microwave one in less time than the electric one requires.  And let's not forget that the microwave sterilizer costs considerably less money and takes up less space.Overall, I would not recommend the 4 in 1 electric steam sterilizer.  It's simply not worth the cost or the hassle of dealing with a poorly designed device.	
1. 	I purchased two of these mattress pads two years ago for my son's crib.  This pad is so easy to put on and take off the mattress.  It fits a standard crib mattress PERFECTLY, and lays nice and flat.  It washes up easily, and does NOT shrink!  It's soft and durable, and it has NEVER leaked!  Oh, and compared to many mattress pads that cost up to $19.99 each- this pad is a super deal!I was so pleased with this product that I'd buy it all over again- and I will.  We are expecting TWINS this spring, and I plan on purchasing two more mattress pads for our second crib!I reccommend purchasing TWO for those middle of the night messes, that way you can change the sheets and pad in the middle of the night and not worry about washing the soiled pad till you wake up the next morning.  :)	
- 1	it mix formula without the bubbles... but it broke after a couple weeks.  I know for the price the product is not going to last forever but a couple of weeks?	
- 1	I bought this 2-Pack 12 months and above pacifier for my 16-month girl, as an updated for her favorite old ones as I've linked hereHevea Star & Moon Orthodontic Pacifier -0 - 3 months.She loves the old ones from Hevea, but unfortunately they don't sell it by larger size. So come back to this new ones.At the beginning, she likes them as they are similar as the old styles that she used. But after only two weeks, she refused to use one of them by a very sensitive reaction even though she was quite sleepy by that time.As I checked the pacifier, I found a weird thing that the plastic nipple became flat(the air inside was gone there) and couldn't come back to the normal shape no matter how I've tried to pinch it back.I don't believe that there's anything wrong with the way that my little girl sucked it, and can't find a better way to contact the seller. If photos are demanded, i can always supply.	
- 1	This is a great toothpaste-- my 9-month-old loves it and she enjoys having her teeth brushed so much that she cries when I take the brush out of her mouth.  The thing I hate about the fingertip brush is that my daughter (proud owner of 8 sharp teeth) likes to BITE down on my poor index finger inside the silicone sleeve.  No matter how often I tell her no, it is hard for her to get the concept that when I put something in her mouth, she is not to chomp down on it with all her might. To remedy this, I try holding just the tip of the finger sleeve and gently let her chew away on it, but that poses a very dangerous hazard as she could potentially swallow it if I don't hold onto it with a very firm grip-- which is difficult to do with a wet, slippery piece of silicone.  Plus, she has now bitten off a couple of the silicone bristles and they are no where to be seen.  So, overall I understand the concept of this toothbrush and it may be great for younger babies, perhaps with no teeth.  But I'm definitely looking for something in between this and a regular hard-bristled toddler toothbrush.  Keeping the toothpaste though, like I said, it's a great toothpaste.	
- 1	I really wish I hadn't wasted money on this product. I would not recommend at all. It is difficult to figure out, even with the crappy instructions. I bought this to keep track of my baby's eating. Found a free app on the iPhone that does the same thing. And that is better because I always have my phone as opposed to a second gadget.	
- 1	As neat as this looks, it is hard to use.  The red ball sits in the water as a pump, and you press the blue star to make the water squirt out of elmos mouth.  I thought it attached to the spicket, but it does not.  The star is hard to press, even for me.  My 2 year old can't do it at all.  And it is not constant.  One push just gives you one squirt.  Was disappointed	
- 1	My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained. I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit. So far, this hasn't been the case. The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable. I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries. However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest. At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus. Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of cage design on the other. I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all. Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older.	
1. 	I am very happy with this sound machine. It is super soft and way up there on the cuteness factor.  The sounds are nice and my son seems to enjoy them, while cuddlying with the giraffe, although I think he would have enjoyed the dolphin sounds more (I did not discover they had a dolphin until after I had purchased the giraffe.) The giraffe seems to be very well made, no loose pieces or strings anywhere that I could find.  Fur is really nice and soft.  I gave it four stars because the sound box was extremely difficult to get into the giraffe but at least you know it is secure and will not come out, I just dread changing the batteries. =)	
- 1	You get what you pay for. These towels are thin and not very absorbent. The certainly don't keep my little one warm when he's just out of the bath. Save your money and buy one nice hooded towel. You don't really need more than one.	
1. 	I couldn't imagine sleeping while pregnant without the snoogle! I even recommend it to others with back problems (men and women.) I don't think my husband as as crazy about it, it is pretty bulky. Now that I'm nearly through my second pregnancy, this is starting to get pretty squashed and I'm back to using additional pillows as well. I really wish that the cover was a nicer fabric and easier to clean.All in all though, it is a genius product that really meets the needs of pregnant women! (And I would argue it is a good ergonomic pillow for those with back problems.)	
- 1	I bought this item because the go mama go brand that I bought for the main front rail had been back ordered and my son was trying to eat his crib for lunch.  They are not very well padded and so when my son hit his head on them he still hurt himself.  The real dangerous part is that the thing is held on primarily by one long strip of standard velcro.  It goes over the vertical slats of the crib and velcros on in the gaps between slats.  Because it is not a strong enough bond and because my son was easily able to get his hands under it on the inside crib slats and then pull the velcro apart he slipped because the rail cover that he was holding onto for support gave way and he smacked his head incredibly hard on the rail of the crib.  Shame on this company for making a piss poor product, Leachco you have lost my trust as a consumer and you could have seriously injured my child.	
1. 	We followed directions for installation and do not overload it. Holds 2 soaps/shampoos 2 wash rags and a few toys. No problems. Love it!	
1. 	I pump each day and these are the only caps that do not spill. Before I used the medela caps and carrying my pumped breastmilk from work and to the babysitter spilt a lil each day. These are well worth the investment and go on our dr brown medela and gerber bottles. Great product	
- 1	Dont use silicone use natural rubber for your baby. I use Nuk rubber Orthodonic nipples because they are natural and work perfectly.	
- 1	So originally I really liked these diapers, so much so that I ordered 6 more after 6 weeks of use. Now I've been using them for about 16 weeks and they leak without fail around the legs.  It's almost like the insert isn't made wide enough to absorb in the correct areas. I have other diapers (bumgenius and fuzzi bunz) that I have had for the same amount of time and have yet to have any issue with. Don't waste your time, go with the major brands!	
- 1	This didn't fit onto either of our models and the cup is huge and didn't work for most drinks.  Save your money.	
1. 	We love this booster seat.  I got it when my son was 6 months old and we are still using it for him at 16 months of age.  It folds up very nicely and one of the straps to hold it onto the chair doubles as a shoulder strap for carrying.  It is very easy to clean and having a cover for the tray is nice so that the tray doesn't get dirty when you travel with it.It has a very nice restraint system.  It is easy to remove the tray completely to use it as solely a booster seat.  It's very durable and has withstood a lot of abuse over time.I've used this seat everywhere with my son: restaurants, over at friends' houses, as a spare seat when we have lots of babies over at our house, and it even fits nicely on a those folding captain's chairs while we are out camping.  It is just a really awesome product and I am so glad I bought it!In summary:Pros -- easy to clean- folds up nice and is easy to carry via shoulder strap- easy to set up- very adjustable- can be used as a booster seat without the tray- fits every chair we've ever tried it on- Has a nice tray cover- Has a removable tray insert for easy washing- The raised edge allows toys to be clipped on the edge if they have on of those plastic link rings on themCons-- There haven't been any for us!	
1. 	At 7 months pregnant my back was killing me. I bought this based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did. After the first night I noticed a huge difference and after a few more days, my back pain was gone. I gave birth back in January and I still use it---it's just that comfortable. I also like that you can use it in other positions (it shows you on the package). I've had it for 8 months now and it's a little bit flatter than I'd like but still does the job. Fully recommend to all preggos suffering from back pain. I just wish I'd had bought it earlier on!	
1. 	I have been breastfeeding my son, since he was born, and now he is 9 months old. I couldn't have done it without this Avent pump. As a first time mother, I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. My son had trouble latching on in the hospital, and so, until he could breastfeed consistently (I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders), I was pumping my breast milk for him. At the hospital, they provided me with a Medela manual pump. It was PAINFUL. I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump. So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis, and I went for the Avent, a much more economical buy. This pump is so comfortable, it really imitates the suckling action of the baby. At first, all the parts might seem overwhelming, but when you put the pump together, it's a breeze and washes easily. I chose the disposable system because I thought it would be more convenient if I traveled to take the pump, however, I find I use the reusable 4 oz bottles a lot more frequently. Whether you're taking the pump on vacation,to work, to extract milk for an occasional bottle or to mix for cereal, this pump is a great buy. Now that my son is older, it is harder for me to pump so much milk (the let-down takes a little longer, and he drinks less, so I do have to pump a bit), but it's so convenient if you have to go out and run an errand, or freeze your milk so that you'll always have supply on hand for the babysitter.	
- 1	We ended up sending this one back.  You can't swivel the camera with the monitor, so when your kid becomes mobile you can't move the camera to see where they've gone, which makes the camera a little useless.  Summer Infant makes better monitors than this one.	
1. 	I currently have a boy almost 4 and a girl due any day now.  I purchased this stroller instead of a traditional double stroller because my son doesn't need to be in a stroller all that often, but he still needs it occasionally.  So far he loves the idea that he can sit or stand.  I've put it together ( it was super easy!) and it's sitting in the nursery right now waiting on the little miss to get here.  My son is constantly in there wanting to sit or stand on the stroller which gives me hope because like a typical boy, he hates to sit still.  This steers very easily.  I test drove it around my small apartment and was able to steer around sharp corners with ease with my 35 pound son it.  Since my daughter isn't here yet I added some weight to the car seat just to see how it would work with both the kids on there.  Not quite one handed steering, but close!  I decided on this one as opposed to the ultra light mostly due to the price.  The shorter wheel base, larger sunshade and lighter stroller just weren't worth $100 to me.  Granted the carseat adapter will have to come off to fit in the trunk (I have an '07 Fusion)), but that's an easy thing to do.  And I bought an umbrella to add to the back if my son needs the extra shade.  But that shouldn't be too much of an issue as the sunshade on the stroller is adjustable.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the basket is a bit awkward to get to.  In order to put anything there, I'll have to move my son if he's sitting.	
- 1	A great idea, but the adhesive is weak and falls off easily. I stopped using them after about a month.	
- 1	i bought this for our 3rd child, after previously owning a graco system.  after lots of research, we chose this system for our new baby.  seemed like a good stroller/ travel system for the price.  unfortunately, the car seat did not fit in any of our cars - a saturn and honda.  it hung off the seat by 2+.  tried it in my parents cars also and found it had the same problem with their ford & chrysler.  had to return it.  amazon took it back.  now we have to start over.	
1. 	Works great in locking the kitchen cabinets. Our 13 month old kept trying to open them for couple of days after I installed them and now has just given up :). I had to use a handheld drill to make holes in the wood before inserting the screws.	
1. 	I bought this in pink for my 3 year old girl - she loves to sit on it, and knows that it's hers. It's a great height, she doesn't hit her legs under the table, and it gives her a perfect boost. This truly is a great product and I'm happy that I spent the $ on it.*Do wash it pretty soon after food/liquid spillage - it's a slightly textured material where you have to scrub to get milk or anything dried off of it unless you wipe it up shortly after it was spilled.	
1. 	1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price. I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time.I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina. It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle. I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump.	
1. 	I have been very happy with the Avent Naturally re-usable bottles. I don't recommend liners of any kind because it's just an extra step in the bottle-making process and something more to have to go buy when you run out! With these re-usable bottles, I just toss everything in the dishwashwer and I'm good to go.I have no complaints about these bottles. They really are wonderful. There are 4 different flow speeds to accommodate your child's needs, as well, which is nice.There are also handles that you can purchase later on to encourage baby to hold his own bottle, as well as little sippy-cup spouts. So, you can turn all of your bottles into non-spill sippy cups, which just extends the life of this product. You won't have to spend money on sippy cups this way.I would not recommend buying any 4-ounce size bottles. Just put a smaller amount into the larger 9-ounce bottles at first. My son was drinking 6 ounces per bottle by the time he was 3 months old, anyway, so I'm glad I didn't waste money on the 4-ounce size.	
- 1	I bought this crib after it was recommended by the book Baby Bargains.  I thought, Why buy a $1000 set of nursery furniture when we'll only use them for a few years?My daughter is now 11 months old, and I just ordered a solid wood crib from Pottery Barn.  This Graco crib is flimsy, which didn't bother me when she couldn't pull up and just lay there, but now when I hear the ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-dunk of her standing up and shaking the side of the crib, I get nervous.  The drop-side was recalled and requires a special kit to make it fixed.  In a single day, my daughter has chewed the finish off in one place; it looks like a squirrel got to it.I wish I had saved my $150 (which was the price at the time) and just bought the more expensive crib to begin with.  It's not a bargain if it won't last through all of the children we hope to have.	
1. 	I love all mustela products. This message oil is not greasy a all and absorbs into baby skin very quickly.	
- 1	I ordered the Da Vinci crib, which is still backordered, and got the free mattress to go with it, so I figured, even if it is crap (which it appears to be) it was free.  I will be using this as the mattress my baby will sleep on when we visit the grandparents.Compared to the Serta mattress I have for home this mattress is way too squishy; it does not feel very supportive, so it will be great for the occasional sleep.Oh and when it was delivered, it was just in a plastic bag, no box, so who knows what could have been placed on it while in the truck.	
1. 	This was awesome for our little one for her first 6 weeks!  It made it easier for all of us to rest easy knowing a blanket wouldn't come loose and possibly cover their little face.  After 6 weeks, little one was able to wriggle out and decided swaddling wasn't their thing! Every baby is different, but this was a must for the first weeks.	
- 1	These diapers are the same Chinese low-quality items rebranded a thousand times. They are cheap, so if you're on a really tight budget, they'll do for now. But one thing I've learned with cloth diapers, is that you don't really need a gazillion of them to diaper your baby. Buy a quality set of diapers and do laundry every other day. These are sub-par, in my opinion.	
- 1	The wedge has a pretty big bump where it meets the mattress and our son just slid down the side of it. We only tried using it one night and then took it out. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	I am sure there was some way of knowing this beforehand, but these covers don't work on my outlets.  I have a track home built in 2006 and have standard outlets I guess.  I unscrewed my covers and screwed these ones on.  Unfortunately, there is a gap between the wall and the cover.  It does not sit flush against the wall.  That seems more unsafe to me, actually.  I felt like my baby could twist these covers as they did not have a secure mounting.  I did like that there is no plastic plug to remove and put somewhere close by yet out of reach but these don't work for me.  Also, the color of these covers is different than my standard ones.  These are more of a gray white.  I would have dealt with the minor color difference had they fit securely but I can't use them.  Unfortunately, I ordered a 12 pack.  :(  Not worth returning but not worth using.	
1. 	My favorite toy.  My granddaughter, 10 months, and I play with it everyday.  It is the most creative toy she has.	
1. 	We have a gas range and always worry a little helper might reach the knob and leave the gas on. These are simple and easy to open when you need access to cook. This is our second set to replace one we just finally wore out so now I have extras. Great purchase for piece of mind.	
- 1	This was something we bought to take our baby on vacation. It was okay depending on the type of chair you are using it with. We found it was just easier for one of us to hold him in our laps and that this was an unnecessary expense.	
- 1	this only worked for food that was already soft.  My wife and I used it briefly then decided it was more of a hassle to wash then a fork that would accomplish the same job.	
1. 	We use these under our car seats to protect the leather of the back seat of our car. I don't use the pockets for anything but the mats themselves stay in place well.	
1. 	I registered for this tub while I was still pregnant, because it was much more reasonably priced than many of the other tubs, and got great reviews.  I have to say, I couldn't be more pleased.  Before our baby's cord stump fell off, the little hammock was great.  It kept her secure, and I could wash her back through the mesh without having to turn her over (if you've never washed a newborn, you'll just have to take my word for it that this is an outstanding feature).  Now that she's bigger, and has to sit inside the tub, she loves it.  It holds her completely comfortably (so she ENJOYS sitting in the bath, rather than screaming through it, as I've been told a friend's baby always does), and the padding keeps her from slipping around.  And it fits perfectly in our sink, which saves my back.  I couldn't possibly imagine a more expensive tub being any better.  I HIGHLY recommend this.	
1. 	Very quick, gentle, quiet when I am using it. Very good. I want to extend my breast feeding because of this product because it makes my express milk life easier.	
- 1	Maybe these work well for other babies but my daughter (now 6mos) has never liked them and never paid any attention to them. Cute, but not very useful.	
- 1	It's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer, our monitor is losing the sound more and more. It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned. We have only had this a year and paid $176 for it. WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen. I would expect this from a $50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred.	
- 1	The sticker on the mirro was faded. It's hard plastic which hurts when you are smacked with it. Our infants leg and arms have been caught in between the bars.	
1. 	I bought this gate not thinking it would hold up long. I needed a gate for my deck for several reasons. One, if my toddler was to get outside and not to fall down the deck. Also, I have feral cats I feed and like them to feel safe on the deck. And last, there are a lot of dogs in my neighborhood that if there is no gate placed up, they will come right up to my patio door, they are aggressive too. I previously had a wooden gate but with it being exposed to the elements, it did not last long and warped.  I did not think this gate would last long but so far I am very impressed. I measured the opening to the stairs of the deck and it was 41 even. I was scared this gate would not fit but it did. It seems to hold really well too. It has been exposed to heavy wind, wildlife trying to get around it, and it also had a feral cat sleeping on it, it seems to have great support. I like that it is plastic and will not matter if it gets wet. I need something simple and cheap. This exceeded my expectations and was very easy to put up. I also want to note I live in a not so great neighborhood so did not want to spend too much if the gate was stolen. For what I am using it for, I am very impressed! Would and will buy again if needed.	
1. 	Rubber ducky doesn't look so tough, and won't talk. Tried: boiling water, water boarding, slow cuts, nothing worked. Not a peep.	
- 1	We gave this nail clipper many chances, but it ended up being a piece of trash.  First of all, the bulky shape is hard to handle precisely.  Second, the curve of the cutter is too curvy for baby nails.  Third, the biggest flaw, the magnifying glass is blurry and out focus! Instead of allowing you to see better, it actually blurs the view!	
- 1	I don't think these feel nice at all. They are stiff and scratchy. They seem to work pretty well for poop, although I sent my roll into daycare, so I personally have only used a couple of them, but my diapers are coming back from daycare without much poop, so... they work. However, if I put a clean diaper on my daughter with one of these, she fusses. She doesn't do that with a non-lined diaper and doesn't do that with the Bummis liners, so my conclusion is that she doesn't like the feel of these against her skin. I haven't personally stuffed one in my undies, so I don't know, but this is the conclusion I'm drawing based on my baby's reaction to them.I only flush poopy ones, too, but I'm not sure I'd trust ANY of the liners to all make it down the toilet. They all seem to clump up and I'm afraid I'll clog my pipes. The ones that have been peed on get rinsed and thrown out.	
- 1	At home my son has a Baby Einstein (BE) jumper which he LOVES.  While I was visiting my parents I picked this up from Walmart for about the same price at Amazon because my son would not stop jumping in my lap.  What a waste of money.  The toys are too close to the seat.  My son would end up smacking his face against the toys - this never happens with the BE. The lights are nowhere near as vibrant as the BE and something about this is really really uncomfortable.  5 minutes in - my son would be screaming and crying.  Not sure if its the seat or the mechanics of the jumping (you jump on the blue triangle which moves unlike BE where the seat is suspended from springs.Not worth it.	
- 1	Good concept but as others say the actual food cup is small.  It only fits a baby carrot.	
1. 	I cannot tell you how easy this makes pumping when you're on the go!  I use these at work so i don't have to bring everything into the bathroom to clean afterwards and love this...	
- 1	While we love the original woombie, this woombie swaddler is WAY too tight for our baby who is 8 pounds.	
- 1	We were quite excited to find this product - thought it was like the  type of playpen from 20 years ago to use for a child. There was no weight limit and the only height limit on the website was when the child was big enough to climb out - from both Amazon and from Graco, so it was perfect for our larger baby.Lots of disappointment when the package was opened and we discovered that is has the same limits (in the owner's manual) as the regular pack-n-play. Between when I ordered in and when it was delivered, the words PACK 'N PLAY were actually added to the title of it.Luckily, Amazon seems to be pretty good about taking it back, but we are quite disappointed.	
- 1	I have had the Dora ones for about 3 days but am posting the review here since this design seems to have the most traffic. For my daughter only, who is almost 4, these are probably fine though I wished they held more than 9 ounces ( wanting to move on from our 12 ounce nubby straw ones which have been my stand by for 3 years). I was trying it out on my 15 month old seeing if he could manage this type - which he seemed to be able to do and get out some milk. The problem is that he throws the cup over his highchair when he's done, and the inner cup already cracked. So the liquid would get in between the two layers.  I don't want the milk inI there to go rancid so that one has to go bye bye.	
1. 	I love this blanket. ALthough I could never actually swaddle my son (he hated it), we use thsi all the time for his regular blanket. I use the green for the car, cover him in his carseat. Its light enough that I can double fold it and it fits nicely around him. We use the other on the floor when we have him on the carpet. They fold up nicely.I have washed both of the blankets hundreds of times and they have not faded. They are super soft and are my favorite blankets!	
1. 	Okay, we are two guys and we don't have any experience with babies.  So when we had our daughter (by surrogacy) we got a lot of help.  This product line was one of the things we recieved and we use it all the time.  It smells fantastic, and people say it smells &#34;like a baby&#34;.  It works well, she likes having it put on her, and it cleans her up super good.  They also have a baby skin lotion that also smells the same, and works fantastically.  This is one of those secrets that you mom got from your grandmother, and they decided to let you in on it.  The product is golden!!!	
- 1	These are really cute looking but I don't know that they serve too much of a purpose. Everything I out on it falls off except if I put nipples on the white middle pieces. But that means I'm drying 3 nipples only... I guess therefore they do serve a purpose (cute and somewhat saving space) but just a small one.	
1. 	The shape of this protector has worked well with both my Honda bench seat and a Tahoe captain's chair. There is a flap on the bottom in the middle that is meant to tuck into the seat crease, so as to help with upwards or downwards sliding. This didn't tuck in so well with the bench seat, but worked perfectly on the captain's chair. The protector doesn't slide anyways.  The nonslip material on the bottom works great. The only think I would change is to make it so that it can be used with a forward-facing seat as well. With a forward-facing seat, the bottom portion of the seat is still surrounded, but the upper back of the child's seat is still pressing into the actual car seat.	
- 1	leaks, was a pain to wash since the straw was always dirty. i have the playtex ones that work much better and doesn't leak.	
1. 	this fits my graco pack and play like a glove didnt have to adjust anything, its thin enough to maintain a hard surface for my 3mth old to start to push up on and soft enough that he can snuggle for a nap!AND its waterproof backing is a great bonus!12 stars!	
1. 	I used these in the first year of my daughters life to store expressed breast milk.  I have the Avent pump (which I LOVE) so with the adapter I could pump right into these, very convenient. I had a lot of milk stored in my freezer I really appreciated how nicely they stacked and that they didn't take much room.  I never had problems with spilling.  As a disclaimer to that, I will say that I didn't transport milk daily and that I rarely filled the cups completely.I appreciate them even more now that I'm done pumping.  While bottles and plastic bags are either causing clutter in my cupboards or have been thrown out, these are still frequently used.  They're a perfect size for on the go toddler snacks.  I also use them to store sides for my husband and I when we take lunches to go or to store small amounts of leftovers (usually headed for my toddlers lunch the next day).Overall, these are a good choice for milk storage based on their potential long-term usefulness!	
- 1	I picked this inflatable spout cover over others because a friend had a similar one and it looked like the best protector - hers was always very full and much softer than the harder plastic versions. Compared to hers this one is okay- but definitely not the same. The two biggest problems are 1) I had a hard time inflating it (whether I tried to inflate it on or off of the spout). The air valve sticks out and it was difficult to get the air to stay in while putting the valve cover on. It doesn't hold much air so it is almost flat by the time I get the value closed. After a few tries it now has a decent amount of air but it is not full. 2) Our faucet has a pull up for the shower and this does not have a hole for it to pass through. We only use that tub for the kids/guests so there is not a regular need to use the shower but if you only have one shower this could be a pain!I will keep the cover because it will serve its purpose and I don't feel like messing with a return but I would not purchase this one again. I would try another brand...	
1. 	This pad cover is nice and soft, pleasant color, looks nice and it works. It was well packed and it arrived on time.	
1. 	Maybe not ideal for an infant, but after about a month, it works remarkably well. And it doesn't look like a SWAT vest, which is a plus in my book.	
1. 	My 4 year old like it when he sleeps in my parents room, and is great for travelling its similar to what they use to sleep in his day care.  No assembly required, easy to fold.  Toddler bed crib sheets is a perfect fit.	
1. 	I really like this bottle brush. I have gone through a few brands but this is by far my favorite. I do not use the nipple part as my son no longer uses bottles but they are great for his sippy cups and even my cups. Easy to sanitize through the dishwasher. Love this and if I have another child this will definitely be my go to brand.	
- 1	My kids still put toys in their mouths, and right out of the gate I felt that a few of the edges were a bit too roughly cut to be safe for small children.  It's also very easy to have small fingers pinched between the wood due to the elastic band holding the toy together.  It is attractive, though not very turtle-like in appearance.  Not much going on here, but not charming enough to fit the 'classic' toy formula either.  I can't recommend this for anything beyond a nice looking coaster.	
1. 	I've tried 3 brands of the sliding switch plates.  These are the best.  Our son pulled out the other types of outlet plugs.  So we needed something more secure.  Ours came with screws that were longer than typical outlet cover screws.  They need to be longer since these covers are not as flat as regular outlet covers.  Other reviewers had issues with the screws for some reason.  These covers are large enough to cover any paint imperfections on the wall...they hit the wall in exactly the same place as a standard cover (not oversized cover).  And once tightened, they do not warp or bow out in any way.  Other brands did that to where our son could grab and pull on the corners of the cover and pull it.  These do not do that.  They lay flat and tight on our walls.	
- 1	From the moment I assembled and installed this bed rail, it felt flimsy. I'd purchased a foldaway rail thinking it would make it easier to make my daughter's bed, but was wrong. The rail was so difficult to fold under that it wasn't worth folding it away; I'd just pull the bed away from the wall instead. Any attempt at folding it down would result in the cheap metal wheels that guide the rail popping off the cheap metal track. In less than six months, my two year old daughter had the rail bent and finally snapped the cheap wheel right off the rail itself. Despite installing it correctly, my daughter would still manage to push it away from the bed enough that she could have fallen through. This thing just ended up in the trash, what a waste of money.Save yourself the headache. If you have to have a safety rail, just get a rail that is solid and doesn't fold away or purchase a less expensive bolster that fits under the sheets. This one is crap.	
1. 	I was starting to wake up from bad back pain in the beginning of my third trimester.  I bought this pillow and it's been great.  I can sleep longer without waking up from back aches.  I also plan on using it for nursing.  I like that I can sleep on either side without having to adjust the pillow.  Some reviewers complained about the seam digging into their shoulders.  I did not have this problem.  I'm 5'2 and found that the size of the pillow was fine for me.  Seems pricey for a pillow but the comfort is well worth it.	
- 1	This is ideal for most pacifiers I've seen, but my baby only likes MAM pacifiers and although you can loop this through the holes in the pacifier, it rests between the pacifier and the baby's mouth - definitely NOT comfortable for the baby.  The description states specifically it will work with MAM, but I cannot see how it could work properly.	
- 1	The distortion of this 'mirror' is really a drag (it's a mirror laminate on a plastic backing of course, due to safety issues with real glass hanging over baby's head in a moving car). Like looking into a funhouse mirror from the back seat.	
1. 	I bought this to take on a plane with my little one.  Although I also had a full diaper bag with me, I knew that taking the diaper bag to the airplane restroom with me and carry the baby would be too difficult. Not to mention that airplane restrooms aren't exactly roomy.  The kit worked really well for quick diaper changes on the plane.  I like the carrying strap on it that I can put around my wrist.  Sometimes on short outings I only carry this kit and not the full diaper bag!  It's an all-in-one diaper changer kit that makes diaper changing quick and easy!	
- 1	The opening is a little small and it's hard for my 3 year old to pee with it without peeing all over the pee guard.  Plus, why would you put ridges in the pee guard?  It makes it so much harder to clean and sanitize.  My 3 year old is in the 50-75th percentile for height and weight, so he's not a huge kid so I feel this seat is just made too small for the average 3 year old.  I don't think I'd recommend it to others.	
- 1	I loved the pacifier pocket the first week. It was so convenient to have the pacifier on the outside of the diaper bag in an easy to find location. But the snap that secures the pocket stopped working and the pocket would constantly fall off. I returned the product!	
1. 	This seat secures nicely, is easy to stow, is convenient for everything from dining halls to the home kitchen to great-grandma's house.  Gender-neutral color, cleans easily (the tray cover AND removeable inserts are awesome.)  I like that it can also be used as a booster.  The tray is VERY easy to snap on and off (for an adult), and doesn't accidentally slip off when the child is in.  Very affordable, and appears sturdy enough to last through several kids.

1. 	playtex is always a go to brand for bottles. its a brand that parents can trust. These bottles worked great, just as I expected them to.	
1. 	This toy net works well enough, but it is not quite as large as I originally thought.  It's triangle shape makes it for corner use only, and can be a bit off balanced if not positioned perfectly.  If the netting came up further on each side, I would give it 5 stars.	
1. 	I will never, ever go back to regular baby bottles.  And if you try these, I'd bet dollars to donuts that you won't either.  Yes, there will be less gas and fewer spitups, but that's not the biggest advantage in my opinion.Get the Playtex dropins and you'll be off getting manicures and reading your favorite gossip magazine.  Ok, maybe not, but you will be amazed at how much time you recapture when you don't have to wash bottles.  The only thing you need to wash is the nipples, and those really don't take nearly the same effort as bottles, and they don't sit with spoiling milk in them either, as bottles do if you don't wash them right away.  I've got a few more than a day's worth of bottles, and a quick sterilization every evening gets all the nipples clean and ready for the next day.  No bottles piling up in the sink.  Thanks for my life back and for the extra time I have with my daughter.	
1. 	We received this as a gift when our baby was only three months old, and she was too little for it at the time, so we placed it in storage.  However, now that she is old enough (and big enough) this is just the best toy, ever!  She spins around in the seat and plays with all the items, and they keep her busy for a long time!  She loves smacking the Big Tent, which plays all kind of tunes, and she chews on all the soft chewy toys now that she is teething.The one thing that REALLY bothers me about this toy, though, is that it is MADE IN CHINA. I am *SICK SICK SICK* to death of everything being MADE IN CHINA these days.  I would not have bought this item PERSONALLY because it IS made in China, but as a gift, it's ok.  I thoroughly washed everything down, and so far, I have not seen any product recalls on this, but it is a concern.This is supposed to be a bouncer, but I don't see much bounce to it.  What it does, and does well, is give a baby an opportunity to practice sitting down, getting up, sitting down, and turning around and around.  Come to think of it, that is actually a GOOD THING.  Babies need to exert themselves to challenge their development.  The baby creates her OWN bounce!  My baby loves this toy, and I'm glad we have it, I just wish it were MADE IN AMERICA.One note:  The battery is NOT replaceable in the Big Tent. Once it's done, it's done. Fortunately, for now, mine is still playing, but that is one negative that I see.  Also, even though this toy is supposed to be a spacesaver (it's foldable) - it's a hassle and too time-consuming to quickly fold up.  I just keep moving it to the corner of the room when it's not needed. When the exer-saucer is folded up, it doesn't really save that much space anyway.	
- 1	I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.  I'm not sure what she made in it, but I find it incredibly messy and not worth the effort.  Works okay for small, fairly dry meals (like spaghetti).  Forget about trying to do bulk meals or anything slightly liquidy. Bulk meals (like an ice cube tray worth of peas) just makes your hand hurt and you have to refill over and over because it doesn't hold much.  Liquidy foods just squirt out the bottom and leak all over the counter. Plus the grinder part is made poorly and doesn't fit well into the grooves.  Hard to get undone after I'm finished using it.The only good part is that it's totally dishwasher safe and it does wash well.  And it's cheap.	
1. 	My daughter (5 months old) has been exclusively breastfed since she was born because we've been unable to find a bottle that she likes-we tried Dr. Brown, evenflo, Gerber NUK, pretty much every kind we could find, and still no luck.  I thought we'd give these a try since the nipple is wide and short (more similar to the real thing) and she will now take a bottle! In addition to the nipple being good, they have the air reducer (attached to the bottom) that keeps her from getting gassy and helps keep the liquid in the bottle flowing smoothly without bubbling.  They come apart easily (into 4 pieces: nipple, bottle, bottom air vent, bottom ring to hold the air vent on) and are a lot easier to clean than some of the other types of bottles we've had that have a lot of smaller pieces.  This set comes with 3 bottles and 3 nipples. Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with these and would DEFINITELY recommend these bottles to any nipple picky baby!	
- 1	Super thin! I returned immediately knowing they couldn't be absorbent at all. I wanted them for burp cloths and found them to be not soft at all. I want something much more comfortable against his skin.	
- 1	Medela products are known to be great, and they generally are, but... I found a better product, and it's by Lansinoh. Read on:i was given one of these Harmony pumps after my daughter's birth, and it worked great. i haven't ever needed to pump that often as i stay home with my daughter, so it only got used 3 or 4 times before it lost suction.well lo and behold, it's not an uncommon problem with this pump, and a quick google search showed me that i'd lost my o-ring.ladies, this is a VERY TINY rubber ring that very easily disappears from this pump when you disassemble it to clean. a set of 10 of these little rubber rings in the hardware store's plumbing department is usually around $2.75 (i know, because i went and looked)- EXCEPT THAT MEDELA USES A PROPRIETARY SIZE THAT ONLY THEY CAN REPLACE. As well, good luck finding replacement parts anywhere except online. It seems that even many of the places that sell Medela pumps don't carry the parts.worse?you'll need to spend TWELVE DOLLARS and replace the entire handle setup, just to replace this TINY little rubber ring (not including shipping). Now, I *have* heard from a few women who've been able to convince Medela just to send them replacement o-rings, however, it cost them over six dollars. I wasn't so fortunate anyway - after i sat on hold waiting for a customer service representative for almost seven minutes, she insisted i replace the entire setup as well. I quickly hung up, went to Wal-mart (yeah i know, but i needed a working pump asap) and got myself the Lansinoh manual.Anyway...  that's another review (it's a great little pump!), so I'll end with this. If you insist on buying the Medela Harmony, and you're buying the right pump for your needs, you'll probably be satisfied (I also found that I had a more productive time with the harder flange instead of the massaging one that comes with this pump - and those you CAN get in most places Medela pumps are sold). AND KEEP AN EYE ON THAT O-RING. Be VERY careful when you disassemble this pump to clean it.	
1. 	We've tried many types of bibs, and these are our favorite. They are flexible, so they can fit behind any highchair tray without bunching up (unlike plastic Baby Bjorn bibs, for example). They are easy to clean, and generally a simple rinse will do. They hold up nicely -- we have some similar bibs that are made from waterproofed canvas that seem to become increasingly warped the more we wash them. They come in many patterns that are pretty unisex, so we can get more than one child's worth of use out of them. Lastly, they are fun and pretty and there are tons of options for patterns. Our daughter actually likes them because they have cheerful patterns, and that's saying a lot since she prefers to go bibless most of the time.Pros: Flexible material, easy to clean, durable, cheerful patterns, fun unisex optionsCons: I can't think of any... seriously!	
1. 	This sheet fit great on our crib mattress and held up in the wash. It's very soft and comfortable. Would buy again	
1. 	Some crib sheets are really thin and the mattress pattern underneath shows through. This sheet is thick enough that the mattress doesn't show through and feels nice to the touch. Good bright color for our dragon theme nursery.	
- 1	Each piece doesn't fit and snug so there's a space between each other make it look cheaper. Easily to take apart. Find other!	
1. 	Sound machine AND adorable stuffed animal in one? Win-win. I love that the sound machine is removable for travel, because the sheep is pretty big. I don't use it all the time, and didn't even get it until my daughter was 3 and 1/2 months old, but it helps when she's worked up and fussy around bedtime (overstimulated would probably be the technical term). I imagine it would have helped her fall back asleep after eating in the middle of the night back when she was still doing that. I like giving baby gifts that are cute and practical, and this definitely fits the bill.	
1. 	I have a Britax Chaperone infant carseat and the base has an excellent lock off feature built in. However I could not get it so tight that it would move less than an inch.  After easily installing the Mighty Tite, it's like the base is a part of the car. It doesn't move at all. I am not a particularly strong or large person and it was a breeze to install. I highly recommend this product.	
- 1	I like the classical music and the white noise options. I don't like that you can't have the mobile turn without having to use the music with it. The mobile doesn't spin well. It operates oddly. The sea creatures that are moved by mobile are attached by a thin string. I was making up the crib with clean linens and a rolled up crocheted blanket bumped one and it ripped right off! For $40 it should last longer than a few weeks.	
1. 	I put this mirror in my mid-sized sedan, and it works wonderfully!  The car seat is in the middle rear seat, and I was able to attach the mirror to the car interior by snapping the hook onto where a car seat tether strap would go.  However, the first time I tried to use the hook, it broke and I had to take it back.  The second hook worked perfectly.  It gave me peace of mind to know that it was hooked onto the car itself and would not become a projectile in a crash.  There is also a strap to fit around a headrest as well.I never found that my son looked distorted in the mirror.  However, he did look a bit small, but that wasn't a problem.  I actually didn't realize how small he looked until recently when I turned his seat forward facing and realized how much bigger he is in the mirror.  I was even able to find lost pacifiers using the mirror while stopped at red lights!!My husband has an SUV, and my son has to sit behind the driver's seat.  We did not find that using this mirror was useful for this particular car.I do want to note that one reviewer mentioned lights and music.  This model does not have those features, but a similar, more expensive one does.	
- 1	I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.  So easy to operate with very little clean up.  Recently I came across some reviews about the coating in the water reservoir flaking off.  As a result I LOOKED for it during my last meal prep and sure enough, I saw tiny little silver flakes.  It almost looks like oily water but under good lighting you can see the silver bits.  I rinsed it out 5 times and still see the flakes.  I'm very concerned as I just spent $100 on this machine.  Unlike the other parent who wants to know what the coating is chemically made up of, I don't really care. I don't think it's acceptable to have ANY coating come off whether it's 'safe' or not. I have no intention of using this anymore.	
1. 	My daughter is five months old and we still use this item!  She sleeps so well and it really works well to keep her positioned correctly.  We love it and highly recommend it.  My niece, who is seven weeks older than my daughter, also loves and still uses hers.	
1. 	These are exactly the same as the inserts that come with the platex sippy cups. I was so glad to find these because we seem to keep losing the inserts and I don't want to have to replace an entire cup due to the lack of an insert. They work just as good as the original. I bought the smaller pack and then promptly lost some more inserts so now I'm wishing I bought the larger pack to have some extras.	
1. 	I was breast feeding my newborn and had just about decided to give up breast feeding when I found this pump.  It allowed me to continue to feed my baby breast milk while I gave myself time to heal.  I used the AVENT bottles with pumped milk and she had no difficulty switching between the two.	
1. 	I put this crib together within 40mins - comes with easy to follow instructions. It is a sturdy and great looking piece of furniture for the nursery. I bought the Espresso alongwith the 6inch Da Vinci mattress and is definitely a worthy investment :)Preferred this over the Da Vinci Emily crib as other reviewers mentioned the gap between the top bars in the Emily crib where little ones usually get their hand stuck. The design of the Kalani crib does not have that gap which will hopefully alleviate that issue in the future.	
- 1	I agree -- this thermometer is way too complicated and counter-intuitive.Imagine trying to use it on a screaming sick baby in the middle of the night.  It will take 20 minutes to locate the instructions (4 pages, lots of fine print) and read them and figure it out.For example:1.  Confusing buttons.  It has 2 buttons and they are the same color and size and not labeled to tell which is the on/off and which is memory.  The messages you get when you press the wrong button don't prompt you on what to do next.2.  Ambiguous error messages. Lo and LO are different error messages.  Whodathunk?  Like anyone is going to remember that a lowercase O means you are getting air in the ear so the temperature is too lo to measure.  Whereas a capital O means lo battery.EPIC FAIL.  SKIP!Should get negative stars.	
1. 	We've been relatively happy with these bottles, but I think we may have gone with something different if we had done any research.  We got these from the lactation consultant's office a day after our daughter was born in a panic of needing to buy something.  Our daughter was breast fed mostly, but used these a few times a week.Venting system: I do hear air going back in the back end, so I suppose it is doing its job to some degree, but I also see air going back in through the nipple.Ease of washing: I dont think the five parts are all that difficult to wash/keep track of.  The bottom stopper does take a bit of attention to make sure formula isnt remaining there after washing though.  Dont use a bottle brush and put it through the bottom stopper... it can cause it to tear and leak.  We've generally handwashed the bottles and parts, but have put them through the dishwasher with success.Leaking: We ususally have at least one bottle a week that leaks.  We havent been able to identify the exact cause, because as far as we can see, they're clean and assembled correctly.  The only time we had a consistent leak to troubleshoot, it was due to the bottom stopper having a tear in the inner ring.Replacement parts: I'm really confused as to why the bottom stoppers are not available in most stores.  Also, why do they sell three packs of bottles and only two packs of nipples?  So we have nine bottles and eight nipples.  Silly.Having not used anything else, I can't really compare. Parents in our parent's group seem to all use something different and they all seem happy with their choice whether it was the Dr. Browns, Medela, etc.	
1. 	It's light weight yet not too thin.It's stylish.It arrived quickly.It works perfectly.I used this for the first time over the weekend to breast feed in public for the first time ever. We were in a busy restaurant. I was wearing my daughter, who was sleeping. She woke up and became very fussy. I quickly pulled out my shawl, adjusted both of us and got her latched in no time. When my husband came back to the table I said, &#34;This isn't so bad is it.&#34; His response, &#34;You can't even tell you are doing anything, except for the occasionally cute little hand sneaking up through the hole to caress your neck.&#34; I couldn't have been happier with this statement.I've read some of the negative reviews that said the neck hole isn't big enough, but I didn't find that to be true. I can see her just fine when I want to, but personally I don't stare at my baby the entire time she feeds, so I have no need for a giant hole that could expose my chest to the world. I also read that the sides were too high and didn't offer enough coverage. I personally still wear maternity pants or nursing tanks to keep my abdomen covered and the shawl can be adjusted to add more coverage to one side over the other if necessary. I think it's very versatile and exactly what I wanted. I couldn't be happier.	
1. 	I picked this up at a local baby store for less than the price listed here today, but this is a good product that does the job of keeping up to three bottles' worth of formula separate. I'm pretty fond of all Avent products and this doesn't disappoint. When you pour one section of formula out into the bottle you sometimes get a tiny bit of powder from another compartment, but largely I have not had trouble. Now that our baby is a bit bigger it's also good as a snack carrier (Cheerios and the like) -- it's great to stretch out the usefulness of a baby product!	
1. 	When a baby gets to the crawling stage, your life changes. Table corners are just one of those places that must be protected and this little gadget does so very well. There are some tables that require the corner piece and the long padding all around the parameter of the table due to sharp edges, but in most cases, this is enough. I only wish they were a little less obvious. Unless you have very light wood furniture, these things stick out like a sore thumb. My only concern is that there is an adhesive (that supposedly comes right off).  Many months from now I suppose I'll find out if that is true, but in the meantime I have (relative) peace of mind when my grandson is crawling or toddling around and that is Priority 1.	
1. 	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the Shop'n'Dine) didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.	
1. 	my son has loved this toy since he was 5months old (i have posted pics). it's a beautiful toy and there is so much to keep busy hands (and mouths!) busy. haba is my favorite wooden toy brand. anything and everything i have ever bought from them has been top notch! the colors are bold and won't chip. the wood is a dream to touch. and the design is perfect. you can't go wrong with this toy!	
- 1	Overall the camera is great when we got it.  Was impressed by the range, sound, and picture.  About 8 months after the first one the night vision stopped working.  Got lucky and when I bought it Amazon had a one year return on it.  Explained what happened and their great customer service exchanged it for me.  Now this time it has only been 5 months and the night vision went out again.  It was a brand new unit.  So it was not just a one time issue.  If you don't care about the night vision I would recommend this camera.  If it is one of the reason you are purchasing the unit I would go with another model.	
1. 	great for establising a bedtime routine and really peaceful/fun to look at	
1. 	I love this pillow! It's size is great and my son loves to sleep in it. It gives him the feeling of being held and he just loves it. It's great for us parents because we can put him in it and he can sit with us on the couch or on the bed.	
- 1	I got this because I wanted a natural teether. Well, it's just simply not entertaining enough especially when compared to the colorful Thomas trains my other child is playing with. I know it's supposed to be natural, but would a little color be so bad? Right now he likes gnawing on frozen asparagus more than he likes this (which is also natural!). There are ways to color toys that are natural too. Maybe it's better for younger babies, but mine got this at 5.5 months and liked it for about 2 minutes.	
1. 	This is a good product.  My daughter is very laid back, knock on wood, but I thought this would be especially nice for those midnight diaper changes when she was young because it wouldn't wake her up as much as a cold wipe would, and it didn't.  I also haven't had a single wipe turn brown, and the wipes have never dried out on me either even when I wasn't home to use them for over a week!  My daughter definately seems to like the warm wipes better as she doesn't ever flinch or cry like she will with the cold ones.	
1. 	I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!	
- 1	This bathtub is big, not space saver, and not safe. Baby slips in it. It is dangerous. Would not recommend it	
1. 	love my bundle me, received it as a shower gift and it is one of my favorites. Never had to wake my baby up putting on or taking off a snowsuit, plus she hates being dressed so it made my life so much easier. Also covers more than a snowsuit, on windy days it kept her face covered from the house to car and vice versa.It is also very high quality and easy to wash. I read some reviews that said otherwise. I believe they bought the much cheaper copy sold at baby depot that is very low quality and not made by the same company.As for the unsafe reviews, I find it unfortunate that people write reviews for products they do not have, nor even bothered to read the manufacturers comments on.In line with JJ Cole's commitment to child safety, the Bundle Me has been tested to FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard) 213 requirements. All tests passed on the child restraint system, indicating that the Bundle Me product appeared to have little to no effect on the performance of the child restraint systemIf you think about it, installed properly, it is no different than wearing a heavy coat.	
- 1	I should have gone with my gut and bought Britax seats. I've used Britax for all of my children and needed two more seats for my infant twins. No matter what you do, no matter how tight you try to get the seat, it wiggles around. My Britax seats NEVER did that. The angle of the pull straps for the latch system makes it nearly impossible to get a tight fit. I've used towel and pool noodles, and nothing helps.  I like that the fabric is soft, and I like the style, but that's about it. Also, like Britax, the straps twist ALL THE TIME.Just my opinion, but keep these points in mind when buying this seat.	
- 1	The design is quite sweet, and I purchased it to place a bunch of items in it for a baby shower as a gift basket. It will work fine for that purpose, but as for long term use, it is not at all sturdy for a playroom or nursery. Probably not worth the money...but I will not return because I need it for the shower! I have ordered other Skip Hop items -- through Amazon-- for my own use that have been very sturdy, so am quite surprised at the lack of quality of this item.	
- 1	I love the features on this mirror, but unfortunately they don't work.  I ordered two of these because of all of the great reviews, so I'm really surprised at the low quality of this product. :(1- The mirror makes the baby look too far away, so I can't even see if his eyes are open or not.  It just shows a little pea head really far away!  Not too helpful.2- I returned one of these because the remote didn't work, and when I got the replacement, I accidentally dropped the remote on the floor once, and now it doesn't work either. Unfortunately the features don't work without it, either.3- The light is a great idea, but is nowhere near bright enough to light the baby. Unfortunately neither I or my husband are handy enough to replace the bulb with LED lights, like the other reviewer!Unfortunately, I have thrown away all the packaging so I can't return these products now, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.	
1. 	... the rest of the items were!  I just can't seem to get enough suction out of the aspirator for it to work.It has everything you need, and the carrying case isn't bulky.  It really is a good investment!	
1. 	This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.	
1. 	My daughter loves being in her swing.. and usually falls asleep in it.. I can count on at least an hour or 2 of 'me' time when shes sleeping in it.  It goes with the rest of the Windsor products I have, but here are my complaints about the swing...1. The motor is a bit noisy, but does not overbear the music.2. In order to snap the tray down, I have to bend it a bit.. it does not align perfectly with the end it snaps onto.3. I wish there was a locking option for when I put my daughter in the chair, so the swing wouldn't move when Im trying to put her in it.4. I had the same problem with the mobile falling to the back, but if you move the arm forward enough, it doesn't fall back, but it wont turn, because the bears hit the area where the motor is. I'd rather it not turn than her not see it at all.5. I can only find the tray toys online at the Graco website, but they give you no description.6. You're supposed to be able to fold it up, but I haven't figured it out yet.. looks like I'll have to find the manual.I gave it 4 stars because it looks nice and it does do the job its supposed to do (entertain my daughter) which is the most important thing to me..	
- 1	I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already.  However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones.  My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore.  The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.	
1. 	My husband and I use this product daily.  I had to pump for most of the time I nursed and we had to warm bottles for each feeding.  The water measurer isn't the greatest, it's hard to fill without going over the MAX line or spilling out.  So I just measured about how many tablespoons of water we needed and kept a glass of water next to the machine.  Just scoop out what you need, turn on the machine, and get your baby to stop screaming for food that much quicker.  We've had the product for 7 months and it's still working great.  I would recommend cleaning it out every so often to get rid of hard water build up and such, but it's great!	
- 1	These clings, just never worked for me.  They ended up clinging together and just never performed as desired.  I would not purchase these again nor recommend them.	
1. 	I bought one of these after my daughter was born to replace the My Brest Friend (which was terrible).  I love it and so does my baby.  We are still using it 9 months later.  So when my sister in law had her baby shower I knew she had to have one.  The Velcro safety strap is a great bonus.  Except this one doesn't have a removable cover for washing and the one I purchased for myself did, so I left out a star for that.	
1. 	We got this before our daughter was born.  It seemed like a good alternative to the bouncers, since it can be used much longer.  As a newborn, she would sleep in it swaddled, loving the vibrations.  I moved it all over the house so I could get things done while she either rested or watched and played with the toy bar.  Best - she laid in this while I got a shower!  We used a Snuzzler to keep her cozy.Now that she is 15 months, we still use this chair.  She has some significant physical delays, so she can't get out by herself, but buckled in, she swings her legs and rocks like crazy!  She still likes the vibrations when she is tired, and she grabs at the toys and rattles them around.  This chair is deep enough that she can still sit in it, relax her back and neck and still be comfortable.We found this to be a great buy, and one of the few things we have used in different age stages.  I would like to see an auto shut-off for the vibration, as we frequently forget to turn it off and go through batteries quickly.	
1. 	This warmer worked great and it was so convenient for the middle of the night feedings to not have to go up and down the stairs.  I used it for almost 3 months and then I went to the microwave.  I know everything warns you not to use the microwave but it works just fine and is much quicker.  Now that my 3 month old is sleeping through the night, I don't have to worry about the convenience factor.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this warmer.	
- 1	The title pretty much says it all. This monitor sends a signal to your iDevice through an app, and the app doesn't work. In my experimentation, it fails to connect more often than it connects, and crashes more often than it fails to connect.If Belkin can get the app stable and functional, this product has potential. No baby monitor i've tried (2 audio-only and 3 video/audio monitors) can get a signal from the nursery to the deck. That means that on beautiful summer evenings, i can't sit out on the deck unless i'm willing to not be able to hear the baby. I can, however, get a very strong wifi signal on the deck. So if this product worked, i could go have a cup of tea before bed without worrying that i won't hear if the baby starts fussing.Even so, there could be some improvements. There's a setting for noise cancellation, so you can set a baseline of how noisy the nursery is. For example, if you have a fan or a white noise machine, this gives you the opportunity to set the monitor to not activate on the constant hum of the fan. There is not, however, an auto-detect option. You can't tell them app, 'Ok, this is the current ambient noise level. Set the noise cancelling for exactly this level of noise.'(Or maybe there is, who knows? The box only includes a quick-start guide, not a full manual.)In addition, the top of the monitor lights up with a giant green ring and microphone symbol to let you know it's on and working. There's a little wifi indicator, too. If you've got a distractable baby, or one who likes to wake up at the slightest hint of light, you'll have to paint over the lights or something similarly dramatic.If the app were stable and functional, this could probably be a 4-star product. I assume Belkin will get around to working the bugs out sooner or later, but for now, it's a glowing paperweight.--And if i may go meta here for a moment: see up at the top, where the product description says (Firmware Update)? That's the differentiate this product from, well, the exact same thing also listed on amazon. When this monitor had clocked in 40 very negative reviews, some clever marketing person re-listed it on amazon as a new product. It's not that the firmware isn't updated - it is. You'll find that out when you start trying to use the product and a pop-up window on your iDevice tells you there's a firmware update available. You click 'ok', and your monitor goes dark for 10 minutes, then comes back with no improvement in functionality.Yep, that's right: what differentiates this product from the one with a slightly different name and a 2-star average over 40 reviews is... nothing. You can almost certainly update the firmware on the other version of this monitor. Belkin basically cheated to hide the negative reviews they already had, and lure unsuspecting customers into buying a product that isn't ready for prime time.Stay classy!	
1. 	this is a  great bib for messy meals! the elastic cuffs keep most everything out of the sleeves. it is great!	
- 1	....But I washed them anyway... for $15 dollars I was hoping that my teething son would love them! But they are very hard (besides at the tip) and I'm afraid of him chewing to hard on the parts he's not supposed to. Should have just bought the $5 one that he could chew anywhere on. He is only kind of able to use these... and doesn't really use them much... just bangs on stuff with them.	
- 1	These cute nylon buckets are really cheap!  The straps are already tearing after a couple weeks.  They tilt over easily and the fabric is really thin.  I give this set 2 stars, barely, for at least holding stuff as promised... they won't last and I do not recommend them.  Cheap and cheaply made.	
- 1	This is actually my second Dr. Browns bottle warmer. The first one that we had I dropped it in the dish water while I was trying to clean it. Then we brought the next one and we had used it for about 5 months. The timer stopped working. We would set it for 6 mins and it would turn off after a minute. My duaghter is almost eigh months old. I refuse to buy another one. I'm just going to purchase the  cheap First Years warmer since she will be on whole milk soon. The bottle warmer worked great until the timer broke.	
1. 	you can use any ol' bag with this. go to the dollar store and get some of those kitchen bags. they fit it perfectly. you put the diaper in the hold in the top, turn the handle, and pop. byebye poopy diaper! it can hold quite a few. we only need to change the bag once a week. it really does hide the smell. the diaper champ is the best!	
- 1	After washing, the fabric was extremely wrinkly and doesn't seem to hold up as well for its purpose. I would say if you feel comfortable not washing it at first, then do not wash.	
1. 	this was the main reason why we purchased it. it is still better than nothing but it doesn't quite do the job entirely.	
- 1	This thing was so cheap and so narrow, it wasn't even functional for my 6 week old. I returned it immediately. As soon as I put him in it, I heard a seam splitting (he weighed about 12lbs!) I ordered a REAL ring sling from Etsy, and use it all the time. Don't waste your money.	
1. 	Like so many other reviewers...my husband and I are SO thankful for this thing!  Our babies first few months would have been MUCH more stressful without it.  The vibration soothes her to sleep.  We have such a hard time getting her to sleep in her crib, but she loves this chair.  When she is really cranky and we just can't walk with her anymore, we can put it in her and bounce her with our hands or feet to make her happy.  We didn't start using the toy bar much until she was about 3 1/2 months, but now she loves batting at the toys and watching the lights.	
1. 	My daughters had cups like these when they were young and they were great for playing in the bath tub, wading pool and sandbox.  My 20 month granddaughter loves her set just as much and has gotten a lot of use out of them.	
- 1	I prefer the gates that have those handles which go under the mattress rather than straps.  The straps were difficult to keep in place while putting the mattress back on box spring.  Also, it's extremely difficult to take down.  Perhaps mine is stuck.  Have no been able to take the side down so it remains up and it looks sloppy.  It also doesn't stay up straight.  One side bends inward and takes up sleeping space for my child.	
- 1	Very hard! Our baby cried when he fell on it in his crib. We returned this item-definitely not for us. We do not recommend this.	
- 1	I purchased this drying rack because i needed to dry several bottles and all the parts that come with Dr. Brown bottles. The bottle drying rack is very delicate and easily tipped over if i did not evenly distribute the weight on the top rack. I am a busy mom and I like Dr. Brown Bottles but this drying rack is not something i would recommend to anyone. I also did not like having to figure out how to get all the parts out of the bottom rack if I still had bottles drying on the top rack. I found it easier to use a strainer and just put everything in the strainer and cover it with towel paper. Everything dried over night and it did not take up my time trying to organize everything on a drying rack.	
1. 	I really like this table. It is light and easy to move, easy to put together as well. The jenny lind design has that old style quality that still up to date and looks great. The wood pattern is fantastic and gives the room an understated look while really pulling everything together. Everyone who has seen it with the crib exclamim how pretty it is and how much it reminds them ofnwhen they were little or, from the grandmothers and older moms, how much it reminds them of when their kids were little. This desing brings back great memories at the same time as looking nicely and subtley chic.	
- 1	I'm looking for a good-quality pocket diaper to replace my leaky Alvas that doesn't break the bank. These retail on the Diaper Safari website for almost $14 and have pretty sound reviews both on their site and here, so I figured it was worth a shot since Amazon has them for $5.75 right now. I was sorely disappointed to see that these are identical to Alvas, with a slight modification to add a second pocket opening in the front, as well as different snap pattern. The pattern for the basic diaper shape/PUL is the same though, I discovered by laying one on top of the other. Laying them side by side with the PUL side up, there is absolutely no difference between them aside from the snaps. The insert is the same as well, holding only 3-4 ounces of liquid at best, with compression leaks happening quickly around the legs if the baby is sitting due to the poor-quality microfiber letting out a lot of pee with the slightest bit of pressure. So, I still haven't found a non-leaky pocket that doesn't break the bank, and these are going back (thankfully, Amazon is paying for return shipping).There are only 2 things that make these better than Alvas: the second pocket opening makes stuffing them a little bit less of a pain, and there is a PUL flap on the front for extra protection against pee creeping up through the top of the diaper (especially good for boys or tummy sleepers). If you have a very light wetter or a moderate wetter that you don't mind changing every hour (at least), these are great diapers! If you want to go a bit longer between changes, skip right past these.	
- 1	I bought these toilet seat covers because we were going on vacation. They are nice and cover the toilet well. Unfortunately, the tape is USELESS. There are 2 pieces of tape at the front of the cover. However, ALL public toilets have U-shaped seats and there is NO SEAT at the very front. So, there is nothing for the 2 pieces of tape to stick too. So, you can't stick the cover onto the toilet. Also, I don't think you can flush them which is annoying.	
- 1	This bag is made of very thin plastic which looks very poor quality. It is quite small too. I am planning to return it as soon as possible.	
1. 	I received this mobile as a hand-me-down and it has been great so far.  I really like the sound quality of the music and animal noises.  I also like the light projection of the stars and moons on the underneath of the mobile on the night setting; it can even be seen during the day with the blinds and curtains closed in the room.  My 10 week old son seems very interested in this mobile and helps soothe him to sleep when other methods are not cutting it.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet.  The mobile is detachable for when babies start pulling up but you can still use the base.  I know my friend's daughter enjoyed the music on the base as she grew older and could hit the buttons herself.  Also, the remote will turn the mobile both on and off.	
- 1	We got this because our baby likes facing out.  It is way to heavy and hot.  I suggest the Ergo baby they just started to make a forward facing carrier.	
- 1	I really don't see the big deal about this toy, and neither does my 10 month old.  He's not the least bit interested in it, and I've shown him that the legs make sounds.  He doesn't care.  I think it was a waste of money.  Oh well.	
1. 	Unlike the Diaper Genie, the Diaper Champ can be used for both disposable and cloth diapers. We have two of them since we mostly use cloth, but occasionally need to use a disposable. It's great, and very easy to use, but you do have to empty it a couple of times a week or you will get a little stink from all the rotting diapers. It's so easy to use, my 18 mo old daughter figured out how to flip it and started doing it for fun. She's now 2.5 and still loves to flip her training pants into the pail.	
- 1	Our bag is now broken. We are using it as a cover.July 2013 - flight to Panama from US (1 connection).  Arrived ok.Sept 12, 2013 - direct flight from Panama to Uruguay.  Arrived ok.Sept 13, 2013 - while transporting bag to our hotel, first strap broke off.  One strap is inadequate for the amount of weight, but we're doing it anyway.Oct 7, 2013 - in airport, seam tears open.  Bag now has a gash that is several inches long.So, now we're primarily using it only as a cover.  It is better than nothing, I think...but...it is about as durable as a product that would cost $8-10, at most. Not sure how to replace it since we're still in South America.  Our broken bag makes car seat transport even worse than it already was.Padding on the straps is almost non-existent, and not comfortable. Bag seams are weak. Zipper sticks sometimes.  The metal on our strap broke.  Did they not test some sample bags before they started selling these?I sure hope they don't use the same manufacturer for the car seat itself!!	
1. 	Received the crib recently, came less than a week after I ordered it, and everything was packed very nicely.We put it together last weekend and it looks gorgeous.The only issue was that some of the bolts did not easily work with the screws ... so it took a little bit to get the bed put together. We wrapped the toddler rail up and put it aside for later.I ordered the white crib and had to wipe it down after assembly, the smudges we put on came right off.Wood looks to be a good material. I know it is a soft wood - so we'll need to be a little careful with it.It looked really high when we put it together, but now that the mattress is in it's fine.Very pleased with this choice.	
1. 	I have 3 of these, one at my sister's, one for the car and one for home. The only thing I didn't care for THIS one is that it doesn't have a hole in the back of the seat so you can use it as a handle. My other 2 which I had bought for my first son over 5 years ago has it.  I use these chairs for a long time! It made my older son stay put in restaurants!	
1. 	This warmer is great. I looked at many reviews before I bought this one. It warms from the top which is a good feature. I have went through about 10 refills in wipes and so far so GREAT! It says you should add up to 1/2 cup of water everytime you put new wipes in. I have no idea why!! The wipes stay perfectly wet with no water added. My baby sleeps through the night so I go from 8pm until 7am without using the wipes and they don't dry out one bit. No browning either. I didn't use a warmer with my daughter and my son is now 3 months old. I was always told not to get one because then the baby would cry and scream when you had to use a cold wipe (traveling, shopping, visiting, etc.). Then, I used some wipes at my brothers house from a warmer. The expression on my little guys face made me have to have one. He loves it. Before the warmer he never cried or fussed with the cold wipes, but he would jet his arms out to the side and his legs out straight at the first touch of the cold wipes. Not any more. Worth the cost!! One thing though...don't rely on the built in light to give you a lot of light. I don't need to use it b/c as I said earlier my baby sleeps though the night :) but I do use it to check how many wipes are left. I can turn it on and see how many wipes are in there. That is another benefit of this little machine...being able to see when you are running out of wipes. I purchased the Wal-Mart one ( I think it was Lionheart or something like that). I brought it back right away. It is very handy to see how many wipes are left.	
1. 	I got this for my 2 yr old son and he loves the balls more than the net really but he's getting the idea.  It seems durable and suctions well to the wall.  I don't particularly like the bath toys or in this case, the balls, that squirt water because I've noticed if any water is left in them, they have a tendency to mold.  Overall a fun bath toy that my son likes!  I would recommend.	
1. 	Best bibs ever.  Love the pockets, love the washable material, love the sleeves.  Overall, it's great!  Plus it comes in really cute patterns.	
- 1	This pillow is not worth the money! It's not as well padded as I expected it to be. It's just as comfortable as using two regular pillows. I got it because I'm pregnant and I really don't find it very comforting. With my last pregnancy, I had one of those straight body pillows and that worked just fine. I shouldn't have wasted my money on this one.	
- 1	I did not realize there was a deluxe version of this product until I ordered this online. I already have, what I now know is the deluxe version, which I purchased at my local baby store. I loved it so much that I wanted another one for my husband's car. This potty is extremely flimsy. It's too low to the ground & cannot hold my daughter's weight. My daughter is 37inches & 32 lbs. Unless you have a super petite child I would not buy this. When my daughter sat on it the legs buckled (& yes I made sure they were clicked in).	
1. 	Great design, my son loved it!  However, he's a big boy and grew out of it very soon.  I found that the closer to the max weight he got that the swing would stop swinging.  The batteries burn out quickly too.  I felt like a slave to diapers and batteries.  Which seemed a little premature to me since he was only 4 months and couldn't play with toys yet. ;o)	
1. 	I use this at work, I simultaneously use my electric Medela Swing pump to save time. This manual pump works really fast! When I'm at home it's all I use.	
1. 	This fits perfectly on our dresser next to the changing pad.  It holds everything we need for a change (I.e. diapers, wipes, rash cream, etc.  Plus I also have a brush and comb, thermometer, and hand sanitizer (for me) in it too.  This is exactly what we needed!  Thanks!	
1. 	I use this stroller for my baby and 4yr old and it has proved invaluable.  The only this is I wish it had more storage room, but I guess that would defeat the purpose of it not being bulky.	
1. 	I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big.  She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in.  I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat.  Hopefully she will grow into this one.  She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side.	
1. 	The best thing is that this rocker is made to serve children from newborn to toddler who can sit and rock by himself. So far I have tested it on my newborn. The chair offers two options for him - a rocking chair with entertaining toys (including one musical) dangling over his head and a sort of portable bed where he can comfortably take a nap (this is converted from a rocking chair by a lever). My child as of now can only stare at the dangling toys, but I expect him to be able to play with them in a few weeks. The chair has been very helpful in getting him to sit up when he is awake so that I can face and play with him, and the sleepy position - for keeping him asleep but away from his crib.If there are any suggestion I would make, they are: it would have been nice to have a head holder (like car seats have) and that the rod holding the toys was a bit sturdier. Otherwise, not a bad investment.	
1. 	I would have liked for these to be a little more difficult to remove, so that is why I did not give 5 stars. But after buying one pack I did come back and buy a second.	
- 1	If you're a plus size gal at all, you probably wont like this product.  I didn't like it at all since my hips were wider than the product.	
- 1	I purchase this wrap when my son was a newborn in hopes of replacing my Moby Wrap. While I love the Moby, it is SO HOT. I live in Georgia and my son was born in the spring. I needed a lighter fabric that would be comfortable in the humid ninety-plus degree heat.The fabric is much lighter weight and much cooler than the moby. It's also beautiful colors and I received many complements on it in the few times that I have used it.However, it is not nearly as comfortable as the Moby Wrap. The Moby is made of a soft stretchy cotten that is soft on my skin and baby's. With this wrap, the edges dug into my shoulders the heavier my son became. It also seemed to rub under his legs.This wrap was useful to me while he was small enough to keep his legs tucked into the wrap (until about 8 weeks). Up to that point he was not heavy, so it didn't rub my shoulders. My son is now 18 pounds at 4 months and I can no longer use it. It was far too expensive for such little use.* I followed the instructions on the DVD, but some people may be able to tie the wrap to avoid the problems that I had. I purchased a Beco rather than continue experimenting with this wrap. It's so much easier.	
- 1	If you have a shorter faucet, don't buy this item. It won't work properly, and the water will just spew out the side of it all over the floor.	
1. 	this was a back saver for me while nursing. It was hard to nurse without support and something sturdy to put my feet on. This is well worth the money.	
- 1	I realize I am in the minority here, but I really did not like this pillow. I know it is supposed to sit right under your chest for breastfeeding, but I found it to still be WAY too tight to wear comfortably. (For reference, I weighed 135 before pregnancy and gained 35 pounds. I'm only two weeks postpartum, but I still don't consider myself to be exceptionally large at this point.)I do like that there is the option to turn the pillow upside down and use it to sit Baby up, though we haven't used much of that side yet. And the optional vibration is also an interesting feature, though, again, my baby isn't that interested in it yet.Overall, and especially for the price, I'm not terribly impressed with this pillow. If I can't comfortably use it for breastfeeding, then what's the point? I'd rather use myBoppy Pillow with Slipcover, Peaceful JungleorMy Brest Friend Original Pillow, Fireworkspillows. At least they fit around me.	
- 1	I ordered this Woombie because of the great reviews here on Amazon.  The pattern is very cute, but the fabric is too stretchy.  My baby kept startling awake in this thing and rubbing his hands up onto his face which bothered his sleep.  From the reviews and description I felt like baby should have been more confined by this blanket.  The fabric was very thin, almost too thin even for summer, unless you're sleeping with no air on.	
- 1	The product serves it's purpose, but it's far too large. Since it extends out past each side, if a drawer is opened without moving the guard (ex, open a drawer to the left or right) the oven door comes flying open and the guard crashes off loudly. I guess it's not meant for leaving on full-time? It hit my baby last night (luckily not too hard) but gave us a big scare. It should come coupled with an oven latch and/or in unique sizes.The plastic pieces affixed to the oven door has turned dark in color and it concerns me that toxic chemicals from the plastic are leaking into the air when it gets hot.The plastic edges are sharp, and my husband cut his finger on it fairly badly.I feel better that my daughter can't reach up to grab a pan, but all the other problems are dangerous in themselves. I'm not very happy with this purchase.	
- 1	Bought the Pee-a-boo forest for my LO and I am not impressed. The pages make a crinkly sound, there is not a story to follow ... I don't really get the book, my son seem to enjoy the crinkly noise but I could have have the same reaction if I handed him some tissue paper ... I wouldn't recommend this book. 2 stars because it catches somehow my LO's attention.	
1. 	This makes it very convenient to use the car seat in two cars without having to mess with the seat belt.  Snap in and snap out quickly and easily.	
- 1	I laughed out loud when I opened this. It is a small SMALL piece of fabric with some ties on it. It covers about 1/4 of the sheet. What are the chances that my son will wet/throw up./whatever perfectly in that spot? Some people say to get two, but why dont they just make it bigger and charge more? It seems silly to me. Not happy at all with this. Sending it back for sure!	
- 1	Have been trying different carriers and saw the price and couldn't believe a carrier could be so cheap. Well, it is, and it's not worth it if you are looking for a good carrier that is comfy and will keep your baby in a good, healthy position where they are not hanging from their... well, you get what I mean (look at the pics showing body position).Especially in the front-facing-out position, this was awkward for me. The baby's weight is moving away from you, so it's like you are being pulled forward. This also does nothing for my back. After about 20 minutes, I'm really feeling it back there. I tried adjusting things. Seems the best position is if the baby is facing me. Apparently, this is supposed to be better for little babies anyway, as facing out doesn't allow the baby to be able to turn away/into you if they get overstimulated. Well, I could carry in the baby-facing-in position longer, but only a little longer. Also, the baby was really red in the diaper area afterwards, as if there was a lot of pressure there (can't be comfortable, you know).In my opinion, there are many better options out there. If you have to have the facing out option, get a Beco Gemini. Yeah, it's more money, but baby seems so much happier in it (may be the carrying position is more like they're in a seat, and not hanging) and my back doesn't kill me after 20 minutes. We tossed the Infantino. Lesson learned.	
1. 	I bought this exersaucer when my daughter was 3 months old and had enough head control for an upright toy.  We already had a jumperoo that I had received as a gift, and since she really enjoyed playing in that, I thought an exersaucer (with so many more toys than the jumperoo) would be even more fun.  I also felt that the exersaucer would be a bit easier for her to use at first since at its lowest setting it's lower than the jumperoo and therefore better for slightly smaller children.At first, the sheer number of toys was extremely overwhelming to my daughter.  She would only stay in the exersaucer for a minute or two before she started to cry.  We kept putting her in for a minute or two every day, and she quickly worked up to sitting in it for five minutes or more.At this age, she's still not doing much deliberate playing with the toys.  However, the design of the exersaucer and its toys allows her to make a lot of things happen even without really trying.  By facing her towards the interactive book, she manages to trigger the lights and sounds just with her random batting at what's in front of her.  By facing her in the opposite direction, towards the hanging toys, she can easily spin the kaleidoscope wheel by herself, and with a little help she can pull the hanging toys to trigger lights and music.  As she continues to grow and develop more dexterity, she will be able to use each of the toys even more fully.One of my favorite features of this exersaucer, though, is the ability to swap in and out different toys in addition to those that originally came with the SmartSteps.  Three of the included toys (the cell phone, teddy bear and turtle) have interchangeable bases that work with a number of replacement toys.  Each replacement toy (purchased separately) is marked with what kind of educational development it's supposed to encourage, and they cost a very reasonable $3-$8 (approx.) each.  So, for a few dollars extra, you can buy some additional toys to focus on different developmental goals as your child grows and give your child even more to do on this exersaucer.As for assembly and storage, the exersaucer has a slightly smaller footprint than the jumperoo or the aquarium cradle swing, and I've found it much easier to move from room to room than either the jumperoo or cradle swing.  It also easily collapses into a relatively flat circle, which makes it good to pop in the car and take along as a portable entertainer.  Assembly was easy except for installing the lower (green) legs into the yellow base.  The instructions say to snap all three green tabs into the yellow base.  What the instructions don't say is that if you don't do it in the right order, it's virtually impossible.  When you look at the tabs, you'll see that two are identical to one another and the third looks slightly different.  Snap the different-looking tab in first, and then snap the other two in - it makes the whole process go much more smoothly.Overall, I highly recommend this exersaucer.  Yes, it costs a few dollars more than the next most expensive brand, but for the tremendous amount of stuff included in it, it really is a bargain.	
1. 	Best bottle brush I have used to date.  I have gone through all kinds of bottle washers.  They all fall apart after a short time of using.  This bottle brush is high quality and lasts and lasts and lasts!  I bought 2 more. Still using the first one!!	
1. 	We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls.  I definitely recommend this gate!!	
- 1	Bought it for my baby girl when she was 3 mth only and couldn't fit into it all eventhough it clearly notes for 0-6mth.The hat looks nice on picture but since it is not stretchy, it is not accommodating at all.	
- 1	Thought this was cute at first but the opening is way too smaill for toddler hands!  My son struggles to pull his hand out with his snacks.	
- 1	This thing is so tiny, I think it must be 3&#34; total across.  You would think that the underside would be covered in rabbit material, but no.  The underside and top side, behind the ears, are just a little blue block.  This cover you see only covers all sides, but not top or bottom of the blue block that is supposed to be the ice pack.  It's a hard blue square and once  you freeze it, the block will be come extremely cold with frost on it.  So tell me, who wants to put a frozen plastic block on your child?  I thought that was the point of this thing.  To have it be an ice pack for boo boos?  How can that be if it's open with no cover??  Would you get an ice pack from your freezer and put it skin to skin??  No.  So why would we put this little frozen plastic square skin to skin on our baby??  This company needs to toss this design and get the rabbit material on the underside to protect baby's skin!!!!Also, it's so damn small, it's like the size of a mouse at Petco.  Unless you plan on using it sideways, you will give your baby freezer burn in no time at all.  I am returning this for a refund, STUPID IDEA.	
1. 	My two year old loves this chair. We are just practicing sitting on it right now. It fits her well and it's easy for her to get on and off it. It doesn't slide around on the floor and she seems to be comfortable while using it.	
1. 	I've owned this for about a year now and here's what I like:  LOVE the projection on the ceiling, music volume levels, music choices.  My son continues to love it and use it to calm down to fall asleep.  The only thing I would change is I wish it had a remote to start it over again.  Also, we ended up buying a battery charger because it does use the batteries pretty quick.  But I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.	
1. 	First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.	
- 1	This pillow is quite small and low quality, sort of like a relatively flat travel pillow. My two year old could not use it comfortably. Instead, she selected a normal, but not too fluffy, regular pillow and this one is currently in use by stuffed animals. Honestly, if you are big enough to use a pillow, you are too big for this pillow.	
1. 	When we first bought our baby home, we needed a place to bathe him. So we purchased a bath tub device that fit into the kitchen sink. It worked well and we got good use out of it. However, after about 6 months of growth, the baby was getting a bit big for the tub. My wife began taking him into the shower and that worked well too. The kid just loves baths, I should add. Then my wife found this Munchkin inflatable tub which we're using at the present time.The inflatable tub works well. It fits our tub well and the kid loves it. Personally, I could do without the cutsie-poo duck head and tail as it increases the difficulty of storing the thing without deflation. Does the kid really appreciate the duck and recognize it? Not really. That corny stuff is for the adults and taking pictures. But the tub itself works well. He loves splashing with a little bubble bath in it. Our faucet extends far enough that the tub water can be continuously refreshed. The tub is easy to drain. I just open the plug and wait for the water to leave (holding the plug open with one finger speeds the process). I like the little heat indicator, but my own testing by dipping my hand into the water is all that's really needed. It's a good product that's probably a bit overpriced.Gary Peterson	
1. 	I just bought this because my daughter is getting too big for her plastic tub. She loves it! It is very soft and seems very comfortable for her, and she stays warm. Dries quickly. Highly recommend!	
- 1	Maybe if I had gotten this when she was younger I wouldn't think it was such a waste of money.  To get any results it has to be used on the nail for quite a while longer than my baby (and probably most) will hold still.  I got this so that I wouldn't have to try to cut her nails only while she was sleeping and it ends up that would be the only way she would hold still long enough.  I'm sad I wasted my money.	
- 1	I received an Ameda pump from my insurance company.  The flange was too big and suction poor, so I tried these.  They insert into the regular size flange.  This was the right size for me, but did not improve the suction from the pump.  Just didn't work for me.	
- 1	This seat was fine when I was able to carry it around when my baby was small enough. Now that he is much bigger, and the damn thing is impossible to pick up without bursting a few blood vessels and developing a hemorrhoid, I find I have to leave it in the car.In principle this is fine, BUT... trying to tighten the straps while the child is in the seat is nigh on impossible. It takes me about 15 minutes every single time. By the time I am done, I have a screaming baby and a shirt drenched in sweat from the sheer exertion of wrangling this beast.The main issue is that in order to tighten the straps, you have to pull outwards on them. The issue with that is that when the seat is installed in the base in the car, you cannot pull outwards because the back of the seat of the car is in the way.The straps are also very short, so when you loosen them and try to take your child's arms out you have to contort and bend them into some very unnatural positions. And loosening them isn't fun either. You have to dig your fingers into a small hole, which is positioned at the very point on the seat where a child's kicking feet are most likely to get in your way.And finally, my final rant of disapproval is that when you install this thing without the base it is the most frustrating and time consuming part of it all. The lap belt fits OVER the child's legs and actually constricts them. You cannot take the child out without undoing the whole system which is tough because as you unbuckle the belt, the seatbelt retracts inwards and locks, meaning if you don't catch it in time you can't remove the seat without GREAT difficult.Please do not buy this. You will not be happy. If you are even considering it - picture yourself with sweat pouring down your face as you wrestle with the straps and your baby cries and screams and kicks and see if that mental image changes your mind.	
1. 	This gate was very easy to put up and is very sturdy.  It is also convenient since there are no levers to pull or push with your hand to open.  It's totaly hands free leaving you to carry other things while you walk through the gate.  We thought that the opening might be a little small, but once it's up it doesn't seem so bad.	
- 1	I thought this product would be a great,cheaper alternative to the woombie. I was wrong.  This product was not strong enough for my 9 pound baby. She could easily get her hands out the top of the swaddle pod. I suggest spending the extra money to get a woombie....unless of course your baby is not super active with her hands.	
- 1	These work for storing milk in the fridge and as a travel case for formula powder but do not work well for freezing breast milk.  The base of the container cracked and broke each time we took it out of freezer to defrost.  They say that it can be frozen but didnt work for us.  Search for &#34;snappies&#34; these are awesome containers!	
1. 	We've had great luck with this tub. Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. Our son has fit just perfectly.  The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.	
1. 	The mattress pad cover adds extra cushion to my baby's mini crib mattress. It's soft and doesn't shrink after multiple washes.	
1. 	I LOVE these bibs!  They are absolutely worth the extra money.  They are a cinch to clean, and as a bonus, we always get compliments on how adorable they are.  Highly recommended!	
1. 	I tried 6 different cup holders for my Baby Jogger City Versa (LOVE the stroller, by the way) and none of them worked until I tried this one. It was relatively easy to install and it fits great. The cup holder is big and feels sturdy. I was also able to easily remove the stickers so the cup holder looks like it belongs with my stroller. The stroller folds easily with the cup holder attached so there is no need to ever remove it.	
- 1	these leggings are a nice soft cashmere-type material but they frayed the second they went into the wash. I didn't even think that this was going to be an issue since I have other Little Legs products and this wasn't an issue. Just wash by hand.	
- 1	I thought I would love this bottle, but my baby and I both ended up not liking it much. The disc to help prevent leaking while shaking works, but then it's annoying if you are out and about because it's covered in milk and you can't just throw it in the diaper bag like you can with a lid for other bottles. Then, if your baby doesn't finish the bottle and you put the lid back on, it will leak unless you put the disc back in place. It also seemed to me that the measurements weren't very accurate on the side. Lastly, the flow of the nipple was always too fast or too slow for my baby. The nipple it came with became too slow for her, so I bought new nipples that were faster flow, but then she was drowning in milk and wouldn't eat.	
1. 	Our son had unfortunately developed a flat head on one side when he was still very young, probably from being in a car seat too often and in a cradle swing that I later discovered was tilted. An expert told us to try this product, so our son wouldn't rest his head as much against a surface. I thought it was a great product, I was amazed how well he could sit up in this at such a young age. It really supported his back very well. It also seemed safe to me, we never used it on elevated surfaces of course and it seemed impossible for him to get out. I have never had any issues and I used it before they added a safety belt. Our son is now 2 years old and I resold the product but I will buy one again for our new baby girl.	
1. 	You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a hospital grade breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE	
- 1	my baby doesn't like it, i don't like it... the sounds aren't as good as the forest mobile one... idk if it will be worth it to invest into another one...i'm thinking not... BUT it was easy to assemble, it works, long battery life (given we barely use it ;)). i wish the octopus would look down instead of out to the side, since baby is staring into... well the bottom of the legs ...and it is missing legs. if you don't think about it it's great... if you think too much this mobile doesn't make sense, ha-ha.	
- 1	The first night I tried this, my newborn slid down in between the bumpers.  This product is dangerous.	
1. 	We got this one and the Summer Infant and they're so similar you might as well get the cheaper one. This one is definitely taller but our son hasn't had better or worse luck with either one.	
1. 	MUCH easier to use than the plastic shields that you plug into the outlet.  Those are always a huge pain to pry out so you can use the outlet.  With this you simply slide the spring-loaded cover over and plug in your appliance.  When the cord is removed, it springs back into place to cover the outlet.  Simple, easy, effective.  Just wish they were a less expensive as spending $24 on a half dozen of these is awefully rich.	
1. 	I have 4 of these changing pad covers in Ecru and absolutely love them! They fit the pad perfectly and the color is great. It is very neutral and although light, does not show a lot of dirt. Also when my daughter has an accident, the pad absorbs the wetness but it does not seep through to the pad inself. I have washed the covers dozens of times and they have retained their quality and are still very soft. I would recommend washing them by themselves the first few times due to the lint they generate. The cover is very easy to change and has elastic on the edges so it stays on the pad securely, which is very important when you have a baby that moves as much as mine does.	
1. 	i started to use this one 2 months ago since the baby is borned, and it work perfectly fine. you need to try the tem before give it to baby anyway.	
- 1	These have leaked several times and they are way to thin. They would be good for when a baby is older and drinking less.	
- 1	Although my child thoroughly enjoyed this product, I believe it's probably safe to assume it contains BPA.  Also when my child punctured it, I called the company, and I was told they couldn't help me. They wouldn't even send me a repair patch. My baby didn't even have teeth and he punctured it.  On that note, I tossed it in the trash.  I really thought it wouldve lasted longer.	
1. 	I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).	
1. 	I think the toothpaste tastes a little funny but daughter really likes it.  She does not want anything to do with the finger toothbrush though, and we use either the baby banana toothbrush or the baby buddy first toothbrush.  Given that you use so little toothpaste, this little tube lasted us for several months.	
- 1	With all the rave reviews and my love for Playtex VentAir bottles, I was very excited about this bottle. Yet, both me and my baby hated it. First off, the bottle itself is huge, which makes it uncomfortable in many ways. Second, even the slow flow nipple somehow seems too fast and makes my baby choke on his milk. In any case, we used it a couple of times and went right back to VentAir. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	I found this at a thrift store and almost didn't buy it - what a mistake that would have been!! I'm going to buy a large one now. This thing is an absolute lifesaver!! Babies learn how to wriggle out of being swaddled pretty fast, but this thing is AMAZING!! They can still move around, but not startle themselves and they stayed covered up.I LOVE IT!!	
1. 	My cousin let me use her Snugli carrier when I had my baby. I thought it was horrible - there was no support at all. I had to hold onto the back of my baby's head the entire time and he did nothing but cry while he was in it. I gave her Snugli back to her and bought the Eddie Bauer one instead. I do agree with the other reviewers in that the straps slip and there is no way to keep them from doing so. However, it's very gradual (happens more/faster when you're doing vigorous activities) and it's not a huge deal to tug on the straps to pull them tighter. Also, it only took me one time putting it on to have the straps all figured out, and as long as you pull it off in a normal fashion the straps don't get all twisted and you can put it on easily the next time. I will say that the baby likes it a lot. He's seems very comfortable; his head is supported and he falls asleep every time I put him in it. I also find it to be comfortable for me to wear...well, as comfortable as you can be with a baby strapped to the front of your body while you vacuum!	
1. 	It is awesome, because my back says thank you... It is so convenient, I recommend so much... Really I do...	
- 1	My baby received this rattle as a gift and enjoyed it until it started incessantly buzzing.  The sound mechanism must have malfunctioned and went from cute monkey noises to a constant and loud buzz.  Replacing batteries did not fix it so it's just a hard plastic toy at this point.	
1. 	Love it! it fits almost anywhere you put it!  plus it's soft so if the baby was to fall on it they will not get hurt by sharp edges.	
1. 	Highly recommend buying online from Amazon the prices in the store are a lot higher these are good bottles cause you can actually hear the air coming out bottom less colic, and you can take them apart so your getting a cleaner bottle and can order different flow nipples . Recommend this item .	
1. 	Speed & QuantityAs one who expressed 30-ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy I can attest to the speed, and efficiency of the Pump In Style.  While on vacation, I misplaced the membranes to the Pump In Style, which are vital for operation.  Considering my breasts were ready to burst, I purchased an Avent Isis hand pump.  The Isis was great in a pinch, or for a weekend away; however, the Pump In Style was superior in speed and quantity.  With the Pump in Style I expressed 16-ounces in 20 minutes, whereas it took me 30 to 40-minutes to express 10-ounces with the Isis.ComfortUsing a breast pump takes time and practice.  It can also be painful especially if your nipples are cracked and bleeding.  I used the PurLan breast cream after each session, so I never experienced discomfort.  The Pump In Style accommodates small and large chests alike.  Small breast shields are provided as well as large breast shields for optimum suction, and comfort.  The suction is adjustable, and it's recommended that one start with the lowest of speeds.  I quickly graduated to the highest speed, which made for very effective pumping.Set-up & CleaningSetting up the Pump In Style is a breeze compared to the Isis pump.  There are 5-simple steps in all, and it takes 2 to 3-minutes tops.  Make sure the tubing is fitted securely, and that the membranes are dry, and laying flat.  Start pumping. After each session, disassemble and wash.  Most of the parts in the accessory kit are dishwasher safe, and can be used in a steam sterilizer as well.  Although, the membranes and tubing should be hand washed only.  If running through the dishwasher, store the valves in a basket for protection from the heating element.StoringThe Pump In Style includes a built-in insulated compartment with zipper enclosure.  The compartment stores up to 20-ounces of breast milk.  3-rectangular cooling packs keep the breast milk cold for hours.  Medela includes 20-CSF collection bags for storing, which I bought separately.  They feature measurement indicators in both milliliters, and ounces.  Labels are included as well, so the date can be recorded.  I do not recommend storing full bags in the insulated compartment as it has the potential for making a huge mess.  They should go right into the freezer, or refrigerator.  I didn't like the twist tie assembly, so I used them for stock piling frozen breast milk.  The bags are durable, and they freeze well; although, I had a difficult time propping them up so they wouldn't fall.  Spilled breast milk is something to cry about.Breast milk can be stored in the refrigerator, or in the freezer.  Freshly expressed milk may stand at room temperature for up to 4-hours; however, it should be refrigerated if temperatures exceed 77.  Breast milk will remain fresh in the refrigerator for up to a week.  One may store expressed milk in a self-contained freezer for up to 4-months, and up to 1-year in a deep freezer.  Frozen breast milk can be defrosted in the refrigerator, in a bottle warmer, or at the tap.  Never re-freeze thawed breast milk.PortableThe Pump In Style is a working moms dream.  One can pump between meetings, and store in the refrigerator, or in the built-in insulator.  If storing breast milk in the refrigerator at work, be sure to mark it, as others may be tempted to flavor their coffee unknowingly.  The pump and all its parts weighs 7-lbs.  This isn't heavy, but when loaded with 3-frozen ice packs, and 4-full bottles it can weigh up to 12 pounds.  The weight was rarely a problem for me, but it's something to consider if carrying a fully loaded breast pump, a newborn, a diaper bag, and a purse.  The battery pack is great for on-the-go pumping, but it eats batteries, so I didn't use it much.  Oh, and on the road pumping with the vehicle lighter adapter is available for an additional fee.  I would have definitely invested in one had I known about it.In evaluating this breast pump, there are so many positives it's actually difficult for me to find negatives.  Therefore, I believe the benefits outweigh any objectionable points.  If asked to present a con, I would suggest the following.  Upon occasion, breast milk will leak into the tubing.  This isn't a huge issue.  All you do is remove the tubing, and soak it in warm soapy water.  Hang the tubing to dry.  If dried breast milk is discovered in the tubes, then disinfect them by boiling in a pan of water.  Hang the tubing to dry.  Thus, I found it best to sit up straight when pumping.  For me, this pump was a way for me to offer my son breastmilk, so I definitely recommmend it!	
1. 	expensive, but one of the items i use at least every other day.  my daughter is small, so it was pretty necessary for her comfort in the highchairs in restaurants and the grocery carts.  she loves the feel of it and that toys can be hung on the loops!	
1. 	I bought this blue HALO sleepsack after receiving a cream colored one from the hospital.  I had purchased a set of the Summer Infant swaddlers, but my son did not like them at all.  Every single time I put him in one of these HALO sleepsack's he immediately would fall asleep.  I didn't have to worry about him being too cold during the night, or worry about loose blankets.  He did prefer to have his arms out once he was around 2 weeks old, so I'm so happy that option is available.  If I ever have another child, I will be ordering several of these.  I did see the review about the wings ending up over baby's face, and I did experience this, a simple adjustment to make sure the wings were positioned correctly and tightly eliminated this problem.  Out of all of the baby gear out there, I really think this is a must have!	
- 1	They advertise this on Amazon as a nursery item. I would strongly advise against it.I ordered 4 white baskets, with the hope to store diapers, wipes, creams etc. in my baby's room, in an accessible area for everyone. All of the four baskets had the same issues:- Terrible chemical odor, probably from the paint.-  The paint was peeling off and was chipped throughout. It looked like a dog had spray painted it, blindfolded.- The end of the wicker was not tucked in safely, but rather exposed on the outside and was as sharp as skewers all around it.I regretted this purchase as soon as I received my order, and sent it back immediately. I would not recommend this to anyone..	
- 1	my 6 month old like to put everything in his mouth and is pleased that the mirror/music box hangs at just the right height for this.  the toy as a whole however is not great.  the mirror only plays one tune 90% of the time.  twice i have heard something different and wondered if it was a new song or the batteries dying.  the music lasts a very short period of time and is very hard to activate.  it has to be hit just right.  while i like the way the toy attaches, with two easy to use clamps, the joints, which make the toy angled, do not work well and the music isnt a great feature.  the mirror is low quality and images are very distorted. on a positive note, the bird has balls in its belly, which turns, and the fan works well with the pulling of the string.	
1. 	I originally bought these bottles b/c they were recommended by almost every breastfeeding person that I asked and since I was planning on breastfeeding I decided to go w/ this starter kit.  I appreciated the variety of things the kit had to offer.  My baby was born prematurely and never really took to breastfeeding but I decided to pump breastmilk and feed it to her via bottle.  I tried several other brands, but none worked as well as these did for her.  I always found myself buying a few more of these.  I have fed my child 6-8 bottles a day using Avent bottles since the day she came home from the hospital and only had 1 incident of leakage and I recognized what I had done wrong and was able to correct the problem w/o further error.  I also use these for storage from time to time w/ the addition of a sealing disc.  It would have been nice to have a couple of sealing discs included in this pack.	
1. 	We love this wearable blanket so much that we bought every kind. They are wonderful. First I must say that they, obviously, do not confine the arms, so if your baby still gets startled by her jerky arm movements when trying to fall asleep he/she may not be ready for this yet. I am slowly making the transition from the Miracle Blanket over to this. My baby still needs the extra swaddling at night and when she is fussy, but she likes the freedom during her naps that this provides and likes to get at her fingers too.I did not find that my cotton sleep sack shrank. The zipper doesn't lay exactly flat on her, but I haven't found this a problem at all.I do feel the sizes run a bit small. My baby is wearing the small size and at 23 has just about outgrown it. I'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need.I don't like that there are no arm sleeves at all. I really would have liked the choice of putting her in one with or without sleeves.This cotton is so nice and light (I wonder if the other reviewer was reviewing a fleece, flannel or quilted one instead) that I can't imagine it being any lighter without being to fragle to hold together.I very much like that the zipper is upside down. It undoes from the bottom which means you don't have to completely unzip your baby for diaper changes and the zipper tab doesn't poke into the baby's chin.	
- 1	We bought this cup for our 6 month old and from the very beginning it leaked.  The nipple was very soft and my daughter seemed to enjoy biting it more than using it to drink.  But when she would tilt it back all the water would just soak her neck and shirt.  I could never give her this cup without her shirt being soaked.  Also it would leak in the diaper bag as well.  Very disappointed... currently searching for a new cup to transition from bottle.	
1. 	It was a great gift for a baby shower and half the price as in the store. Wish the packaging was a little better though.	
- 1	My son loved this toy on his carrier. But, one week after we attached it to the car seat, it started leaking! I was so disappointed because my son really like the music, and especially pushing the beads back and fourth, and making them rattle.I also found myself constantly attaching it and removing it to be able to get him in and out of the carrier. While it was at a fine height with the carrier handle raised, it hit him in the face when the handle was moved back so that he could be put in or taken out of the seat.A really disappointing product from Baby Einstein. We love and own many of their other items.	
1. 	I like this product... we got it for my 16 month old at Christmas so he can get used to seeing the potty and sitting on it, even though we're not potty training yet. My only complaint is that I wish the pieces would clip in place so they weren't so easy to remove. My son has taken this whole &#34;getting used to the potty&#34; thing to heart and likes to take the potty apart. Not an issue now, but I'm sure it will be once he starts using it!I also like that it LOOKS enough like a toilet that he tries to &#34;rinse&#34; his cloth diapers in it... (like I said, he's a fan)	
1. 	NOthing special going on here with this teether. Its just your normal teether that you can buy anywhere. Its a little bulky.. But it does hold onto a freeze quite well. I wish I knew if I could sterilize it. So if anyone knows..... Please tell me	
1. 	These bottles are exceptional and do everything they claim they do. They are a natural shape and make it easy to feed the baby. The ventaire system does significantly reduce the amount of bubbles, which means less gas, burps and a happier baby. They are easy to clean, and I love the fact they have covers to keep the nipples free of dirt/dust, etc. Overall, a great set of five starter bottles for twenty dollars. I highly recommend.	
- 1	Horrible design! I should've listened to the other reviews. It will stay on my daughters Graco stroller as long as she doesn't touch it! The music hippo is cute and the toys catch her attention but bad design overall.	
- 1	It worked fairly well, starting out, then the bristles began to fall out this morning. I've only had it a couple of days, but the bottles have at least 6 pieces to wash and maintain. I was hoping it would stand up to the constant use. Perhaps I just managed to get a bad brush, but it didn't last; at least not for me.	
1. 	I don't know what I would do without this bib. It is so easy to rinse clean and then wipe dry so it's always ready to use. The pocket is a lifesaver. About 1/2 the food my 8 month old eats ends up in the pocket rather than on his pants. It has fit my son perfectly since he was 6 months old and he seems comfortable wearing it. Because of this bib I can relax while my son plasters himself with food, because I know cleanup will be fairly easy. I have tried other bibs and none of them even come close it the convenience of this one. If you have a baby, you need this.	
1. 	Love this bib as I was sick of baby getting her sleeves so dirty.  The pocket is great as it catches the food she drops.  And it's so easy to clean in the sink right after she eats since it's waterproof.  What I don't like is the tie back.  I also bought a sleeved bib by SillyBillyz that has snaps on the back and the neckline is also fabric and stretchy.  Now, if it was only waterproof SillyBillyz would be perfect.  But I still prefer it over Bumkins.	
1. 	Love this potty.  I highly recommend this potty.  It works well and I can't imagine anything better.  I can definitely recommend it.	
1. 	A little pricey for having to replace every three months, but if this is all I have to replace it is well worth it.	
1. 	Child refuses to keep a blanket on. They are great on my now 16 month old who has figured how to take her pants (and occasionally diaper) off, but has not figure out the upside down zipper!	
1. 	These bibs are easy to clean, i just wipe them down or throw them in the washing machine, and are made of good material, very happy with my purchase.	
1. 	We love this potty.  We've had 4 other potties and this is my favorite.  It is super easy to clean up and the bright colors are great.  My son still loves to sit on his green potty.  He is 28 months and can easily pee, empty it, and rinse it by himself.  I'm not sure what the people who are complaining about pee going over the place but he can do it by himself with no problems.  Just teach the child to sit properly in a chair & make sure it's not hanging out of the potty (taught my son to tuck it in at 18 months so there really is no excuse).  He is about 32 pounds and 36 inches & I'm sure he will be using it at home for a while.  While he's been using the regular toilet for a while too at home, he loves his green potty.  BTW, baby bjorn makes 2 potties (and a ring too) this is the larger one.  If you are wanting a smaller one, there little potty is great but would not recommend it if you are starting with an older child as it is rather small (my son loved it at 15/16 months and will use it now but I don't think I would buy one that small for an older child).	
1. 	This is an awesome hammock. My wife and I are so happy we purchased it. My daughter has tons of stuffed animals and we figured a hammock would work perfectly.  We are so happy we bought it. Highly recommend!	
- 1	I LOVE the Ergo. I had a Bjorn with my first daughter, and it was fine and uses daily. I decided to try and Ergo with my next one and literally cannot live without it. My 8 month old still uses it. However, I found this insert to be unnecessary. I read the directions and did it correctly, but it just felt cumbersome. My daughter didn't like it either. She fit much better in the regular Ergo, even as a newborn. She weighed 7.5 at birth but lost weight and has been the 5th percentile since. So, she wasn't a huge newborn. I just don't think this is necessary. The regular Ergo is amazing enough on its own.	
1. 	This is a nice little potty, however I wish it was a little heavier; it's way too easy to push around.	
- 1	I was expecting a necklace that I would wear for my daughter to use while teething. When it arrived, I realized it must be for the baby; however, it was too small even for her.  I plan to return it.  I was disappointed having read so many positive reviews & being eager to try it...	
- 1	Pain to install, pain to use and overall terrible. The ones that work work too well so I can't open the drawers- and the others broke within the first try. I do not recommend these locks, they are terrible and frustrating.	
- 1	Not really comfortable toy. My 4,5 month old don't get interested in it at all and when she eventually grabs it - it's so obviously uncomfortable for her to play with it, that she quits in few seconds. Not to mention that it looks more like turkey, not peacock :)	
- 1	I don't understand why they would make a product that does not fit standard corner tables! I need to return this item	
1. 	We did not buy a standard high chair for our home due to lack of space. This high chair seat has worked great over the past year and a half from when he needed the tray to now as he sits at the table. We would also travel with this due to it being able to fold up slightly and when relatives did not have a high chair.	
- 1	I purchased it to protect my 1YO twins from hitting their heads.I loved how it directs the flow of the water.However, shortly after using it I removed it to clean it and there was mold everywhere. I used bleach, tile cleaner and nothing works. The mold is embedded in the plastic.I recently had a vent fan installed in my bathroom and I have a open window (used it in summer warm weather) No where else in my bathroom has mold or moisture issues so teh problem is with the product.	
1. 	I wanted a swing with a hood - and for some reason it has started squeaking after only a few months - but I do like the small size and that it is low to the ground.  I took all of the toys off.	
- 1	UPDATE:Almost 2 years in and the monitor is broken. First the picture faded, but motorola replaced the unit, but The new unit's battery basically died after 6 months, so we had to keep it plugged in. Not a huge deal, but one would think that it would last longer than a year. But now the on/off button is broken and the product is out of warranty. It was good while it lasted, but it just didn't last.We live in a small apartment, so I can't comment on the range, but this monitor works perfectly. The picture is very clear-- yes I can see my baby breathing if I stare at her long enough (and yes, I do stare at her long enough!). And there's no static. Pricey, but worth it, I think.Update: we had this monitor for less than a year before the picture started to degrade. To motorola's credit, they sent us a replacement right away. We now turn the screen  off before we go to  bed because I'm sure keeping it on for so many hours is what killed it.  But now the battery on our new unit lasts only about 30 minutes.	
1. 	I bought this product for two reasons. 1. My daughter is going through a nightmare phase and has ended up in bed with me often lately. She is a thrasher at night and needed something to keep her safe so we could also get some sleep.  2. We plan on transitioning her to a full-sized bed in a few months and predict she will need this based on how much she moves at night so it will get a lot of use in the future.  The rail installed fairly easily. I would say it took my husband a bit longer based on our very heavy tempurpedic mattress and the set up of our bed-frame. It folds down fairly easily as well. My Mom has one at her house as well for when we sleep there and she is equally pleased with this product too.	
- 1	My less thank one year old boys figured these out right within a couple months. If you yank hard enough it opens up. The adhesive started to fail, and the drawers they were talk enough to see into the learned how hot press the latch on their own to open drawer. Ridiculous how easy it was for them.	
- 1	I like the idea but in reality didn't work for us.  We would have had to order 3 sets to cover the 4 sides of his crib which gets pricey. The length (from top to bottom) is not enough for his crib either - his rails are more like 2 or 3 inches.  So he can get his bottom chompers underneath these and still go to town on the wood. And of course he pulls them off easily and throws them to the floor too (11 months).  I'm going to order some cloth ones that can be safely tied on-not interested in a DIY project when it comes to ties and cribs.	
1. 	Bought this for my girls (turtle for my son).  it is adorable even off.  The lights are great (although after 3 months of nightly use the green doesn't seem to work as well) and project onto the ceiling & walls.This does say not suitable for children under 3, but we put it in the middle of the room while the children are in cribs at night so age isn't an issue for us.The turtle by cloud b is also fantastic, my son loves it.i only wish they could stay on longer (after 45 minutes my son is still awake and we have to go and turn the turtle back on).This is a great gift and I look forward to buying more cloud b products for my family.	
- 1	Would give this zero stars if I could.  Every time I wash a bottle, this brush flings soapy water everywhere--all over the sink, counter, and my face!  And the nipple brush is way too thick and the bristles are too hard.  A double-sponge bottle brush is what I had before (a sponge tip and sponge at base, with bristles in between), and that's what I'll be going back to.  And by the way, the tip of the nipple brush rusts right away, as other reviewers have mentioned.	
1. 	I have a Britax Chaperone infant carseat and the base has an excellent lock off feature built in. However I could not get it so tight that it would move less than an inch.  After easily installing the Mighty Tite, it's like the base is a part of the car. It doesn't move at all. I am not a particularly strong or large person and it was a breeze to install. I highly recommend this product.	
1. 	(...)So I switched to the Platex Premium nurser.  She really likes the softness of the nipple and I think it is similar to that of a real breast nipple.I was totally against buying the bags and having to go through the hassle of changing bags and thought it would be messy and expensive...but I only have 5 bottles -- they clean easy, and I just toss a new drop in bag in and it's fast and convienant.	
- 1	I had to return these after one day of usage. Maybe my daughters legs are just too chubby (what toddler doesn't have chubby legs) but they kept slipping down her legs and were so tight they were leaving marks.  I returned them and Amazon was kind enough to let me keep them and not make me go through the hassle of the return.	
1. 	I love this, but its big...real big. I love it, my son loves it and it keeps him and his stuff contained. I have told many people about this item. i would say it should be left up and not taken up and down all the time. I could see how other reviews had brake issues with the play yard, however I have not had any and i think its because I leave it up in one area.	
- 1	It works for what we need it for and it is nice looking.  However our baby is tall (like my husband) and i'm short...about 5'1.  When i wear the carrier with baby in it her legs hit into mine when i walk.  She sits too low in the carrier.  Its not a great fit for short women.	
1. 	I rarely will buy anything without looking at reviews.  This works fine at protecting me even with some of the issues I had prior to giving birth.	
1. 	This is a great toybox. However, 3 pieces came damaged. replacement of the pieces was easy - you order it online. The pieces came damaged because not enough protective packaging was used. Nonetheless, once all the replacement pieces arrived, it was easy to assemble.	
1. 	does great the job! quick and easy removes buggies from our 4 month son's nose. i like it better, because saline water made him cry and these tweezers does not	
1. 	My son (18 months) loves it; he rides him, feeds him (hahahaahahahahhaha) every day and plays and talk to him; it's adorable; recommend it 100 %	
1. 	at first i was against activity centers, as most people use as a babysitter. but my child loved it, before she could even sit up.  she is 14 months old now, and still loves to play with it, so im having a hard time getting rid of it.	
1. 	This bath tub is everything we wanted in a tub for our baby. It has ones side where she can lie down and the other side where she can sit up. We started using this when she was 5 months; she could not yet sit by herself. She is now 8 months and sits very well on her own. She'll use the sitting up side for part of her bath, but still very much enjoys lying down on the other side. I was hesitant when I bought it, but now that we've had it for a few months, I would definitely buy it again.	
- 1	Don't bother buying this. It wouldn't stay on my toilet or keep it closed. It just kept falling off. Pointless.	
- 1	This is completely useless for breastfeeding, or anything else. The opening is really small so it didn't fit around my waist.  (Maybe if i was a size 0 right after giving birth it would have!) Also the curves along the length of the pillow put a baby at the wrong angle for nursing. I have nursed 2 babies through one year and have never used it once! I tried the first day at the hospital until a nurse suggested I use something else. If you are pregnant, don't waste your money! I use a pillow and blanket, or try a product called my breast friend.	
1. 	I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!	
1. 	We have an awesome little girl who just turned 4, and my husband and I thought she would like this. She has Autism, and isn't easy to buy for! She LOVES this! It is amazing how well it projects stars and the moon onto her ceiling, I had no idea it would be as amazing as it is. Even her 8 year old brother loves this thing, and her dad and I like it too. =) The colors are bright and vivid. Beautiful! If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just do it! =) Your little one will LOVE it!	
- 1	I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this product.  I bought these crib rail protectors and my twin boys figured out how to remove them within a few days and they are under 9 months old.  So not only did I waste my money purchasing these, but both of my cribs also have a bunch of teeth marks... exactly what I was trying to avoid.  What a waste!	
1. 	I adore this system.  My son only gets breastmilk, and the system works great for bottling/storing/serving breastmilk.  In conjunction with the breast milk storage kit, I am able to express milk directly into a bottle.  I then twist on a lid and put it in the freezer or fridge.  When the milk freezes solid, I am able to remove the liner and lid from the bottle.  This takes less freezer space and means I don't have to buy that many actual bottles.I will have to keep buying liners, of course.  But the cost isn't prohibitive.  And I did have to buy several storage systems, but compared to paying for formula, I find this cost unimportant.  Particularly because I will be able to use the system again for our next child.It is a tidy, easy system that works great for me and for my son.  He has no problem taking the silicone nipple in spite of the fact that he prefers the breast.  He IS slower about taking the bottle, but he takes it fine nonetheless.	
- 1	I didn't like this cup holder at all. I have a valco stroller (and like it) and I couldn't get the cup holder tight on the stroller. It's not easy to get a coffee cup in and out either. I know there has to be a better cup holder out there. Additionally, I hardly think since it doesn't fit on a Valco stroller that it could even remotely be considered universal. Poorly played, valco.	
1. 	I find this portable high chair to be invaluable when we go on vacation or eat at someone else's house. It is really the only high chair you need. It could easily replace my stand-alone high chair in my dining room and it takes up way less space!	
1. 	I previously had Carter's sheets. THose are a bit thicker weight but in a pinch I wanted a slightly less expensive, and different color, option and this one is fine. The apple green is bright and cheery (not quite as drab as it appears on line).	
1. 	My daughter is 7 months old now and she gets so excited seeing me pull out the finger brush. She LOVES to chew on it more then any other teether we own. She likes the flavor of the tooth paste a lot. I actually have to stop and take my finger away or she would never let me go! It sticks really well to my finger, I'm never worried that it will come off in her mouth, I have to literally peel it off my finger. I just rinse it under the tap and it stays clean. I've put it in the dishwasher before and it came out fine. I think it's a great introduction to brushing and hopefully she will like our upgrade to the banana brush next!	
- 1	Should have unscented bags without the endocrine disrupters then I'd give them 5 star. Its just a conveniently rolled bag so once you tie the bag closed with dirty diaper inside smell wouldnt be an issue anyway	
1. 	My husband is not a big fan of putting together furniture, but this crib was very easy to assemble :-) And it looks gorgeous, we get so many compliments! The best: this crib is toxin-free!!! So far this crib was the only one with a finish that didn't have any toxins in it.	
- 1	The guard is held together with plastic screws that can easily be loosened by my 15 month old twins, but this isn't the biggest problem.The plastic guard blocks the vents of the oven. So if I am baking something hot condensation forms against the plastic and drips.My oven door stays cool even when the oven is on, so it is normally safe for the kids to be in the kitchen. The condensation problem this guard creates, makes it unsafe for my kids or even me to be around it.	
1. 	Love it. Fits perfectly in our changing table and really snuggles our daughter into its center.	
1. 	I was using a basket to hold wipes, lotions, etc and keeping on the changing table.  My daughter is growing and is very long so the basket was in the way.  I looked everywhere for a hanging basket but couldn't find one I liked for a decent price.  This diaper  depot is absolutely perfect.  It hangs perfectly on my changing table.  I did put a piece of fabric under it so the finish doesn't get scratched on the changing table.  I love having everything right there at changing/dressing time without taking up drawer space.	
1. 	I live in a small condo so there is no space for a full high chair and I landed up buying this. This has been great so far. My 22lb 7 month old might fit in this for another couple of months or so and I am okay with that because this is not such an expensive product. I also love the fact that the fastening straps can be buckled and used as shoulder straps when you take this seat along with you during travel. I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a solution that doesnt take up a large footprint.	
- 1	This pump doesn't work well compared to the other one I have tried (Medela Harmony). The shield is small and doesn't work well on breasts that have just gotten milk in! The handle lever is also strange and really big. It doesn't give good suction. Went back to my Medela Harmony manual pump.	
1. 	Perfect for newborn to toddler! It smells great and is a gentle enough cleanser to wash newborn skin, but cleans my toddler son's skin really well after a day at the park! Highly recommend.	
- 1	The pros?  It's cute, and cheap.  That's it.Functionally it bites.  As others have said, the hook-and-loop closure just doesn't work for very long.  Unlike most other diaper covers, there's no secondary loop tape to close up the tabs while you wash it.  This means lint collects in it like crazy.  It also seems to be very low-quality in general.  It worked just fine for about a month (I bought it in late March), and then started popping loose every single time I put it on my daughter.  All she has to do is twitch a tiny bit, and it comes loose.Moreover, the fabric is very thin, and one good pee will come through very fast.I realize there's a big difference between paying $8 for this and $13 for a Bummi cover if you're short on cash (which I am), but you'd really be much, much better off going somewhere like Cloth Diaper Nation or Diaper Swappers and buying used Bummis there than buying one of these new.	
- 1	I bought this based on reviews but did anyone really ask their kid if they like it?  My kid sat in it and said the seat was too hard. Which it is. Essentially it's hard plastic covered with fabric. I can't imagine having my kid sit in this chair for longer than 30 minutes at a time much less for long road trips. I gave this seat to his grandmother to use when she picks him from school and takes him home.	
- 1	I bought a set of these medium flows back in Aug and they are the perfect flow for my baby (now 8 months old).  Then I bought another pack and they are completely different.  First of all, the holes aren't even in the middle of the nipple, they are randomly punched off to the side on most of them.  Also the holes are way smaller, it is more like a slow flow nipple.  And finally, the silicone is thicker than the other batch.  My baby REFUSES to drink from these.  What a waste of money!  I already threw out the packaging or I would have returned these.I have triple checked that I ordered from the exact same vendor before writing this review.  There is another vendor who sells the nipples in a 2-pack, I'm going to order one pack and see if they are better.  LAME, evenflo!!!	
- 1	In our culture, it is preferred to hide the bottle when feeding in public, so I bought these sleeves as they seem to fit the Dr Brown bottles well, but they r verrrrry hard to put them on... so couldn't se them.	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to clean, my daughter loves them. We have used the Dr. Brown bottles before, which worked very well (however, I got tired of cleaning them). I feel bad using the plastic liners, but especially when we are travelling, they come in so handy and I do not have to worry if I washed the bottle well enough.	
- 1	I liked these at first but now I don't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into. They cannot support the weight because they do not bend. I've also had one break, but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on. Keep that in mind. It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I'm not aware of any. Also, I wouldn't call these soft.	
1. 	Got these hoping they'd be more comfortable than regular shields, and they definitely are.  However, the more you wash/sterilize them, the more they start to yellow and will eventually need to be replaced sooner than the regular kind.	
1. 	This dresser was hands-down the easiest furniture assembly I've done in the past several years. All the parts (screws, etc.) were there, all the holes were well-drilled and centered, and everything fit together just as it should. I did nearly all of it by myself, in about three hours. The finished dresser is beautiful and has plenty of storage for all of my daughter's clothes. I would highly recommend this dresser!	
- 1	For some reason they do not contain the order like they use to.  It stinks up the room and it is not even that full.  Not to mention the fumes you get when you drop your diaper in it.  We had to buy a freshner for the room.  We use to buy these at babies r us, so I am not sure if the ones coming from amazon are made differently.  My next purchase will be from BRU and then I will update this if I do notice a difference.	
- 1	This cup is not meant for me, so I rated it on how my daughter respond to it. She almost hates the thing. I have tried multiple times to get her to drink both milk and water from it but after attempting to use it and sometimes just handling it, it is a) give back, b) dropped, c) thrown across the room.I like the designed but since I am not the one drinking from it, what I think does matter. She has the chewy top cups and hard cups like this and drinks from all of them. This thing, she won't even touch now after all my attempts.	
1. 	We put this in our newborn sons room doorway to keep our cats out... they would like to jump into his crib and sleep in it.  As new parents we want the door open to our sons room so we can hear him and not worrying about our cats disturbing him.  The gate is very tall and impossible for them to jump over.  Plus the gate seems like it will be good to use once our son is able to walk we can use in other spots around the house so he doesn't get into trouble.	
- 1	I bought these because they were only cup that my toddler would drink out of but after washing them one time they leak like crazy. Unfortunately I had already bought 8 of them. They are supposed to have an arrow on the top that lines up with the bottom to prevent leaking but it doesn't work. These are horrible.	
- 1	I love Dr. Browns 3.5 oz glass bottles and thought these were essentially the same just a little bigger.  I am SO frustrated with them however because after I got these 4 oz bottles home and washed them (so I can't return them, nuts!) I realized the top/opening is just a little bit off from the standardized size that Evenflow/Dr Browns3.5oz/Medela bottles are.  This means i can't connect them directly to my Medela pump, and I can't use the medela storage covers on them.  Also, the vent system is also just a tiny titch longer than the 3.5 oz Dr Browns vent system, so you can't mix & match.  Very frustrating.  I prefer the 3.5 oz ones for the standardized opening.	
1. 	These bibs are very durable and nicely cover the whole front of our 13 month old daughter.  Also, the sleek fabric is easily wipeable (and don't stain), and because the bibs are not hard or plasticky, they lay nicely and don't bunch up in my toddlers face while sitting. Love 'em!	
- 1	my now 6 mo old son has been using it for almost 2 months now. He likes the toys that come with the seat, but that's the only things he likes about this seat. Here are some of the cons that I observed:1) the harness won't stay tight after being tightened. The buckles are poorly made that the length of the straps won't be locked. That means the harness is loosened easily when baby moves his body.2) the blue saucer pan that holds the toys does not rotate smoothly. Baby won't be able to move it around, so the parents have to rotate it for the baby to play with all the toys. I think it is misleading to state it allows 360 degrees of fun.3) the back is quite low that this is not suitable for babies without good head and neck control.4) my biggest complain is that the underside of the blue saucer pan is full of sharp ridges and crevices. My son always move his legs around and his feet always get caught by the crevices. We have to put socks on him to avoid his feet being cut by the sharp edges. Also, parents have to hold down the child's legs in order to turn the saucer pan around, otherwise the child's feet get hurt when the saucer pan is being turned.My son can never sit in this for more than 10 mins. I don't know if the seating area is not comfortable or what. So overall I don't think this seat does everything that the manufacturer says it does. I don't think the design is well thought of, and the materials are quite cheaply made.	
1. 	My son is 18 months old 36 tall and 33lbs. All other potties were absolutely too small for my son, he dwarfed all seats but this one. We love it so far!!!	
- 1	I am not new to baby carriers... since my daughter was born in July I have owned 2 Moby wraps (which are GREAT), 2 slings and 2 different Infantino's.  I got this one at Babies R Us when my daughter was about 4 or 5 months old.  I loved it.  I only used it in the front and it was fine for a while.  However, she was too tall for it from the beginning and her arms had to go over the straps.  Not very safe, but since she was facing me and didn't move too much, it was fine.My daughter is now 8 months old and just under 20lbs and I think my back is going to break.  She also pushes to see all around which worries me that her arms don't fit in the straps.  I have to make sure to keep a hand on her.  Yesterday I tried to wear her on my back, thinking it would take some of the pressure off, and for the life of me I couldn't figure it out.  You really need a partner to help you.  I even put her on like I normally do and tried to slide her to my back and it worked, but took a lot of time.  Once there, I didn't feel like she was secure enough.  I watched a few videos on YouTube on how to do it and it just wasn't working.  I just ordered an Ergo and I'm really hoping for better results.	
- 1	I didn't realize when I bought this that I would need a specialized straw cleaning tool, sold seperately of course. No thanks. I opened it, looked at it, realized it had this weird knobby thing on the bottom of the straw that made it impossible to clean. Quickly decided it would be a pain to deal with and immediately returned it. Waste of time!	
1. 	I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn't absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don't need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It's very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it's rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren't detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don't think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn't strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that's easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it's assembled it's not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don't move them much either.)-It's surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I'm not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I'm still very happy--it's easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA toy for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We've been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I'm still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.	
1. 	I love every aspect about this tub!	
- 1	This began falling apart after a few uses. I wanted a cute, black diaper bag that looked like a purse and this was cute but totally not worth it because it's made so cheaply.	
1. 	When my then 14 month old daughter started to sign poop and then within minutes would start going in her diaper, we knew that she was ready to start potty training. It took me almost 2 weeks of researching different potty's, reading various reviews (good and bad) and then finally deciding on this one. Our little one took to it immediately (not to mention the 10 potty books she had to read helped quite a bit too).Eventually, she would say poop and we'd rush her to her potty chair. I read many reviews on this one and I took any reported problems that parents had (of both boys and girls) into consideration. I was nervous about her accidentally sitting on the splash guard or watching for her bottom having a red ring after sitting a while or the seat sticking to her bottom whenever she tried standing up and spilling pee everywhere. Honestly, I haven't had any of those issues. Her bottom does have a pink ring on it from the impression of where she was sitting on the potty seat, but it's not like it's sore or that it's an actual bruise. I get one too whenever I use the toilet, so can't really understand why parents complained about that.This is a really good potty seat. It has a rubber bottom edge so it keeps the potty chair in place. It has a tall back support and some armrests which is really nice. The little inner potty cup is easily removed and cleaned instead of needing to pick up the whole thing.I didn't give it 5 stars because the potty chair is kind of short. My daughter is petite and I'm surprised that she's still kind of tall for this. I think it's still one of the best potty's out there.	
1. 	Finally relief for my poor boobs! As a mom who breastfeeds it can be tough when your nipples are sore or cracked. These provide relief from your bra or breast pad rubbing and allows air to get to your nipple to allow it to heal. I put nipple cream on my sore nipples and then wear these breast shields to get a break! Definitely a must if you are breastfeeding!	
1. 	These bottles are great if you have a colicky baby.  People complain about the extra pieces being a pain to wash.  If you put them in the dishwasher, it's not that big of a deal.  Even washing them by hand is not difficult.  These bottles get rid of the air bubbles almost entirely which helps when your child has reflux or is really gassy.  My child had reflux and we had to put rice cereal in these bottles as well...if you have to do that, then you need the Y-cut nipples as well.  Great bottles.	
1. 	I got these for my 9.month-old as i had already bought the number 4s and the flow was too fast for her. Number 3s are perfect for her now at 9 months.	
- 1	I wanted to love this stroller. It is lightweight, easy to fold and unfold, easy to carry and has a smooth ride. I returned it though after just a few days because it was so frustrating to push. Both me, my husband and my mother kept kicking the back wheels when pushing. We had to shorten our stride dramatically and it was very frustrating. I am 5'6 and my husband 5'9, so this is not because we are very tall people. If you want to be able to walk comfortably when pushing a stroller, do not buy this one.	
1. 	Our 11 month old really loves this toy, he loves swatting the sides to make the music turn off/on. Its very sturdy and well made, but the one we received stopped working for no apparent reason after about 2 weeks. Amazon quickly replaced it and so far all is well with the second toy, though we've only had it a few days.	
1. 	My daughter has outgrown her crib and therefore also her crib light up toys.  She was used to having something soothing to distract her.  We got the turtle and she loves it.  We make choosing which of the three colors she wants as part of our bedtime routine.  I really like that the light lasts for 45 minutes, not just 5 minutes like many other night time toys/lights.  The only thing that would make it completely perfect is if it also made night sounds.  We ended up getting a separate sound machine also.  Would highly recommend	
1. 	These are such nice cars to teach little ones numbers and the stacking value.  Ours have been scooted across the floor, cat's tail, into walls, you name it and they've always come back for more.  It's just a nice change from the nesting blocks and it's fun to hear all the vehicle sounds that children make with these guys.  I'd buy them again for sure!	
1. 	We really liked the Halo swaddlers, but our little Houdini baby can get his arms out of the cotton ones, so I found this and thought we would give it a try.  Works great!  Put him in it last night for the first time.  His arms remained inside and he stayed all snuggly in his Miracle Blanket without his arms flailing about & waking him up.  He slept for 7 1/2 hours.  He may have slept even longer, but Mom & Dad couldn't believe how long this 6 week old had slept, so we woke him up!  He slept for another 3 hours after he was changed & fed.  It is easy to use as well.  My husband put him in it at night, so when I was up with him in the middle of the night nursing, I searched online with my phone for the instructions, so I wouldn't have to get up & find the ones with the package.  They ARE online, so I read them and was able to put the baby back in it myself.  We wrapped him in this while he was in just a diaper, but you could have him in a onesie if you keep your house a little cooler.	
1. 	This is definitely the pump to have if you are going to have to pump much.  I had to pump the first month of my baby's life while she was in the hospital.  I had a lot of trouble getting my supply up since she wasn't on me, and I wasn't even able to hold her much.  I used the hospital pump during the day, and at night this one after I got it.  At first I had a single pump (Medela), but it took twice as long.  Plus, the lactation consultants say that double pumping stimulates your production better.  I got as much from this pump as the one at the hospital.  Pumping is not fun, breastfeeding is so much easier, but if you have to pump this is the way to go.  Medela pumps are much better than the rest. Breast milk is so much better than formula. Whatever it takes, it is worth them getting the breast milk.	
- 1	This was not at all worth the buy.  It had absolutely no suction!  Honestly, I have been unable to find a good syringe since we left the hospital.	
- 1	The good news is we didn't experience leaking from this.  However, my toddler already has oral muscle tone issues; I didn't find it easy to drink from this, and all the more so my son.  He prefers straws, hands down.	
1. 	She finds it quite comfortable and falls asleep within 10 minutes of me putting her in it when she is tired. It is very easy to put in your car (especially if you have a latch system) and the straps are pretty easy to adjust as well. If I had to say one bad thing about the seat is that sometimes I find it a little difficult to snap the bottom part of the belt into the position between her feet. It's a little low down and you really have to push the buckle down into it to hear the click. Otherwise, the seat was well worth the money (and it's also rated very high on safety).	
1. 	This is a really nice baby gift. Honestly I thought we would use it more than we so for white noise. The good news is that the noisemaker can come out so she'll enjoy it as a stuffed animal for many years to come.	
- 1	I was hoping to love this bag, but it was missing some key features that I now realize I need. Here are the pros and cons in my opinion:Pros:- nice color (peacock), nice looking bag- roomy - it holds plenty, probably even enough for more than 1 kid- side pockets on each side are useful - can use one side for a bottle or sippy, and one side for your ownCons:- for the price, this bag has very few actual &#34;features.&#34; it's awfully expensive for just a large tote bag.- no &#34;feet&#34; on the bottom, so if you have to set the bag down in a bathroom or sticky restaurant floor, the bag will likely get dirty.- no hook/fob for keys, which would really help in saving time/frustration of digging for keys every time.- no real organization inside the bag. It's nice that the bag comes with two pouches, but for the most part the bag is just a big empty space that doesn't have any built-in organization. Yes it has side pockets in the main compartment, but they are slim, and you can't see what's in them without reaching inside. The included pouches distract from the fact that the bag itself doesn't help organize what you put in it.- only one way to carry this bag -- on one shoulder. I tried the bag while carrying my child in an Ergo carrier, and my shoulder and neck were aching. I wish this bag had a backpack option or at least a longer strap so that it could go crossbody/messenger style.Like I said, I had high hopes for this bag, and I am disappointed that it has so few &#34;features.&#34; If all you need is a roomy bag, then this is a nice one, and the peacock color is vivid.	
- 1	I thought these stroller links would attach 2 umbrella strollers so I could have a light and small stroller option in my car trunk (I have twins and double strollers are big and bulky).The links attached the strollers in three places. This added dramatically to the width of the strollers side by side. We could not fit through a standard doorway.Also, with a real side by side double stroller you have 2 wheels in the middle. When you attach two single strollers, you have 4 wheels in the middle. This made the strollers impossible to roll in harmony with each other.The strollers broke away from each other within minutes. My babies were crying and I had to push one a few feet, then push the other so we could get back to the car and go home to get our real double stroller.	
- 1	I wanted to love these bibs, they have a waterproof liner in the middle and terry on both sides so they sounded perfect but I fortunately they were not.  After washing for a couple months they started to collect fuzzballs on the edges of them, they also are not that great for being waterproof.  Unless you change the bib right away, moisture will get onto baby's clothes. I ended up getting the Carter's teething bibs and they are more waterproof and do not collect fuzzballs.	
1. 	I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!	
1. 	We love these drop-in bottles. I searched for a bottle for my bf baby and was thinking I was going to have to spend $14 per bottle -- so happy when we found that our baby prefers this style!!	
1. 	I gave this five stars as this is the third one I've purchased.  I purchased one for myself, one for each of my grandchildren who's parents have counter height tables and the grandchildren are too big for their high chairs.  I originally purchased this one for our granddaughter (since we too have a counter height kitchen table) who was 9 months and it was perfect for her!  Now that our grandchildren are 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 it is perfect for them still.  I HIGHLY recommend this for grandparents, people who do not have children as it is so handy to pull out and use for company that has little one/toddlers.  The seat conveniently folds up and has a strap for throwing it over your shoulder if you're going to someone's home that doesn't have a high chair/booster seat.  Fisher-Price has done it again!	
1. 	My daughters just got potty trained and I did not want to lug two potty chairs around, so when I saw this I thought perfect. I do not think it is at all flimsy. Granted, you do need to hold your child while they are on it because it is smaller then most potty's but heck, you can fold it up and carry it around with you so who cares? I would recommend.	
- 1	I really thought this was a clever cup until a few months in when we figured out all the weaknesses...  Mostly thanks to my little guy.  He had no problem drinking from it, but I got fed up with the mess!- If the liquid inside is cold and then warms up, it will push its way out of the straw- If your toddler pinches the straw, the drink streams out- If your toddler throws the cup, the straw inevitably gets hit and leaves quite the spray pattern on the way/floor- On its side, liquid works its way out- If your toddler pushes on the top, it will sink in and allow the drink to pour out that way- If your toddler hits the straw top, there's a spray- There is always a little liquid above the seal after your child drinks--drops that will fall out when tipped	
1. 	I originally registered for a step 2 toy box that is a hard plastic. I have two of them already in the basement for my other childrens toys.  I changed my mind when I saw this one. I have to say I really like it. It's great and there is no smell to it at all.  I love the look of it and the fact that it's soft is a big plus for when he is a bit older and either crawling or walking. I wont' have to worry about him pinching himself or the lid falling down on him. I definetly love the detailing and the little drop down side that looks like a playmat.  The extra little bag that comes inside for transporting or additonal storage is great as well. It's a great value and looks really nice in the nursery.	
1. 	After 12 months of using cloth bibs that were completely messy after each meal and had to be washed each time, we found these Babybjorn bibs on Amazon. The first time we tried them, our daughter hated them and kept on crying until I took them off. I think the plastic thing around her neck just scared her because she was not used to it (if you start off with these bibs it is probably no problem). We then put the bib on her several times for only one or two minutes when she was in a good mood and did not notice the bib much and pretty soon she did not care any more whether we used the cloth bib or the plastic one during her meals. The bib is great at catching food and it is so easy to wash it after each meal! Saves so much time and her clothes stay much cleaner this way.Also, some reviewers were saying the bib was too small. Our daughter is now 16 months old and on the 92nd percentile in terms of height - a little giant! The bib fits her perfectly and the adjustable strap leaves us room to make it looser when she gets (even) bigger. So we are very happy with this and definitely recommend it.	
- 1	With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young.  These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon.  Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth.	
- 1	Just bought the product in US web site, and finally found out the original is China, what a joking for me!	
- 1	For my second baby gate, I decided to try out a custom solution.  I bought a 2&#34;x3&#34; at Home Depot for $1.79 and cut to length.  I secured the beam to the bannister with velcro straps ($6).  I then mounted the gate to the 2x3 and voila!  Same thing for a fraction of the cost.  You could probably also use inexpensive cable ties instead of the more expense velcro straps and do the whole thing for under $5.	
1. 	I love that Medela has changed the design of these bags. With my first, you had to use a tape to strap the bag to the pump in order to directly pump in to.  The best part of this new design is that it now comes with an attachment that hooks the bag directly onto the pump and milk is directly pumped into this.  The other benefit of the new design is that the milk drops below the seal, where the previous bags did not do this, thus possibly contaminating the milk. I haven't read the other reviews, but I know from my personal experience, I love these and I especially love that I can pump directly into the bag, eliminating the need to pump into another bottle and then transfer to the bags.  These are the best!	
- 1	Please Please PLEASE do not use this aspirator without a back up!  It works great fresh out of the box, but six months after purchasing it I have laid it to rest in the garbage can.  It has multiple design flaws, the largest of which is that it requires fresh batteries every 2-3 days for frequent use.  And if your baby is congested, you need to use it frequently!  Thank heavens I ordered theBabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue)and it's arriving later today...since this one died 7 hours ago, and my poor baby is so congested he can't drink his bottle without throwing up!  :(	
1. 	I really don't know why exactly I am attracted to these things... but I think they are fun and look hysterical. Although if the baby is very young this brand tends to be on the heavy side and the baby may not be able to use it.	
1. 	Basic heavy plastic gate for a great price. Easy set up and worth it! It's cheap and functional but not flimsy.	
1. 	I keep these in my diaper bag wherever I go.  These are small enough to stuff anywhere in case you need to throw a smelly diaper away!	
- 1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.	
- 1	We originally bought this for our son, who didn't like it very much, so we only used it once or twice. Our daughter DOES like the swing to sleep in (she is a newborn and likes the motion), but since reassembling it after storing a few months, the motion dial to modulate how fast the speed of swing is no longer works. It also has a noisy grinding noise and the whole unit sways back and forth despite not being able to function at the maximum speed. We may end up buying a different swing, since the baby does like swinging. Also, it has a large footprint and takes up a lot of space.	
- 1	I can't believe I bought this in 2 colors!  The fabric gets extremely itchy after being washed and tumble dried!! Pills like crazy.	
1. 	I needed to pump when I went back to work and I bought a couple of these on top of those that were provided with the Medela Pump In Style. They are very resistant, easy to clean, and the rings and caps are very useful.I only put 4 stars because the nipples are useless if your baby is already using another brand, and I would have prefered another bottle and accessories instead.	
1. 	So convenient. Don't worry about the suggested age range; my toddler is 15 months old and she still uses. As long as your child is drooling, these bibs will be perfect for them. I bought my first 10-pack when she was 6 months old; just bought the second 10-pack.	
1. 	My 4 month old is teething and drools EVERYWHERE so we just put one of these bibs on (comes in almost every color so it always matches what he is wearing) and it saves me from changing his shirt 8 times a day!	
- 1	We have been using this baby monitor for almost 8 months.  At first we thought it was going to be a good fit for us.  It seemed almost too sensitive to noises, the red lights would flash when the baby rolled in her crib.  But the out of range light would flash and it would intermittently beep.  It wouldn't beep consistently though, seemingly only at night.  The clicks, pops and crackles are horrendous and wake us up frequently.  With the baby sleeping through the night we often resort to turning off the monitor at night, completely defeating the purpose.  Almost 8 months of use and it is now not picking up the babies noises very well.  I can hear the baby through the wall before the monitor picks up her sounds.  We have tried multiple channels to try and get rid of any interference but nothing seems to help.  About to chuck this monitor and replace it with something that will work.  Don't waste your money on this, read reviews carefully and go for something else.	
1. 	I ordered the Navy & Royal & there wasn't much difference in the shades.  I chose these because they are 100% cotton.  They remained soft after washing & fit the crib mattress well.	
1. 	this was a baby shower gift, my friend still uses this after 1 year. great investment, it was sturdy and the colors were bright.	
- 1	I bought these thinking they would be great for use on public toilets. Well, they are more hassle than they are worth. They cover the toilet just fine. They have tape to position it securely on the toilet, which seems great, but when you are in a hurry trying to get your child on the potty before they have an accident, it is more trouble than it is worth. I have found that is just as easy to lay TP down on the seat for my son to sit on. Also, I think these are NOT FLUSHABLE. The package did not say flushable. They are disposable, but I mean really, are you going to pick this off the toilet seat and carry it to a trash can?	
- 1	This is a good camera, with one flaw which makes it not be a good option for us: the screen is way too bright to place by your bedside.  Maybe our screen was defective, because the lowest light setting was no different from the highest light setting.  We settled on the WiFi Baby because of how versatile it is.	
- 1	my son was not fooled, this is just such a production to get this working a tired mommy will get frustrated i know i did, it is ok if you cant breast fed i tried everything brewers yeast fenugreek, mothers milk all of it reglan i just couldnot make the milk and my son is perfect on his simlac sensitive	
- 1	I would suggest looking at these in stores and buying one in person and not over the internet. I got this thing as a baby shower gift as it was on her registry -- twas quite small and was hard! I am glad i didnt have to use it.	
1. 	I love these bibs, they work great and catch all of his food.  Easy to put on a baby,  very easy to clean.  I would recommend rinsing immediately after you take off the bib so the food doesn't dry on.  They are dishwasher safe which I love!  I would recommend them to anyone!	
1. 	The hubs and I don't really buy a lot of special baby/kid goods. Our two year old son drinks out of normal glasses, he eats with adult silverware, he never used a pacifier, etc etc. So we didn't want to buy him a separate little potty chair, either. Might as well start him on the real thing so we don't have to switch him over later, right? We bought this so that he could sit comfortably on a normal toilet.This is a lovely, sturdy device, which is very easy to clean and has a convenient hook for hanging on the wall. What a nice bathroom decoration. The guests. just. love. it. &#34;You have a toilet seat on your wall! Wow! That's great!&#34; said nobody ever. But whatever, it's an easy way to store it. The front lip is a little difficult for my son to get over when he's sitting down, but it seems like somewhat of a safety feature, so I'm good with it.I don't really know what to say. It's well made, but come on, it's a potty seat. Your kid sits on it to pee. It's not super hard to get that wrong. Anyway, my son is still not really interested in the potty, but that speaks more to his love of pooping in his diaper in whatever hidden corner he can find than the quality of the chair. I'd recommend this product to others.	
1. 	This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!	
- 1	It takes too much space. Make me feel my baby was squeezed in. I didn't use it at all. Maybe it is good for very little baby.	
1. 	My daughter has the purple Twilight Turtle.  It is VERY cute.  She cuddles it during the day and has tea parties with it, and at night she puts it back on her dresser for bed.  It has three different color options for the stars on her ceiling, and I can set the timer to make sure it stays on long enough for her to fall asleep but not drain the batteries.  The stars and moon displayed are a muted, soothing tone, giving just enough light to soothe to sleep.  We go about three months on one set of batteries, and we use the turtle almost nightly.With the hard shell, it's a good toy to have on a dresser - it's not soft enough to snuggle in bed, but if set near the bed it projects stars across the entire ceiling. I also like that the buttons are big and spaced enough apart that they are easy for a child to operate and pick their own colors at night.This is not a light to leave on for the entire night, but it does a great job at soothing and I'm glad we have one!	
- 1	first off it was extremely hard to mount to the carseat safely.  no matter how hard my husband or i tightened it, the slightest tug from our daughter would make it collapse and fall on her.  i can't believe that this was ever tested out by children, because if it was they would have made some huge changes in design!	
1. 	This is a superb crib. I am very happy withthe color, apearance and even the quality. It took 1 hour for us to assemble it. Very easy. Nice directions. Perfect crib.	
- 1	My less thank one year old boys figured these out right within a couple months. If you yank hard enough it opens up. The adhesive started to fail, and the drawers they were talk enough to see into the learned how hot press the latch on their own to open drawer. Ridiculous how easy it was for them.	
- 1	My 2 month old was diagnosed with torticollis at 6 weeks. I saw this online I thought it would help keep her off the flat spot. In theory it's great, however my newborn can wriggle out of it immediately, even though it's appropriately sized. Plus, when we put it on her she screams bloody murder.  So I'm disappointed, but I've already scheduled the return.	
- 1	We should have listened to all the negative reviews. Seems like a great idea. Biggest problem is that is slides all over and our son was terrified he was going to fall, into the toilet! He pleaded with me to get the one we have at home. We purchased this for traveling. Since we are visiting my mom, I went to the store and bought one and we will just leave it there. We will use the Kalencomm 2 in 1 Potette Plus we also purchased, but is larger.	
1. 	My daughter received the cloud b twilight turtle for her first Christmas (she was 6 months) and my two nieces received the ladybug's (ages 2 and 3). These night lights were the it toys that Christmas (2010) - especially with the older toddlers. These adorable little critters are soft, and project beautiful soft stars onto the ceiling and walls. For us, all of the colours showed on the ceiling - the amber is a bit fainter than the blue and green, but still lovely. The product does project better if placed in the centre of the room (on a stand), or at the end of the bed. It is also best enjoyed by older children, especially those who have a fear of the dark. These night lights are very user friendly (which means the children can turn them on and off as desired without us parents having to be called back in all night long). The automatic shut-off is an excellent feature as well, to conserve battery power. We have found that our daughter, now 2, does enjoy this toy more than she did as a younger baby. She finds the stars comforting at nap time and bed time, and is actually falling asleep much quicker (fingers crossed that this continues). In sum I think this is a fantastic product and very well made, (these little guys are stilling going strong after two full years of use and abuse by my families toddlers)! For those of you who are looking for a combination of sound and light, cloud b is releasing a Tranquil Turtle this June 2012.	
- 1	I tried using these inserts but they don't fit properly in original assembly and break the vaccum terriblyI tried pressing them against my body to seal well and this gave me shooting pains in the breast, did not pump well either. I bought Medela pump and right sized flanges and I could pump more in 5 minutes than 15 minutes of pumping (and subsequent pain) on Ameda with and without these inserts.	
1. 	These are awesome.  We use them for burp cloths, padding around seats, for games of peek-a-boo, sloppy spills and all.  They are extremely soft and hold up wash after wash.  With 2 reflux-y babies, these were a must!	
- 1	It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid. It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids. For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably. Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss. If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance. But should not have any issues in carpet. Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product. Going back to fisher price bouncers.	
- 1	I don't like this bath at all.  I was really whetted to the idea of washing the babies in the sink. I'm short and our tub is deep so the only way for me to reasonably wash them is to crawl into the tub since my arms can't reach from the outside.  Before you purchase this, you need to consider the dimensions of your sink, shape, and placement of the faucet.  I think if your sink is too small, this is going to be difficult to use.  In addition, if the faucet is low or protrudes too much, it will be obstructive.  The best combination would be a medium-sized, oval sink, with a faucet that isn't in the way.  Having said that, I have a large, square sink with a very high faucet that can be rotated out of the way.Cons:1) It doesn't have a drain at the base.  After you've washed your baby with soapy water, the only way to empty that dirty water is to lift him out of the Puj tub, flip it over to dump the water, and put him back in.  It's a bit dangerous when you're by yourself and the baby is a wet, slippery mess.2) It doesn't fit my square sink nicely.  It tends to tilt to one side or the other spilling the baby out.3) Even when they are older and bigger, they tend to slide down to the bottom leaving their neck extremely flexed and crumpled.Pros:1) It folds up nicely saving you a ton of space and also allows you to take it with you if you travel.	
1. 	you can see your baby perfectly  and the mirror it's big so it's perfect the quality is good .. .	
- 1	When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the breathable bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. Great idea, but bumper needs work.	
- 1	This mattress is super soft - does not adhere to the Safe to Sleep guidelines.  Further, the labeling is misleading - it did not fit properly in my Pack n Play.  There was about a 2&#34; gap between the mattress and the edge of the play yard.  I love that it was using some organic ingredients (in hopes that it had lower levels of VOCs than traditional foam mattresses), but it creates other safety hazards and is not worth the risk.  I would not recommend this product for use in an area baby sleeps in unless you are only using it for supervised naps, not overnights.	
- 1	I have purchased 7 Britax car seats in the past 2 years and been happy with all of them - except for this one, which is just awful. I have already returned it.A few comments on the Britax seats I do own/recommend:  I have a Britax Frontier 85 in my husbands car.  I had 2 of these in my car as well until my car was stolen, at which point I purchased 2 Britax Frontier 90's.  (I also purchased a Britax infant seat recently.)  I've very pleased with both the Frontier 85 & 90 and highly recommend you spend the extra money to purchase one of these (or switch to another brand).  The major improvement in the Frontier 90 (vs. the 85) is that you can easily and securely install the car seat without using the latch system . This is useful in my SUV, which has a 3rd row with no latch hooks.  I wanted my 6 year old to remain in a harnessed seat, but with 2 spaces already taken with car seats in the middle row I thought I would have to move her to a booster.  With the Frontier 90, I can secure the seat in the back row VERY securely and VERY easily using the vehicle belt, and she can continue to be buckled into the seat using the harness instead of using it as a booster.  My 4 year old rides in a Frontier 85 in the middle row, and since she is &#62; 40 lbs, the manual says you MUST use the vehicle belt to secure the seat INSTEAD of using the latch system.  I'm not sure why latch is less secure for children of this weight (since I believe the Frontier 85 allowed you to use latch for children up to 85 lbs).  The click-tight system in the Frontier 90 is extremely easy to use and VERY secure - seat does not budge an inch.  The reason I would prefer to use latch in the middle row of my SUV is because the vehicle seat cannot be moved back and forth when the car seat is installed using the vehicle belt (because the belt is attached to the floor of the vehicle.  Whereas using latch, the carseat is independent of the vehicle seat belt and the 2nd row can be moved back/forth as needed.  In a sedan with a stationary back row, this would not be an issue at all.As for this Frontier 70 car seat, it does not have the click-tight system, so I assumed I would be able to use the latch connectors to attach the car seat to the vehicle seat.  Not so.  For children &#62; 40 lbs you must use the vehicle seat belt instead.  The vehicle belt must be routed in front of the car seat back and behind the car seat arm rests so it does not lie flush against the seat.  It also doesn't secure the seat in any way.  The manual says you have to make sure the car seat does not move more than one inch after installation - which I believe to be physically impossible with this seat using the vehicle seat belt.  There is a flimsy plastic flap under where your child's bottom would sit on the car seat, which is supposed to go over and press down on the vehicle seat belt, but if you tighten the seat belt you can't push this flap all the way back, so it would be digging into your child's back.  Even besides this issue, the seat is fairly bare bones and does not look very comfortable.  For almost $200, I would expect much more!  Please save yourself the hassle and do not buy this seat.	
1. 	Love the body pillow, just wish the case would be easier to put on. I am very pleased with my purchase!	
1. 	I can't say enough good things about the sleep sack. After my son made it clear he could get himself out of any blanket, we started using the sleep sack. It's so nice not to worry about your baby getting cold at night or suffocating in a fluffy blanket. I do love this product, but I must admit the swaddle feature does not work for me. My son can't stand to have his arms confined and even though you can wrap the swaddle vest below their arms, it's just an additional unnecessary step when dressing the baby. When I put the sleep sack on my boy he knows it's bedtime and it's become a nice part of our wind down routine.	
1. 	I am happy i got these, they are sturdy, good quality, easy to use and wash. very practical when breastfeeding but want to have a supply.	
- 1	the suction cup on the one I got wasn't good, it hardly ever stayed up, we were disappointed with it and had to return it.	
- 1	our baby likes the soft part but not the handle so I remove the soft part and transplant it into glow in the dark handles from walmart	
- 1	I don't know if it's just my dishwasher, but the caps and nipples did not come out clean. The OXO seems to be a better one.	
1. 	We bought this for our curious 9 month old and love it.  She's cruising and likes to play with everything.  When we make it a play yard she screams...apparently she likes her freedom.  So instead we opened it up and are using it to block her way to the TV and computer.  This way she is safe from sharp corners and cables, but can still wander around the rest of our baby-proof room.  It is heavy enough that she can't move it and as long as you have plenty of bends in the thing (don't make it a straight line) it doesn't fall over.  We still have it held up on both sides by heavy furniture because I'm paranoid that she'll suddenly get a power burst and pull it down, but so far it's just been overkill.When the baby is in bed, we move the play yard to our front porch and our dogs can come out and enjoy the evening with us.  I don't know that this would work for all dogs, but ours are scared of baby gates and things so it works for them.  Most other large dogs would jump this thing in a second.I also wanted to note that we bought this at Babies R Us because we had a gift card for that store, but it is cheaper here by almost $10.  We'll come back to Amazon if we decide to get the 2 panel expansion.	
1. 	I would buy this over and over again. Best quality gate I have ever purchased as a mother. I tell everyone how wonder it it. We bought 2 to make it bigger for outside use and take some sections out and use it around the christmas tree. Absolutely wonderful!	
1. 	Very large bib, soft but thick, and the corner is fun for the baby.  It's our favorite, and we wish we had more like it!  Nothing gets through it - very thick cotton - like a nice towel.	
- 1	I ended up returning this sleep sack. Even though it was labeled as a &#34;small&#34; it was considerably larger than the Halo Sleep Sacks we already had in small. But the main reason I returned it was because the fabric is so rough -- very similar to burlap. And the colors are even brighter than shown in the picture. I worried that the color alone would be too stimulating for my baby to fall asleep quickly.	
- 1	Look for a larger, better padded changing pad! This one is very small and not padded at all.  My baby is small and this pad is still not big enough!	
- 1	Because it leaks so much from openings, I don't see a need for this product.  I thought this product was designed to help mom. In addition, this cup is fairly large for a toddler.  I ended up giving my son a smaller, glass cup so that he can hold it better.	
- 1	These new cups are awful. We had a couple of them from late 2012 that were awesome.  The lids were easy to screw on and they never leaked.  Then Playtex redesigned the lid and now they are really hard to get closed, sometimes hard to open, and they leak if you don't get them exactly right.  I just got done clearing out the shelves of my local pharmacies at 8:30 at night trying to find the old style (Yay, got 3!) because we put our son to bed tonight with a cup of ice water and he woke up 20 minutes later because he was lying in a freezing cold puddle.  His cup was apparently not screwed together properly and it leaked all over his bed.  I do not appreciate changing sheets for no reason.  This is not the first time we've had the cups leak on us.  I will use the old style until he chews the spouts to death, which is what happened to our old set, and then I will find another brand.  I'm not sure what the point of the redesign was since the old style was perfect.  Please bring back the old style!!!!	
- 1	I didn't even think of making my own, but most fabric stores sell nylon mesh and home improvement stores sell great suction cups.As with most things sold with suction cups, the suction cups don't suction. Other than that hugely important aspect, the bag is what it is- a bag.	
- 1	My child is breastfed -- she's still using a size one bottle nipple and she can down a bottle in less than a minute an ounce. The first time I gave her this cup she drank out of it just fine, but she sucked so hard that the nipple collapsed. There are two small slits in the top and apparently that wasn't enough for my child.	
1. 	My three month old daughter loves this toy. She likes the dangling bone and loves the crackling of the ears.  The barking sound that the dog makes is a sound catcher.	
1. 	We love the Playtex Insulators. We tried a whole bunch of cups when my youngest hit the sippy age, and these were the best by far. This is one of our many purchases as we have added to our sets over the years. We do find that after a while the plastic valves need replacing, and occasionally I have thrown away a lid but only after a long time (years). One note of caution, do not try to boil these as it warps the cups and then the seal is not correct. That may seem obvious but I have heard of several people doing it so it is worth mentioning.	
- 1	Not sure why they are one of best sellers,  its next to impossible to clean the straw that means can only use for water.  The cap keeps on getting stuck with straw, and eventually tip of straw breaks off causing suction flow to increase.  There is small plastic rink that keeps coming off from cap of the cup, causing water leakage.  Look into other options	
- 1	Ugh, where do I start? The thing is complete crap. The suction cups stick for about 5 seconds, and since it's designed in flaps to fold up, not only does it unstick, the different sections actually flip straight up onto the plate. The pocket doesn't catch much food because it is angled *towards the table* instead of towards the kid. The texture is hard to clean, it's also bulky. I couldn't imagine toting this around to restaurants, those sticky plastic ones with the graphics are cheaper, disposable, and honestly much more convenient. I'm now still in search of a GOOD toddler placemat!	
- 1	I have tried but my daughter just doesn't find this toy amusing and doesn't use it to teethe. The toy seems nicely made and easy to pick up but she's just not crazy about it	
- 1	My baby didn't like it to be swaddle in this. I rather use a cotton blanket.	
- 1	My baby got out of this just as easily as if I used a regular blanket. And NO, this is not easy to use. It is a pain in the butt. If you can't swaddle  with a normal blanket this will not help you. And the fabric is super cheap. Waste of money.	
- 1	I actually bought this at Target, but please take note; this placemat is NOT intended for small toddlers. My 1-yr-old flings it onto the floor everytime we've tried to use it. Food everywhere! I'm hoping we can get some use out of it as she gets older, but as of right now it's been a waste of time and money. Not crazy about the silicone either as it gets mucky even when washed and folded.	
- 1	This sippy cup on paper looks great.  The straw is soft and won't harm the palate, its relatively easy to take apart, the straw mechanism works reasonably well to deliver liquid...  However, we did not get more than 2 months use out of it before we tossed both of them.Here are the cons:- this cup leaks.  The straw leaks and the top leaks.  Its not only that you have to thread it perfectly, it also has to be closed not too tight and not too loose.  Somewhere in the middle there might be a non-leaking tightness, but unless you have 5 minutes to adjust/re-adjust it multiple times its just not worth it.- the straw leaks.  If you have anything other than water, prepare for squirting out of the straw especially when you open and close the flip top- the cup will not hold up.  If your child is like mine and will occasionally drop things (not necessarily even throw, just drop), this cup will not wear and tear well.  Every drop on pavement will dent the hard plastic and create rough plastic burrs.  I'm not surprised how some reviewers had their cup itself crack on them	
1. 	Bought these for extra milk storage, these store well in the freezer and the elongated shape helps to quickly defrost them as well. the only downside is that it's hard to read the volume markings on the side.	
1. 	fun to bang, fun to eat, fun to carry! easy wash and put away. We didnt know that they had cut outs and numbers but its cute.	
1. 	My daughter likes these cups because of the characters on them. I like them because they are sturdy, easy to clean, and hold up well. The ones with the straws do tend to leak very easily if tipped over. We reuse them over, and over. There are no tricky parts to clean, and they hold up extremely well with repeated washings. These are my second favorite sippys, the first being the actual sippy cup without the straw.	
1. 	I have liked this tub.  The no-slide grips on the tub keep your kiddo in place well.  I also used a hand towel placed along the back of the newborn back slant to give even more 'grip-a-bility' when she was tiny.I have also used this tub as a 'holder' for her (empty of course) as a good place to set her down with a few toys.  She can't quite sit up by herself yet, but likes being upright.  This tub gives her enough support so that she can balance on her own.I have liked First Years products - I have the bottle warmer and drying rack too.	
- 1	My son just does't like this.  He is able to get the food out, there wasn't much of a learning curve for him.  But he would rather drink out of a cup with a straw when I make smoothies.  Waste of money for me.  Make sure you clean this write away, the nipple will stain, especially with carrot.  Food easily gets stuck under the nipple.	
- 1	I was looking for something to keep my baby cool in his convertible carseat. I needed something that a) kept him cool and b) could attach to the seat. This product sort of manages the first, but fails terribly at the second. The material is a nice mesh, which looks like it should feel cool. After a long ride, my baby's head wasn't soaked in sweat, as it usually is after being pressed up against the non-breathable material of the car seat. Unfortunately, the liner does not stay attached to the seat. The bottom part sort of sags against the back of the seat, so I had to adjust it every time my toddler sat down. If I didn't pull it straight, it would crumple under his back and I'm sure that is not comfortable. The head rest attaches to the main body of the liner with velcro, but the velcro can slip, detatching the head rest from the main body, exposing the velro strip. This caused a rash against the baby's neck. Lastly, the head rest theoretically should adhere to something on the back of the car seat (they provide tape), but it doesn't reach and doesn't stick, so the headrest often falls off completely.I ended up sewing the headrest to the liner, and sewing ribbons to the headrest so I could tie it to the carseat. At that point I might as well go buy some mesh fabric and sew my own liner.I gave it two stars as iti does seem to keep things cool, but the design is really poor. Don't buy this.	
- 1	The case material is soft, but it doesn't look very nice once on the pillow. the opening is very loose looking - would be nice if it overlapped - looks sloppy and cheap	
- 1	The spout broke after 2 uses. My daughter chewed on it but she is supposed to do that - she is 9 months old! Threw it away.	
1. 	This little crib is really well made, cute and just the right size for small babies.  The mattress that comes with it is worthless, however.  I bought the mattress that is recommended to be used with it.	
1. 	this is a great product for baby bath time.  we were using 7th generation foaming cleanser, but it would dry out our daughter's skin and her hair would be oily looking within a day.  with this, her skin is soft and doesn't dry out and her hair is soft for days.  plus she smells so clean without being too &#34;perfumey&#34;	
1. 	This is a must have for that weird stage between when baby is too big for the infant bath tub but can't sit up on their own yet. My son is average size and he fits in this great.	
- 1	I would not recommend buying a crib set.  We have this one and it is cute, but I found out after it was purchased that using bumpers is not recommended due to the possibility of suffocation and SIDS.  The valences hang down really low, so we were unable to use them with our blinds.  Babies are also not supposed to sleep with a blanket on top of them, so we have yet to use the comforter.  We did get the rug, found the set of pictures that match, and use the crib skirt.  They are cute in his room.  We did like that this set would work for a boy or a girl too.	
- 1	This review is for the brown Snugglesaurus blanket. While it is very soft and cute, I have experienced a very annoying problem with this blanket: it is good for 2-3 washes, then it gradually starts to shed onto all your baby's clothes! Lint screen won't do a thing, and neither do fabric softener sheets - it sheds, sheds, SHEDS more than a German Shepard! I had to toss it when baby was 8 months old because there is hardly any blanket left (it thinned out A LOT) and many of her clothes have this stubborn brown lint on them that is so hard to remove I have given up (lint roller doesn't work). This happened with fairly light use: we washed it once or twice a month as we only used it in her infant carrier.If you do decide to get it make sure you wash this separately from everything else, but beware that even out of the washer/dryer it will shed lint onto your baby's stuff. It's ruined quite a few of my baby's lighter pajamas because I can't stand all these little brown lint dots all over them, they look worn and dirty. This is one purchase I completely regret!	
1. 	Love this duck tub, my son likes to play in it and fits well, he's 8 months but almost reaches the other side of the tub which is ok. Easy to drain and easy to blow up and deflate when needed. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a transition tub.	
- 1	These spoons are awful for scooping food and putting it in a child's mouth. The spoons are way too deep and the rubber is way too flimsy to successfully spoon anything into it. Our child has to turn the spoon upside down and lick it out. Absolutely terrible design.However, they are great chew toys for teethers who need something sturdy but with a little give to chew on.	
1. 	This tub is great for my 19 month old. We didn't really use it until she could sit on her own at about 6-7 months though. I didn't like it for before she could sit...another option with more padding is better. I will continue to use this until she's 2...it's great that I don't have to fill up the whole tub and feels much safer.	
- 1	Unstable and flimsy, this piece of plastic nonsense is such a disappointment.  it's not sturdy enough to support a toddler.  I should have  known that at this cheap price that I was going to get junk.  You're better off putting a stool on the ground and a seat on the toilet.	
1. 	This swing is so comfy, I wish they made them in my size!  My three week old son has loved this swing since the day he came home from the hospital!The only set back is a temporary one.  My son was under 7lbs. when he first used it and now at over 8lbs.  he's still too light to use the actual swing on the lowest setting.  It goes so fast that I get scared and turn it off.  If I want him to swing I just give it a gentle push every couple of minutes or so and he seems happy.	
- 1	I'm frankly surprised that this pillow more than 3-star average ratings. First off, let's talk about $30 for a pillow of this size. I've never even spent that much on one of my standard sized adult pillows. And for that price, I would expect great things. It came out of plastic packaging smelling very strongly of, well, plastic packaging. And after a week of airing out, this thing smells very, VERY strongly of a petting farm. (Basically, it smells like sheep).I'm so disappointed, because like everyone else who made the hard decision to spend this kind of money on a tiny pillow, I simply wanted something safe for my toddler. Instead, she wakes up smelling like a sheep with a little bit of plastic. If not for the smell, I'd probably be satisfied. It did flatten out, but I don't think the babies need it too fluffy.	
1. 	This is one of the best inventions!  Going out to eat, you never know how clean the tables are, and I don't like the thought of her food sitting on whatever cleaning products were used.  It wipes clean with a diaper wipe, well, clean enough to roll back up and toss in the diaper bag without getting anything else dirty.  We bought a second one so we always have a clean one on hand.  I even get compliments from waitstaff for using it.  Gives them less to scrape off... ha, ha.  Definately worth it.	
1. 	They do the job. They're keeping baby's fingers from getting in those darn sockets! I think they're pretty easy to pull out as well.	
1. 	Worth the extra money. Finally bit the bullet when our second was born. You shouldn't need more than one or two since they're easy to clean and hard to use. With our 7 month old it's a little big when she's in the high chair but as she gets taller it will work well like it does for our 3 year old.	
1. 	I think my daughter (5 months) will love this more as she gets old.  She likes it now, but really just holds on to the pages right now	
- 1	We have a comparably priced Summer Infant video monitor, but we have had to purchase a second remote device (the hand-held device with the screen) because the remote has been dropped so much. When the opportunity to try this one came up, I jumped on the idea! We have our iPhones and iPads handy almost all the time, so it sounded ideal...Not so much.Summary: Setup was easy. Video is lack-luster, sound is meh and crackly. The internet aspect slows things down from the moment you try to log on. Quality and user experience are severely limited by the Internet involvement.Setup:Software: App install was quick and easy.Camera: Set up was annoying but not terrible. You have to make an account on their server, even if you only want to stream within your own house. And then you have to configure the camera for your network (which involves the camera starting its own default network, you joining that network with your phone, configuring the camera to join your network then switching back to your network with your phone). That went well and the instructions were very clear.Login: I find it takes forever for the app to log me in. It's annoying and unnecessary. It also means that you cannot run it exclusively locally even if you want to. If you lose internet, you probably lose the baby monitor. (I did not test this, personally.)Video: The video quality on this camera is poorer than the Summer Infant one. The night vision works, but it makes the room and crib look hazy, like a dark, smokey bar. (Summer Infant's makes it look like surveillance tape, but it's clearer and easier to discern what's what.) Both cameras use infrared LEDs for night vision.During the day, it's ok, but still not as clear as the Summer Infant camera.The picture looked much better on the phones than the tablets - the resolution isn't there for larger images. The zoom is digital, so it's not actually useful (same pixels, just larger!). Switching between high and low quality made no visible difference.Sound: I could not get rid of the crackly static noise from the camera. I tried different rooms, different angles...Also, I could not get the push-to-talk to work.There is a slight delay - maybe 2 beats - in sound and video.Controls: There's definitely a delay between pressing the button to move the camera and the camera moving.Loss of connection: If the camera loses connection, the device you're monitoring on will beep. Loudly. It's a nice beep - like an industrial elevator beep - but still quite loud. Just what you don't want to hear in the middle of the night, right?We did try connecting from offsite and that was easy if also slow. Video was very clunky at that point.Plus it's expensive.The room temperature display is kind of neat, but not nearly enough to make up for the short-comings.Conclusion: There are more tests we could have done but this small amount of testing turned up enough clunkiness that we decided this wasn't for us.	
- 1	I was trying to find something to keep my sons pacifier in his mouth and believe me, this is not it. It holds the pacifier at such an odd angle that it ends up making it pop out. Completely useless.	
1. 	These are my babies preferred bottles. He has GERD and these don't bother him. We tried the regular size but when he was younger it created some bad habits for when he nursed.these wide nipples keeping him latching correctly. The down side is there are 6 pieces per bottle, the upside is that they're easy to clean thoroughly	
1. 	These bibs are awesome. They're super-easy to clean and put on a child. They serve their purpose well when you get to the stage that a toddler is trying to feed themselves, this keeps all their food from falling on their lap or floor like it typically does. A pack of two is perfect because I can have one in the diswasher from the prior meal and have the spare one ready for the next meal. The only complaint I would have on these is how long they hang down because if you're feeding a child in a booster seat with a tray on it, the poketed part at the bottom hangs low enough that it touches the tray and gets in the way a little....still, it is manageable and better than any other bibs I've tried. I began using these around 8 months and my daughter is now 18 months and still leaves them on to eat each meal without it bothering her.	
1. 	Such a clever little thing to have for those little teethers! They are a bit hard to clean but I guess that's because the mesh is so fine to avoid chunks breaking through!	
1. 	This product really did the job when cleaning my granddaughters bottles. It was vibrant and really cleaned off the formula grit!	
1. 	This did just what I wanted it to: catch the poop without messing up my diaper covers. The baby size was wider than my diapers, which works great, because it is easy to push them in, and I don't have to worry about them not catching everything. They are a bit stiffer than other brands, but my baby has never gotten a rash from them.	
- 1	It gathers the play pen mat creating a dangerous gap between the mat and the underneath soft area. It's a waste of money. I should've stuck with the joovy 2 idea	
- 1	I was looking for the type of cabinet lock which would protect babies and toddlers from danger but be reasonably easy for adults  to open. Not only does this product fail to do either but the plastic straps ( integral for tightening and loosening the locks)  crack, stretch, and eventually stop working.Not only that, but putting these on cabinets is time-consuming and when they are opened ( when adults want to get into a cabinet) they don't lock into place easily. Fail.	
1. 	I absolutely love these bottles. When I brought my newborn home I wasn't sure what to use. I knew that Playtex was good but I had problems telling how many oz. of water was in the bottle as according to the scoops of formula. When I found the VentAire collection I thought it was great because both my husband and myself had problems with ear infections as children. He refused to take the regular VentAire so I tried the Natural Shape and have never gone back. It is the best bottle that I have ever seen.	
- 1	I was excited when I ordered but as soon as we got them and put them up everything kept falling out the front kids and I were bummed. I grabbed 3 one for each of my kids and they have about 6 teddy bears a peace would not recommend	
- 1	Too loud. Too hard. Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds. Battery replacement requires screwdriver.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube	
- 1	I ordered this because I don't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub. It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out. I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt.	
- 1	I washed this blanket before using.  After washing it was not the soft pretty blanket I bought.  It is a &#34;lint grabber&#34; on the brown hem.I would not buy it again.	
1. 	These are a great product.  Yes, kids can figure out how to spill the snack out of the cup if they want to, but it helps avoid many accidental spills.  My son likes to shake the cup up and down with his goldfish inside and nothing escapes.  These are an everyday staple in our house.	
- 1	These are great. My child seems frustrated when her toys don't fly across the room, but that's point. I like the colors too.	
1. 	Purchased this play yard to use in the house for our dog.  The dog recently  had surgery and had to be confined.  I don't own a kennel and was looking for a more versatile option.  Upon arrival, opening up the box, I was pleasantly surprise to find the fence was already assembled.  One pull on the strap, lifted the entire fence out of the box.  I set the fence into the desired shape, put down the dog bed, put the dog in and closed the gate.  It was very simple.  This set up allows me to fed, water, attend and pet our dog all without opening a cage door.I'll be using it in the future to keep the over excited dog from running over my young nieces and nephews during family events.  This way the dog can be in the room with us and not doing any harm, like stealing food from children's hands.	
- 1	I wanted the Kick Mat to cover most of the seat back to prevent mud, dirt, etc.from staining the seat.  These mats are definitely too short for that task.	
1. 	If there is one way to swaddle my son easily it is using this sleepsack. I highly recommend this for a newborn and to aid in getting some great sleep. So soft too!	
1. 	I wouldn't use on an 8+ month old (or so), because it really isn't that good for a sitter upper who isn't very good at safely climbing off things, and worse for an active toddler trying to climb on everything.It was very nice before then, because it laid back nicely and reclined nicely, and it looked comfortable for a little baby, and later less reclined for an emerging sitter.  It was also good for training him to drink a bottle by himself, and he seemed very comfortable in it.I used it one day with my 16 month old, when he was very sick and just wanted to recline and relax in front of the TV.  The next day, he was once again trying to climb up the back of it, and I had to put it back away.  Not that a toddler wants to sit around in a chair anyway.	
- 1	I bought these shades because they are wider than any other I've found in stores, but that's pretty much all it has going for it.Pros:1) Wider than the ones I've been able to find in stores.Cons:1) The suction cups are useless.  They always seem to fall off either when I close the door or just randomly as I am driving.  I cannot even get the bottom suction cup to stick so the shade is left to dangle-- which could be a contributing factor to why it keeps falling off.  I had to use the top suction cups for a Brica sun shade and left it dangling and I never had an issue with it falling off.2) Cheaply made.  Thin and flimsy.  The Brica one I had previous to this was much sturdier, but I had returned that one because it wasn't wide enough.Update: However, the plus side to it being cheaply made is that the hooks are so thin that it bypasses by window's safety feature of automatically rolling back down when it detects something in the way.  I had originally avoided trying the hooks because with the Brica sun shade, the windows automatically rolled down when I tried to use its hooks.  But out of frustration of the shades falling down, I gave it a shot and my windows closed.3)  The side that faces outside to everyone else is white so it makes the logo stand out.  It's not even a good looking logo either.  Fortunately the logo is near the bottom so I just pull the shade down pass the window so it doesn't show.	
- 1	Dont use silicone use natural rubber for your baby. I use Nuk rubber Orthodonic nipples because they are natural and work perfectly.	
- 1	We received this as a gift, I would have never picked this stroller, but tried it anyway.  After 6 months the fabric tore off the metal rod in the front, exposing the rod.  This happened simply from the baby's knee pushing against the fabric.  There is a reason this stroller is so cheap -- it is disposable, like a disposable diaper.  We're changing it for something like the UPPAbaby G-Lite.	
1. 	Love this stroller!  It is a breeze to fold up, as well as it's pretty sturdy for an umbrella stroller.  We use this one when we travel, can gate check it at the airport.  It folds up very compactly, goes through the TSA x-ray machine no problem.  The sun shield is detachable, if you are travelling at the airport, would suggest to put that part in the suitcase, and then just take the stroller and the bag it comes with to the gate check.  The bag itself is durable, I don't think that you need to purchase a separate gate check bag, we have been on at least 6 airplanes now, it has withstood at least that many handlings.  It is lightweight and also has a little area on the the bottom to put some items.  I would suggest buying something that can go between the two handles so that you have more space to put things.  When we anticipate that we are going to go somewhere that is kinda bumpy through, we will take our BOB stroller, as this one doesn't have any suspension, and ride can be bumpy if you are not on a sidewalk/pavement.	
1. 	Love the bib !!!! i washed it several times and still looks like new . i bought 2 of them	
- 1	While the pattern is cute, this mat is made of a very thin plastic--think of those disposable, emergency rain coats you keep in the back of your car. Given the thin plastic, I would say that the mat is not terribly durable. I really don't even use the mat under my son's chair, instead, we sometimes use it like a toy parachute--my husband and I flap it up and down while my son crawls under it.	
1. 	This product really did the job when cleaning my granddaughters bottles. It was vibrant and really cleaned off the formula grit!	
1. 	I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.	
- 1	I love the concept and look of the Sleep Sheep, but there are a couple of features that I don't care for. Firstly, the sheep is on a 25 or 45 minute timer (which may work for some kids) but I really need something that runs all night. My baby wakes up as soon as it goes off. Plus, the only sound that is continuous (like a whooshing, and the only I can stand listening to since he sleeps in our room) is the rain setting. (Mother's heartbeat is just creepy... not conceptually, just this particular version) The other sounds are obnoxious and distracting- especially the whales, though my husband likes them. I guess I should have just used my current alarm clock on rain setting all night. Lastly, it needs to be much louder! All that said, I do use it- and could see other families having no problems. At $30 or whatever, it is worth the gamble.	
- 1	After originally posting a review with 1 star, I am now upgrading the caps to 2 stars based on the fact that they fit on regular bottles.When I bought these the valves prevented any liquid getting through and then the manufacturer suggested that I squeeze the valve's spout before using it. Hey presto, it worked! There is no mention of this on their website nor on the little info sheet in the packet. Moreover, after washing them, the valves get stuck again so often that I have resorted to squeezing the spout every time before I put them in. This is not so bad in comparison to the fact that they have no lids so if your baby doesn't finish the bottle, you have to remove the cap (very messy and impossible to do with a squirmy baby in arms) and stick something else on with a watertight cap! This is because the caps can leak even when screwed tight.	
- 1	I don't like this k'tan. I have pretty much lived in my original k'tan for the last four months and was really excited to try this one in hopes that it would keep my child cooler. I ordered the same size that I have in the original and it fit to small. It doesn't stretch as well and neither me or the baby was comfortable. I'm returning it.	
1. 	Great cup that I use at my house for whey Grandson comes over. He loves drinking from the cup and it is a durable product.  Very cute design as well.	
- 1	I originally purchased a traditional crib bedding set which included a very cute bumper, but after reading about how unsafe they were and searching for alternatives I came across this product. The only useful thing it did was to keep the pacifier in my baby's crib every time he dropped it in the middle of the night. It's barely padded in order to be breathable, so it didn't keep the baby from bumping his head against the rails. It also didn't keep his limbs from getting stuck between rails. It collapses easily (so babies cannot climb it) but again, in order to be safe, it defeats the bumpers' purpose: to keep limbs from getting stuck and protect their heads from hitting the wood. We currently are not using it anymore. Bumpers are not safe, I'd rather have to go free his arms and legs or console him when accidentally hits his head, but we can also do without this mesh because it does not do anything at all!!! I really wanted to like it but it is a waste of money	
1. 	This bib is great. It does as advertised with protecting those neck folds from formula dribbles. There is a long piece of Velcro at the closure so the neck opening size is adjustable.The actual bib is bigger than I expected. It is plenty large on my 13lb 3 month old. I plan on using these when he starts cereal too because they cover enough of his body. The material is a very soft terry even after a few washes.And THANK YOU tommee tippee for making this bib the same color as formula! I have far too many white bibs that get formula stains and just look gross during a feeding with yellow spit up all over them.My only complaint would be that I wish the Velcro was Aplix (the not scratchy hook and loop) instead.	
1. 	I loved the fact that though this is a sturdy unit, it was ridiculously easy to set up. We were trying to figure out a quick and easy way to keep our 1 year old from playing with the TV and the wires around it. One of our friends' purchased this product from Amazon and used it as a fence around the TV and the cabling. We got the yard, and are now using it for the same purpose, and are very happy with the stability of the yard. Perhaps its not the purpose the yard was intended for, but it works very well.	
1. 	First I would have to say what a great seller. I ordered pink and for some reason I got blue, I emailed them and they promptly sent me out a pink one!My baby also loves to lay on her changing table and feel the softness of the cover, sometimes i just put her on there to let her feel it.	
1. 	My crawler/wobbler is now an active toddler and needed more room so I bought this extension. Just what we needed! Word to the wise: once a toddler they will be able to lift & move  the fencing a little, not enough to get out but perhaps enough to get closer to something you would rather they not have access to. this is greatly impeded by installing the adhesive pads included, and/or attaching it to the leg of a heavy piece of furniture with the blue nylon snap straps also included. I don't know if the straps are included for this reason, but this works well for us. between the pads and the straps she cannot push the fencing around the room and has given up trying.	
1. 	This took seconds to install and was working great from the beginning.  I put it at about 7 o'clock.  I am not sure why this has so many negative reviews, our little girl bangs the lid up and down a quarter inch testing it every day and it has held up well so far.	
1. 	This is a very nice stroller - light (I can hold my child and take the stroller out of the car and unfold it, at the same time); roomy, does not look or feel like a toy, as many umbrella strollers do. I wanted the canopy to cover the back and not to be loose, so the sun always gets to the child, and this one does that. The material looks durable, the 5-point harness is also a nice feature.I give it 4 stars, because when folded the front wheels touch the canopy and make it dirty. The lack of a cup holder is also not very convenient, although not a great minus in my opinion. The back wheels get a little close to your feet, so you might kick them while walking - also not a great issue in my opinion.Out of the lightweight strollers out there, this one is definitely high quality and a decent price. The price on Amazon is $[...] less that the regular retail, which is another plus.	
- 1	My son just chewed off the top of the silicone spout right away, so the cup became useless.  Otherwise it works fine.	
1. 	Works good at restaurants to keep little one from touching dirty table. Large surface area. Rubber-like surface easily wipes clean. You can put food directly on surface. Easily rolls up and can keep in diaper bag. About the size of a paper towel cardboard roll. Deducted one star because suction cups do not work well to keep mat in place. Would recommend. Haven't found anything else that works better.	
- 1	I was looking for something to keep my baby cool in his convertible carseat. I needed something that a) kept him cool and b) could attach to the seat. This product sort of manages the first, but fails terribly at the second. The material is a nice mesh, which looks like it should feel cool. After a long ride, my baby's head wasn't soaked in sweat, as it usually is after being pressed up against the non-breathable material of the car seat. Unfortunately, the liner does not stay attached to the seat. The bottom part sort of sags against the back of the seat, so I had to adjust it every time my toddler sat down. If I didn't pull it straight, it would crumple under his back and I'm sure that is not comfortable. The head rest attaches to the main body of the liner with velcro, but the velcro can slip, detatching the head rest from the main body, exposing the velro strip. This caused a rash against the baby's neck. Lastly, the head rest theoretically should adhere to something on the back of the car seat (they provide tape), but it doesn't reach and doesn't stick, so the headrest often falls off completely.I ended up sewing the headrest to the liner, and sewing ribbons to the headrest so I could tie it to the carseat. At that point I might as well go buy some mesh fabric and sew my own liner.I gave it two stars as iti does seem to keep things cool, but the design is really poor. Don't buy this.	
1. 	These have been our favorite cups for quite some time as they are valve free. They don't drip or spill and do not gather debris and mold in the tops. We throw them in the dishwasher everyday and the graphics stay for a long time.	
1. 	I love this as a snap-n-go for my Graco35. We were going back and forth between buying this and buying the adaptor bar for our City Mini but opted for this since it's lighter and more convenient.  I actually don't love the car seat itself (Graco35) but this in combination as a stroller was perfect for the first 6 months.  It's lightweight, has ample storage and cupholders, steers well.  Not a lot bad to say about it, except that sometimes when it's folded the &#34;one-touch&#34; open button doesn't work because the wheels kind of lock together.  Then you have jiggle the wheels a bit then the button works.  It was easy to snap the car seat in to place.  All in all, this is a product I'm glad I bought and would use again if we used the same car seat for the next kid.	
- 1	Wanted to love it, but the smell was horrendous, and then I think our cat walked on it. Dead within a month.	
1. 	My son has had teeth since he was 3 or 4 months old.  He was a very early teether and we did not slack off one bit, his teeth have been brushed every night since they cut through. I find through all the variety of brushes we have gone through, these seem to last the longest, the bristles are not too soft, and not too hard, so they hold up fairly well, for at least 2-3 months,which is great considering the amount of time we spend brushing.  My son loves the fat handle and will often chew on it because it feels nice.  He will also chew on the bristles as a practice brushing before his dad takes and it brushes his teeth properly.  We generally sing This is the way we brush our teeth..... early in the morning) and it keeps him calm enough for Daddy to get all those little pearly whites!	
- 1	I bought this swing because I read great reviews for it, but I have found that it is very noisy. I thought maybe the motorhead was defective so I called Fisher Price and they sent me a new one, but the new one is just as noisy. It makes this horrible creaking sound when you turn the swing on. Also, the legs are not very sturdy. I have placed it on every surface in my house (tile, wood, carpet, rug) and have not found a single surface that it works well on. The minute I turn it on the legs start to wobble. Needless to say, I stopped using this swing. A friend gave me another Fisher Price swing that her daughter used and that one is just fine, but it is a different model. I would recommend the Fisher Price swing but definitely not the My Little Lamb model.	
1. 	We have purchased it when our son was about 7 months old, using the audio monitor before. I guess the price of it was the main thing that kept me from buying it.Now I'm thinking I should have done it right from the moment my son was born. It is absolutely a great idea to have one, as it saves you a lot of time and effort just to look into monitor versus guess work of what was this sound - just a stir? Or going into the  room to check on baby and waking him up.It works fairly good along our wireless network, and lots of other different-frequency equipment, the only spot I have problems sometimes is in my bedroom which was built out of the crawl space underneath the garage - so it is mostly concrete walls there.But still I get a decent picture.The only tip  - if your baby is always sleeping in the darkened room - you might as well buy a black and white one, as the picture is always going to be in nightshot anyways.The bigger screen is a plus too, considering the fact that you're going to watch the whole crib and the picture is going to be pretty small.	
1. 	I pumped at work and didn't really feel like dragging my pump parts to the communal kitchen to wash off twice a day. I was able to use these wipes to clean my pump parts in the privacy of my office. I even threw a pack into the diaper bag -- these are great for cleaning toys, pacifiers, anything!	
- 1	They don't show a picture of the back of this product but it is a sticky material that will melt to your car seats inthe heat.  I returned this as I've had that type of backing ruin other things so I knew what would happen. Going with the Britax version instead.  Liked this better intiially b/c it covers the seat back as well, but not worth ruining the leather.	
1. 	We use this at daycare to hold cloth diapers.  We line with a plastic bag and bring the dirties home daily.  Virginia state health code requires that diapers pails at daycare have to have a pedal open top for.  For the price this fits the bill. It's large enough that is could hold 2-3 days worth of diapers but I think odors would become a problem. At home we just use a hanging zippered wet bag that we can throw into the wash with diapers.	
1. 	I purchased this gate at Babies R Us, but read the reviews first from Amazon.  I just purchased a toddler bed for my child and the gate is used to keep her in her bedroom at night.  The gate was so easy to put together and fits perfectly at the entrance of her bedroom door.  To open it, all you do is step on the foot pedal, which is needs weight to open.  The only problem I have now, is that my child closes the gate all the time.  When it's suppose to stay open.  Oh, well!!	
- 1	I couldn't fit very many of my milk bags in it.  Also, please note they must be flat or this doesn't work well.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and just use ziplocs, now.	
- 1	I really wanted this monitor for the temperature readout as we have a January newborn and I worry about her being too cold.  Another selling point was the fact that it was supposed to be a private channel (2.4 ghz) and relatively quiet.  The temperature is WAY off- like 5-6 degrees higher than the actual temperature in the room.  I wrote to customer service and there is no way to calibrate it.  The monitor buzzes about half the time- maybe it is our wifi?  There is nothing to be done about the buzzing.  The other functions (flashlight, lullaby, nightlight, tc.) I have not found to be useful yet.  I would probably look into an avent or anglcare monitor if I were to replace this.	
1. 	I purchased this set for my baby on the way.  I was a little hesitant on paying so much for bedding that gets used for a relatively short period of time.  With my previous children, I bought much cheaper sets and got what I paid for.  They wore out and faded fairly quickly and only made it through one child.  This set is beautiful.  The quality is obvious.  The bumper and comforter are twice as thick as cheaper versions and you cannot match the detail.  The animals seem to jump right out at you.  It is absolutely adorable and I like the fact that it is not baby colors.  Plus you get everything with this set including a diaper stacker and window valance.  I also bought it when it was on sale so I got 15% off.  Well worth it and althought this will be my last child,  it could easily be passed on to another.  Don't waste your time with cheaper versions.	
1. 	Wonderful bottles, as our daughter won't use anything else.  Wish they were more narrow so she could hold them herself.  Occasional leaking when shaking milk around or mixing a bottle of formula.	
- 1	I loved the design of this carrier but it hurted my back and shoulder so badly after wearing it for 10 minutes. My baby is 4 months old and there is no way that the straps can be adjusted to fit my body and the baby so baby wasnt tightly wraped against my body. This resulted in pulling her forward which I believe caused the back straining. I really wished it worked because it was very pretty to wear.	
1. 	I primarily breast feed and pump so my husband can bond with baby during feeding also. I originally got alot of Avent Bottles but baby didn't like the nipples.  The playtex nursers worked well with the Gerber Breast Milk Storage Bags as well as their own liners.  I did however have to buy the nurser nipples for newborns (square tip) which are softer and more 'natural' shaped.	
1. 	The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google Door Guardian installation instructions, find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8 inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16 inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16 inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.	
- 1	This was a total waste of money - nothing fits in it and it is terrible to clean when you do find something to fit into it. I would definetly NOT recommend putting food in it. For now I have the toothbrush handle in it so we don't lose the tooth brush but that is about all it is good for. The opening is not much bigger than a quarter so look around before you buy it and see if you have anything small enough to slip into it. The clip does not stay clipped either - the slightest tug and it comes off the shirt or bib, pointless because then both items are on the floor needing washing. Wish I had not bothered - total waste of money.	
- 1	Ok, so the dresser was only $200 (plus shipping), but I would have rather had a little more drawer space.  The fronts of the drawers measure almost 9, but the insides are only 3-1/2 deep!!!!  As others have said, the front of the drawers and outer casing of the dresser are pretty solid, but the drawers themselves are particle board.  It took about an hour to put together and according to my husband, the instructions were easy to follow and there were no pieces missing.  I would only recommend this item if you are looking for a dresser that looks nice but don't need a lot of storage space.	
1. 	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).	
- 1	I ordered 6 of those, each different color, for my baby which will be born in April, will use it but this one came with a broken snap at the top- so not to happy about it , will try to fix it, color is nice thought	
1. 	I have to order these every two weeks since my dishwasher likes to eat them.  They keep falling into the heating element.  And yes I have bought the basket but that stupid thing only holds three at a time.	
1. 	Yes, this material is a little 'plastic-y' and stiff, but I have found that bibs that are too soft or cloth-like aren't as good as repelling water or food.  This has been a great find for us.  I really appreciate the elastic around the wrist-bands -- not too tight and just perfect for my son.  I should state that he is a big 9 month old, but not off the charts.  I was pleased to get the Dr. Seuss one at a reduced price.  I love a better deal!	
1. 	This is probably the best gate I've had so far. I really like the hands free foot peddle. I've had it for more than six months and haven't had any problems.	
- 1	These don't hold up in the dishwasher. After just one wash the spoons tips are all melted and deformed. They are more like take and toss.	
- 1	I assume by everyone else's reviews I got a lemon, but both sound and night vision did not work with my monitor. I called Infant Optics' customer support, and they were accommodating and were willing to process a return for me - but could not generate a free shipping return label like Amazon could if I returned it through them. I considered reordering this product again, but instead am going with the Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor which seems to have consistently high ratings.	
1. 	When I first got this pillow I wasn't ecstatic about it, it was okay. The seams at the top sorta bothered my arms/shoulders. I have had it for 2 months now and LOVE LOVE the pillow!We moved our bed against the wall so that it can't fall off the bed. I have no back pain with it and sleep through the night so well!	
1. 	Great for baths! Or for those babies that love chewing on things lol. I always thing bath toys are fun for lil ones	
1. 	My 3 month old likes to be held a lot and this is a life saver! I can walk (not sit, but that's my baby for you) around doing things and she will be happy looking around and/or will fall asleep in the carrier. My back hurts if I carry her in it too long though. I probably should have considered the one with a waist strap even though it's bulkier since I have back issues. Doesn't bug my husband though. The worst part is when I'm out with her in it and I have to take her out to put her in her car seat. It's hard to not wake her up (and she hates her car seat).	
1. 	We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket.  The ONLY one our daughter (now two - she used it for about 3 months) and now our 2 month old son does not break out of is the Miracle Blanket.ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two flaps that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby.  The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking coocoon that works!*  NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up!*  Keeps them warm with nothing else required.DISADVANTAGES*  The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!*  Nothing else we can think of	
- 1	I am hoping I will use this in the future. However I have yet to use this item for my twins	
- 1	Don't buy this pillow if you will be using it to nurse. The cover doesn't come off to wash either piece! I don't care for it's shape, but it might be perfect for another mother/baby pair. The fact that you can't wash the cover is ridiculous. What child doesn't dribble milk out of their mouth? What mother doesn't drip a little? You are going to get milk on this and not be able to remove the cover to wash it. You will have to wash the whole pillow. Not cool.	
1. 	Our daughter loved to sit in it and watch the lights and music play at about one month old. (With the constant play switched on)&#60;br /&#62;At two months she figured out how to kick and make the lights go herself.  She was rewarded by kicking her feet.  I was worried it would be hard to make it work, but even the little kicks make it work.  She had her first laugh in this bouncer.&#60;br /&#62;She is now 4 1/2 months old and still loves to play in it and make the lights and sounds go.&#60;br /&#62;I also love to put her in the bouncer without the toy bar on so she can sit where I can see her and talk to her better.&#60;br /&#62;A must have.	
1. 	Bought this for my grandchild and my daughter-in-law loves it and says its so easy to bathe the baby in this. It is not too big and cumbersome and the swing part makes the baby feel safe.	
1. 	My daughter loves it and I love it too.Its a fun fun fun musical toy!!!Well built toy!!! The edges are carefully covered with smooth soft plastic. awesome buy!	
- 1	My daughter does not like these cups, so I don't like them.  It's too hard on her mouth and too hard to get any liquid out. They also don't click when screwing the lid on, unless you're extremely muscly.  She is 15 months old, who knows, maybe she will use them when she is older.  She did much better with the NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, 10-Ounce, when going from bottle to cup.	
- 1	This may sound pathetic, but after buying this product I find myself too lazy to use it. You have to take time to stretch the elastic edges around the seat. It's quicker to just throw a blanket over the seat. I've actually decided to spend a few hundred bucks and just get the windows tinted. It's so hot where I live that we're all sweating by the time the AC cools off the car.	
- 1	You might as well glue a foam pool noodle to the crib rail, becuase this thing doesn't stick. Seeing that others have had problems with these not sticking, I figured that they couldn't be manufactured that poorly and that others were maybe not cleaning the rail well enough before applying. I was wrong. These don't stick without the help of your adhesive of choice.	
1. 	This replaced our soft toy-type faucet cover.  We don't use the bubble bath option.  But the kids think it's great to rinse under the cascading water.  No problem getting it to fit our faucet.	
1. 	MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE TASTE AND THE BRUSH ON HER GUMS VERY CUTE AND GOOD PRICE WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHER MOMS.	
- 1	This monitor was great while it lasted.  We had it set up with three cameras to watch our three kiddos wherever they were sleeping, but one camera and the main monitor stopping working in under two years.  The warranty is only for one year...something you don't think about until you need it.  The customer service hasn't been very quick to respond either with days in between contact (and no resolution so far).	
- 1	This product would be genius if it actually worked properly!! I installed the thing perfectly, following the directions to the letter.  My issue is that whenever I depress the pedal to open the lid and insert the diaper, the next time the pedal does NOT work.  I have to actually open the whole darn can and re-shut it to re-engage the pedal, several times, to get it to work again.  You can't just pry open the lid b/c the clamping mechanism will not work. If this unit worked perfectly it would be the best diaper invention ever. I think Diaper Genie was just too inventive with this one without it working properly all the time. Its a real hassle to use because of my above listed issues with the product.  Its beyond frustrating.  Buy at your own risk. Your's might work or it might not.	
1. 	Not as soft as the fleece ones I usually use, but at least they're all cotton. When I'm especially leaky, I do have to swap these out for fresh ones now and then, as they get rather damp.	
1. 	I purchased this product for my 16 month son to use for an upcoming plane trip. We purchased the dog model of this. The product we received was very true to the picture and seems to be very high quality. The fabric is very soft and feels as though it would hold up well to a few cycles in the washer.  Initially, my son wasn't a fan of having it around his neck, but we demonstrated how it was used on ourselves and he seemed to warm up to the idea. Then we used in the car a few times when he was about to zonk out.  Overall, it is a little big for him, but not enough for it to be completely useless. He is a toddler, so I'm hoping he can grow into and get a few years of good use out of it.  I will say while it's been helpful in the car, it doesn't completely eliminate that 'head forward hang' that sometimes happens when he falls asleep and slumps over.  This seems to help a bit so that it doesn't seem quite as uncomfortable, but doesn't solve the issue completely. That said, I don't blame this as that is more an issue of the car seat dimensions.Overall, we've been very happy with this and my son has enjoyed carrying it around with him. I think this will be a great purchase for upcoming trips!	
1. 	My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!	
1. 	I had to travel and didn't want to bring my large electrical breast pump. So I ordered this manual pump and I like it.Pros:- Easy to use - I like the letdown trigger- Easy to assemble- Easy to clean- Small for travel or a quick pump without pulling out the electric pumpCons:- Sometimes if I screw the bottle on too tight, the suction decreases. I unscrew by one thread and it seems to work better.	
- 1	Very cheaply made. Compare to other brand, i could not even call these breast pads. Very thin, too thin. Not absorb at all. Leaks all over. They should call it breast paper....I ordered 2 boxes, used 2 of them. Had to go out and buy another brand.I have lots of breast milk, this is not good for me at all. I think it only lasted 20 mins before the milk leaks out.I always love nuk products. I do not understand why they made pads like this. It is not a good product.	
1. 	First let me say that I love the online reviews on this site.  I use them all the time before making any major purchases and they have saved me a lot of money, time, and hassle.  I have written several of my own reviews on other products as well.  That being said, I have to say that I'm really very baffled by the reviews on this stroller.  We bought it after much consideration and test driving at our local BRU store the other night. I have to wonder if the stoller we bought is the same one that so many others have complained about!  The main issue seems to be the flimsy cardboard back.  Well, on the one we bought, the back is made up of what feels like 3 sturdy plastic panels that I tried to purposely bend and couldn't.  Perhaps the design was very recently changed, but in any event, ours is definately not cardbord or flimsy.  We have used it for 3 different outings and my 13 month old is happy as a clam in it.  He's fallen right to sleep in it 2 out of those 3 times.  As for storage, yes, storage space is limited, but we're not dealing with a travel system here.  This is an umbrella stroller, folks, and I've yet to come across any umbrella stroller regardless of brand or price that has a large storage space.  Same with the cupholder issue.  We simply bought one at BRU for 5.99 and it fits great.  Problem solved.  Bottom line, I went with my gut on this one and I'm so glad that I did.  This is a great umbrella stroller for those of you who are tired of lugging that bulky travel system everywhere and want something samller and easier to deal with.  Plus, this one comes with a raincover so you don't have to spend onother $20 to get one.  Don't be mislead by reviews saying that this is a bad sroller because it's not.  It's sturdy, easy to use, and does everything a high-end umbrella stroller should.  We love it.UPDATE 03/31/2006Ok, we've been using this stroller frequently for nearly 2 months now and I thought I would go ahead and update my review. It disheartens me to see that so many have had a problem with this stroller. I think what's happening is that there are still a few of the older ones floating around out there that have the flimsy backs on them. Chicco fixed that problem and the newer ones are great. The back on ours is very sturdy and we haven't had any problems with it at all. My son is almost 15 months and weighs just over 20 lbs and is still very comfortable in the stroller. He'll sit in it for long periods of time and never fusses. In fact, he usually falls asleep in it. My point is, many of these reviews are not based on the stroller as it is now. Check it out for yourself and you'll see. It's a great buy for $90.00! We've thrown away the box and receipt, since I have no reason or intention to return it!	
- 1	This product is terrible. We bought it looking for a less-crazy, more modern-looking alternative to the noisy, pastel-printed alternatives. But there isn't really any part of this mobil that works. The cross bars are prone to breaking (we had to superglue them twice while setting it up). The cards are supposed to be interchangeable, but I spent 20 minutes trying to swap out a single card, only to give up and spend 20 minutes undoing what I did. Even if you leave the card alone, they don't really hang flat. And the attachment mechanism is worse than other mobiles that are in the same price range. Terrible!	
1. 	We have very drooly 8 month old teething twins. Regular bibs weren't catching all of the drool, but these have been great! All of the colors allow for matching to their outfits (which isn't important but a nice touch). Would definitely recommend!	
1. 	My baby loves her sleepsacks almost as much as I do.  They are wonderful because you don't have to worry about the blanket falling off or accidentally covering the baby's face.  The cotton ones are perfect for summer because it is light and airy.  My baby knows it is bedtime when we pull out her sleepsack and settles right to bed (typically).  They are pretty long, so they fit for a long time.	
1. 	Works great. I keep it under the regular 'waterproof' mattress cover for when there is (rarely happens) a full bladder whoops from my recently potty-trained daughter.	
- 1	The bag is really cute and great for travel.  I cloth diaper my son and used this bag when I was out and about.  Unfortunately the bag tore in the wash the second time I washed it and it was never put in the dryer.  Yes, its adorable but its not going to last long.  Once you touch the bag you can tell its not very durable.  I gave it two stars because it's a cute bag.  Guess I'll have to figure out how to fix it. Definitely not worth the money in my opinion.	
- 1	I cant even explain to you how upset I was with this product. It kept falling off the wall in the bathroom.And this is kind of a purpose of it, no?	
1. 	This was my favorite bottle bag for my son.  It will hold six bottles with the ice pack going on top of the bottles.  I usually only put five in at one time so that I could use additional ice packs.  The storage on the top is small, but will fit two Gerber baby food containers, spoon and bib.  I used this to take his bottles to daycare and on all-day trips.  For short trips (to daycare), one ice pack would work.  For all day trips, we used additional ice packs.	
- 1	We bought this stroller before out little one was born in January and I was quite excited about it. I had done tons of research looking into the strollers and settled on this. We did not buy any additional accessories for this stroller and found it to be a pain in the ass! Honestly I found it to be much more cheaply made than the Uppababy Vista we bought after this (when our little one was 3 months old).The price tag in my opinion is not even worth half or what they sell this for. Here is a simple pro and cons which I found with this stroller (after having the uppababy vista and using it and a little comparison as I know many moms and dads debate between the two.PROS:-Looks nice-Extremely compact-Handle bar goes both ways-convenient for when you are eating out, etc and don't want to switch the bassinet or seat with baby inside-No padding in bassinet-Thin fabric that I have seen fade quickly and then look pretty cheapCONS;-NO STORAGE- the under-seat bag is absolutely worthless in my opinion. Its impossible to get things in and out and can not even hold my diaper bag-Does not fold in one piece, When you are having to put the baby in the car and get going quickly the LAST thing you want to be doing is to take the stroller apart and set one piece on the ground will putting the other in the trunkNow onto the Uppababy vista for those who might be interested-Fold of the stroller: Uppababy wins. Althought both can not be folded with bassinet the Uppababy folds with the seat attached unlike the Bugaboo which you MUST take a part at each fold-Bassinet- Uppababy wins by FAR. Uppababy makes an all organic, padded mattress, and really nice a comfortable bassinet for baby, the Bugaboo bassinet is really simple and I found to also be flimsy.-Fabric-Uppababy wins by far. The fabrics are extremly thick and durable and I don't see the fabrics fading like the Bugaboo fabrics do-Storage-Uppababy....I can fit an ENTIRE cart of groceries into the under seat basket, I couldn't even fit my diaper bag in the bugaboo storage thing-Smooth/Ease of push- I would say they are about equal. The uppababy I believe handles terrain a bit bitter and the bugaboo might seem a bit easier as the entire stroller is more lightweight-Harness: Uppababy wins....its padded and easy to adjust-Belly bar: Uppababy wins....it had a removable cover that can be washed unlike the bugaboo-Handle bar: Uppababy wins...it just seems more durable and more comfortable than the simple handlebar on the bugabooHonestly I don't think this stroller is practical at all. I really wish I would have bought the Uppababy from the beginning. I know everyone has different needs so definitely test them out and think about the little things before purchasing!If you don't need storage space and don't fold your stroller up often this might be for you. If you are going to running errands and folding it up a lot....go with the uppabby!Also love the uppababy becomes a double stroller so easily.	
1. 	I really like this changing table. The changing table that was supposed to come with my furniture set from BRU was part of a big long dresser thing (not an upright, a long one) and was going to cost $600. For a dresser that wouldn't fit in her room. No. So I decided to find a cheaper one that matched her room, and landed upon this one. It has been absolutely great for 8 months now. I have 0 complaints.	
1. 	My baby outgrown the Summer Infant swaddles in length by 2mo.  This sack works well as long as you keep the swaddle flaps 1-2 inches below the shoulders, or be sure the hands are tucked in so the arms cannot push up the flaps to gather around the neck.  The material is soft and washes well.  However, a strong baby will likely be able to slide his arms out of the swaddle rather easily.  My baby is about 24 to 25 inches long and the sack still has ample room.  It works well.	
- 1	When I read the reviews I saw a lot of bad and a lot of great comments. It seemed like if you just read and followed the directions it would work great. NO WAY! If you tighten enough so that it doesn't leak then the baby can't get anything out of the spout. If you loosen it like the directions say it leaks all over everything! I'm returning it ASAP.The only good thing I can say is that it does fit with the parts from Dr. Browns bottles, so you don't have to buy everything.	
1. 	When we first bought this toy our son really enjoyed playing with it - in and outside of the bathtub. We introduced him to one of the five figurines at a time, since we knew that he will get eventually bored with them. The figurines are small and fun to hold and look at. They are quality made and have lasted for as long as our interest in them. He still plays occasionally with them, but has now graduated to some more sophisticated bath toys.	
- 1	I had high hopes for these little guys but no such luck. Easy packaging literally open and they are ready to go. I put one on my bathroom door and it worked to prevent it slamming on my son's fingers, but it left the gap at the other side of the door where the hinges are, where he eventually worked his way over and CRUNCH slammed them in there instead. :(I am sure these were designed for the one option on the door and they work for that, but they did not address the other side and for that I give it a 2 star.I have since removed them and found that my daughter uses them as elf ears for dress up. awesome.	
1. 	This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained. The flashing lights are very attractive. Though I have to say, the sound quality is just so-so, but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying, so that's all that matters. I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy. My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry...	
1. 	I just got this bed, put it together.  It's real easy to put together, took me about 40min.  It's rock solid.  The metal frame was a bit confusing, the metal hinges are not to be extended parallel to the frame but are angled upwards, then it all makes sense.  I used a lever to make it all level.  Espresso is a good color also.	
1. 	I purchased these bags twice intead of some type of expensive diaper genie.  Super stinky diapers still need to be double bagged (like after baby starts to eat food), but overall I am happy with these.	
- 1	I had this carrier and could only use it for maybe 30 min, at that is a stretch, without it killing my back. And that was with a 8lb baby! I have an ergo and wow! What a difference! So much better for baby's hips and the back. I can wear my daughter for hours without any pain and my daughter weighed more and you can use the ergo for up to like 50lbs (can't remember the details). It's worth the extra $30- trust me!	
- 1	I don't think these will last very long.  The wash rags were held together with tape--that tape was stronger than the wash cloth!  When I took it off, the terry cloth came off with the tape and left a bare spot that was still apparent after running them through the wash.  Disappointing.	
1. 	Not all kits include scissor, digital thermometer, tweezer etc. This is one does. The compact pouch securely holds everything in place which is great for traveling. Great value!	
1. 	My baby is four weeks old and bathtime was not much fun for either one of us until we got this great little inexpensive sponge.  We have an infant tub with the sling, but he would get so cold and slide down so I was constantly having to hold his head up and readjust him.  Also I had to put his tub in our big bathtub, so I was forced to lean over the side.  Not fun when you've had a C-section!  I had seen tubs that fit in the kitchen sink but I really wanted a way to bathe him in our smaller bathroom sink, where I have all of his towels and bath items nearby.  This sponge suits our needs perfectly.  It soaks up the warm water so my son stays warm, and it supports his head wonderfully.  Bath time is so much quicker and easier now, and there is a lot less crying!  I will probably use this product until he can sit up on his own.  Even if he outgrows the bathroom sink, I will probably put this sponge in his infant tub for extra comfort and support.  Definitely worth the money for me!	
1. 	A bottle warmer has many uses.  The first and most obvious use is the fact that you can have a bottle warming while you're changing your baby's diaper, getting them dressed etc...While some will complain that it takes 5 minutes, I find that to be a gross over estimate.  It takes not quite 2 minutes from refridgerator to warm.  If it truly took 5 minutes my guess is that too much water was being put into the resevoir.The next great use is the fact that it's easy and so any Dad - new or experienced - can figure out how to use it to help out.  It's extremely easy to use so it can even be easily used in the middle of the night.The one weakness that I found has to do with warming up breast milk that's been frozen.  It seems to have some sort of timer that times how long the water in the resevoir has boiled to not let the milk get too hot.  If breast milk has not had an opportunity to thaw out in the fridge yet it will obviously take more than just 1 press of the button for the milk to thaw and be warmed up.  The problem is that even though there's still ice in the bottle the water will be warm and so the heating element that heats the water will shut off after 10 seconds.  What I had to do was shake the bottle to more evenly distribute the temperature through out the bottle and add more cool water to the resevoir 3-4 times.  This situation is easily fixed however by remembering (easier said than done when you aren't sleeping much!!) to take out a bottle 12-18 hours in advance.Overall, great product, great value and a must have.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was a way to set some sort of control to tell it that the bottle is full of frozen liquid.	
- 1	When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the breathable bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. Great idea, but bumper needs work.	
- 1	This thing is weird...like a little bite wing tray that has to be positioned perfectly to do anything.  Also, the 'soft bristles are more like hard nubbins.  I'm really surprised this has such a good rating.  It was useless to my 4 month old.	
1. 	If you don't have a dishwasher, it is so very hard to get a bottle clean - especially if you rinsed it & tossed it in your diaper bag during a day away from home.  These made cleaning so much easier since the top and bottom come off.  Surprisingly, they did not leak! They also do really reduce the amount of air a baby takes in while feeding.	
- 1	This is the fourth set of connectors I've had to buy in the six months that I've had my Medela breast pump. If they were of higher quality I would not have to replace them so frequently. I'm disappointed more generally that Medela would make them of such poor quality to begin with. Since I only pump at night, the pump gets very little use overall, making the quality of these connectors downright shoddy.	
- 1	horrible product -- condensation runs down lid, through hinge holes, into bottom compartment with exposed electric heating element.  eventually stopped working and rusty water poured out the power jack!  opened it up and it was all rusted/corroded.  the company claims this is impossible, well, reports of it are all over the web.  returning for refund, lucky it didn't burn our house down!we switched to just using a glass bowl of water sitting on this, works great:Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer	
- 1	I think this was a nice try, but our baby did not like this and it was not like the breast at all. waste of money.	
- 1	I never write reviews but after spending my money on this I just had to.1) you can't return it so I've read unless its unused2) it leaks your milk (every time my shirt was soak)3) it sucking is very low.. (it takes forever to make a bottle, especially  if your baby needs 1 right away.4) The manual part leaks from the backand last5)That rubber piece is just for show.. it actually makes the product suck.I love there bottles and bottle warmer but the pumps need to put recalled for false advertisement	
- 1	This thing is so huge. I bought it hang on the side of the crib, but it's so ridiculously giant that I ended up nailing it to the wall in the closet. The &#34;shelves&#34; are flimsy and would never stand up under the weight of the products shown in the photo. I'm going to use ti just to store extra diapers and lightweight cloth stuff. Really, I wish I hadn't bought it.	
- 1	I agree with another poster about this issue, I can't believe it hasn't been more of a problem ... yet.  We have two of these seats and our daughter can unbuckle BOTH of the chest buckles easily.  We purchased both of them from a different store but I wanted to warn people who might be researching seats.  This is an unsafe seat!  Even if the chest IS buckled, the ease if it unbuckling makes me wonder if it would STAY buckled if we were in an accident.  We've already had to change out the seat clip buckle because of the recall on those.  I've complained to Graco but have heard nothing back yet.  This is unacceptable.BUY SOMETHING ELSE and check the quality of the buckles when you do buy!	
- 1	Runs very large. My daughter will be in first grade by the time she fits in this. I followed the size guide.	
- 1	When we first got this wipes warmer we were mostly pleased with it. Our only complaint was that you had to add water to the bottom pad every time that you changed to a new packet of wipes.Fast forward 8 months later and it became a pain to close the lid completely as it would pop back open. That meant that the one wipe that would be at the top would be hard and dry by the time of the next diaper change. Multiply that to about 6 changes a day, that meant I was loosing 6 wipes a day or 180 a month. Not acceptable!Then by the time our baby was 16 months old the wipes warmer stopped working completely. We tried several outlets, and the light would still be on as if it was working but it would not warm the wipes anymore! This while we were in the middle of this crazy Polar Vortex winter with so many days of record low temperatures and many snow storms that I lost count.I was hoping this warmer would last us for a longer time than 16 months. So We DO NOT recommend it to anyone and would try our luck with a different brand next time around.	
1. 	my daughter is just 8 month old, but she stares at it when i turn it on before bed time. I think she is not fully aware or interested in it right now. But it is lovely. I pretty sure she will too when the time comes.	
1. 	I think the worst part of safty shopping is for the gates. So many out there boast that they are the best; so I started to read customer reviews. We were moving into a two-story house and needed a great pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs. First I got the hands free one from I think it was safty 1st, with the pedal at the bottom...my daughter figured out how to open it, so it had to be returned! After a few more misses, I bought this one and I love it! The opening is wide, but not too wide. I am a bigger person, and I have no problems getting through this gate with child in tow! It works perfectly in our home and I am completely pleased with it!	
- 1	I only use this go pod when we're at a soccer game. I bought it because I was looking for a chair to place my 5 month old in while I washed the dishes. It turns out that when my baby sits in it, the go pod sinks in. Another thing that I didn't like about it was that the material is falling apart at the corners.	
- 1	This is a cute idea, but the execution is virtually impossible!  The stuff is so sticky that you can't roll it out with their little wooden dowel at all.  The first imprint I did was fine, though not much detail.  Then trying to &#34;cut&#34; the stuff into a circle?  Disaster.  And then trying to &#34;poke&#34; a hole through the top with the straw?  Impossible!!!  It's so sticky and their tools are so dull that it doesn't work and by the time you've gotten anywhere the imprint has been destroyed.  I just threw the whole mess out.  Don't waste your money.  Get real plaster and do it with something better.	
1. 	These bibs are heavy duty, easy to rinse off (probably their best trait), and have a substantial pocket to catch drips and crumbs. However, we never use them because I can't get this bib on our baby comfortably while she's sitting in her high chair. Because the rubber/plastic these are made of is so stiff, there's no way to tuck this in around her, and she's too short for it to dangle. So, while this will be great once she's in a booster seat, I recommend trying something more traditional for a baby in a high chair.	
1. 	We bought this as seat to keep at our parents house for when we visit (~5 times a year). It works perfectly on their chairs and is small enough for them to put away when we leave. Not sure if it work for us on an every day basis, but it works great for those visits.	
1. 	I'll echo what a lot of other reviewers have said, I love these bibs but got them cheaper elsewhere.  (Babies r us had them on sale.)  With that said, for a mommy with a baby with reflux these are wonderful.  Our daughter seems to leak milk all day long and I am constantly trying to scrub it out from under her chin.  The rolled top to these bibs solves the problem and they are a nice length that prevents a larger part of her clothes from getting wet.	
- 1	I bought a Evenflo Symphony DLX first.  I sat one night, read the instructions, installed in my car within 20 minutes and move it to other cars at least twice a week in about 3-5 minutes.I got this car seat for my mom's car.  It was what she was used to, what my sister had used with my niece and what she wanted.  I tried to do the same thing I had done with the Evenflo and found myself two hours later, sweating frustrated and cussing this car seat.  I finally got it in rear-facing even though I wasn't sure it was 100% right, mostly because of the center strap and where it goes in reference to the LATCH system straps.  Also, once I had that how I thought might be right, I was stressed because I could never get it tight enough.  I was used to feeling a very clear sweet spot where a car seat felt secure and I just never got it there.I debated for a week whether or not to return it.  My mom kept saying it would be fine if we just turned it front facing.  My son is 15 months so I finally agreed and repositioned the seat and now he sits front-facing in her 2008 Honda Odessey. If fits more securely, but stays permanently in her van.  I do not move it around like I do the Evenflo.  I don't want that frustration.  The Evenflo is so much easier.The color I got is really pretty.  The car seat looks really nice.  I hope it is as safe as all of the ratings say it is and I never have to find out for sure.	
- 1	It wasn't elegant at all. We had a wonderful nursery set-up but I really felt it needed a rug. Although we have some jungle/animal themed things around the room, this just did not fit FOR US.If you have the entire theme from the Kids Line Jungle room... it may be nice as it completes it. But don't think this would fit as a stand-alone piece in a room that did not have other Kids Line Jungle items.Plus, this is really weak quality- terrible and flimsy.	
1. 	I am using these for frozen home made baby food.  At first I was disappointed that I couldn't get the cubes out as the plastic didn't twist.  The secret is after the food freezes to put them in your fridge for just a few minutes.  After that, then twist the plastic.  The cubes pop out.  Then you can put them back in your freezer and take them out as necessary.  Don't over fill the holes too much or else it'll be even harder to get the food out.  Love that it is made in the USA. The covers have stayed on well for us in our freezer.	
1. 	The fabulous Munhkin Mozart Magic Cube was given to our friend's daughter when she was an infant. From a very early age, we watched in amazement as she responded to the sounds of the music, obviously recognizing changes. We could see the pleasure on her face. As time went on, she played with the toy herself and was constantly drawn to it.There was always a limited assortment of toys for her to explore on the living room floor. She loved to play with some more than others. However, she was always constantly drawn back to this -- the sounds of the music from different instruments was a great source of fascination.As she gets older, the way that she handles Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube becomes more selective and sophisticated. This is one of the best toys we have ever seen to develop delight in music!She is beginning to talk now, and I feel certain that her first words will be, GET ME A HARPSICHORD NOW!!Love it!	
- 1	This may be good when my child is taller (just over 2 ft.) but right now she cannot see over the lip of it so it doesn't really work for us.	
1. 	I've noticed that the negative reviews on this potty focus on how small it is. Yes, it IS small. It would be too small for most kids beyond the age of 3 and any bigger/tall  toddlers. If you are in that category you'd want to look at one of the larger Bjorn potties.HOWEVER, if you are ECing a baby or working on potty training with a younger/smaller toddler, this potty is great. Their feet will touch the ground and it's easy for them to sit on. For myself I love the simple, one-piece design. This makes it really easy to carry to different areas of the house, in the car, and it seems less tempting to be used as a hat. We have used 3 different potties over the years with our children and this is my favorite. The back has a knotch cut out for easy carrying. Really great little potty.	
1. 	I've used these trays for several years. My favorite baby food to make for my babies is to roast yams until they are dripping syrup, and then puree them with a bit of coconut oil. I put the puree in the trays, freeze it, then transfer the cubes to a ziploc freezer bag for storage. These trays are so easy to use and clean. I put them in the dishwasher (TOP RACK ONLY) and they come out beautifully. Don't put them in the bottom, because it warps the lids a little and they don't fit as well. Nothing tastes plastic-y from these trays (unlike some of our ice cube trays).	
1. 	This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training.  It's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks.  It's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off.	
1. 	My son was struggling with getting the hang of regular sippy cups, but he took to this cup right away.  I was worried about spilling, but it doesn't leak or spill unless he turns the cup upside down.  These are actually his favorite sippy cups.  He will now choose them over other cups.  He wants all of his drinks in this sippy.	
- 1	This fabric is not good. I borrowed my friend's sleepy wrap and bought the moby thinking it was the same. Wrong! Boba bought out sleepy wrap and it's so much better. Get that one instead! The fabric is stretchier. :)	
- 1	I really wanted one of these papasan swings because of the super cool light show and I thought the removable canopy was adorable! Plus it has 3 positions so that it can either cradle from side to side or it can swing back and forward facing either direction! My son is only 4 months old and I haven't gotten much use out of it because#1 even on the fastest setting it barely swings back and forth.... You have to come back every minute or so to give it a little push#2 the seat is not adjustable so that the baby can sit upright! They have to always be reclined!I just feel that for $140 I should have been able to use this for up to 1 year old at least! The extra features are NOT worth the money!	
1. 	My 13 month old son LOVES his bath letter and numbers. He loves them so much that he wants to carry them around the house chewing on them.  And the best part is they are VERY durable!  He has 16 teeth already and doesn't rip them to shreds like other things he chews on.  We had to order a second set of these because we had some plumbing issues and these got ruined.  He's getting his second set for Christmas! :o)	
1. 	I just love these. I now own 4 and it's not enough. I wish I only had these for bibs. They are so easy to put on and take off and clean. I throw them in the dishwasher or just rinse them off sometimes during the day. They catch EVERYTHING that drops---applesauce to bread crumbs. My kid even eats out of it when it drops down there. Saves the mess and saves the food.	
1. 	I bought one for my parents, and liked it so much that I bought another for our house.  It really helps to keep the chaos to a manageable level.	
- 1	Every child is going to be different in terms of enjoying/liking a product, our son somewhat enjoyed the walker at first until he fell out of it. There are no side support straps to prevent a left or right fall. Having a son with a body too small for his head, the head tends to go and then the body follows. While in the walker he leaned his head to the left and fell almost completely out of the walker except for a leg/foot that was caught up in the streps like a pirate in ship rigging. Not being a seamstress I have no idea how to fix this on my own or know a good solution, sorry. You may want to try some shoulder straps possibly.	
1. 	These bibs are great. They make my life so much easier. Once my child uses them, I just put them in hot soapy water then air dry. The velcro hasn't worn away at all. Still sticks great.	
- 1	Nice that it's small and portable.  But Baby doesn't like sleeping in it at all. Isn't very comfortable and the pad is very thin.  Bad buy.	
1. 	The best part about this product is how perfect the size of it to transition sitting infants into tubs. The water outlet is a bit cumbersome to work with ESP with one hand. The duck is great for baby baths!	
1. 	My son and I love this tub. I used the sling to give him sponge baths until his cord fell off. He is now 6 weeks old and no need for the sling anymore: he sits perfectly in the &quot;newborn&quot; side of the tub, without slipping. I also enjoy the fact that this tub has a separate water compartment than we put clean water to rinse the baby afterwards. The changing color plug is a plus, because it indicates if the water is too warm for baby.It fits perfectly in our sink too!I recommend this tub, it's great!	
- 1	The product is a solid product but it is tight on my 1 year old so she cannot chew on it while wearing it and she doesnt like to chew on it because it is harder than the ones her other baby friends has	
1. 	bought this for our 4 weeks when she started tracking and looking at contrasting things...the mirrored section is a big hit, she will stare at this for quite a while and seems to enjoy it	
- 1	The only thing my husband and I ended up liking about this carrier was the color and material of the fabric. We bought this carrier to use with our infant daughter and she hated it! The first issue was the straps for whoever is wearing the carrier are not very easy to adjust. Second issue, if your infant is really small, the area at the bottom where their little legs are supposed to come out is really wide so it's not comfortable and leaves bad red marks on their skin. Third issue, we found it almost impossible to put the baby in by ourselves. You needed 2 people in order to make it work. We ended up returning this item after using it on 2 occassions because it was such a pain. We ended up buying a Bjorn Air Carrier to replace it and absolutely loved that carrier.	
- 1	they're cute little pieces of fabric, but they won't be cute after they get stained with poo. seriously who need cute diaper wipes. Just cut a couple of  old t-shirts up into small squares. If you have enough (like 100), you only need to wash them once a month	
1. 	I purchased this for my son who isn't born yet but 2 of my friends with 8-10 month olds told me I had to have one. This may not be that practical for me since I plan on making home made baby food but my friends love this thing.	
1. 	I got this smock for my two year old who likes to play with water in the kitchen sink. I was sick of changing her clothes after sink time and so I bought this smock. It goes on easily over her clothes and has worked to protect her from getting wet. She is picky about clothes but she likes the pocket and she seems to like the bright colors. It has worked for us.	
- 1	This stroller is hard to maneuver and it sucks.  I hate it and feel like I am struggling to push it and turn it.  I am a fast walker wherever I go and this thing slows me down.  This is only good to use at the airport to carry luggage with my child in the front!!  I will never use this stroller for another use.  Thank gosh I have my double BOB stroller which is a Cadillac compared to this thing.  It is to bad because I was hopeful.	
- 1	I ended up not even using this calendar. The drawings and information felt like it came from a textbook in 1970. It looked like something my mom would've used as a teenager. Besides that, it just came with some useful, but unnecessary stickers. Wouldn't buy it again.	
1. 	We felt like overprotective first time parents when we purchased this monitor, but are so happy that we did.  It is great to be able to see our little guy without having to go into his room and potentially wake him up.  He makes lots of noise while he sleeps, so a quick glance at the monitor lets us know if he needs us or is just being his typically loud-sleeping self.The range is excellent.  Our bedrooms and the baby's nursery are on the 3rd floor of our 5000 sq ft house.  We still get reception when on the 1st floor at the opposite end of the house.  We also get reception in most of our yard.The video quality is great.  It's actually easier to see the baby with the monitor than in person at night.We didn't think we'd have much use for this monitor until our baby was older and able to scoot around in his crib, but we've enjoyed it since moving our baby into his nursery.  Highly recommended.	
- 1	I love all the orange ones I bought and love this products so much. However for the blue one I bought, it leaks, turns out that either the lid or the bottle is not round shape so those two never go together. Need better quality control.	
1. 	We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.  At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.  But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.  He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.  He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.  I love that he loves this toy!	
- 1	So, my first impression was very bad with these liners, they kept bunching and making a baby thong and not catching anything but that was only when using a pre-fold and cover. When we switched to pocket diapers these started working amazingly. I lay it all the way out and let the edges lay over the out side of the legs and that holds it tight across the diaper and catches everything. So I love them now. I have never tried any others, so I don't have anything to compare them to. My son is also in the largest size of his one size Kawaii diapers and this cover almost the whole way from front to back of diaper.	
- 1	the qaulity sounds good but the cover is sillier then ever, its easy to remove and also hard to stick in hand,used it for a cup to drink	
- 1	When I first received this I was extremely pleased. It stuck to my tiles extremely well, they are shiny and flat, so I think that helped. I'm not sure if it would stick to a textured tile.However one day I found the scoop in the tub, with the holder still attached and the suction stuck on the wall. It had broken off and the scoop was not even heavy, probably half full, so I had not over loaded it. I tried gluing the suction back to the holder, but it just kept breaking off. Extremely disappointed!!!!	
- 1	I sent these back as soon as I received them.  They were so stiff I can't imagine that they would be comfortable for my daughter, and we would have been able to hear her coming from a mile away because they were so crinkly sounding.  Also, I think that they would have cracked and torn in the wash.  Buy the nylon version made in this brand, they are wonderful!	
1. 	We have been using only Mustela products for my son since he was born. They do the job, they smell great, and they don't break him out.	
1. 	My wife has the large Bugaboo she uses all the time, but I needed a stroller for our one year old to keep in the trunk of my convertible (BMW M3).  This fit the bill.  It is light weight, fits easily in my tiny trunk and my daughter seems happy in it.  Does it have all of the bells and whistles the Bugaboo does?  Of course not.  Does it give me a place to put her when we are out running errands on the weekend.  Yes.I am fairly short (5'4) and have absolutely no problem with the height of the handles.  My only complaint is that occassionally my feet will hit the rear wheels when walking.When folded, two wheels end up at the top and two at the bottom.  This means that if the wheels are dirty, there is no clean side.  Also, the dirty wheels will tend to make the sun visor dirty since they are in contact when folded.The buckle seems to work well although there is a velcro cover that folds over the buckle assembly from the outside in.  I'm not really sure what the purpose of it is, but I guess it keeps my daughter from opening the buckle herself - not that she has the hand strength necessary.Overall, for the reason I bought this, I am happy.  I would not recommend this as the only stroller you own, but is perfect for a second car or for grandma's house.	
1. 	my 8 mo old has loved these since he was 5 mos or so, his favorite is the crab and the turtle as they are easiest to hold and chew on	
1. 	I bought this item after reading the reviews for it here on Amazon.  I have a less exspensive cushioned princess toilet topper but this Baby Bjorn is SO MUCH better!PROS--Easily adjustable to fit most (if not all) toliet seats.-Snug fit; doesn't wiggle/wobble when climbed onto by my 28lb 2yr old & no worries of her legs/fingers being pinched between the seats.-Ergonomic design; my daughter seems very comfortable on this seat; Much more so than the cushioned one I mentioned prior.-Would work well for girls or boys since it has a high front side which helps to avoid accidents.-Very estically pleasing.-One fluid piece so it is easy to clean; no grooves, creases, etc. to have to worry about.-Durable; something I can definitley hold onto for our next baby.CONS-N/A ;)I would highly recommend this item.  It's worth the extra $10 you'll pay for it over the cheaper ones!	
1. 	We love love love ours. We have used for two years, and it is in as perfect condition as when we bought it. No sharp edges a fabulous size, and easy to clean. It is also more attractive than many others we looked at. Could not be happier.	
1. 	We bought this for our youngest and its great! It gives just a little light in her room for us when we check on her and give her something to look at as she falls asleep.	
1. 	We use this for our 22 month old and it is perfect. We were able to ditch the big heavy high chair and we just use this now. This is super easy to clean and it's very portable too. I like that it can be used as both a booster for the table or with the tray. The fact that it has adjustable height settings is also very nice.	
- 1	1) the instructions that came with this product must have been written by a 9 year old Chinese foreign exchange student2) Syncing the cameras to the monitor is a PITA3) When working it has a great picture	
- 1	I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks.  While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.	
1. 	This sponge works great for travel. I used it over the holidays instead of lugging the infant tub around. It is a bit hard to wring out, that could be improved.	
- 1	I got this because I got a boppy with my first dd and was disappointed in it. I am overweight but not huge and the boppy just didn't fit. I figured since this had the belt type adaptation it would maybe suit me better so I was really looking forward to using this for bf this time around. Well I have tried several times and it just isn't comfortable. I'm 5'4 and 200 pounds it's snug but it just doesn't seem that supportive and I'm still having to lift the baby to me too much. I have just found using several pillows (some are throw pillows and others are regular ones) are just more supportive and work better for baby and I. Unfortunately I ordered this when I was around 6 months pregnant and so I can't return it bc with a newborn coming I washed the outside shell so now I'm out that money. If you can with any of these I would try to use someone else's for one or two bf sessions first before ordering one just to make sure it fits and that you find it comfortable so you're not out the money. It seems like good quality, and does fit better than the boppy so thus the 2 stars but sense I still can't use it as intended no more than that.	
1. 	This liner is easy to flush, but is a tad too thin in my opinion.  It doesn't hold wet poop that well.  It is softer than the Kushies liners, but doesn't hold up as well.  So, I have to use two, which gets more expensive.  I'm on the hunt for the perfect diaper liner. :+)	
- 1	Every time I scan I get a different reading, even when using it on myself. It's OK to give you a ballpark number on older kids, but you end up scanning over and over for an average.Our pediatrician requested a temperature reading from a rectal thermometer for our infant which she said was most reliable. Yet, they use ear scanners in her office. I probably should have gotten one of those instead.	
1. 	Son liked is and the price was right	
1. 	It is a very very nice product. It works for my infant baby. My baby barely can open her eyes when the ocean is turning on. I love the sheep. Of course it is bigger than I expected, but anyway, the sheep is a very good sleep-helper.	
- 1	I'm giving it two stars just because I think it's cute, but it does not stay up, no matter what I've tried.  My tub walls are smooth but slightly porous so I thought it would stay up but it never, ever does.  I ended up returning it.	
- 1	I wanted to like this but it's going back. I already have a Foscam monitor for my older child but I wanted one that I could have a separate handset for my baby. This monitor does not work well for us. The night vision, while it allows you to see the baby just fine, tries to compensate constantly causing the monitor to flash every few seconds. This is very disturbing to a light sleeper. Additionally, if you use the VOX with the sound on, the monitor beeps every time it detects movement.Another note on the VOX is it is useless if you use a loudish fan like we do. We use the fan to help drown out noise in our baby's room but this fan sets off the sensor leaving the monitor on or beeping on every few seconds.My baby's room is next to mine and I still constantly get the &#34;out of range&#34; notification. If you use a cell phone near it, forget it.  I like the idea of the magnetic base but it does not seem to function as it's supposed to. Throughout the night, it would shift slightly and make it so that I couldn't see my baby at all. I would prefer if it had an attached base and even better, remote tilt/pan feature.Some positives: I actually do like the lullaby feature. However, I can use my iPod with the same effect.  I also appreciate the nightlight since my baby still wakes throughout the night and it's nice to be able to see without turning any lights on. Again, this can easily be achieved with a nightlight.Unfortunately, I am sending this monitor back and going back to my trusted Foscam.	
- 1	This pump is NOT efficient in multiple daily pumpings.  There are many things wrong with this pump and I hardly know where to begin.  First of all, the instructions are not user friendly.  Like other Avent products, the manual relies on pictures that can be difficult to interpret.  Once assembled, I found that the pump leaked as a result of the suction petals not attached completely and totally.  During the process of pumping, the valve that creates the suction would become loose and I would have to unscrew the bottle and press it back into place.  The pump squeaked sometimes and I couldn't quite figure out why.  The instructions recommended changing the position of the petals on the breast to get the most milk, however, during this process it would leak even more because the milk would collect between the plastic and the suction petals when the milk was supposed to be going into the bottle.  I also purchased the sterilizer which works great.  However, the instructions insist on sterilizing the pump after each use.  Frankly, there are just too many parts that have to be assembled and taken apart.  I didn't think there was a need to have sooo many parts.  Overall, this pump was very messy.  For a manual pump, it was more complicated than it really had to be.  And for all the reasons listed above, I find this pump to be overpriced and not worth buying.	
1. 	This sleep sack is thin. It's great when it's warm out but not so much when it's freezing. If you live in colder climates, I highly recommend the Gro sleep sack. They're thick and made of comforter-like materials. They're so soft and warm, plus they come in adorable patterns.	
1. 	I got this for my baby shower and I LOVE-Love-Love it.  I put it on my kitchen table after filling under sink, and drain it from the easy-drain spout right into the sink when I am done.  My baby Amelia has been in it since week 1 and she is 3 months and still loves it.  She fits perfectly in the newborn side, and I feel safe she won't slip down.  I can easily bathe her alone without problems.  Highly recommended, especially since the tub grows with you and your baby.	
- 1	After reading the negative reviews of this mobile (and seeing its flimsiness for myself at a local Babis R Us store), I went in search of other mobiles with a moon/stars motif.  I found several, but the cutest one by far is the one that matches the Lambs & Ivy Twinkle Twinkle bedding set.  It has a white moon and many blue and yellow stars...[...]Hopefully other people will be able to take advantage of this -- I'm not sure how long it will be offered at this price, but good luck!  I was so excited when I found it!	
- 1	I have been using Dr Browns ever since my son was born at the recommendation of his pediatrician.. Started off colicky and then Acid Reflux.. I ordered this set from Amazon recently as we needed extra bottles to juggle between home and daycare. THESE LEAK..and guess what - the bottle cover and cap do not fit snugly into the Dr Browns dishwasher basket I have from BRU... imitation bottles,,hmm thats a first!	
1. 	This is the best &#34;teether&#34;gets in the tough areas and he doesn't realize he is brushing his teeth.I have a million teethers and toothbrushes. This is the ONE to buy	
- 1	This sippy cup on paper looks great.  The straw is soft and won't harm the palate, its relatively easy to take apart, the straw mechanism works reasonably well to deliver liquid...  However, we did not get more than 2 months use out of it before we tossed both of them.Here are the cons:- this cup leaks.  The straw leaks and the top leaks.  Its not only that you have to thread it perfectly, it also has to be closed not too tight and not too loose.  Somewhere in the middle there might be a non-leaking tightness, but unless you have 5 minutes to adjust/re-adjust it multiple times its just not worth it.- the straw leaks.  If you have anything other than water, prepare for squirting out of the straw especially when you open and close the flip top- the cup will not hold up.  If your child is like mine and will occasionally drop things (not necessarily even throw, just drop), this cup will not wear and tear well.  Every drop on pavement will dent the hard plastic and create rough plastic burrs.  I'm not surprised how some reviewers had their cup itself crack on them	
1. 	My husband and I have an older car that does not have the latch system for car seats.  So any car seat we buy had to be strapped in using the belts.  When we first bought this seat car seat we thought it was a bit difficult to install, but not hard.  Now, after installing a different (supposedly comparable) car seat in my parents car, I think we have an incredibly easy car seat to install!  The directions for installation are clear and comprehensible.  the few times we moved the car seat to a rental or my parents car and utilized the latch system I couldn't believe how much easier it was than the latch system we bought for my parents car, thread through the bottom and snap in the latches... you're done!  I also researched safety  reviews and the Radian went beyond the requirements for safety - SOLD.  It is quite heavy, but since it folds up and tucks away into a duffle bag or duffle/backpack - it's easier to travel with.	
1. 	My son is mildly Autistic and suddenly developed a fear of the dark. Despite having 3 other fairly bright night lights in his room we couldn't get him to calm down about his room being dark. Eventually we turned the over head lights on, hoping it would help.. and it didn't. He has a bunk bed so with him being under the second bunk's shadow, it was still too dark.So we purchased this, and it has worked wonderfully. It lights up enough of the bottom side of the top bunk that it is no longer dark under there.Another major positive was that he took to it immediately, which is pretty amazing for him. Usually it takes him weeks to warm up to something new... but this was so comforting he loved it right away.	
- 1	Buyer beware!  This is a terrible pump.I bought (and used) it to occasionally relieve engorgement.  It broke after about 10 uses.  Hand expressing or electric pumps are much more effective.  I have the Medela Freestyle pump which is nearly as portable as the hand pump and much, much better.Problems:1.  Unusual flange shape is uncomfortable for nipples and pinches them2.  The handle only allows you to pump with high suction unless you have a very precise squeeze3.  Takes forever to pump any milk4.  Spills easily if tilted at all, wasting ounces of milk (when unscrewing the bottle, for example)5.  Breaks and loses suction after a few weeks of use	
- 1	Writing this review despite a total lack of time.  This tub is a total waste of money: have to bathe my three-month old daily because of eczema.  I use a gallon of water and one tea-spoon of hydrogen peroxide to desinfect her skin.  Tried the tub for this purpose today.  It only fit three quarts of water.  Ok, I thought.  When I very gently put my 12 pound baby in, of course some water came out through the overflow slots at the edges.  Well, when I gently took the baby out to see how much water was left -- there was no more than a cup of water.  If you would like to bathe your wee one in a cup of water, this may be the tub of choice then... Anything more than that will flow right out through the side slots.  A total waste of money and ridiculously overpiced.	
- 1	We bought this for our 20 month old baby and she likes using it, but the toothbrush is really made of cheap quality materials and the vibration switch doesn't always work. This product is just so poorly made and not ideal for infants because it just falls apart and can be hazardous.At the time of writing this is the first review, but make sure you read the review onSummer Infant Gentle Vibrations Massager And Toothbrushwhich is essentially the same thing. You can see there are lots of reviews mentioning pretty much the same defects.	
- 1	This mirror is just pointless.  It has no mechanism to aim the mirror whatsoever.  Strap it on to the headrest and hope for the best.  I did manage to wedge a plastic bottle behind mine in order to get an appropriate angle, but it's still not stable and it's literally trashy.  The way that the mirror works is to be so convex as to include such a wide angle of view that it almost HAS to show your baby (even though it didn't).  The end result is an image of your baby (our car seats are right up against the front seats, so the mirror is as close as possible to me) is so tiny as to not show you any real information.  The image of my 8lb infant's entire head would easily fit on the mirror surface 20 times, it's so small.  If you just want a mirror because you're neurotic and you just want to be able to relieve your conscience and technically see your baby, then this mirror, coupled with some ingenious use of trash, should do the trick eventually.  If you actually want to see useful information (e.g. is my baby turning blue), then you're better off elsewhere.	
1. 	We received a sleepsack as a gift at a baby shower and ended up ordering another one in a larger size once our son outgrew the newborn size.  We spent a lot of money before our baby was born on swaddling products and in the end, found that we preferred the sleep sack to all of the other products and wish we would have gotten more of these.  The sleepsack is great for our son because he likes to sleep with his arms free.  We can just put him in the sleep sack and not have to worry about tucking a blanket around him (which can often wake him up if we move him once he's already sleeping). We use this product almost every night and during the day for naps (so I would suggest getting a couple if you can!) The sleepsack is easy to put on/take off and the zipper allows for easy access for diaper changes. The fabric is particularly nice because it's not as hot as the fleece version of this product.This product is a total lifesaver...we highly recommend this product!	
1. 	We started using this feeder when my son was just 3 months old.  He loved the flavor of melon, but we were uncomfortable with letting him bite on a piece of melon for fear he might choke.  The baby feeder was the perfect answer.You can cut up just about anything and place it in the feeder bag.  We even put lightly frozen grapes in it when my son was teething.  We used it mostly for fruit, especially melon, grapes, pears, and strawberries.  I will admit that it can be messy to use this feeder, but it was totally worth it to us to give our son a chance to learn to love fresh fruits.  Enjoy!!!!	
1. 	If you are doing CLOTH diapers and wipes, this is the wipes warmer for you!!  It's great for disposables to pop-up in case you ever stop using cloth ones, so why wouldn't you want to cover both if you can?! I have used this for 9 months now and wouldn't use anything else.The best thing about it is that you can have a pool of water in it if you want to dip cloth wipes into a solution.  It won't leak water out like the munchkin one will once filled more than 1/4 inch. It's also easier to clean than the munchkin; it has a flat bottom as opposed to a groved bottom. I used to put a cloth wipe solution in and dip the wipes and ring them out. Now, I prefer folding two kinds of wipes, placing them separate piles in the warmer, then pouring solution over them.	
1. 	When my son was put in the NICU, he immediately stopped nursing.  I'm assuming it was due to the stress.  While I was at the hosptal, I used their Ameda Elite hospital pump, but at home, I was pumping full time with this pump.  It gets the job done quickly and the handle is very comfortable.The milk can leak out the sides, which can be very upsetting, especially if you're pumping for a hospitalized newborn and you need every drop you can get.  You just have to make sure to keep the pump perfectly upright.  Don't tilt it at all!I didn't have any problems with creaking, and if I did, I'd just take it apart and put it together and the problem was solved.I also know some had problems with the milk getting backed up and the silicone star not letting the milk flow to the container, but you just have to be sure to release the handle completely so the milk can flow out.  Another way to get it into the container is the break the suction between the pump and breast and pump the handle a few times.This pump worked great and I was able to come up with ways to avoid problems until I had used it (full time) for a month and a half.  The star would start getting sucked up into the top even if I slightly pumped the handle.  I emailed Avent and they emailed me back and had some great tips (great customer service, by the way!).  They said to boil the silicone parts for 10 minutes in water and 2 teaspoons of white vinegar... and viola! Problem solved.  If you use it as much as I did, the tackiness of the silicone wears and has to be fixed by the boiling.Lastly, I read some had problems getting everything to fit in the bag.  It takes talent, I tell you!  My advice is this: Remember how it was packaged in the first place!  Before you take it out of the bag, take note of how it's arranged.  After several attempts, I finally got it all back in.All in all, it's a great pump if you don't want to invest in an electric pump, or if you're only pumping occationally and you work around some of the little issues.  In those instances, I'd definitely recommend it!  I have an Ameda Purely Yours as well, and overall, I'd suggest paying the extra money and get an electric if you're working or having to pump full time, or you just want more convience.I hope this review helps, as I wanted it to be my best, considering all the experience I've had with so many pumps!	
- 1	These crib pads do help keep sheets dry but they wear out quickly.  They looked awful after the first time I washed them and have started falling apart after 6 months.  I wash them with natural baby detergent and hang to dry so I am surprised that they have worn out already.	
- 1	This mirror is just pointless.  It has no mechanism to aim the mirror whatsoever.  Strap it on to the headrest and hope for the best.

- 1	This car is cute and small. As another reviewer mentioned, it's about the size of a soft-ball. I was expecting that when I purchased it. However, I was expecting the pops to be more forceful-- you can hardly tell that the balls are popping-- they move just as much from the car moving. Also, the wind-up feature on the car I received appears to be defective-- it is stuck and doesn't roll forward. So, basically I ended up with an expensive rattle. Good idea, just wish it worked better!	
1. 	These are the only bibs I have found that keep my drool monster dry! Only once has it ever leaked through and that was after dumping a full sippy of water on himself. Considering how messy this kid is I would say they hold up well!	
1. 	Haven't had a chance to use these yet as our baby hasn't arrived, but I'll update once they're in use.The packaging was OK from Amazon, but the box was way bigger than the item... could be more efficient...	
1. 	This bib is AMAZING.When my baby started solids, a bunch of our regular cloth bibs were stained with carrots and peas, and broccoli, and mango. You get it.At first I didn't want to spend 12 bucks on one single bib... When you could buy a package of 10 cloth bibs for 5 dollars. But after ruining half of our bibs, I placed my order and God was I happy!It's wonderful, you can just wipe it or rinse it and you're done!The bottom pocket is awesome. It catches food and you can even use it as a bowl lol.We've been using this bib daily for over a year and I love it. We have the green one and color is still the same as when we first got it.My baby is now 17 months and still fits him great.	
- 1	My 7-month-old received this as a gift and we both love it. It's sturdy enough for her to pull herself up on easily and it's the perfect height for standing and playing. She's not too interested in rolling the balls yet but she loves all of the songs, lights, and buttons. We've had it for two weeks and so far the sounds haven't driven me totally crazy, probably because there's so many of them so it doesn't get too repetitive. The Circle, triangle, diamond, square - they all make a happy pair song does irritate me a bit every time I hear it since four items do not, in fact, make a pair, but other than that most of the songs are pretty tolerable.In any case, this toy is currently the only way I can get anything done while my daughter is awake, so it's a winner in my book. I'd imagine that as she gets older the educational aspects of it will be helpful too. It has pretty much all of your preschool bases covered: colors, shapes, the alphabet, etc. Heck, it even has them in Spanish. I can't recommend this table highly enough!UPDATE 1: I have to remove a star after an incident today. My daughter got the tip of her finger caught between the page of the book and the yellow light-up button as she was using that hand to steady herself while trying to sit down on the floor. Thankfully I was right there and got her unstuck quickly but she still really smushed her finger and was clearly in a lot of pain. I definitely wouldn't let a baby play with this unsupervised!UPDATE 2: After 2.5 months of use, the electronics have gone haywire. It started having occasional audio glitches about a month ago and it's gotten progressively worse until today the thing stopped working altogether. Now when I turn it on it just makes a buzzing sound and none of the buttons do anything. This is a real bummer, my daughter loves the sounds and lights and I thought she would get a lot more use out of it :(	
1. 	We tried using a regular blanket to keep our baby warm, but they were never the right size and constantly had to be adjusted. We put this on and it fits our car seat perfectly, was easy to install and is easy to remove, and keeps our baby warm in the very cold weather we live in.	
1. 	med were to big, this was the perect size, no air went through and pump worked perfectly with the small shields. no local baby store carried this size, not even babies r us	
1. 	I read the reviews on many drawer chests before purchasing this one for my 5 month old son's room. I was a little apprehensive before I received it because of some negative reviews, but I am pleasantly suprised. This chest is very nice for the price I paid. It was not that difficult to put together, just need a screwdriver and patience. It took about 3 hours to assemble. There aren't any scratches on the finish, it is also pretty sturdy. The drawers are on metal tracks which makes them open and close very smoothly. I can see us using this for at least several years to come. It came with an anti-tip over attatchment that is very important as my little guy learns to pull up on things and walk. All in all, I am very satisfied with this chest, it was worth the money and I would buy it again if I needed another.	
1. 	We are so glad that we bought this gate. We use it in the entrance to our son's room. It keeps him in and our 3 dogs out. Completly hands free is such a plus!!!!!! Simple to use!!! Fits very snug...it isn't going anywhere. The vertical only slats are great because our son tries to climb this gate and I truely believe that if we had bought a traditional gate with vertical and horizontal slats that he would be able to climb it!!! I recommended this to all our friends already!!!	
- 1	These liners are not a good option if you want to wash and dry them with regular laundry loads. We are a cloth diapering family and I currently use waterproof changing pad linersCarters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Ecruover my changing pad cover. The pads I currently use can be washed and dried right along with my cloth diapers and have held up wonderfully for over two years now.I thought these munchkin pads seemed like a great value so I picked up a batch to try. Unfortunately, they fell apart during the first washing/ drying. Turns out, they need to be hung to dry, but we live in humid south Florida and nothing really dries when hung or dried on low. I washed and dried these with a regular load of cloth diapers and the waterproof backing separated from the fabric making them very slippery and unusable. While I like the size and shape of the munchkin pads, I would not recommend them due to the fragile construction/components.Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!	
- 1	It was very cute when I received it in the mail. After the first wash it was totally deformed and didn't look the same. I don't recommend this item at all.	
- 1	I really regret of putting my daughter napping on this one. It works as a support, but it was made of cheap synthetic material and the color continue to fade after washes. After just spent 2 hours napping on this one, the back of my daughter's head turned red because of the color fading issue.	
1. 	When our daughter started eating finger foods, she tended to get messier than she does when we spoon-feed her.  Even with a regular bib, I found myself spending a substantial amount of time treating her clothes for stains.  These bibs are great - waterproof, wide coverage, and a pocket to catch dropped or dribbled bits.  It doesn't hurt that they are cute, too.  I also like the fact that they are machine-washable, but if the mess isn't too big, you can also just wipe them clean.  I am spending a lot less time/money on stain removal on her clothes!  We'll likely buy more, as we have another baby on the way!	
1. 	Used these throughout the bottle stage with our now 19-month old. Playtex bottles were the only ones we used and the drop in liners saved us time on dishes which to me was worth the extra expense.	
- 1	I expected something a little larger than this.  It seemed so small when I took it out of the package that I measured it.  It is NOT 14&#34; x 28&#34; as the package says (the description says 29&#34;, which is even more wrong).  It was barely 14&#34; x 27&#34; (you would have to pull it tight to get it to 27&#34;).  I had to work to get it to tie to the slats properly and I am guessing it should be tight, but it was not as easy as I expected for a standard crib.I understand the point of this--to save sheets because your little one spits up or wets the bed--but they aren't supposed to have pillows in the crib with them and this is pretty fluffy and almost like a thin pillow.  Mine sleep with a pillow as it is, so I'm not overly concerned about it, but mine are over 12 months now also.It doesn't cover much area, so if you are concerned about diaper leaks and you have a baby that is a mover, this one cover isn't going to work.  You would do much better to have a full mattress pad with a second sheet under it (a quick pull off in the night and you are set with a clean sheet).  My babies have been big movers since they were just a few months old, so I would have had a hard time figuring out where to put it when they were smaller (they are big enough now that their middles tend to be pretty close to the middle of the crib most of the time, but I still would need 2 of these to cover the whole possible area).Really, not worth the money as you are better off with an extra mattress pad and sheet (I got all my crib sheets for $2-$3 on clearance and the mattress pads were around $10).  If this small cover isn't in the &#34;leakage&#34; area, you are going to need to change the whole sheet anyway, so you might as well just be prepared.	
1. 	I have to clean mine about once a week with using it for both of my boys. I really love this chair and we take it with us everywhere. It doesn't fit tables that have a leaf stored underneath it, which has been inconvenient.	
1. 	Baby loves this and has used it every single day since birth till now (hes 8 months)	
- 1	This is cute to look at, but that's about all. It does not function at all in my car. At first I had my carseat behind the passenger seat, and I couldn't fit it around my back seat's headrest at all. I recently moved the carseat to the middle where it's safest. And the middle seat does not have a headrest and it is impossible to attach it to any part of the seat. My car is a 2010 so you would think this mirror would be compatable with newer cars...but it's not at all. I can't imagine this working in anyone's car, no matter what the year or model. Don't waste your money!	
- 1	I bought this willing to try anything to get my kid to sleep more than 2 hours at night, for one, its pretty warm (I live in a warm climate, so this almost seemed like it made him too hot), it takes forever to dry in the dryer. It wasn't magical at all and didn't help my kid sleep. Definitely not worth the 40+$ I spent. I lent it to my sister in law in hopes that it would work for my nephew, no such luck.	
- 1	Pros- NoneCons-It is really a very thin strap. I got green color and it is so YUCK!!!. it was that birght shiny green color. They are so thin that they slide down. I returned them the very next day.JUST DONT BUY IT.	
1. 	i just saw this product at Target for $12.00 more than what i paid here, this is a great tray and a wonderful product for anyone with a baby/toddler, buy it here cause in any store you will pay more.	
- 1	These bibs are cheap but you get what you paid for.  The velcro comes off easily and the loopy side is very rough and sharp.  My husband tried to take the bib off of our baby once and it slipped and gave him a bad gash on his neck!  Our baby drools and spits up a lot too and it goes right thru the bibs and onto his clothes.  It's not worth it.  We'll stick with the Carter's ones from now on since their velcros are very soft and it actually sticks.	
1. 	This is great for on the go!  And your tray is always clean!	
1. 	I like many things about this high chair/booster seat. This is very easy to clean which is one of the biggest advantages. It is a very inexpensive and functional seat which takes up little space. Also it adjusts in many ways which accommodates a growing baby. Very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	They are more than just wipes for us.  We use them as washcloths and handkerchiefs too.  They are super soft and have held up really well through almost 100 washes so far.	
1. 	This is an awesome tub. It's huge so Lo can stay in for a lot longer than most tubs. My daughter loves her bath time and her tub. The seat thing is great and does a good job at keeping her from slipping when I lay her back.	
1. 	After hearing about a 15 month old who fell into the toilet head first and could not pull himself out he died as a result. This occurred in the middle of the night. What a horrible accident. We have one installed in every bathroom and feel much more secure. This will help with toys being flushed as well! Great Idea a must have for every parent with a curious toddler.	
- 1	My 18 month old pulls the visor off the second i put it on. Also, if i can get him to keep it on it takes a few seconds to create a seal around the skin and it always takes too long - i end up dumping water on my son's head and it does go onto his face. I don't like it, wish i could get my money back but already threw away the packaging. Not a cheap item, either. Dissapointed :(	
- 1	i have to first say that this seat is very sturdy and safe which is obviously paramount when it comes to car seats.  however, this seat is a pain and almost every time i use it i mutter to myself something about how much i dislike it.  first i would say that the seat is heavy and cumbersome and i am sure that there are seats out there that are lighter and smaller.  next i would say that the carry handle does not move into a back position easily at all; i am constantly trying to click the round circles in in order to move the bar back to get my son into the seat.  lastly i would say that the pull strap to tighten the shoulder straps is pretty tough to pull.  again, this is a safe seat but i feel as though you can find a seat just as safe without all of these drawbacks.  it also doesn't help that the seat is so expensive and yet i get frustrated with it every time i use it.	
- 1	scissors were too big and bulky, was afraid to cut the baby accidentally. the blades became dull after some use. bought a different kind with shorter blades that i am very happy with . I cannot comment on the nail clippers because I do not use them on my baby. however, the nail files are useful because it makes the nails smoother which helps prevent baby from leaving scratch marks on her face.	
- 1	I bought these bottles cause they're waaaaay cute and baby and I had problems with latching. I wanted her to use bottles in which she had to open her mouth wide. It did help with her practicing getting her mouth wide open...but her bouts with gas had increased when we switched from the Dr. Brown's to the Comotomo bottles. My mom and my hubby  knew how cute I thought the bottles were and how excited I was about getting them but they felt so sorry for the crying gassy baby that they waited till (or conspired while (depending on who's telling the story!)) I was asleep (in pain from breastfeeding challenges) to bring back out the Dr. Brown's bottles that I had neatly put away. I woke up to a much happier baby...and family. Again, these bottles are waaaaaay cute, fun and modern and may even help with latching. But if your baby is having problems with gas stick to Dr. Brown's or whatever has proven to work for your baby. In fact I thought the Dr Brown's wasn't working because our baby still had gas pains. But the crying increased when we stopped using the Dr. Brown's! Maybe I'll try the Comotomo again when baby is much older and over her gas pains.Oh! one other thing! They're kinda hard to clean. The milk sticks to the material. The product videos recommend that you clean with a cloth and probably users should stick to this advice because using a bottle brush alone would not suffice.	
- 1	It was okay to install. However it did not work in comforting baby. Baby just cried a lot in it. Returned it. Bought baby a simple swing and baby was happy and eventually went to sleep.	
1. 	I own the Original full sized Arms Reach Co Sleeper, and this mattress pad works perfectly with it. I've never had a leak with this, works great. Its not like sleeping on a pillow, but it really isn't too firm either. I feel the baby is quite comfortable between this and the sheet.	
- 1	I found this overrated pillow actually rather useless. I am 5 ft 8 hence my torso was too long to comfortably nurse my little one (born at 9 lbs) as I had to slouch to breastfeed or somehow prop up the boppy with something else. Anyways, not useful for infants....maybe +6 month olds but definitely not infants.	
- 1	After my baby started teething hard, the spout was damaged and it spills the drink everywhere. It makes a hig mess.	
1. 	We like these so much we have two sets. One for the tub and one for the toy box/travel. My 10 month old likes the holes in the bottom when we play with these in the tub and she like to knock them down when you stack them on the floor. Lately she's figure out how to stack them inside of each other. Great, simple, inexpensive learning toy. :)	
- 1	Update: 05/09/2013 Finally tossed these out :( There was mold growth in the caps which are very difficult for me to clean because theyre so small. For the same reason, they're a choking hazard. After trying to twist the cap on and off, my toddler then put it in her mouth. Lastly, if a toddler sucks too hard on the mouth piece (mold growth / hard to clean there too btw) damage will occur on the gums because the material is too sharp.Update: so originally I gave 4 stars, but took it down to 3. I tossed a pouch in my diaper bag, went to the library and discovered a mess. I checked to make sure the pouches were closed. They were, but it still leaked. :( Very unhappy that these on the go items have to stay at home.--------I saw a posting on Pinterest abou the Little Green Pouches so I looked for a cheaper version. I found Yummi Pouches, Squooshi and EZ squeezees. Chose the latter because it was cheaper and for a test run at making food pouches at home.So far so good. I made a carrot, spinach and pear puree (made the carrot and spinach then froze before hand) using my Ninja blender that my daughter ate. Good because I recently transitioned my one year old to whole milk and she'd had constipation from drinking too much milk. The only bad I can see is cleaning - there are crevices that I have to make sure to rinse out carefully.I also noticed mention of how wide the pouches were. I was concerned about that too, until I realized it's a good design because if you fill the pouch to capacity and close it, then hand it to your child, their touch may cause the puree to squeeze out. To minimize the mess, your child will probably grab the pouch with both hands using the sides/handles, or you can fill the pouch with less puree.I like the pouches and I'm going to use the for awhile. I also want to try the others because the caps on the others are larger and more visible.	
1. 	My 10 months old baby has now been using this one every night for the past 2 months, and probably still will for a while :)Very practical, it still allows her to roll over and sit easily in her crib. We live in Florida so even though we have the A/C we just needed a light blanket and we loved the HALO swaddle bags but needed something bigger.We bought a cute one at IKEA that did not last long (the zipper broke), very disappointing, so got back with HALO. Do not regret it at all. Cotton is very soft of great quality even after weekly wash/dry. Zipper is still fully functioning. Like new after 2+ months!	
1. 	We use this every day. I love that it covers her entire lap! Might even buy another one. Easy to clean, too.	
1. 	My baby slept in our bed for about 4 months and this was perfect. We would also use it on the couch sometimes to keep her secure for a nap during the day. She was on the small side, so we had no problems with her fitting it. it. It worked great when she had a cold, as we were easily able to elevate her head. We would have used this for travel, if he had traveled while she was using it. We passed it on to a friend when she outgrew it. Highly recommend this product for anyone considering cosleeping. I am glad we did.	
- 1	Completely inconsistent temp readings. 103 mysteriously becomes 96 in a separate reading just seconds later. It's a nice idea to read from scanning the forehead, just poorly executed by The First Years.	
- 1	The marshmallow like clay is not easy to work with.Not sure how others have done it, I had such a hard time getting an impression of the hand, or a foot.	
1. 	I actually borrowed this pump from a friend after debating whether or not I needed one.  I was going to buy an inexpensive manual.  I would not have survived!  I woke up very very engorged on the fourth day and the pump saved me.  I was able to pump 8 ounces within 15 minutes.  If I have another baby, I would buy this pump.  It is worth every penny.A previous reviewer commented that you cannot buy replacement parts.  The Medela website sells all parts and the prices and shipping are reasonable.  Their customer service is excellent as well.  As a thank you for the person I borrowed from, I got all new pieces for her when I returned the pump (and she was again pregnant) for about $35.	
- 1	First of all, these are a great concept!  To have something to keep sippy cups and toys from falling to the floor in a restaurant or outside is great, but this one is not a good choice.  There are better ones!  I have only used this strap a hand full of times.  On the first attempt, the button was so difficult to punch through the hole that it took more time than it was worth.  Then there was the removal...which took even longer.  I do like that the strap has a removable piece, where you can attach it to let's say a high chair and remove it with one touch of a clasp.  After using this product for approximately the fift time, I went to put the button through the hole, and it came off.  I tried to re-attach it, but it required glue...too much trouble, so it got tossed.  This is a good product in theory, but too much to it.  There are simpler products similar out there.	
- 1	This bag has broken twice by splitting at the seams. It is poorly constructed for the price you pay and the fact that you are trying to protect such an expensive stroller while traveling.	
- 1	I purchased these at Baby's R Us because of the good reviews, but I have not had any luck with them.  They didn't pull the nipple out far enough to make any difference, and the pressure on the nipple made me leak constantly.  I would soak through a cloth pad in a couple of hours.  They are suppose to have a reservoir to catch the milk, but your nipple must protrude a certain distance in order for the shell to work.  My nipples were too flat, so I just ended up with wet, smelly breasts.They are also very large and extremely noticeable - there is no way I would wear them in public.I also think a previous reviewer got the medela shell types mixed up.  This shell does not have a foam insert, and is hard plastic.	
- 1	I'm not quite sure how these people labelled an AQUA/ LIGHT TURQUOISE pad cover as navy blue, lol. They're two totally different colors. I needed the navy blue to match the nursery theme. The photo is inaccurate as well. I returned it for a full refund since it was their error. I really hope they fix this! Otherwise, it was very soft to the touch and seems quite durable. :)	
1. 	If you need to pump in the car for any reason:Working full-time, during lunch.Long trips (vacation) during the summer.Privacy.Asking someone to drive, while you pump in the back (cord long enough).:)	
1. 	This set  of Playtes Drop-Ins included()4-ounce bottle complete with nipples, bands and covers  and 5 liners. Great addition to the bottle fed baby.  We used 8 4 ounce formy grandson who had to have special formula.  Great  No mess, no brushes , no boiling, bottles and no stinky bottles, and you get a new sanitary liner every bottle. We love the drop ins since it makes making bottles easier.My set was girl sthemed. pink ring with butterflies and stars, and yellow duckies, so so cute.	
1. 	I bought this original bundle me in Graphite and I love it. It really matches the Stroller. It is so warm and soft that our son is comfortable. It is alot better than lots of blankets that your child eventually will kick it off.	
- 1	We purchased this item for our newborn. It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted a little over 1 month. I rarely write bad reviews, but I thought this product warranted it because of how short these monitors lasted! I'll start with the pros.PROS:1. These monitors have exceptional range. I have the base unit on the third floor and was able to get reception in the cellar as well as across the street in our garage. A++ for range.2. The number of channels to choose from limited the amount of interference static. However no matter what channel we were on our cell phones managed to give annoying static and we were alerted by our baby monitor any time of text message was being sent or when one was coming in.3. There's two of them so you can switch out. The fact that there were two made this product last longer because when the first one no longer had reception we switched to the other on.4. The base unit and the monitors plug in. HOWEVER as another viewer mentioned, plugging your monitor in for more than 12 hours will fry the monitor. So if you forget to unplug your receiver, you've ruined the monitor.CONS:1. It was hard to avoid bursts when the unit was around our cell phones and by around I mean in the adjacent room.2. The pro of having the monitors have an A/C adapter become a con when you can't just leave the units plugged in. And not only can't you leave them plugged in, you destroy the product if you do. Why have an A/C adapter in the first place?!3. The monitors stopped getting reception after only one month of use! And if I'm being accurate each monitor only lasted a few weeks. We just moved on to the second one after the first one died. So while as a whole we were able to use the unit for a little over a month if both monitors had been in use at the same time we wouldn't have had that much time.In my book no matter how great the pros were/are, if the product only works for 1-2 months then the product is worthless. I love fisher-price but these monitors barely deserve one star.	
1. 	My Anna Banana loves to shop with Anna Banana.  I can stick her on the cart and it's a great distraction as I get the things on my list.  She also likes playing peek-a-boo with the peels.	
1. 	These are great for nursing mothers.  I've given these as a baby shower gift along with an Avert breast pump before.  They were received well and I've been told they're comfortable and very convenient.	
1. 	I have flat nipples and absolutely could not get my baby to latch on. I was depressed and worried that I would not be able to breastfeed. The hospital gave me a nipple shield to use and it was great because a few days after my baby was born he was exclusively breastfeeding. In the beginning it was uncomfortable but I think that was because I had to get used to feeding, not because of the shields. My baby is now 3.5 weeks old. I have weaned him off the shield on one breast though he is still using it on the other one (I think I'll be able to wean him off that too in the next couple of days) so I will be able to breastfeed totally without it. Of course breastfeeding without the shield is much better and I see no reason to use it if you can get your baby to latch on, but if you have flat nipples and you want to breastfeed it is a total life-saver.	
- 1	I received this set of 3 bottles in the cute colors as described, however on the bottle it said 2002 Playtex inc. Hence I googled to find out if these are BPA free. From the Internet I was able to obtain limited information. Playtex started making BPA FREE baby products in Dec 2008. Hence I called Playtex customer service to find out about these bottles. Their customer service was wonderful. I got an agent on the phone without any wait line. She got the number from these bottles and told me that they contain BPA and to not use them. THanks to Amazon's customer service I am able to return the item back free of charge.	
1. 	I like these bibs; they catch bit of food my daughter dropps before it gets stuck between her and her high-chair.  They wash really well in the washing machine without damage or wear - this was key for me.  (Be sure to stick the velcro pieces together before washing so it doesn't attach to other laundry in the wash.)	
1. 	This is a great changing pad.  The contours on the side keep the baby from being able to roll around, making for easiest clean-up if the baby has a messy diaper.  It is extra long (34 inches), allowing for baby to have extra head and feet room as he/she grows.  If you buy this product, be sure to buy covers that have adequate length to accomodate this changing pad, though.  I use the ultra plush ones, and they fit well.	
- 1	First, we read the directions and we follwed them.  But this never seemed to work the same way twice.  Sometimes at 4 min. the formula was too hot and sometimes at 6 min. it wasn't hot enough.  There was no rhyme or reason to it, we had it set the same way every time.  We used it for a month and then threw in the towel.	
- 1	The formula doesn't stay in its compartments. I started out with four compartments of formula and ended up with two nearly empty compartments and two nearly full compartments. I no longer had properly measured out formula and it was a disaster. I tossed it that day.	
1. 	These are way better than those bulky plugs my son tried to take these out but he couldn't. I totally approve of these.	
- 1	We received this watch and it was a great reminder for my child-actually helped her a lot, but it is cheaply made and only worked for about a week then it died! After wrestling with it to get the back off, I couldn't remove the batteries to try and replace them-I am returning it and hoping the replacement they are sending works longer than one week! Great idea-cheaply made!	
1. 	This headrest is perfect.  Since day one my daughter has been comfy using this.  When she was teeny tiny the insert kept her head from flopping forward.  Now that she is bigger we use it without the insert and she's still happy.  At 4 months she has wonderful head control, but I wouldn't put her in her carseat without this.  I tried the head rest that came with her Graco car seat and it was terrible.  It sort of lets her head roll all over when we carry her from the house to the car.  For a small baby I wouldn't even think about using the flimsy headrest they give you with the seat.	
1. 	It took me 3 tries to finally find a great bottle brush. The bristles are a bit stiff but I don't mind the spraying of soapy water so much as long the brush cleans the bottles well! Made of durable plastic so hopefully, I'll still be very satisfied after putting this to good use!!	
- 1	Got this for our first child (read: bought into the idea of buying the whole BabyBjorn potty training line to match).  It's only 6 inches tall so it's your basic step stool.  Obviously the product description already says that so that wasn't a suprise.  However, my son is 20 months, 95 percentile for height.  When the faucet in the bathroom is on full-blast, this stool only allows him to get the tips of his fingers wet so I still have to pick him up to wash his hands.  This doesn't allow him to get on the adult toilet by himself nor can his feet touch when he's sitting on the adult toilet (which: (a) is bad for assisting him w/ #2 since it's better for him to plant his feet and brace himself rather than dangling his legs; and (b) this requires me to hold him still while he's sitting on the potty so he doesn't fall backwards or forwards).If you want a basic step stool there are cheaper ones out there that are just as good.If you have a young child, this isn't the best option.  Try a 2-step stool, such as the rubbermaid version, instead.  For kids 4 and over this is probably fine, my nephew is close to 4 and this would probably work for him.	
- 1	It's not as gorgeous as everyone made it out to be in my opinion.  It's very basic it's thin so don't be fooled it's not thick and it's small.  I sent it back the same day it arrived.  I think I'd rather spend the money on a NookSleep blanket or a Pottery Barn quilt	
- 1	I bought these bibs at a retailer.  I thought that they would work well, but they are terrible.  First, the plastic is stiff and does not drape over my baby at all, which means that it slides around all the time and food gets in under and around it.  Second, as others have said it is quite hard to clean, especially around the piping.  Third, the pocket is pretty much flush with the bib and therefore doesn't catch much.  Fourth, the bib is relatively short, which wouldn't be a problem if the pocket worked better.  Fifth, although waterproof plastic may seem like a good idea, in fact liquids just rolled straight down the bib and onto baby's lap.  For someone looking for a bib I would recommend a soft cloth bib with waterproof plasticized backing in a large size or a bib with sleeves.	
1. 	After reading some of the 800+ reviews, almost entirely in favor of this seat, we bought it for our then 3-month old, knowing it might be a little while before he could really sit up in it well.  To our surprise, he did great!  At first, he could sit in it for a few minutes before he'd start to list to one side.  Now, he's almost 6 months old and he's eating solid foods a few times a week.  This chair is PERFECT.  He can sit in it just fine.  You can use the tray or slide the baby up to the table, which is what we usually do.  The tray does fit great into the dishwasher.  The chair is super easy to clean and it'll be nice later on to have a portable high chair for him.  I'm so glad we didn't spend a ton of money on a chair that wouldn't do anything more than what this one does so well...support your child in a safe place while they learn to eat.	
- 1	I got my ergo when my daughter was over a year so I didn't know how to use it with my newborn son. I got this and can't say it did any good. I could never get a natural, comfortable hold. I used my moby for the newborn days.	
1. 	It's bit pricey but I love it. I can do light scrapbooking while adding family history and little antedotes about me and my husband for our son. I recommend this photobook.	
1. 	I have loved this changing table. I got little baskets to put in the cubbies and it has been great. We've been using it for almost eight months as a storage for diapers, wipes, lotion, oils, butt paste, etc. It's doing a great job.	
- 1	Interior foam compressed significantly to one side after two months of a newborn sleeping on it causing the baby to move to that side.  Once material compressed it was worthless and we replaced with a natural latex mattress.	
1. 	The Warm Fuzzy seems to do two very important things for my 16-month old daughter: 1) It makes the BOB more comfortable for her. She fits better in the stroller and lasts much longer in it now that we have the Warm Fuzzy; and 2) It also seems to keep her warmer. The canvas material of the BOB can get quite cold during the early mornings and this does a fine job of blocking out the cold.My only complaint is that it's so expensive. The BOB is already a high-ticket item and this warm fuzzy, at least in our experience, seems to be essential.	
- 1	Personally, this didn't help in my case. I purchased these to reduce cleaning throughout the day, pumping on top of caring for newborn and 4 year old and running household. My nipples are small and what I really needed was the 25 mm that came with the pump but I can't find them anywhere.	
1. 	I picked this up at a local baby store for less than the price listed here today, but this is a good product that does the job of keeping up to three bottles' worth of formula separate. I'm pretty fond of all Avent products and this doesn't disappoint. When you pour one section of formula out into the bottle you sometimes get a tiny bit of powder from another compartment, but largely I have not had trouble. Now that our baby is a bit bigger it's also good as a snack carrier (Cheerios and the like) -- it's great to stretch out the usefulness of a baby product!	
- 1	I don't have a super unusual crib. It's one of the Babylettos, but plenty of other cribs I have seen will have the same problem that mine did. The problem is that they made it only to fit cribs that the top part (where you would connect the mobile) is only 4 inches tall (wooden piece) or less. (The part where the crib slats meet the top). Ours is around 6 inches and I honestly can't say that we saw any mid-range crib that was different.If you try to put it on with it not fitting properly, it is not very secure. My guess is that it would be a very short period until the whole thing falls on your baby's head. And no, that's not being overly dramatic - it fits that poorly on the crib types I have mentioned. It's hard to describe, but it doesn't screw properly since it has to be at an unintended angle. In addition, as other users have mentioned, the way the hard plastic cards interlock with each other and onto the mobile is done poorly. I can see the plastic cracking and leaving small hard plastic bits in your crib unexpectedly.We received this as a gift after placing it on our baby registry. After having twins, it's not worth the hassle of the return. I will say that the patterns on the cards are interesting, so to make it not a complete waste, I will be using them as flash-cards. The babies (very young) seemed interested, so at least there is that.Overall I would highly recommend AGAINST this product if you have the crib type I mentioned or if you feel you will be changing out the cards frequently. If you just installed them once and left them alone, then it would probably be ok (with the right crib). It's just disappointing to have so many design flaws on a product that I really wanted to like. Had it fit my crib, I still would have been disappointed in the plastic cards, but would have rated a 3 star.P.S. There is no sound/music that goes with this mobile. Not a big deal, but I didn't realize that when I put it on my registry - which makes it seem even a cheaper quality.	
1. 	I have tried several different kinds of bottles and this is by far my favorite. My son will use these as well as the Ventair Natural bottles, but these seem to give him less air therefore less spit-up. They're the easiest to put together as well. Cleaning them is easier then any other bottle. You can re-use the bottle itself and get a new, clean nipple for each feeding rather then having to get a new bottle and nipple since it takes liners. It may be a bit more expensive in the long run with having to buy liners, but it is far more convenient.	
1. 	Love the royal blue color.  Maybe it shrank a little?  I'm not sure, but it's a great fit on our baby's mattress.	
1. 	We love these bags!  We didn't buy a diaper pail, but instead stuff as many diapers as we can in to each of these bags and then tie closed.  It keeps our son's nursery smell free!  He is 8 months old now and we can fit 4-5 diapers into the bag.	
1. 	This cover fits perfectly on Costco shopping carts, covering all surfaces, as well as all supermarket carts. I keep getting stopped by people asking me about it because my baby looks so comfy - it's like a mini sofa! It has tons of features:* Very padded and comfortable, especially for long grocery runs. My baby can nap in it, supported by the pillow, while still buckled in.* Has a wide removable pillow 18 x 6 x 4 that you can insert behind baby to prop them up if they can't sit up well. It's attached by a tether so it stays in the cart.* Secures to the cart with just one hand - you just unzip, plop it into the cart, flip one part over and under the handle, flip the other part over the back, turn the fitted edges over onto the sides of the cart, and attach it with a buckled strap.* Buckled waist belt for baby* Can also be used as a diaper pad. I don't use it for this purpose because the fabric is too nice!* Doubles as a backup diaper bag. Has a large 19x 11 zippered pocket to put diapers, formula packets, ointment, etc.* Has two smaller 9 1/2 x 4 zippered compartments, for coupons, makeup, wallet, etc.* Two elastic loops to hold formula bottles.* Folded into itself, it zips up all contents neatly to the size of a small duffel bag, (24 x 9 in diameter).* Machine washable cold, machine dry warm. With the exterior's heavy black canvas and all the padding, it doesn't look like something I'd like to wash too frequently. Will have to see how easy this is.* Also comes in pink, at BRU.I've tried the Clean Shopper (almost no padding, smaller, a simple strap goes through the back to secure the baby to the cart) and the Safe N' Easy (cheap quality, looks like a big rain coat/ shower cap, difficult to get baby into, doesn't stay on). They can't compare to this one.	
1. 	We got this as a shower gift, along with several other play gyms.  After looking closely at all of them, we decided to keep this one and returned the others.  I'm glad we did.  This one is perfect.  We already use it for tummy time.  The mat is soft and when he spits up, it wipes off easily.  I like the mix of soft and plastic toys attached and the fact that they all come off easily since my little guy cant reach them yet.  After tummy time we roll him over and he loves to stare at the lights and butterflies.	
- 1	I was pretty excited when I ordered this diaper can, it seemed like a good concept, and I didn't want to do a diaper genie. It is a good idea, unfortunately it doesn't play out as well in reality. The plastic has absorbed the odors of dirty and wet diapers, so now, even when it is empty it smells....bad. It left my daughter's room with a dirty diaper smell. In order to attempt to solve this issue without getting rid of it I have scrubbed the empty can down with bleach and odor eliminator, have sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the new bag and have bought Arm and Hammer diaper trash bags to tie each individual dirty dirty diaper in before throwing away in the Dekor. Hopefully this will help with the stink.	
- 1	My daughter hated having her teeth brushed.  I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon.  I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger.  The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all.  Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway.  It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket.  Also, do know you can't pick color.  We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice.	
- 1	The mattress shrunk! I read reviews about some mattresses being too small,  but I ignored them. I figured if it was the wrong size, I could just send it back.  I purchased it in October 2011 & it fit perfectly in the crib. So I thought great, the mattress I received is fine.  The baby started sleeping in the crib in December. By February 2011, the mattress has gotten smaller lengthwise by about 2 inches --especially at the corners. It seems as if the mattress pad & sheets have permanently compressed the foam. Amazon customer service is willing to exchange the mattress or offer a refund if i return it, BUT its going to be way too much of a hassle to find a box that fits it & then lug it to the post office. Boo :(	
- 1	This seat looks good but it is the hardest  seat to get inside of a car!! It's so hard to tighten it down and it becomes loose easily. It takes 2 people to tighten it down and get it out. You'll be sweating by the time your finished. The instructions are terrible and I never knew if I have the seat in properly or not. Some of us only have one seat and have to change it from car to car. I hate this seat. The buckles are hard to click together. They were recalled and new ones do work better. The harness runs my sons neck to where it's blood red. He refuses to left me add any new pads that I bought to go on them. It's just a headache to go any place!! My husband hates it as much as I do. We are going to invest in another brand.	
- 1	I received this as a baby shower gift which was on my registry. I did read all the reviews here and all the negatives were that it didn't fit the crib. Well it fit my crib fine, but the craftsmanship on this mobile is not really up to par. The bird up top is just a cloth covering. I thought it was an actual plush. The birdie perched on the branch is lopsided. The branch itself is lopsided. And the kicker? The mobile plays a different melody than Brahms which is stated on the box itself. The mobile I have plays something that sounds like twinkle twinkle little star, and I actually had to google Brahms lullaby to make sure I was going crazy and hearing the wrong melody.I wanted to return it but was told that since I opened it and assembled it, I won't be able to so I'm stuck with it.	
- 1	We have been using this play yard to keep our toddler off of the stairs. It worked fairly well before she became extremely mobile but it has grown less and less effective over the months we've had it. The panels are so light that they are easily lifted by a little one (my daughter is a small 15 month-old) so we have had to bungee cord the panels to the stair railings on either side so that she doesn't just move the gate out of her way. Even with the bungee cords, she has now figured out how to move the panels just enough to squeeze by and get up the stairs. My husband and I have always strongly disliked the gate on this play yard but now hate it after months of use. The gate requires you to lift up and out in order to open it but the entire panel is so light that instead of releasing, the entire gate panel simply lifts off of the ground and doesn't open. We have found that you have to step on the corner of the panel to hold it down while lifting up and out on the gate. It's ridiculous and a constant source of frustration. I don't know if there is anything better out there but we certainly wouldn't purchase this again.	
1. 	These are perfect for east coast winters. We love them! My only complaint is that sometimes my son (now 7 months) can pull apart the zipper.	
1. 	I breastfed and formula fed my baby for the first 5 weeks. My baby did not fuss at all when I offered her these type of nipples (compared to the breast).  I also tried the Dr. Brown's, Gerber and Evenflo and she did not like them at all.  I think because the base of the nipple was not as big as the Playtex nipples.  Anyhow, it is very convenient for at home use.  It is not convenient when you are out and about.  You still need to have some type of regular bottle.  I found that out the hard way.  Something in my diaper bag punctured the plastic liner and the formula got all over my brand new diaper bag.  I suggest the Playtex ventair system for a regular bottle because it has the same basic nipple shape. Overall I think Playtex has the best bottles and nipples.	
- 1	it was comfy for my son-- but it's bulky and impossible to dry after baths.  so the mold came -- despite my efforts to squeeze and hang it -- in just over a week.  4 or 5 baths and mold was growing inside and out.  disgusting and dangerous!!!	
1. 	This holds up well! Ours has been used every day for the past 6 months and it is in great shape! Fits the ottles and nipples perfectly!	
1. 	We use this with the KidCo G15 White Center Gateway with Walk Through Pressure Gate for the bottom of our steps. Our staircase looks just like the one they have advertised in the picture and it works perfectly for us. I was so happy to have found these two products!I would have given it 1 more star if it was not quite so expensive but highly reccomended to anyone in a similar situation.	
1. 	I was a little skeptical before ordering these cuz I thought they might fade with one or two washes. But it has been 6 months now that I own these and they look still the same. They hold up great in the washer/dryer and make meal times less messy for me. Thanks amazon for the great price!!	
- 1	I thought this would be a great way to get my bottles clean but you still have to scrub them clean first yourself, THEN prepare this thing to stick in the microwave for x-amt of time, THEN wait for it to cool.... too much to do prior to getting a bottle ready for a fussy baby!&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;If your baby has an immune promblem, then this may be great for you, otherwise, skip on this and just buy a nice bottle brush.... I like the one by Munchkin.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;BUT if you still decide to get this, check it in the store first, because when I got mine home it was USED- it had obvisiously been returned (someone else thought it was useless too I guess) with milk residue on the bottles- yuck!	
1. 	I like that they're clear so as to not draw much attention to themselves.  You also get a bunch for a good price compared to the other options out there.  I've found that the level of difficulty in removing these plugs really depends on the actual outlets.  We've used them in two homes and it was easier to remove them from older outlets--probably because those outlets were more worn out.	
- 1	CON: First, for the expensive price this item should be PHENOMENAL, which, it is not. The lid is not a seal (NOTHING like a standard Tupperware seal) so the food can easily develop ice/be exposed to air, etc. Also, you have to let the tray to sit out for about a minute or two to slightly warm in order to remove the food, which I still have to do by forcefully pushing the handle of a metal spoon into the side. Doing this probably isn't good for food preservation and sometimes hurts my hand.PRO: I do like the small portion size which allows for easy portion control for each meal. I'm not sure there is anything else out there comparable to that convenience.	
1. 	Putting this on is a fun part of our bedtime routine. It is cute, warm, and I feel secure knowing my toddler won't trip. Also, I love that it keeps him warm, without me worrying about him kicking the blanket off. I also have a summer version in a ligher material.	
- 1	First off, the 'key' you need isn't included in the package with the lock and it never said that (grrrr). Secondly, they don't work.  A good yank on the doors and my 15-month old granddaughter had them both open.	
- 1	I thought the fabric on this felt cheap and the black &#34;leather&#34; parts were very obvious that they were plastic (and cheap thin plastic at that).  All in all, I was very disappointed with this product and returned it.	
- 1	I'm not sure if this item works or not. It fell off the first time my baby wore it. It was around his ankle and he was in a forward facing carrier with dangling legs. Not a lot of activity in that position so not sure how it came off. I know how to work a snap.	
1. 	Was going to NYC for a weekend, with two kids and really needed a bunch of toilet toppers for the less than pristine toilets of the city.  These did the job, at at a fairly reasonable price.  They have enough cover, and are waterproof which is a must.	
1. 	I read the reviews on many drawer chests before purchasing this one for my 5 month old son's room. I was a little apprehensive before I received it because of some negative reviews, but I am pleasantly suprised. This chest is very nice for the price I paid. It was not that difficult to put together, just need a screwdriver and patience. It took about 3 hours to assemble. There aren't any scratches on the finish, it is also pretty sturdy. The drawers are on metal tracks which makes them open and close very smoothly. I can see us using this for at least several years to come. It came with an anti-tip over attatchment that is very important as my little guy learns to pull up on things and walk. All in all, I am very satisfied with this chest, it was worth the money and I would buy it again if I needed another.	
- 1	Terrible!! These replacement lids are terrible. In fact, this is a terrible product all together. The cups leak really badly.	
- 1	For the price, at about twenty bucks, it isn't horrible. But it isn't as convenient as I thought...I bought aThe First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Rev and Go Sounds Potty Seat(which is cute, but no longer makes any noise and had the battery explode and leak battery acid onto the seat) to use in our upstairs bathroom and I figured this seat would snap off and be the seat for our second toilet once the little potty was outgrown...but you have to take off the entire top half - lid and green handles and all to place on top of your toilet seat. The thing is HUGE and not easy to store in the bathroom when not sitting on the potty. The step-stool feature is equally annoying because it is shaped, well, like a potty, not like a stool and is too short to get my son onto the toilet or assist with hand-washing.Basically, if you are not sure whether you child will prefer a little potty or the adult one and you need to break him/her into the idea, this isn't awful. I honestly wouldn't recommend it. It might be ok if you got it on super sale and it was for a grandparent's house where it would be lightly used, otherwise, keep browsing and find something else!	
- 1	I love Skip Hop Zoo buddies. I got the lunch pail for my little boy, as well. The bib though, while it is super cute, is such an aweful material for a bib. It got stained and ruined the first use; and for the price of this bib, it is not worth the buy!	
1. 	Its nice knowing she won't kick off her covers... or when the time comes that it will help keep her from climbing out of her crib. Excellent quality.  And I love that the zippers zip backwards to make middle of the night diaper changes easy.	
- 1	Shipped through low cost carrier LASERSHIP which is notorious for losing packages.....like this one. Never received product.	
1. 	These bibs are the best I've tried so far (out of about 6 different brands). I have purchased at least 3 sets of 10, in both the boy and girl colors.Pros:-beautiful, color-fast colors-big variety of colors in one 10-pack. I can always find a bib to match whatever outfit he is wearing.-absent of cutesy distracting baby designs and obnoxious patterns. My 16-month old has been wearing bibs all day every day for a year, and I very quickly got tired of seeing bibs with MONKEY BOY or POWER DROOLER all over them. They are a part of his wardrobe, and I want them to be as inconspicuous as possible.-soft-absorbent-truly water resistant: there is a waterproof layer sandwiched between the two layers of terry cloth-strong velcro-both the fabric AND the velcro stay perfectly flat after repeated washings, rather than buckling or curling from the dryer like many others I have gone through-the strong velcro STAYS strong after repeated washings, not getting weaker or with repeated use or exposure to the dryer (also like many others I have gone through)-perfect size...not too big, not too small-really decent price for a pack of 10 in my opinionConsiderations:-You must make sure that the velcro is closed (scratchy velcro half fastened to the soft half of the velcro) when you wash them with other delicate fabrics, like a satin-feel baby blanket, or the very strong velcro will catch those delicate materials. To me, this is a common-sense laundering issue, not a product flaw, hence my rating of 5 stars. You also have to make sure the velcro is fastened well (that the two pieces match up, no overlapping, etc.) when you put it on your baby. Since the velcro is very strong (and scratchy when opened), it can irritate sensitive baby skin. Again, a common sense issue, since all you have to do is make sure the two velcro halves match up when you fasten the bib, then no scratchy parts are exposed to skin. Again, common sense and in my opinion not a product flaw.Edit on 3/27/2013:  I am now using the very same bibs on my 18 month old daughter.  So these bibs have been in constant use since November of 2009, well over 3 years, and still look great...colors are still bright, terrycloth hasn't pilled, waterproof layer between the terry layers is still fully intact, and they come out of the dryer essentially flat (not curled from the low heat).  Velcro still super sticky.  I haven't had to throw a SINGLE ONE out...really amazing.  I'm pleasantly shocked at how well they've held up!	
1. 	My son would just pull these off the table.  I did better with the plastic ones that stick.	
- 1	These are good but too small to use for a long period of time. Also it's very difficult to get stains out of them.	
1. 	This pump is great for when you need to pump at work or travel.... but if you are breastfeeding I HIGHLY suggest investing in an electric double breast pump. SO WORTH it! It is hard to constantly use your hand to pump, the electric pumps get it all out quickly and easily.	
1. 	My cousin recommended the Baby Bjorn carrier to me, which she used for both of her boys.  She warned me that they aren't cheap but well worth it.  I followed her advice and WE LOVE IT!  I especially love to wear it while shopping and walking around the neighborhood.  When my daughter was 0-4 months, she faced toward me (as required) and always slept comfortably in the carrier.  Now (at 6 months) if she is tired I face her towards me, and when she's awake, she loves facing out and looking at everything.  I don't have a single complaint about this item.  My husband is 6'3, 220 lbs and he can and does wear it comfortably.  I purchased the fleece cover (through RightStart) and that's wonderful too.  You know the saying, you get what you pay for, so pay the extra money and get an excellent carrier.  It's absolutely worth it!	
1. 	This item is great for on-the-go feeding. Plus I figure when he's done with formula, we can use it for cereal or another small travel snack. Very pleased with this purchase, especially because we got lucky on the colors and got the green and blue shown for our little boy!	
- 1	They are trying to make it so you can use your newborn in it. Well, floppy newborns need more support than this. My son wasn't happy in there. And still, I was afraid of his head flopping around when I did put him in there. Now he is older and doesn't flop, but he doesn't need this. So it was a waste of money for me.	
- 1	I like that this garment is flame resistant, that it is spacious and sleeveless, but that's about it.  The fabric has an unpleasant feel and the zipper began to break after only one use.  It continually splits from the wrong end, so every time the baby wakes up, she's come out of it.  I regret this purchase.

- 1	I really wished they made these in a larger size. This size would be great for a newborn, but that's it.	
- 1	Looked like it was defective or had been exposed to something hot - the colors were &#34;melty&#34; looking. Too much hassle to return it.	
1. 	Good price for such a convenience!  Driving down the road with your breast pump attached is one of the biggest joys in life!  :/Thanks for making it possible!No problems with this product.  Works perfectly!	
- 1	My 5 month old is still swaddled, and oddly enough, she seems too small for it (we even own a size small). The sides that are to be wrapped around the belly/arms are too long, so the velcro barely even works. The left side (that wraps around first) pretty much tucks all the way underneath her back, and the right side (that wraps around second) wraps all the way around to her back, only leaving maybe an inch of velcro contact. Needless to say, it isn't secure enough to keep my little one from working her way out of the swaddle. She also gets her hands up and out of the bottom of the swaddle wrap, causing it to bunch up around her face, neck, which she then ends up chewing on and waking herself up.I bought mine from Target, on clearance in June/July 2011. Maybe that is why? It is a small, cotton, pink swaddle. She is 25 inches long and she fits ok length wise, but to wrap her tightly at all, it's waaaay to big for her. Seems strange to make a swaddle so loose since the purpose of a swaddle is to be tight.Also, mine does not have any velcro fasteners on the bottom like the other commentators. Not sure why but ours are apparently different.	
1. 	Great bottle brush! Even includes a micro cleaning brush in the handle for little hard to reach crevices in bottles.I love that the brush head is so stiff as it really scrubs the bottom of the bottles well.Definite must have for any parent who is bottle feeding!	
1. 	They have a lot of static, but you don't need the volume cranked up to hear the baby - I could hear him pretty clearly whether he was crying or quietly babbling to himself.I did pick up another monitor on one of the channels. Keep this in mind if you have neighbors with babies. Since the monitor has two channels, I just switched to the other one (and turned the monitor off after naptime so the neighbors couldn't hear my singing/TV/what have you).They still work after a year, and I haven't really even taken very good care of them - they've been loose in suitcases, they've been yanked off of shelves and fallen on hard floors.	
1. 	We bought this for our youngest and its great! It gives just a little light in her room for us when we check on her and give her something to look at as she falls asleep.	
1. 	The yin and yang of disposable liners is having to keep buying more. But it beats washing bottles all day long.	
- 1	I saw this and though it would be easy to use.I was wrong. It not only bunches and leaks but my son, which  is big for his age out grow this in 2 months. I would not buy this again or give it as a gift.	
- 1	Very disappointed with this purchase and with Amazon's customer service.  I bought this item for my baby after hearing how wonderful it is.  I purchased it from Good Products LLC and realized something was wrong when I received the package.  It's a fake!  To those that are wondering how to tell, here's a quick list of differences on the fake:1)  The packaging is different2)  Image quality on box and instruction manual is very poor3)  No DVD included4)  Logo is slightly different in color5)  Large waist buckle says warrior instead of stealth6)  Warning label on inside is in 5 different languages instead of 27)  Poor stitching (especially noticeable looking at edges on front waist belt)8)  Thinner padding on shoulder strapsQuality control and safety standards are NOT what makers of fake items care about!  If you have one, please make sure it is the correct one!  I'm going to purchase it at a big box store, just to be safe.  Yes, it will definitely be more expensive, but worth every penny for my baby's safety!	
- 1	I purchased this diaper for overnight wear due to some great reviews.I did use a diaper cover and an extra insert and my son was soaking wet by morning.	
- 1	Does not get those tough stains out. Great for a toddler who doesnt spill/play in dirt but if your kids are like mine, they are filthy by the end of the day and this just wont cut it.	
1. 	My husband and I bought this product after reviewing and comparing several others to find the best one for us and for our daughter. It is very easy to use/put on, and very comfortable to wear with my daughter in it! The straps distribute the weight over your shoulders/back in a very comfortable way and nothing digs in or is uncomfortable when you wear it. She always fell asleep when we put her in it and never fussed about it, so I assume it was just as comfortable for her! I feel that this is a good quality, safe and durable item, and very secure. My daughter is now 2 years old and we have kept this product to use with our next child! We highly recommend it.	
- 1	Great idea, but did not hold up. We have a 6mo old and wanted to use this with the baby gate. saw a snag in the cover material that morning and thought maybe the gate messed it up. Well come to find out my little man scooting about on it pulls the plastic top up from the foam and it rips, leaving fun flaps of plastic he LOVES to pull at. The cats walking on it have left it dotted with holes as well. Very disappointing. No idea how one could expect to use it with a toddler	
- 1	The idea is good, put your sleeping baby from the car to the house without the baby waking. My daughter is rarely sleeping when we come home so there goes that good idea and when she is, unfortunately she still wakes and wants out. So, I rarely use it and even though I rarely use it, the motor all of a sudden started making a loud disturbing noise that wakes my baby anyways. Its not worth the money spent, in my opinion. Save your money and buy something else.	
- 1	Does not stay on my toilet very well and it is easy to pull off.  My son is able to open the toilet still.	
1. 	It is a nice product and definitely keeps my baby warm with the colder months coming up. I can also tell that he will be able to use it will he is much older. However, I am currently using it on my City Mini Baby Jogger. I have found that after installing Bundle Me, I am not able to recline the seat. I need to leave it upright as the rubber strap that holds Bundle me to the stroller would not allow it to extend. also, with this installed, trying to get out the strap that folds the stroller into half is a little more cumbersome. Not absolutely perfect, but still defintely useful and more convenient than using a blanket to him him warm .	
1. 	This one is the best and a must have! Don't waste your time or money on the other ones.  The Diaper Genie is way too complicated.  It's a trash can so it should be simple.  I shouldn't have to read directions on how to use it!  This one is great because it is so easy to use, I never smell any odor, and it uses normal trash bags!  Why spend money on special trash bags?  I like the cheap roll of scented trash bags for like $2.00.  They work great and they are small so you can keep them in the nursery for quick and easy trash changes.	
- 1	I thought we would love this sleeper and we did at first.  I read reviews prior to purchasing about babies getting flat heads after sleeping in these, so I have been carefully paying attention to our daughters head.  I thought that if she only slept in it at night, that would not happen.  I was wrong!  Our daughter is only 4 1/2 weeks old and I have already noticed her head starting to flatten out.  We have stopped using this product.  Other than that we loved it.  We loved how easy it was to move from room to room.  We now have her sleeping in a cradle and it is much harder to move around and we can't use it while traveling.  Maybe the other Rock n Plays with the bunny or puppy would be ok?  Those look like they have a lot more padding around the head.	
1. 	This shade is basically like a piece of spandex with piping in the front to give it the curved shape - it fit my Graco Metrolite stroller with no problem and can see how this would/should fit any stroller. Really easy to put on/off and adjust if needed. If the sun is pointed right at us, I can easily just pull the shade so it goes lower and then just pull it back when the sun is not in our face so my baby can see more! I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they need to get their baby sunglasses for taking walks.	
1. 	I am happy with this product, although it is smaller than expected, it is a good quality and small enough for little hands to hold.	
- 1	I found that this seat pinched my child's legs/hind area on the sides where the seat unfolded. It also has some foam on the backend  (I assume so it doesn't slip on a toilet seat) that just didn't seem to get clean when I would try to sanitize the seat. I ended up throwing it away.	
1. 	Now that my daughter is eating finger foods I use this bib all the time. It's very good to avoid a big mess at meal times. The material is very good. It doesn't create mildew like other bids, it's very easy to wash and it dries really fast, so I can have it ready for the next meal. It's worth buying it! The reason whay I only gave 4 stars it's because I don't like the designs that much.	
- 1	My twins figured this thing out in no time flat. Just another thing to toss into the nice idea pile of products that do not work as advertised. What a waste of money.	
1. 	I purchased this for the smaller of my one year old twin granddaughters, the larger baby uses a high chair I was able to borrow from a friend. So in order for  little peanut to sit with the rest of us at a meal time-I purchased this. Shes fits in it perfectly fine, she is happy as all getup in it and to be part of the family at dinner. She will be getting weighed this week at her one year checkup, but I am estimating she is about 19 lbs and 29 tall. the entire set up cleans easily,  And since I never leave her unattended in anything-I wouldn't have the problems some of the other reviewers seem to have with the white tray pinching the childs fingers. I love the fact that it is height adjustable and the straps are long enough to fit around any chair in my house as well as my daughter & son in laws house. All in all a great booster seat. I would recommend this to anyone.	
- 1	I used this for a newborn and a 7m.o.  It didn't last very long.  Extremely uncomfortable on my shoulders and back, because all of the weight is balanced on your shoulders.  My biggest con for this carrier, though, is the fact that it's not ergonomic.  The baby dangles by their private parts and there is no hip support.  I can't imagine trying to use it with a larger child.  I would definitely go for an ergonomic carrier over this.  There are affordable options (I have the Infantino Support Ergonomic Cotton Carrier and love it).	
- 1	I purchased this item for my infant twins.  I read the negative reviews on several websites, but thought my experience would be different.  I purchased this swing because at the time it was less expensive than other models for sale.  Plus, we only wanted a swing that could be plugged in, which it does.  Note: we only used the cradle swing feature.Pros:  Attactive.  Easy to assemble when following instructions.  Lots of sounds choices.  Good volume control.  Appreciate foot controls when holding a sleeping baby.Cons:  After using this swing for 10 weeks it no longer swings properly.  We turn it on high and it barely moves.  It has to warm up.  I cannot wait for it to warm up - on several occasions this waiting has awakened the baby.  Last night it stopped working completely and woke my very fussy, teething baby.  We never used the glide feature because it is not smooth.  The music turns off after about 20 minutes, which wakes the baby.I would not recommend this swing for anybody.  We are returning it and found a Fisher Price Little Lamb swing for $122 plus free shipping.  If you purchase this swing, please save your box, instructions, etc. because you'll likely have to return it.	
- 1	I've put a lot of thought into this product and whether I could possibly use it for a second baby, and as its currently designed I would not feel comfortable using this or recommending it to a friend.  My daughter slept amazingly well in Rock n Play for over four months.  We took this RnP on trips, she napped under the table at a wedding, it was great.  Helped with her mild reflux, seemed easy to clean (just removed the cover and machine wash), and easy to travel. It was great until two weeks after my daughter had been permanently moved to her crib and I removed the cover on her Rock n Play which was still sitting in the corner (hadn't been cleaned in a month but not used in two weeks) and there was mold, definite mold.I was upset that my daughter had possibly been sleeping on mold for those two weeks she had used it and immediately called Fisher Price.  I was referred to cleaning instructions but with mold growing on inside unreachable fabric next to the plastic shell, no thanks, so instead they were sending me a replacement. I considered what I could do to keep this clean, but the only option I felt would really keep it clean (wiping it down with bleach every few days) isn't really safe for my baby.  Because the fabric covers plastic and can't be removed there's no way to completely clean it, other than having it sit in bleach which is there suggestion but would be obnoxious to do too often and still, bleach on something my baby sleeps on.I expected changes on the replacement to make it easier to thoroughly clean but no such luck, and was told by Fisher Price that the only way to keep the Rock n Play mold and mildew free is to wipe it down frequently, but when mold is growing on the inside where I can't even get to to clean that doesn't really help. I'm sending it back and going for a voucher instead.  Luckily I was only using it for traveling anymore with my daughter, but for our next baby I'll find the next new baby product that hopefully wont be prone to growing mold.	
- 1	Too long, does not fit our davinci porter crib. Hard to find the right size. I would not recommend it	
1. 	I love my inclined to sleep. I wish I found it sooner! It's comfy and it works great for infants with reflux. I wish it was longer since my 3 month old baby is almost too big for it now. I washed it a few times and it held up well. It's great for cosleeping and for nursing in bed.	
1. 	Giving a bath as a first time parent was made less terrifying by the sling.  When my daughter was big enough to do without the sling this tub fit perfectly on the floor of our tiny shower stall.  This tub is deeper than the other brands I've seen so I think it will last longer, my daughter is now almost 6 months and not quite able to sit up on the toddler side but has become quite comfortable lounging on the baby side... she likes to put her tailbone on the bump in the middle which allows her to touch the other end with her feet, making her feel more secure.  I don't see how that can be comfortable but she manages to get into the position no matter how many times I scoot her back.  My only dislike is that the trough on the end quickly fills up with water and can't drain.  Anything that you put into the trough then floats in cold stale water until you turn the whole tub over to drain it.  But that's a very small complaint, I love this tub!	
1. 	The gate is great and works perfectly! Go ahead and buy a set of longer screws or anchors to install with the gate. We have two of these, and ended up having to do that to both of them after they came out of the wall when opening!	
- 1	These nipples are VERY fast flow.  My baby was choking on the milk that was coming out. I don't recommend using anything above stage 2.	
1. 	I have the Graco Pack n Play and this sheet fits perfect!  I was a little scared to dry it after reading reviews online so the first wash I did not dry.  After the 2nd wash and ever since I have dried on the medium setting and no shrinkage for me.  This is suuuper soft and nice and cushy!  I am not sure if I would use if it was summer time unless the house was nice and cool.  I also used it in other pack n plays that were not graco when we traveled and it worked great.  I would recommend and will for sure buy another if I need one.	
- 1	I really had to laugh out loud when I washed these for the first time.I felt like I was on a hidden camera COMEDY!  These diapers shrinkdown so much, that you will laugh out loud!  I really could not believemy eyes.  They went from baby diapers to doll sized diapers!  Ha-ha-ha!Only buy these if you know what to expect on this shrinkage issue.  Theyare soft, and make a good use for burping spit up diapers.  I do not knowif you'd like them otherwise.  I would not buy more than one dozen untilyou try them out first.  Not really recommended....	
1. 	This is so much easier, and smaller, than purchasing a high chair. Also great for traveling. Once my little one grew out of his bumbo chair he was ready for this one. I use a plastic mat underneath the chair to keep things clean.	
- 1	This seat was on sale and we thought it was nice to have something that had some fancy features- the music is great, it becomes a stool too, and it has a lid we can put down just for cleanliness (which also made it look more like the adult potty too!).  But the functionality is an issue.  I imagine that the pee guard for boys needs to be movable for safety, but it is hard for my short-legged 22 month old to deal with.  It often gets pushed down as he tries to sit by himself- and although I can lift him up and onto the toilet, what's the point of not giving him independence?  And then when he does try to get on himself, the guard pushes down, and he knows it is supposed to be up and tries to put it in place.  All this distracts him from going to the bathroom and he's already pinched his privates too.  I tried to teach him to push down the guard and his weewee, but let's just say that touching himself was also distracting (TMI?- boys will be boys!).  This has a lot of cute ideas, but it just doesn't work well when it comes down to it.  I wish it had.	
1. 	We have four of these for our son.  He likes them and so do we.  They hardly ever leak and they are easy to hold for little hands. They stand up to the dishwasher well too.	
1. 	Awesome hand pump. Very easy to use and clean. Great for pumping On a regular basis or for expressing milk when engorged. Medelas high quality as usual for a great price! Love it!	
- 1	While my NB was in the middle of a bottle he began to shout out a cry cuz he had a lot of air from the bottle, the burp that came out of him was horrible and scared me from EVER using these bottles again. I could even hear him swallowing air at some points.	
- 1	Everyone that wrote that the mirror is like a fun house mirror got it right. It seems like it's a little warped because it's on a soft surface. Even though it's a little odd for me to see, my little boy loves it. We're using it during his tummy time and he loves lifting his head to take a peak at himself. Overall, I rated it 4-stars because it's sturdy (we haven't had any problems with it falling over), well-made, and fun; however, I wouldn't use it as a mirror in the car.Update: Of all the toys we bought, this is the one that we used the least. it was great for about 3 weeks for tummy time, but once my son was able to move to touch the mirror, it would fall down. I ended up using a peanut butter jar to prop it up so that it wouldn't collapse. Then, when we put it in his crib, if he pulled on it, it would fall on him. I tried to tie it up, but it was awkward. He couldn't get to the bird or the monkey so he never really got interested in it again. I LOVE Skip Hop, but I honestly feel like I wasted money on this toy.	
- 1	Tried to order the unpainted, waited over a month and it never came back in stock.  Ordered the teal blue.  I sanitized it per directions (water no longer boiling, and bottle cannot hit sides of pot.  Nipples and lid CAN be boiled). The nipples had tiny black marks on them that don't come off, and the bottle has peeling paint.  This is not acceptable!!!  Seems VERY dangerous for my child. I was trying to save money over Kid Kanteen. Guess I should have known better. I never even got the chance to see if the baby liked it.  Also, the vents on the nipples are REALLY long and very difficult to clean.  Great concept (that you could progress to a sippy cup).  Unfortunately, very poorly executed.Wish I would have read more of the reviews...a lot of others commented on the paint peeling too, yet still gave high star ratings, which confuses me.Thankfully, amazon will return it.	
1. 	We finally figured out to buy this Junior size bib for my son when he was 18 months old.  We had been using the smaller ones and we would have to change his pants after every meal.  I wish we had bought these sooner!  These are perfect for toddlers and are the only bibs we need now.	
1. 	I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!	
1. 	I bought this booster when my daughter was 9 months old to use at restaurants instead of a high chair. She seemed to like having her own tray, and I found this booster more secure and more sanitary than using a restaurant high chair. My daughter is now 20 months old and she has outgrown her high chair and we use this seat at the table every day when we eat. I have known another mom that never used a formal high chair and only used this chair strapped to one of their kitchen table chairs. This booster takes up a lot less room than one of those huge high chairs. I love that the height on the chair is adjustable and the price can't be beat. This is one of my must have baby products. We even bought one for Grandma's house when we go and visit.	
- 1	This is one of those items I thought was a must have when having our first child.  We hardly use it.  Yes, we do find it nice to have at times, but for the price and amount of use we've gotten out of it borrow one if you can or find something less expensive to use.  This is a difficult item to review or buy because you really can't know what your needs will be until you have your first child.  All of the positive reviews are nice, but you may not be as avid a user as they all are.	
1. 	This pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well! It's great that it doesn't require any special type of bag. You can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags. I use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers.It does a great job of keeping the smells in. The only time I notice a smell is when I'm opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner.I like this product so much that I recommend it to anyone I know who's having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers!	
- 1	I read the reviews about the sheet being too small. I ordered it anyway. I should have listened to the reviews. When the sheet arrived, I washed it and put it on. It was small, but not too small. I thought I was in the clear. However, after a few more washings, she sheet is definitely too small. So small, in fact, that I ripped it getting it on the mattress. Nice fabric, cute pattern, soft, but it doesn't matter anyway because the dang thing is too small for a standard crib mattress.	
- 1	Been shedding no matter how many times I wash it. Now the one side is completely covered in lint balls.	
- 1	Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me.  My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it.  The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his equipment being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too).	
- 1	REALLY FAST FLOW. It chokes the baby. Please dont use it with newborns as its too much flow and air and it creates colics	
- 1	this nasal aspirator is a waste of money, doesnt work for us.Like another reviewer said, I wish I could give this 0 stars.For me the best nasal aspirator is the most simple, a pigeon manual aspirator.If you want an advice, dont waste your money on this! Is a very weak aspirator...	
1. 	We are very happy with the tub.  It is light, well made, made in the USA!  THANK YOU!!!  We buy a fair share of Made in China stuff, so it is nice to see a made in the USA product.  THe drain in the bottom is a great idea as well.	
- 1	This unit was mentioned on several forums as a good option for bedside sleeping for newborns. When it arrived, I couldn't imagine having my baby sleep in that for a nap, let alone for a full night. The bottom is very hard, nearly no padding. The rocking feature is nice but not worth the tip factor. I was also surprised by how deep it is. Already sitting below our mattress line, the bottom is about 10&#34; below the top of the bassinet making lifting baby out for late night feedings very awkward. I'm glad I returned it for another option because I ended up having a c-section and it never would have worked for me.	
- 1	After you wind this up, it plays for less than two minutes before you have to wind it up again.  It is now on my son's crib as viewing pleasure rather than a soothing device.	
1. 	After purchasing multiple bibs from Walmart and Target, and ordering others online, without a doubt I recommend these bibs. I only wish I found these earlier. I purchased 2 for my twins, blue fizz color and they match the photo. My twins are 15m and these fit great, room to grow and also not so large they could of worn them when they were younger. The sleeves have elastic on the ends so they don't slide up or down. The pocket works well for my kids. The tie in the back as the closure is prefect because my twins know how to take bibs off but the tie is long enough to not be tight on their little necks. It works well as waterproof and after washing there has been no fading in color, rips or fading on waterproofing.	
1. 	This is a great product. It's easy for the babes to sit on comfortably. It's easy to clean b/c it only has one part. And it has that nice rubber ring on the bottom to prevent slides.	
- 1	Too small.  It felt worthless for what I wanted.  I ended up buying a 12&#34; 7.5&#34; tall wedge with memory foam that is a lifesaver!	
1. 	We have the good fortune of taking our 8 month old daughter to work with us at our family owned business. The first one of these we bought was the blue/green version. We liked it so much we came back and bought a second chair for home. Cleanup is super easy. The only bad thing is that my daughter has already figured out how to remove the top tray. No big deal, we just take that off and feed her in the bottom tray attached to the seat. It also seems that she will have plenty of room to grow in this seat.Great chair and Great price!	
1. 	As an FYI, the product dimensions Amazon has for this product are incorrect.  It is NOT 33 wide.  The correct dimensions are found in the product images.  The indication of 33 is misleading and may prevent people from buying this product.  The product is a standard size and regular crib sheets will fit.  Hope that helps someone.I haven't used the crib/mattress yet, but it seems like a standard, firm, coil free mattress, hoping that it lasts us awhile.	
- 1	I wanted a better mattress in the pack and play.  This is not a snug fit for it. If thats what you want don't buy this.  Otherwise it seems ok.Editing to add that this is def. not a good mattress to put in your pack and play especially once your children start moving.  I am having to take it out because there is a gap down the side as it is not quite large enough.  My boy got his arm trapped down there when he rolled on his belly and got himeself stuck.  This should NOT be used in a pack and play.It is now going to be a bed for my cocker spaniels.	
1. 	I love this product! It works wonders. I made sure I tested it at 5 different restaurants before I posted this. It worked very well and does it's job to a T! Lets be honest, we all have messy kids, so the chances that they're not going to get one item on the floor is impossible. This product definitely minimizes the issue by 90%. I'm one of those moms who said that I'm not going to let my child make a horrible mess on the floor if we went out for dinner. Well, that's impossible too. I literally picked up 2 to 3 pieces of food off the floor versus 40 pieces of food from before. I'm very pleased with this product and when you're finished with it, you can just roll it up and take it home for cleaning. Will recommend this to others.	
- 1	How are they getting away with selling a BABY product with such a toxic, gaseous smell??!  This pillow reeks with fumes, I think from both the plastic packaging and the foam in the pillow itself.  Please do not buy this pillow for use near your baby.	
- 1	We got this when our little one still preferred to be swaddled but was now occasionally rolling on to his stomach. We were hoping this would prevent him from rolling. Learned how to use it to keep baby on his side which he preferred however he did not like being restricted to one place. He fought it each time he realized he was in it. Like the idea and hoped it would work for us. Probably would work for younger babies.We had to go cold turkey with not swaddling real quick.	
1. 	I have primarily used these travel bibs until I recently tried Bibsters.  I quickly switched back.  I like the crumb pocket design.  It holds well and catches food.  The neck closure has positives and negatives.  It is a sticky seal.  As long as you press it together well, it holds well.  My daughters pull on them, but quickly stop when they can't rip them off.  The problem is they have long hair and no matter how hard we try, we end up pulling their hair.  We put the bibs on in front (under their chins,) then twist the bib around.  After they eat, we rip the bib to remove on the side, rather than trying to open the seal.  This has reduced the hair pulling, but we cannot seem to keep it from happening completely.  Overall these are my favorites.  We have not had any issue with food leaking through the bib.	
1. 	My 4 year old absolutely loves having this in our house.  We use it when the kids all sleepover in the same room, and there aren't enough beds.  But because it's so light and they know how to fold it up (just pull in from the ends) they carry it around the house and set it up wherever they want.  It comes with a cover that has reinforced corners, which seems like it will help it from being ripped because it's a very snug fit.  Make sure to wash that cover, by the way, because it completely smells like chemicals when it arrives.  Made it China, though the box says it's Made in the USA.  Maybe shipped from the USA?  Anyway, we are very happy, and for the price, I might even get a couple more.  Watch out when you are walking by it, though, because as an adult, I have caught my shin on it a few times and it isn't soft.	
1. 	I love the playtex dropins system.  Always just need to make sure that I have enough liners.The pricing is good (it's worth 4 cents to me to not have to wash a bottle!).  And the product is secure.Very very occasionally it leaks if I put it in carelessly and didn't make sure the liner was solid and not a bit crumpled.  But that's my fault.  Overall, no complaints.  Even the pricing is fair.	
1. 	You really can't ask for more from an exersaucer for only $50.  Yes, you can pay twice as much for maybe a few more toys, but this is good enough for my daughter.  She really gets a kick out of being able to turn around in the center to play with her favorite toys.  She can spend a good 15 minutes at a time playing in it.  Her favorites are the flip up & down pictures of circus animals, and the wheel with the monkeys in it.  There's plenty of shelf room to put your own toys on there, too.  It's a definite must have for any stay at home parent.	
- 1	I have been using these diapers for almost a year and have hated every minute of them! The inserts do not fit, they bunch up and then this causes them to leak. My daughters are not heavy weters and they leak through them by the legs in a half an hour. I have contacted FuzziBunz about this, adjusted the leg elastic, only used approved detergent, lines dryed, no chemical or rash cream, and still they are junk. I bought a couple Bumgenius after this horrible experience ready to give up and they are awesome! My kids go at least three hours in one diaper, no leaks!! Please do not spend the money I did and have it go to waste. P.S. the snaps broke on 24 of the 50 total that I have bought of these junk diapers.	
1. 	PERFECT fit! Thick, elastic goes around the entire pad, with a deep fit, and it's soft to the touch! Fits my Delta mini-crib perfectly. Very happy with this purchase... it was even 4 dollars cheaper than current eBay sellers. :-) Love Amazon!	
- 1	I bought this bouncer for my 4 month old daughter because I wanted another seating option for her besides her swing or Boppy lounger. I thought this bouncer had a good concept with the interactive toy design. However, once I put together the bouncer and let my daughter sit in it, I saw that she couldn't even really reach the monkey and butterfly toys at the top.  She also couldn't get the push and pull feature of the toy bars.  I don't know if she's still too young and only knows how to bat at the toys but it just seemed like to me that she got bored very quickly sitting there staring at toys that she couldn't play with.  Perhaps an older baby may like this better but according to the bouncer description, you shouldn't use this on a baby that can sit up on their own and that's the only way I can see any baby being able to reach up for the high toys.  Also, the music and monkey sounds that comes on when you move one of the handles gets really annoying after awhile.  It would be good if there was an off button for the music rather than having to just remove the battery.  Lastly, I thought the toy bars could be moved to the sides so you can easily take your baby in and out of the chair but it doesn't.  That means you have to lift your child from the top and slide their legs out from below the toys.  Not a big deal but another annoying part of the toy design.  I ended up returning this bouncer as it wasn't worth the money for the badly executed design of the toys.	
- 1	I got this pump when I had my fourth child. My insurance company let me choose from several options, and if was going to get the medela but after doing some research and reading reviews on the rumble tuff I decided to try this out. Unfortunately I am not so happy with it. I find that I just don't get as much milk as I should. My baby is young, I have a full and wonderful milk supply, and for some reason all I can get is 3 ounces in 10 minutes when I use this pump.  When I used my medela for my other babies i definitely got more.This pump has some advantages over the medela, in my opinion.  I find it more comfortable because of the silicone shields. And the tubing does not accumulate moisture like in the medela. I like the bottle stands so that the bottles don't tip over when you put them down. I liked the feature that it has that turns it into a manual pump but I never actually used it, so while it originally attracted me to this pump (I guess I thought I hate pumping, maybe I would like the manual pump better) I have never used it. There is also less to shlep around with this pump but that could just be because my medela came in a huge backpack. As another poster said, the carry bag for this pump is really a joke (no zipper even!) but it is easier to just stuff in a small bag and not lug around a giant backpack.The bottom line for me is, I am at home with my baby and use the pump so I can get the occasional evening away. For that purpose this pump is okay. But if I was working full time and relied on this pump there is no way I could produce enough for my baby with this. It simply does not empty me as much as the medela did.  (Not to mention the time involved - when I used to work and pumped with the medela all I had time for was a quick pumping session a few times a day. This pump takes me 10 minutes to get 3 ounces combined from both sides - I would need to use this for 20 minutes at a time to get a decent amount and I never had that kind of time to kill at work.)I am disappointed, and if I was doing it again I would choose the medela because it is stronger and I got a lot more milk.(And again, I am pretty certain this is not a milk supply issue. I seem to have an abundance of milk, I often feel very full, often milk leaks out, and sometimes if my baby comes off while nursing milk keeps spraying out at her anyway. She has doubled her birth weight in less than three months while exclusively nursing. So I am fairly certain the pump is simply not as strong as others.)	
1. 	These are quality made bottles and like most others stated, they don't leak.  They are easy to clean and BPA free.  Most babies are picky, so if it is your first child, you might have to experience to find the right one.  I recommend giving this one a try.	
1. 	What can I say, the product simply works. I only use it on long trips but there is where it makes all the difference. I happen to have a convertible and the strap hits me at a terrible spot. This becomes an issue on long trips. This product has enabled me to stop constantly pushing the belt down and watching it ride right back up and then cutting into my neck. So, bottom line, if you have a seatbelt such as mine I wholeheartedly recommend this product.	
- 1	Ordered these by mistake, so I thought I'd give them a try anyway. Bad idea. The tabs that you are supposed to remove have a terrible perforation and need to be cut off. The liner doesn't fit right around the Playtex Drop-In bottle like it is supposed to. 3 out of 4 leaked when feeding. 1 out of 2 gave us milk explosions when squeezing the air out of the bottle -- and it was a very slow low pressure squeeze too. Wasted way too much breast milk that had me nearly in tears. Stick to the Drop-In style!	
- 1	The sheet is soft, but thin and very see through because it is so loosely knit. I would fork over the cash for something of better quality. This can only be used with a layer or two of other things underneath it.	
1. 	I am so happy with this play yard.  When  I put my four month old down inside it he looked around then looked up at me and smiled, I kid you not.  The only complaint I have is that the description here on Amazon says that the play yard is 38x38.  However when the box arrived it indicated that it is only 36X36, still plenty of space though.  I only paid $49.00 because I have the Amazon credit card and get reward certificates to use towards products, so between that and the free shipping I got a GREAT BUY for a GREAT PRODUCT.  Thank you Amazon and Graco!	
1. 	This base easily converted my Evenflo Embrace 35 into a sturdy stroller.It's easy to assemble. It took me less than five minutes out of the box with no instructions required.It's easy to use. More easy to store, carry and transport than any stroller system I've used. I've found it much more practical than the combination stroller car seat systems that I've used in the past and much more affordable.It looks great. Once paired with the carseat, it doesn't look any different than any other infant stroller.I would buy again or purchase as a gift.	
- 1	I bougth this lamp a few weeks ago and is colorless. My baby is not yet born so I am wondering what is going to happen in the next 5 months.... Expensive and bad product	
1. 	These covers stay in place and my kid can't remove them like the others with the push button in them.	
1. 	Our 10wk old spits up half his meal every time he nurses.  We went through outfits constantly until we found these bibs. They are super absorbent and cover him well (we use 3-6mo sizes). Would definitely buy again.	
1. 	Very light weight, flexible, VERY EASY to clean and has a large adjustable Velcro strap on the back  for attachment	
- 1	The bobby was way too cumbersome for nursing.  It was given to me as a gift, a lot of people said great things about it and I registered for it before my baby was due.  In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time trying to get the boppy comfortable around me and in place before someone handed me my daughter during feeding times.  Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy!  The boppy is collecting dust.  Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up!  I still can't stand the boppy for nursing, but I really love it for a cushion when they are sitting up!	
- 1	Cheaply made. I did not even use it. I could have made this on my own with some fabric and a needle and thread. It is not very well made either.	
1. 	I really needed a pack of soft, cute bibs at around four months for my drooling baby.  These were perfect--they attach securely but comfortably, are absorbant and soft.  When we first started solids a few months later, they were great for that, too.  Once baby started really eating we switched to a less absorbant, rinseable bib.  Initially they worked for eating without a problem.  They got very messy and we never had the food or milk soak through all the way.	
1. 	These shields are amazing! I've used them to breastfeed my DD since she was born (now 2 months old) - BF without them is incredibly painful for me, even with a very good latch. My baby has a super powerful suck and also tends to bite down as she falls asleep while nursing (as she often did in the first weeks) and without the shield, i'd get painful damage. Wearing the shields has made the experience bearable. They are super easy to use and wash and sterilize quickly and easily.	
- 1	I got this because I got a boppy with my first dd and was disappointed in it. I am overweight but not huge and the boppy just didn't fit. I figured since this had the belt type adaptation it would maybe suit me better so I was really looking forward to using this for bf this time around. Well I have tried several times and it just isn't comfortable. I'm 5'4 and 200 pounds it's snug but it just doesn't seem that supportive and I'm still having to lift the baby to me too much. I have just found using several pillows (some are throw pillows and others are regular ones) are just more supportive and work better for baby and I. Unfortunately I ordered this when I was around 6 months pregnant and so I can't return it bc with a newborn coming I washed the outside shell so now I'm out that money. If you can with any of these I would try to use someone else's for one or two bf sessions first before ordering one just to make sure it fits and that you find it comfortable so you're not out the money. It seems like good quality, and does fit better than the boppy so thus the 2 stars but sense I still can't use it as intended no more than that.	
1. 	It fits in even the smallest bottles (medela breast milk storage bottles) and seems to get every inch! My absolute favorite bottle brush!	
- 1	Highly recommend them!  I had used them for a year and a half and just bought more for next baby, they work great!	
- 1	Since you cannot train a 6 month old baby, my daughter tends to hold it by the round shape and tries to chew on the giraffe's leg and body. She gets frustrated because the only favorable chewing part is the ring shape. A baby cannot chew any other part. But since she tends to hold by the ring, she cannot chew the ring. Bad design	
1. 	These are really great if your kid kicks off the blankets, then wakes up because he's cold. They are roomy enough for them to move around in, and sized generously. My son outgrew the small size by 6 months (29&#34;), and I skipped the medium size entirely and went right to a large, which he will be in for several more months.	
1. 	We will be buying a second for our other carseat. The price can't be beat and it weathered the trip to Alaska, around Alaska and back. It fits our Britax Marathon easy. (Other bags are a stretch to house the Marathon.)This has nothing to do with the quality of the bag, but I do wish it was in stock more often. The two times I have come here to order it, it is out of stock. Last time I ended up ordering it from a different vendor and paying more plus paying for shipping. Please Amazon - get this in stock before the holidays!	
- 1	To go straight to my points:1) It leaks (I'll upload pictures)2) After 30 minutes of steaming 1 1/2 cup of carrots they were still tough (very!) So I decided to put more water in the chamber and steam it for another 20!... Then &#34;puree it&#34;. When I was done, the carrots (maybe because it leaked all the water) was more looking like grounded coffee than anything else, so I added water and puree it again and it kept the same texture.I didn't want to burn the machine by &#34;pureeing&#34; too much (as it started to make a weird noise after 40 seconds of chopping) so I just got the carrots out (I'll post pictures of this too).I thought carrots might have been the problem, so I steamed apples and it happen again!3) I don't even know if the bottle warmer works, but I have to say, a Tommee Tippee bottle fits comfortably, so it is a good size.4) It is big (specialty for the counter of a 700sq2 feet condo) (10in height x 10in depth x 7in width) and the power cable is kind of short (31 inches)Arghhh I was going to write more, but the Bruins just lost the Stanley Cup... So... I guess this info might be enough.Don't buy this thing, an oven or a microwave and a regular blender will do a better job!	
- 1	I bought this as a second sound machine for my 1 year old for my parents house and it is a piece of garbage.  It only has 5-6 white noise sounds and most of them are strange and jarring.  There is one that sounds like rain which is the only one that is not horrible sounding.  It is also not very loud.  There on button has a blue light that is super bright and is annoying but you can't turn it off.  I am sending it back.  I bought the MyBaby by Homedics SoundSpa - Sleepy Snail for my own house and I love it.	
1. 	Folds up so easily!  I have used in the house, at friend's house, in the grass, on sand, it goes everywhere!  Easy to simply wipe off.  Handle is nice for carrying.  Fits in bottom of my Bob stroller.	
- 1	PROS:-It's a placemat.CONS:-Doesn't stick to wood tables(I didn't think it would be a problem since our hook-on high chair would secure it to the table, but since it doesn't lay flat and sits off the table due to the suction cups underneath, our curious 7-month-old spent every meal pulling up the edges and trying to figure out how to get it to his mouth).-The cutesy little design is raised making a zillion nooks and crannies for food to get stuck in if you don't run the whole thing under water immediately after using (not practical with a hook-on high chair).-The reservoir doesn't interface well with a hook-on high chair, and doesn't interface with the Bjorn soft bibs.-Doesn't lay flat, even with hook-on high chair arms on top of it for 2 weeks.	
1. 	I read some reviews suggesting that it is simple to just lift both toilet lid and seat I do not agree. There is a latch that actually goes inside the toilet bowl so that is not possible. My 15 month old son can not lift the lid and has actually lost interest in even trying. It is simple for me to open so no struggle when ya gotta go! I give this the full stars it deserves!	
- 1	Went through 2 packages of these... they don't seem to hold up well after being used a lot because the plastic is a bit flimsy.  After several uses, the plastic part of the round part of the spoon frays making some parts potentially sharp to sensitive baby's mouth.  Tried the Nuby spoons and these are a lot thicker and hold up a lot longer.  I've still been using them from the first package as they have not warped at all.Nuby Hot Safe Spoons 4 Pack BPA FREEThese aren't the exact ones I got but they seem similar.	
1. 	This is a good product.  It allows for quick and easy disposal of diapers, wipes, etc. and does not require any special bags.  Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any problems with it getting stuck. It does start to smell when there are poopy diapers in it, but I can't imagine that any product could completely eliminate poopy diaper odor!! If you change the bag regularly, you should not have any problem with odor.	
1. 	I've been using this for my son who's now 7 months old.  He loves it. The features are nice & it's built pretty sturdy.  He's never tipped over in it, but I also don't put it in the rocking position since you aren't supposed to until the child is a toddler who's getting into and out of it by themselves.I also have an older model of the same chair for my daughter who's now 3 and she still uses it!  I got her's used, so I don't know how old it actually was, but the vibrate function quit on her's when she was a little over 1.  (Of course, she didn't use the vibration anymore by then anyway, so it didn't really matter.)  My son's vibration on his chair is still working great though, so perhaps they have improved their manufacturing on these newer ones.I like how the seat belt is able to be put underneath the chair for toddler rocker use. It seems safer that they aren't actually removable plus they don't get lost that way either.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for only a couple reasons:1. If you have a very small baby the toy bar is too far away. (My daughter was always small-below the bottom curve on the growth charts...at 2 years old she'd barely reached 20lbs.) However, for average or bigger babies, the placement is perfect. (Like with my son, he is in the 75th percentile & it has always worked fine for him...but he was the exact same height and weight at 4 months that my daughter was at 1 year).2.  While being used as a rocker for toddlers, it is reclined a bit further than I'd like.  There are only 2 settings for the seat back and even the one that's more upright is still leaned back pretty far.  It works well for kids to lay back and relax to watch tv or something, but it'd be nice if you could sit it up more like a regular chair.Overall, a great buy & will last you a long time! (which is really nice since most baby gear gets outgrown pretty quickly)	
1. 	This Play Yard is exactly what I was looking for to cordon off a large portion of a room as a play area for our crawling 7mo.  It's sturdy and colorful.  It's much larger than I anticipated, I ordered the extension with it and didn't end up needing it, but it's really the perfect size for a spoiled little rug rat.	
1. 	I'd seen this swaddleme before, but didn't think it was that good! It is soft and the baby looks cute too. It is warm and my daughther (NB) stays really nice swaddled. The small one is a bit too big for a newborn, but we manage to use it well, and they grow fast, so I will still use it a lot.	
- 1	I bought it because I thought the polka dots can stimulate my baby's vision. But I guess it's too much and he couldn't fall asleep when I put on the bumper. Eventually I still use the plain white one.	
- 1	We did not get ours through Amazon, we were given it and told that it was purchased at BRU.That being said, my son finally figured out how to really chew on the head the other day, and I looked at him and he was covered in black paint! It completely smeared all over him and Sophie. When I rinsed Sophie off afterwards, more and more paint just ran right off until there was very little left. I gave up.I am certain our Sophie is real, as I watched the video on the Vulli website and it has all of the markers a real Sophie should have, and none of the fake ones I looked up online.That being said, while the paint is food grade I still don't want my son eating it. Babies under 6 mo should have nothing but breast milk (or formula if that's the way you're going) and I am sure that the paint is not made out of milk.Oh, and it smells horrible. Like a balloon. Which the company says is supposed to stimulate sense of smell or something to that effect.It's a cute toy, but since I won't let my kid use it, what's the point?	
- 1	I washed these and then the very first time I used them, not even 5 mins after putting them in, I leaked through one. I use other washable pads no problem. In this case you get what you pay for.	
- 1	The metal clip/grip that comes with this product had to be put together. It wasn't intuitive at all and both me and my husband had to tinker with it for a bit to get it right.	
1. 	We use this for home and travel.  Just pop it in the  microwave and sterilize.  Good item.	
- 1	With baby #2 on the way, we are in the market for a double stroller. We have loved our Bugaboo Frog (a hand-me-down) and naturally thought the Donkey would be the way to go, given our past success with the brand and the reputation. Plus it just looks so much nicer than all the other side-by-side doubles.I didn't want to spend $1,700 (this base plus the duo kit plus the various accessories) on something I hadn't test driven, so we went to a store and brought our older child with us. Much to my intense surprise, he is already tall enough that we could not comfortably extend the canopy (his head was level with where the canopy meets the top of the seat). I normally don't review items I do not own, but as I had not seen this mentioned previously I thought it would be important to point out.My son is in the 80th percentile for height with a long torso, but he's only two and a half, and one would hope that a stroller would last until at least age 4 or so--and it's rated for 38 lbs, so it seemed reasonable to think my 27lb kid would fit!If I were expecting newborn twins, I'd probably go for this as it's so pretty and conveniently sized and the options are fantastic. Plus I love how Bugaboos handle and think they are incredible versatile. But we can buy a less attractive double stroller that is the same width for 1/3 the price without cramping our older child or having to deal with the ridiculousness of folding up a Bugaboo (you'd really think they'd have fixed that by now).	
1. 	My 11 month old sleeps with this on every night and loves it. It has lovely soft colors that light up his room just perfectly and allow for me to check on him without having to turn on any lights. It eats up batteries it seems like mad, but I love it too much to worry about that!	
1. 	I wasn't sure about this mobile at first since it doesn't move and it's just a bunch of abstract and simple pictures dangling above the baby, but I needed something to distract my 2 month old daughter at the changing table without having to buy another fancy mobile.  At first glance, my baby took to it right away.  I don't know why these images attract babies but it does.  This has become one of my 2 month old daughter's favorite toy.  She loves talking to it...so much so that sometimes I'm reluctant to move her out of the changing table.The stem is made of plastic that comes in two parts which you snap together and once attached you cannot take it apart. The cards are plastic and reminds me a bit of plastic poker cards.  Some of the cards have images like a car, house, cat, and dog, but most have abstract images that comes in bold colors or black and white.  Taking the cards apart from each other can be tricky and I can see why some people can accidentally rip it apart.  I've found that if you fold the cards so they lay flat against each other and then wiggle/twist the area where they are attached they usually slide apart.  So the parts are not exactly sturdy and once my baby can reach it, I'll remove it and just use the cards as flash cards.The mobile comes with several sets of cards so you can change the images and the baby won't be bored.  However, I just put the images I like on the mobile and use the rest as flash cards when traveling to distract my little girl.For the price and the entertainment it has brought to my baby, I highly recommend this mobile.	
1. 	I love Bumpkins bibs!  Washable, lightweight, quick-drying, great for home, restaurants, travel.  Never had one stain, used them with beets, tomatoes, paint, food color, Easter egg dye, you name it (although after a few years, the white trim is just a little off-white now, but that is to be expected!).  I use this model for an art smock, but would absolutely bring it along for Christmas dinner or any other dress up occasion with a messy meal!  I have three different Bumpkins styles, this one, the one like this with short sleeves, and the regular bibs.  I absolutely love them, best parenting investment ever!	
- 1	I bought this but never use it because when it was on it was always moving out of place and didn't really help at all. I wouldn't recommend this product since it turned into more of a hassle than helpful.	
1. 	It is a great product. I like the fabric and the design making it easy to see your baby while feeding. It is wide enough to comfortably cover all the necessary areas while feeding in public. It does a good job and I am very happy with it. I have already promised to pass it to my sister who is expecting.	
1. 	I decided to order this because you got a bit more for your money over the Mustela Creme and although pleased with the product be forewarned it does have a different scent that the creme.  You also have to squirt about 4 pumps into a baby washcloth and use your other hand to rub it into a lather...that amount seems to wash my 33 lb. granddaaughter just fine and it takes about 2 pumps to wash her short haircut.  My granddaughter is not a normal rambunctious toddler so my comparisons in cleanliness would be comparable to an infant that is not sweating.Mustela Bebe Dermo-Cleansing Gel for Hair and Body 16.9 fl oz (500 ml)Each bottle seems to last about a month and when the product is a bit low and more difficult to pump, I add just a bit of water and get several more baths worth out of it.	
1. 	They do the job. They're keeping baby's fingers from getting in those darn sockets! I think they're pretty easy to pull out as well.	
1. 	I love this carrier! I had received the model above it for my shower and didn't like it at all. I exchanged it for this one and have loved my decision. My son has used it since he was 2 weeks old and it is very easy to use and seems comfy for him. Great value for the great price!!	
1. 	I love this tub! The hammock sling makes bathing an infant so much easier! This tub is the best!	
- 1	Unless you put all 5 pieces of this cup together just right, it leaks. Putting it together is a chore, very difficult. The big selling point is how it keeps the drink cool, well all but the milk that sits in the spout, that gets sour quickly.Wouldn't buy them again.	
- 1	The motor died and had to be replaced. The thing makes a lot of &#34;motor noise&#34; when running. Clicking and whirring, etc. The music is almost annoying. Babies can reach the dangling toys and stop them from spinning. My son really didn't like it, but I know some kids won't. Still, for all the problems, it was not worth the hassle of assembly (twice!) and the giant expense! It is tough to &#34;store&#34; by folding up the legs. It's cumbersome to move.	
1. 	I have used this since I first started &#34;showing&#34; and could no longer sleep on my belly.  Which was a big deal for me because I am normally a belly sleeper.  This has made sleeping so much easier.  I am now 33 weeks pregnant and am still loving this pillow.  I only wished I had known about it during my first pregnancy.	
- 1	The other reviews talk about ease of assembly. Well, mine must have been defective.Nothing fit together easily, and once together did not line up to attach. After this, realized one tower piece was missing. Took apart, placed back in box and returned. I don't have time for this nonsense. I assemble everything I buy myself, from furniture to toys. You usually can tell if something is well made and worth it, this was not. Waste of time and energy!	
- 1	I bought this product, but ended up returning it because I couldn't see how it would ever stay clean. There is no separate cover, so you have to actually wash the pillow itself. The pillow does break up into 3 sections, which makes that possible, though difficult. I bought a $20 body pillow with a washable case instead.	
- 1	Buying this item was a bad idea as was buying the bottles. Bottles aside; to have a brush that is only good for one type of bottle is stupid in my opinion because you'll need various brushes then and that results in having a counter full of extra brushes.To buy any one baby product that is only functional within the same brand is foolish in my opinion.The Lansinoh bottles require this brush and this brush is no good for other bottles&#8230;. enough said?	
1. 	These bottles are great.  My son is 2 1/2 month old and hasn't had any gas bubble that much.  He drinks very good with these bottle.  Just have to remember to put the plastic part down and around on the bottom part of it will leak!	
1. 	This set  of Playtes Drop-Ins included()4-ounce bottle complete with nipples, bands and covers  and 5 liners. Great addition to the bottle fed baby.  We used 8 4 ounce formy grandson who had to have special formula.  Great  No mess, no brushes , no boiling, bottles and no stinky bottles, and you get a new sanitary liner every bottle. We love the drop ins since it makes making bottles easier.My set was girl sthemed. pink ring with butterflies and stars, and yellow duckies, so so cute.	
1. 	This was a gift for my now 13 week old son. He is just starting to grasp objects and loves the raised bumps on the teether-handles. The Square toys holds a cat ball inside and is a huge hit as well. He loves watching the ball turn as I rotate the toy. There are different fabics on the sides of the toys to stimulate infants (satin, felt, ribbed, mirror, ect)I love that the objects are extra large, so they are easy to grab and play with. Furthermore, there is plenty of the clear plastic top for him to be able to see the objects inside. (Some toys only allow a small hole and if difficult for that young age to see inside.) I was thrilled that someone gave this to us for it is defintely a Keeper!	
- 1	Fits standard pacifiers?  Doesn't fit any of the common pacifiers we have, such as the NUK or Avent Soothers.  Not sure what pacifier would actually fit to be honest.  So don't waste your money like I did.	
1. 	This monitor is fantastic. The picture is very clear, even in the dark, and the sound is super sensitive. The battery lasts a long time, and after almost 2 years of daily use it is still working perfect and we have had zero problems with it. Every once in a while we'll get a tad bit of static, but the house is pretty big, so it's expected. This was definitely worth the money.	
1. 	My 3 month old son just loves this bouncer seat! He never seems to get sick of the aquarium scene. He loves the twirling starfish & the bubbles. A great feature is that you can switch from music to ocean waves to rain, etc. He stays entertained & will sit in it for long periods of time without fussing. He falls asleep in it alot, too. This is great for when you need time to do things around the house & cant hold your baby. It's easy to pick up & move (with him in it!). You can even remove the aquarium panel & just have it as a seat which is nice, too. I recommend this bouncer seat!	
1. 	I've owned this for about a year now and here's what I like:  LOVE the projection on the ceiling, music volume levels, music choices.  My son continues to love it and use it to calm down to fall asleep.  The only thing I would change is I wish it had a remote to start it over again.  Also, we ended up buying a battery charger because it does use the batteries pretty quick.  But I love it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.	
- 1	This is not soft and baby wants to play with it. If baby hits head on it, it is very hard and will hurt your baby. Returned this and got a blow up one.	
- 1	This is by far the worst package I had received ever. I wanted this do bad for my daughter, the package came opened and the box was in a horrible condition. I bought I brand new item but instead I got something used. I am very unsatisfied with this item!	
1. 	My 15 month old still enjoys this toy after getting it for Christmas when she was near 9 months. She didn't quite get it at first since she was so young, but through the months she's enjoyed pushing the buttons, watching the lights go on and off, hearing the music, and now at 15 months knowing that the different buttons do different things. My only complain is that there are a couple of songs that get old quickly, but I guess that comes with every music making toy! I like that it's colorful and the education it provides with the instruments (mommy and daddy are crazy music lovers) as well as the simplicity of the toy. Hopefully she'll enjoy it for a few more months!	
1. 	That is so funny that a previous reviewer called this the Pooperoo because my daughter poops almost everytime I put her in it!  And it really squishes up the back of her diaper because all her weight is pressing down right there - ew!  But anyway, this thing is AWESOME!  We bought it for my daughter right before she turned 4 months and, I swear, within a week of getting this for her my very colicky daughter was suddenly a happy baby.  Before we had this, I was her Jumperoo - holding her for hours while bouncing on an exercise ball (not great on the back!)- and this seemed to solve all her problems!  She is now 11 months old and still goes in her Jumperoo about a half hour everyday to watch a Baby Signing Time DVD (and so I can take a shower!).  I'm surprised that even now that she is a skilled walker she still enjoys spending time in it.  I'll be sad when she outgrows the weight limit!	
1. 	Do not look at the weight ranges when deciding on a size.  My son is at the top end of the size large weight range, but this item will still fit him for many months.  Instead, look at the height ranges for a more accurate size determination.  My tall son is growing out of size 18-24 month clothing, but the size large sleepsack (size 12-18 months) will fit him for many more months.	
- 1	Yes, it's cushy and comfortable and your child will probably enjoy sitting on it. But, someone decided it would be a good idea to make the cushion absorbent, which translates into a big pee-filled sponge. I used it with a girl, and once I noticed what was happening, I would wring the cushion out in bleach water but it still got really nasty.	
- 1	This bib is not soft enough and  after a couple of trips with it my son's cheeks were bright red from friction. What I do, I use it as a cover for the carrier, so I do not have to wash the carrier itslef, but I also use a big Aden and Anais bamboo burpy bib between it and my baby's chin and cheeks for softness. This combination works wonders for us and even if the burpy bib gets soiled and is removed for a little while I am replacing it, my baby carrier is still protected from drooling and milk.	
- 1	Everybody I know loves these, but I hate them. They aren't very stretchy. They are hard to get fastened to the diaper correctly. I switched to old fashioned &#34;safety pins&#34; instead. Maybe I wasn't using them correctly? Like I said, I'm the only one I know who doesn't like these so I'm sure it's a good product, but not for everyone (or at least me). Lol	
- 1	I was shocked when I read all of the 5 star reviews. These are horrible bibs. They are listed as waterproof, and is very far from the truth. Never have these kept moisture off of his clothing. We would have to double bib him, and even then, both would be drenched in a half hour or so. We will stick with our generic Target brand ones that absorb and wash great.	
1. 	It simplifies and saves room in your kitchen. You don't need anything else to feed your baby(s), everything is there. Very practical and good looking. It has bright colors. My 10 months old baby is using them since she was 6 months and loves them. They are also safe for your baby to play with. 100% Recommended! Don't forget to get the Take & Toss Organizer. It makes a big difference!	
- 1	I got this product and boiled it as directed to sterilize. I now have 10 bottles that are partially melted, same with the caps and the little inserts. Worst part of it is that I now have melted plastic on the bottom of my good pot!  I am still using the bottles to store milk, but not really happy with the product.	
- 1	The design and concept is great, very handy, but its not well made - the handle broke and the extension stuck from the beginning. If it were better made, I would give them more stars as its very easy to attach your seat and even though my daughter had NO interest riding in it through the airport, it saved us from having to carry it around which is really not feasible with a big car seat, luggage and a baby.	
- 1	My son is a little rough on things, so keep that in mind.  It was a great concept, until my son figured out how to pull it out, and then broke it.  The plastic did crack very quickly while still in the holder, as it is flimsy.  Additionally, he could pull it down in front, and reach over it.  So - they probably need to try again.	
1. 	This is the PERFECT toddler bed - it's inexpensive, it's sturdy, and it's absolutely adorable!  If you search the 'net, you'll find dozens of other rave reviews about this particular toddler bed.We just bought this a few weeks ago for our son's 2nd birthday.  He loves it!  It's close to the ground, and he can get in and out of it with incredible ease.Like some other reviewers said, the instructions were a little vague.  Like the pictures won't show you which way to put together each piece.  You need to think it through a little and make sure the holes for the side rails are both going the same direction, etc.  Just think ahead and anticipate what goes where, which isn't hard by any means.  If you've never put together furniture before, I can imagine it might be a little more difficult.But my husband and I having put together cribs, dressers, changing tables, etc, we found this one of the easier baby items to assemble!All in all, it's an awesome product, and I would definitely purchase it again!  Do NOT buy the cheapo ones at walmart, etc - those are poorly made, plus with amazon, you have the added benefit of no tax and FREE shipping, meaning you don't have to lug it out to your car and then to your house - they deliver it to your doorstep!I searched for hours for the best online deal for a toddler bed - this is it!  You won't find a better product for a better price!  Buy it and you won't regret it!Thanks amazon for yet another great buy!UPDATE 1/8/2010:We've had this bed for a year and a half, and it has held up FABULOUSLY!  As hard as our toddler can be on furniture (I'm sure you all know!!) I was surprised at how well it's held up.  He still fits great in it, and he loves that he has a bed sized right just for him.  :o)  A year and a half later, I would still definitely buy this again.  A really great toddler bed, especially for the price!!	
- 1	Comes folded resulting in creases that are still present.  Suction cups do not adhere to my wooden table.  Scoop is very awkward.  Haven't found this product particularly useful.  Think twice before purchasing	
- 1	Didn't really work the way I imagined it would.  The think kept spinning around and made it more difficult if you wanted to carry it with your hand because it was so big.	
1. 	These bottles are great.  My son is 2 1/2 month old and hasn't had any gas bubble that much.  He drinks very good with these bottle.  Just have to remember to put the plastic part down and around on the bottom part of it will leak!	
1. 	This was purchased for use in a special needs classroom.  It was easy to install, easy to use, and has stood up to the abuse of being used in a school classroom.  It is much more sturdy than previously used wood gates.  The item may be a little more expensive, but the quality is well worth it!	
1. 	This pillow really helps when breast feeding and provides a lot of support to both me and the baby. The only thing is it slips out of place quite easily. Other than that, it's absolutely great.	
- 1	These are not nearly as good as the yellow ones. They leak every time. I use them with the Pura bottles and have used the yellow Avent spouts since the beginning but have been unable to find them so I finally just bought these thinking they would be just as good. They're not.	
1. 	This review is for the Skip-Hop Pronto and is from daddy's perspective.  This was my bag of choice when taking my baby daughter to day trips to the museum, beach, friends, Grandma's, etc.  I really liked the bag and used it for over a year as my daughter was still just wee.  Below are the main points I can speak to from my experience:Pros*  Size - This size was just perfect for day trips.  It held a travel-size package of wipes, a few infant diapers (or a couple of bigger ones), and a couple of tubes of hand sanitizer, bottom balm, etc.  I loved the fact that it all condensed down into a small sized satchel that could be tossed under the compact stroller or hung on the handle without taking up a lot of space or getting in the way.  I always kept a larger, fully stocked diaper bag in the mother-ship (car) where room and space weren't as much an issue.  I thought the size of this was perfect for on-the-go short adventures.*  Function - I really  liked the fold out pad.  Though my daughter didn't really care about its aesthetics, I liked the pattern on the changing pad.  Its surface was smooth which made it really easy to clean.  Most importantly, it had nice padding that kept my daughter comfy while I went about the diaper business.  The padding wasn't very thick, but it seemed to be effective against hard surfaces.  Also, I liked the size of the changing pad - I found that there was plenty of room for baby. The case had plenty of areas for storage for its size.*  Quality - Mine held up very well with frequent use over time.  I saw other reviews that indicated quality problems and that's too bad.  I bought mine in Fall of 2007, so perhaps the company changed manufacturers or materials that led to some shoddiness.Cons*  Price - I chose this over other, similar on-the-go diaper bags because I thought it had better styling and I thought the set-up was a little more functional.  That being said, it was pricier than most others - sometimes significantly.  It could probably be cheaper.*  Size - I'm not sure this is a con, but some people would probably find that it's just too small.  The opening for the wipes is a tight fit.  I never had a problem with it and never considered it a problem.  Some have noted that you can fit fewer larger diapers vs. infant-sized diapers.  Well, yeah.  Just like you get fewer #4 diapers vs. newborn diapers in a package of the same size.  I don't see this as a negative, as by the time my daughter was wearing #4 size diapers she was also going less frequently and more predictably than when she was in the infant size.  One of the things I liked about this changing bag was that it was small; if I wanted something that would carry the same number of large-size diapers, I would just have lugged around my backpack-style diaper bag.  Which is the point:  This is a very compact bag, suitable - in my experience - for outings that lasted hours, not days.Final ThoughtsI should also mention that I found the small plastic wipes case that came with the bag to be useless and just tossed it; travel-sized wipes packages are the perfect size for this bag and are usually resealable.  Also, getting rid of the hard plastic case saves space and adds flexibility to the bag, in my opinion.  Others may feel differently, but I didn't think the plastic case added any value.In the end, I used this bag more than any other and really liked it, and can recommend it based on that experience.  It is specialized, though, and not something that you'd take on an extended trip.  For this daddy it was perfect, but that may not be true of others.  I would rate the product five stars based on style, functionality, and size, but feel compelled to knock off a star for price.  Saving ten bucks here or there can buy a lot of wipes, you know?	
1. 	This is a wonderful product. My 14 month old loves to look at the stars on the ceiling before drifting off to sleep. This mama loves looking at the stars too! =)	
- 1	Very cute doll, but almost as soon as we got it home I noticed there was a little hole under the doll's arm that was leaking stuffing. Also, baby isn't interested in it! Disappointed--this company's toys usually seem to have very good workmanship.	
1. 	My daughter loves this toy, but when I wash it for her, water tends to get inside the spinning area of the toy. So I have to wait for it to dry before my daughter can be entertained with the spinning part. Other than that, the colors are just as pictured, perfect for boy or girl. It is great for teething. It has different textures that baby will soothe their gums with, it rattles so its another plus. It is also lightweight, so it is a Perfect toy for a baby learning how to grasp.	
- 1	Not really a fan of these.  It is nice that they bend, however the spoon/fork area is not even big enough to hold food on. My daughter couldn't actually pick up any food with these.  I'll be sticking with the other brands from now on.	
1. 	I read the previous reviews of this bag, so I decided to check it out at our local Babies R Us store.  It really is an awesome bag!  I bought it today, and switched all my stuff into it in the parking lot!  I absolutely love it.  It is very roomy, has pockets for everything, and the purse section (front pocket) is wonderful for organizing mommy's stuff!  There is plenty of room for lots of stuff--I fit 4 small board books, a soft big book, a bunch of teethers, flashcards, a rolie polie olie doll, a Wet Ones canister, my son's shoes, 2 burp rags, a nursing shawl, diapers, wipes, diaper cream, and my personal stuff (wallet, lipsticks, camera)ALL of it comfortably!  The strap is nice and wide so it feels steadier and more comfortable carrying it.  I just love it!  I wish I'd found it sooner because this is bag #3 for us, and our son is only 1!  It seems sturdy so I think it'll last awhile!!  I definitely recommend this bag!	
1. 	I think these membranes are supposed to be replaced every 3 months, but I didn't replace mine until they tore (at I think 6 months).  I bought this pack and these worked until I stopped pumping after 12 months.  These are pretty much the same thing you get with your pump originally.	
- 1	i was so excited to use this sippy cup because i use dr brown bottles. this cup worked for about three days then decided not to! horrible, the suction of the two inserts causes the sippy to close up completely rendering it useless and ultimately frustrating!! i thought i was going crazy and doing something wrong until i read these reviews! on to the next...	
- 1	I ignored the other reviews that said this product was too large for baby mouths, because it looks perfect and is after all designed to be a teether. But they were right -- the ring is way too big for my 6-month-old (he's average size). Maybe when he's two and getting in molars it will be handy, but it's going in a box for now.	
- 1	i ordered Britax foot muff for my 8 months old since winter is coming. This nicely fits in britax b-agile stroller and has agood material (looks great). Only, yet big, issue is it is so small. My daughter fits in here right now. Now it is fall here. When it is winter, i doubt she can use it. It is far shorter than its stroller. Even now it is difficult to zip if she is wearing a shoe. Just wondering why britax make it little longer and roomy. Or it should put product size. It is surely not one size product.	
1. 	We've had this turtle for four years and it's still working, which is more than I can say about a whole bunch of similar products we've tried. I love everything about it: the design, the true-to-sky constellations, the three light choices, the auto off feature. Perfect for a nursery or an older child who's afraid of the dark!Update: We let a battery leak and it killed our turtle :(It was only 5 years old and I know it could have lasted much longer!We got the ladybug version for our LO and love it as much as the turtle!The colors are different than the turtle. It lights red, purple and green (the turtle had orange, blue and green lights).The light seems to be much brighter, but it could just be that the batteries are new.We'll be sure to check them regularly to make sure they don't leak.	
1. 	What can you say? They're simple... easy to use... clear, so they're hardly noticeable. Cheap, too.  In some outlets it took a little work to get them in... but to be honest, they're outlets I don't think I ever put anything into before. And you can pull them out as long as you have at least SOME fingernails or just use a knife or similar to start it. Once started out, just pull. No brainer. You don't need to spend any more time researching this. Just get them.	
1. 	Let's start by saying I love this thing - it was easy to put on the stroller, it's easy to take off the stroller, and it zips right up to baby's chin to keep her warm.  I love it; it is exactly what I wanted.  HOWEVER, it does not attach perfectly to the Britax B-Agile stroller.  Because the B-Agile seat is attached at the top, you cannot hook the cover over it and slide the elastic down.  You have to hook it over the top of the back pad, which makes the cover less than securely in place.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.  Also, it doesn't attach anywhere on the bottom (legs area), so when you fold the stroller up, this cover is loose and it's a little annoying.	
- 1	ahhhh where do I begin.  I had such high hopes for this one.Instead of this stroller, get the bumbleride twin if you can afford it (it's totally thin enough, don't worry :), or the joovy ergo (if you have a child willing to sit/stand).Here's my review of the aria twin 2010......- SHADE: the canopies look useless in the photo but they're actually nice & come all the way down to the tray.  They don't go beyond the tray like the bumbleride twin, they go down to the side of the tray closer to the child.  I don't know why they don't show that in the photos.  the only thing is that they don't go 'out' far enough so when you pull it down all the way it goes right in front of their face.  Kids don't like that.  my kids duck their heads forward to the outside of the shade (does this make sense?  like, the kids' faces are forward overtop of the tray b/c if they sat back the shade would be right in front of their faces.  so I guess in that way the shade is useless.  Oh, and the kids' legs are exposed.- TRAY: the trays are easily removed and put back - just a button (not the same as the pliko p3 but similar).  But there's a downside... (and this is a big but) ...The tray for the 40 seat is 1 inch wide.  seriously.  it's ~10 inches long and approximately 1 inch wide.  (1 inch deep too).  so if you line up 10 triscuits, that's the width and length of the indentation in the tray.  I'm not kidding or exxagerating.  no cup holder.  the other tray (for the '60' seat is about 2 inches wide and has two tiny round sections for a cup on each end.  really?  do you think the older kid will let the younger kid put his cup on their tray?  let me answer that for you.  no.  so the trays are there which is a plus, but the design is the worst I've seen.- SEATS:  seats are straight up & down which I LOVE.  My kids don't like it when they can't sit straight up & down.  (they do recline.  they also fit big kids.  with a 4year old & a 2 year old the seats were plenty big enough.- MANEUVERABILITY:  I was hoping to be able to turn it & push it with my pinky finger (like i can with my bob revolution or my bumbleride twin).  nope.  can't.  it's fairly good steering & turning fully loaded but you still have to use 2 hands.  ...and it has that catch up where the front wheels point in one direction and you want to go in the other direction, you have to reverse it & then push it forward.  (happens with all strollers with double wheels in front).  I had test driven the 2009 version & it pulled to one side horribly (whichever side had the heavier kid).  This one doesn't.  the 2010 model goes straight ahead.  The scary part is that when you turn it, you can feel the whole frame twist like it's going to break.  you can totally tell you're pushing a flimsy plastic stroller,  (the frame is made of flimsy plastic, unlike the bob strollers or bumbleride or joovy ergo)- COLORS:  the one that looks beautiful blue and brown is not.  it is this ugly gray stripe material and brown.  there is absolutely no blue on it anywhere.  it is very ugly.  I mean very very ugly.  it would've been pretty with blue & brown but they went with gray and brown which I wouldn't wear together if I were picking out clothes.  and the gray is gray stripes.  u.g.l.y.- FIGHTING:  there is no divider between the kids so they fight & have full access to eachother.  Did I mention that the '60' kid has to share their extra cupholder with the '40' kid?  not condusive to peace.- DOORWAYS:  it fits through a door but I definitely would not take this thing to the mall & expect to get around clothing racks.  You'd be pushing and pulling the thing trying to get it to turn & it wouldn't fit anyway.- STORAGE:  looks good - I think I could actually fit some stuff down there.  I could easily and comfortably fit 2  filled paper grocery bags down there to give you an idea.  they would be easily accessable too.  storage is a plus.- HARNESS:  they kept the harness design where the 5 point part of it is not secure.  I don't know how to explain this properly - just think of it like this - there is only a 3 point harness.  this stroller does not have a 5 point harness  (it does but the top of the 5 point harness is not attached to anything so it's worthless.  which is neither bad or good, it's just an observation.  (actually it's only bad if you were hoping for a 5 point harness.- FOLDING & UNFOLDING: easy to do- WEIGHT & MATERIAL: you can lift it with one hand.  very nice weight!  ......oh, but the downside!  when you turn this stroller, the whole thing is made of plastic so you can feel the entire frame torque.  simply by turning a corner.  the frame twists & I'm just waiting for it to snap.  It won't but it feels like it will.  I don't think this stroller would last long with my use.anyhow, that's my review.  here's my take on other strollers:- gracos?  too difficult to steer- bob double?  kids are reclined & no trays & storage is hard to get to  (their trays are so poorly designed they are not worth buying)  I have the bob revolution ($450 incl. accessories, great but only takes 1 kid & no useful cup holder (I bought the cup holder & it's worthless & the seats don't sit straight up)- jane powertwin?  great for kids under 1 year old but the seats still have to be removed to fold it- baby jogger same problem as bob - kids are reclined  (& they don't  have good trays)- kolcraft tandem?  $200, it's a beast. super super heavy & you have to take the seats off (difficult) every time you fold it- peg perego pliko p3 ($350, still use it but hard to steer),- joovy caboose triple stroller ($400, too big for our suv - have to disassemble it for it to fit)my 2 favorites are the joovy ergo sit & stand (i wrote a review on that one on amazon) & my favorite  (which is the most perfect stroller I've ever tried & the only one Ill ever need) is the ridiculously expensive bumbleride twin (I wrote a review for that one too).	
1. 	I got a bedding set from ABC and the jersey sheet it included was great.  I wanted to order extras and came to Amazon, only to find there are two choices:  regular and value.  The price is about $5 difference.  I went to ABC website and their PDF product info didn't even list any real variation in the specs... so I ordered both.  The differences is in the weight/thickness.  I could immediately tell the regular sheet package was thicker, but I got nerdy and decided to weigh them.  I took the sheets out of the package and weighed them on my digital scale.  Here are the results:ABC Value Jersey Crib Sheet - 8.3ozABC Jersey Crib Sheet - 9.5 oz  (this is the one I'm reviewing here)The difference was visible when I put my hand behind a single layer of fabric.  I could see through the Value Sheet much more than the standard.  Both are really soft though, so if $$ is an issue, the value sheet would still be a lot softer than most other baby crib sheets I've run across.  I just think the standard will be a little plusher in the long run!  It really does feel like a soft old tee shirt.  Recommend!	
- 1	The baby really didn't play with it at all. I'm hoping he will grow into it, but he's 8 months now and he still doesn't use it, even if I play it for him.	
- 1	I wouldn't recommend these unless you have a much older baby or need to add a lot of cereal to bottles.	
1. 	Royal blue was just what i was looking for, the jersey knit is soft. I washed it before I put it in my sons crib, it held up just fine, hopefully it will continue to hold up with future washes. Fits mattress well, I plan to buy more of these. UPDATE, I just bought two more of these, make sure you do not wash them with other items the first time. You can wash more than one sheet but do not add other items, as the blue color will wear onto other fabric. I will update after my son has actually used them.	
1. 	I bought this to replace the bad changing pad included in my diaper bag. I won't disclose the name or brand of that diaper bag because that's not what this product review is for. This product review is for the First Years Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit.They call it a kit but it's really just a foldout changing pad. There's a small zippered pocket with a place for those wet wipes but no one buys it for the zippered pocket. We bought it for the pad.It folds nice and is a great color for The Boy. The only issue is that the day after we used it for the first time we went to a thrift store and found the same product for half the price. It was used, but by that time so was the one we had just purchased so we could have saved a couple bucks.But that's not the product's fault, that was just a digression.	
1. 	Baby sleeps through the night with this!  We have been using Halo's since our baby was born.  The sleepsack recreates a womblike experience for the baby and he also cannot hit or scratch his face with his arms swaddled.  He also has enough room to kick his legs.  The puppy dogs are cute & the material is soft.  Our baby started rolling over, so we had to start putting him in a long-sleeved onesie and leaving arms out.  It is nice to still be able to use the sleep sack for both swaddling arms in & then letting the arms be out after he started rolling over.  This keeps him nice & warm at night especially during cold WI winters.  Good product!	
1. 	Have had for almost 2 years and we use it all the time.  Great to have for little ones to keep them out of the sun.	
1. 	Got it for my wife who is a side sleeper and was having a hard time sleeping due to pregnant tummy. She is very happy with this pillow and says it provides plenty of support.	
- 1	I do NOT understand why anyone likes the Boppy for nursing.  I am a pretty small woman (about a size 8) and I found that the donut-hole in the middle was so small it buckled in the front when I tried to put it around my waist.  Not only that, but it really needs to sit around the hips in order to be low enough to rest the baby on -- and that never worked, it just kept riding up to my waist. And because it's so round and puffy, I had to use just as much muscle to keep my baby from rolling away from me as I would have to hold him up!  I tossed it in the closet and used regular bed and couch pillows instead.  Also, I couldn't use it in any chair with arms (like a rocker or a dining-table chair because the big fat arms of the Boppy got in the way of the arms of the chair.	
- 1	Wish I would have listened to the reviews... this mattress pad cover is far too narrow/ small to fit either of our Pack N' Plays... disappointed.	
1. 	I was looking for something different than your typical stacking cups for my sons birthday.  His aunt got him these.  What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.  They also have the function of just being play cars, which is nice.  I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!	
1. 	We've been using this since our baby was a week old, and he's really starting to enjoy it.  For the first couple of weeks we just used the vibrations to help him sleep, but he's now (at a month old) starting to watch the lights and bubbles.  A great buy, and I love having somewhere for him to nap in our living area.There are 2 battery compartments: one (takes 1 D-cell) for the vibrations and one (takes 3 D-cells) for the toy bar.  The battery lasts a surprisingly long time for vibrations-only, but the toy bar drains them within a couple of days (when using 1-2 hours a day) so get 2 sets of rechargeables!The only thing I really don't like is the design of the battery compartment.  You can't change the batteries while the baby's in the seat: you have to unbuckle the cover from underneath, and use a Philips screwdriver to open the hatches.  But apart from that, it's been a sanity-saver!	
- 1	I received this 5 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.  I loved how the birdies were projected onto the ceiling and I loved how sweet the music sounded. It wasn't too loud and my son loved it. After he outgrew it I took the batteries out and stored it carefully. Now that my second child is due to be born in a few weeks I took this soother out of the closet and put new batteries in it. The only thing that works is the music and lights. The birds no longer move and the light show does not project. Such a bummer. They just don't build things to last anymore. So while it did last for about a year with my first child it no longer works and I don't know why. I just think these baby items should last through more than one baby.	
- 1	$8 for one pacifier clip? I thought it came with 2 so that's why I got it. I could have gotten a cheaper one that works just as well. I didn't read the reviews on here before purchasing (I usually do so I'm kicking myself now) so be warned that the picture that shows 2 clips is just showing each side of the single clip.	
1. 	I had previously purchased another tub because it was a few dollars cheaper but soon regretted it once received. The tub had two pouches to but the soap and shampoo. But the one thing i needed was a drain. The dirty water built up and the only way to get it out is to tilt it up so it can pour out. Such a hassle while washing a 9month old. Not with this one though. I can fill the tub up for him to play and splash and allow it to drain out when its time to wash. Great, so my son don't soak in dirty water which he does pee in.	
1. 	I gave these 5 stars because they are soft and well designed. However my baby doesn't like them but it is my own fault for not reinforcing the pacifier soon enough so I bought these to try them, hoping that my baby would magically take it. It might work for your baby, go ahead and buy it and they are very affordable.	
- 1	This stupid (not inexpensive) monitor just stopped working after a couple weeks of use. We only just began using it regularly when our infant moved into her own room and out of the blue, as we are about to go to bed, the sound just stops working.Now thanks to Motorola we have no working monitor overnight.	
1. 	Each time i open and have a warm wipe in between my hands, i feel better and glad or this purchase. Before having it, my daugther was shaking when i cleaned her with a cold one. Now, we r enjoying to change diapers	
1. 	Love this gate! When hubby bought it, I assumed we would be returning it and buying a better one. But was very surprised how well it works for our family. We have one installed to wall downstairs to separate rooms/at at times dogs locked in kitchen area. It is very solid even when partially locked, and the whole opening/closing/locking operation can be done easily/swiftly while holding baby and other items in your hand (I do it all day long). and then we have a loose one at top of stairs that we can hand carry to top/bottom of stairs (again I was sure we'd be returning and looking for something else). It is again strong - I can put my entire weight forceably against locked gate and it does not budge - and it can easily/quickly be installed with baby in arms, one handed.	
- 1	This really didn't work for me.. Looked bad, would fall down.  I have a Land Rover and the Roller Shade works so much better, and looks so much better.  This item is more appropriate for pickup truck windows because they are smaller.	
1. 	Yes, sometimes it overheats the bottle if you don't take it out as soon as it's done, but it gets the job done quickly and easily.  And at this price, I was able to buy a warmer for both grandparents' houses.	
- 1	I have leather headrests in my car and this product slipped all over the place. It never stayed put while driving. I also hated the installation design and directions. You can only loop it around one way (over/under) and it is just slippery on the leather.  There isn't a way to stabilize this mirror. I returned it and am trying one by britax back seat mirror that has way more features and costs the same on amazon.	
- 1	I contacted Dr. Brown's the first time the cap snapped off my formula dispenser. (I sent the broken one back to &#34;quality control&#34;). They sent me a new one and after a few months of daily use, it snapped off again. I'm going to try another brand dispenser. I don't like the short munchkin type dispensers, the tops are hard to get off to refill and I like the tall, skinny design of Dr. Brown's. Not sure what to try next. :-(	
1. 	I received one of these as a gift, and it took me a while to open the product - I had planned to use theBaby Bond Flex Nursing Sash with Removable Burpcloth, Night, Large/X-Largebecause it is supposed to cover the boob rather than the baby. After eventually opening the apron-style Bebe Au Lait, washing it, and tossing it in the baby bag, I can't imagine trying to use the boob-covering sash.My husband jokes that this cover is a giant napkin, as it catches the spills which inevitably result from eating pasta and burgers with my non-dominant hand. I looked for another cover so I could have one in the wash to remove the evidence. After considering other brands available on Amazon, I got another Bebe Au Lait. Here's why:- The terry pads at the bottom give it a little weight to keep it from blowing in the wind. I haven;t used them as pockets or burp wipes yet but see how they can be handy.- The viewing window support has stood up to repeated washings and being folded/twisted to put it in the baby bag- The buckle on the neck strap stays in place - size once and don;t worry about it after washing and using several times.- It's available in subtle patterns. Having a big apron across me is a big enough advertisement that I am feeding my baby - I don't need lime and pink paisley drawing extra attention to that fact. The mosaic pattern is primarily white and brown, and reads like brown or gray from a distance. My other cover has a pattern of abstract flowers drawn as a white line on a gray background, which I also like.Based on reviews, other covers seemed less robust and made of lighter materials.The cons of this product are the same as any apron-style nursing cover:- it can be moved by the baby (I don't think Baby Bond would be immune to this based on how my baby grabs my clothes)- It gets hot in the summer - babies are little space heaters. I minimize this by moving the cover off my baby's bottom half, covering only his head and my boob, and holding the cover out for some air ventilation- It doesn't hide your back, so if you nurse bottom-up (like pulling a t-shirt up) it can leave your back exposed. I don't care most of the time, and use Nursing Tank By Undercover Mama or a top which allows top-down access in situations where I care.- People standing behind you could theoretically see in, especially if you're seated. Honestly, I don't care. I use a cover to respect other people around me by not blatantly flashing my boobs. If a passerby happens to catch a glimpse in once baby is going, they don't see anything they couldn't see at the beach or in a Victoria's Secret ad. If they have a problem with this, it's their problem, not mine!- It doesn't have a L/R reminder feature, which I don't care about at all. I only use this while out, not at home, so keeping track on the cover doesn't make sense.I'm glad I ended up with this instead of the Baby Bond: it reliably covers your nipple for latch-on, is easy to put on and take off, and doubles as a SuperMommy cape.All the best to you in your breastfeeding journey!	
- 1	There is really no reason why you should have to replace these bags, other than they make them that way. They could easily make bags that dont need to be replaced, but there goes a lot of money soo....do not buy.	
1. 	These work great with standard bottles. I like that I can order them online with amazon prime so it avoids a trip to the store just for 1 small item.	
1. 	It is awesome, because my back says thank you... It is so convenient, I recommend so much... Really I do...	
1. 	This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)	
1. 	I love the Svan chair...and now that I have the cushion, my 6 mth old is as happy as can be. The cushion is quite thick and cushions her well. I haven't washed the cushion yet, but hopefully it will be easily washable.	
- 1	Do not buy these bottles unless your babies can absorb formula through their skin. The lids leaked within just one week. Further, the bottles are not finely graded, so when you are trying to keep track of how much a newborn is eating, it's not very accurate. The leaking was the most annoying thing to deal with on top of everything else. I recommend Dr. Brown's starter set instead.	
1. 	This is great! It's so much nicer than the hard plastic tubs. My 6 month old doesn't slide around in this and it's easy for me to rest my arm on the tub while washing her. (Couldn't do that with the plastic tub.) Easy to fill up and easy to clean up. It even has a suction cup so it doesn't slide around in the tub. (I also use that for hanging up so it dries out after every bath.) This tub just makes bathtime much easier!	
1. 	If I could I would give it 6 stars! Boy do I love this chair!We are urban, minimalist, no nonsense people. I always dreaded the ugly plastic baby chairs I used to see at other people's houses. So we registered and got Eddie Bauer wood highchair for our baby shower. One word of advice - don't buy products such as chairs until you meet and get to know your child.We set up the EB chair and realized right away what a mistake it was buying it. It was gorgeous but totally unsafe and difficult to use. It had 1 point harness, the strangest contraption I've ever seen. We could imagine our kid hanging off the chair in a year or two. So we took it back and after much research and testing, we chose Malawi. We are so happy!1) We got both the vinyl and cotton covers, so when the baby is small we can use cotton, than later we'll move on to vinyl.2) Malawi has the wheels so we can move the baby with us when we're cooking, cleaning, or just moving out and about. We can even take the baby to our deck when we dine outside. EB chair was VERY heavy and no wheels so I had to lift or drag - a major pain in the you know what. The wheels can be locked or omitted if you don't want this feature.3) Unlike hard, uncomfortable EB chair, Malawi gives the plush, armchair type dining experience for our 8 month old kid. We put the cotton cover on top of the vinyl so it's extra padded and comfy. I used to have to put rolled up towels on both sides in order to keep our baby upright.4) Malawi reclines, where EB doesn't. Major plus with the tiny ones who don't sit on their own yet. Also the fact that it has different hights is a wonderful feature. We can play real low or dine real high.5) My only issue is with the tray. Tray is not really one-hand release. It's heavy and bulky and it took me some time to get used to it. Unlike Fisher Price Healty care chairs it doesn't really slide into place with one hand. However, the dishwasher tray is large and covers the whole tray which makes cleaning a snap, plus you get an extra one in the box to use when the first one is in the dishwasher being cleaned! How cool is that!Also, the tray is a bit too high for our kid, but we'll just keep it in the closet for now.6) This chair is by far the most comfortable out of all the ones my baby tested. I like that unlike Fisher Price Healthy Care chair it doesn't have reclining lever in the the middle of the head rest. Also the chair cover is longer than on any other chair. I was under the impression that Fisher Price vinyl cover sharp edging would be cutting in my kids legs.7) Malawi is very pretty green and blue color, but if you don't like plad you have a choice of solid blue or solid green covers. The 5 point harness is nice and tight and you can remove it to clean it.Hope this helps and you consider this chair.	
1. 	My daughter likes this one. She especially loves the rattle at the end and the vibrating motion. I believe this is for babies that are a little more older. I gave this to her when she was 4 months since she keeps on sticking items in her mouth.	
1. 	I initially ordered 6 of these because I decided I want to make all my daughter's food from scratch.  I just used them for the first time, and they are absolutely wonderful!  I recommend hand washing them, because some of the stickier foods (i.e. prunes, bananas) are harder to get out in the dishwasher.  I love them so much, I just ordered 6 more!	
1. 	I had a diaper Gienie when I had my first child.  We used it for first three or four months or so, but it was just too much hassle and it ended up in our garage.  When I got pregnant with the second baby, I searched the best alternative for the diaper Gienie.  These bags are great.  I use them every day to bag dirty diapers.  When my older one was going through potty training. I used thee bags in the Elmo potty as liner (portable potty) when I was out and about (yes we kept a portable potty in the car).  I will keep buying until I am done with my second child's potty training.	
- 1	I bought this and another one at our local store.I have twin babies that have had this toy since three months old. When they were three months the thing was just too heavy and they couldnt grasp it because of the rings. So i put it away and forgot about it. Now they are six month old and i gave it to them today. Its made of such a hard material, or whatever it is, that when they miss their mouth and hit themselves in the forehead it hurts them! And me (i tried like another review :). The rings around the middle just gets in the way. I will be throwing these away. Its just not a great design for little babies who are still working on their fine motor skills. Way too solid and hard for them.	
- 1	The only thing that was cute was that the baby figured out how to put the balls on top and then watch them come down. Other than that, she spent more time pulling them apart because the second one never fit right with the rest. Didn't matter what order they were in the first two never stayed with the bottom three. My 18 month old now uses the balls as shakers instead of using this toy lol.	
- 1	These bibs are cheap but you get what you paid for.  The velcro comes off easily and the loopy side is very rough and sharp.  My husband tried to take the bib off of our baby once and it slipped and gave him a bad gash on his neck!  Our baby drools and spits up a lot too and it goes right thru the bibs and onto his clothes.  It's not worth it.  We'll stick with the Carter's ones from now on since their velcros are very soft and it actually sticks.	
- 1	My daughter has the tiniest nose you have ever seen, but this aspirator tip is so small there is no suction at all. it can't create any kind of a seal at the infant's nasal opening (nurses will say don't put it up the baby's nostrils). I threw it in the garbage. You are better off with the one they give away at the hospital. Save your money on this product.	
1. 	After dealing with a couple of unsatisfactory baby tubs, I found this tub for my infant twins. It is, hands down, among the best baby gear purchases I've ever made. Can't say enough good things about this product. The smart ergonomic design keeps your baby sturdy and safe, and allows you to have both hands free for washing and grabbing bath products and towels. YOU WILL LOVE THIS TUB!	
1. 	this changing cover has worked well with our changing pad helded up in the wash from so many poopie diapers...which is a nice pad along with our changing pad (which we whip clean before use  and after use..over the pad its self (which sometimes my nephew sticks to without a oniez on!)	
1. 	My son moved to this tub when he was about 5 months old and too big for his whale tub. I love that there's the option to let them recline or sit up straight. While my son is sitting up with no problems now and can catch himself (he's 7 months) I still recline him while I wash his hair so that I can avoid getting shampoo in his eyes. I have never used the drain feature as I just tip the tub over when I'm done. This is a great tub for babies too big for the sink but too small for the real tub! I highly recommend! I also recommend theOXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue- it really saves your knees while you bathe your child.	
1. 	We love these bags!  We didn't buy a diaper pail, but instead stuff as many diapers as we can in to each of these bags and then tie closed.  It keeps our son's nursery smell free!  He is 8 months old now and we can fit 4-5 diapers into the bag.	
1. 	I got two of these for my younger boys unfortunately my 5 year old is to tall for it but I have plenty of other kids around so it will get used very handy at nap time or when we go out at the lake pop it up under a tree when one is tired or even just for them to sit on. love this product I have sat on it to make sure it will hold more then one I am about 150 did just fine didn't bend or tear very well made	
- 1	Poor design--so awkward to use with so many parts that are hard to wrangle, and yet not enough versatility.  The flanges are attached, so it's a pain to use with a pumping bra (which is a must for anyone pumping regularly).  Noisy.  The diaphragms are flimsy and didn't go back into shape within the first five times I used it, decreasing suction.  The diaphragms are also not attached and fall out when you disconnect yourself from the pump the second you lean over to handle all the dozen other parts you have to deal with for staring/stopping pumping.  Tubing is low quality.  When you take off the collection containers, they are wide open leaving you susceptible to spilling your liquid gold. Any lactating breasts I know of would not fit in the small flanges that come with the set, so you have to go bigger (spend more money).  If you have to use the inserts to go smaller than the next size up, the inserts add yet another awkward extra two pieces to the whole kit and caboodle.  It's hard to clean the whole flange/diaphragm-holder part because of small/bisected areas that you can't get a bottle brush through.  What a pain!  After using the Medela pump I rented from the hospital for the first month, I'd like to strangle the moron who designed this Ameda pump (it's the one my insurance provided).  It's so infuriating and I pump less milk with this one, to boot.  NOT looking forward to 6+ months of having to use this. Ugh.	
1. 	This is THE BEST little baby gadget yet.  The first time I saw it I thought, What will they think of next... but now that my 2 year old and nearly 1 year old are putting everything in their mouths this is an indispensable part of our home.  It's great for teething because you can stuff it with cold fruit and your baby will love sucking away while getting all the juice out of grapes, pineapple, watermelon, even strawberries!  It's great for regular feeding too, since you can now place larger pieces of food inside to give your child a taste of such things as meat, fresh brocolli, etc.  The easy to clean mesh bag does get stained pretty quickly, I tried to boil mine clean with gentle soap and water, but after just two weeks of steady use, the carrots and bananas had stained the bag permanently.  The refill package costs nearly as much as the unit itself, but it's worth the total investment for peace of mind that your baby will NEVER choke on anything they eat through this feeder.  I suggest bringing an extra along in the diaper bag -- it's a great thing to have on trips.	
- 1	We bought this and hoped it would be used for a few years.  But, I noticed the chair was squeaking when my son moved his head.  Somehow, the styrofoam came apart from the frame (the 2 buttons on the back didn't work to hold the styrofoam on).  Neither my husband nor I can recall doing anything to the carseat to make this happen.It gets 2 stars because the roller adjustment to the straps was great---when it wasn't stuck.	
- 1	these do not work. they arent snug enough to keep anything in. they are completely pointless. don't waste your money.	
- 1	This item works inconsistently.When i first got it i tested the water setting to see what i needed for my bottles.It warmed properly 2 times after that, but then the 3rd time did not heat all the way up.I increased the amount of water used to Steam the bottle.  It worked about 2 more times then again, then did not heat the bottle.This pattern kept going until i needed more then the measuring container held to heat a 3 oz bottle.  I don't want to know what it would take to heat an 8 oz bottle!Baby is waiting to eat impatiently while i steam and re steam a bottle, never knowing how much water to put in because it changes / increases with use of the product.This is a problem because the safety feature on the product does not allow you to steam a 2nd time without the unit first cooling down, which takes at least 4-5 minutes.I do not recommend.	
1. 	You get four of the brushes that are identical to the ones that came with your bottles.I gave four stars because I remain annoyed that I need these in the first place, but, other than that, you'll be getting exactly what you're expecting.	
1. 	My little Houdini baby could break out of ANY other swaddle product! This blanket was Houdini baby proof! He is no longer able to bust his arms free, and sleeps soundly through the night! This product truly is a MIRACLE blanket!	
1. 	My son is 16 months and we have been using this stroller for nearly a year.  It has fit our needs very nicely and we are very happy with this purchase.Positives:1. It is very light weight and compact.  Fits easily in our car.2. I can fold/lock and unfold it quite easily with one hand -  with a toddler on one hip and a travel bag over my other shoulder.3. My son seems quite comfortable in it and my husband, parents and I all seem to have an easy time pushing it.4. I like the 5 point harness - especially since we started using it at 6 months of age.5. I love that it does not tip backwards (even when I take my son out) when I hang a bag or two over the handlebars. Very convenient!Negatives:1. It would be nice if it reclined more.2. The material is easy to wipe clean.  However, if it really gets soiled (we brought it to a very dusty third world country for a few weeks), it is difficult to more thoroughly clean.  The fabric says it is machine washable, but the instruction manual reports that the fabric is not removable.  The washing never would have been an issue with normal use.Overall, a recommended purchase.  A great step up from the basic cheap umbrella stroller without breaking the bank.	
- 1	These are cheaper than other disposable pads...for a reason. They are the only brand I've tried which leaked through. Also, there are no sticky tabs to help keep it in place in your bra. I won't waste my money on these again.	
1. 	Originally I was thinking of buying the Playtex nurser system, but did't want to spend more money on those little plastic inserts. My baby has bad gas, and I knew these bottles would help. They have proven to be the best there is. There are a few parts to each bottle but it is easy to put together in no time. And I'd rather clean a few parts then spend more money on those plastic inserts. It practically stopped his spit-up, he's never had colic, and by using these bottles and giving him gas drops, he's got no gas, and is a happy baby! I also like how these bottles easily connect to my breast pump---they say it's best to pump into the bottle you're going to feed your baby with, I don't know why. I bought the 4 oz bottles for when he was a newborn, and now we use the 8oz bottles too. I'm trying to spread the word about how great these things are. And they aren't expensive!	
- 1	I sadly went by the weight guidelines, very, very bad idea. I bought these to use with my Flip diaper covers; however they were too big. Now I am stuck with over 24 for of these things. I boiled, washed four times AND dried twice. Afterwards, they still wouldn't fit in the diaper cover. My daughter is 16 pounds and a thin girl, I cannot image using these on her, it would be too bulky. Save your money, go with Green Mountain Prefolds. Wish I had from the start.	
1. 	Love this chair. Before our daughter started solids, we actually began using it as a seat to sit up and play in on the floor, to have her near when we ate, or for her to get a new perspective when playing under the hanging toys of her activity mat and when wanted to sit up more (instead of getting the Bumbo chair). Now we use it for its intended purpose and it's nice and compact to take to restaurants. Also, love that is not a huge eyesore that takes up too much space.	
1. 	Our little grandson loves these small, easy to grasp toys in the tub. They don't squirt all that well, but he doesn't care and loves holding and sucking on them anyway! Cute and durable, and for more than just the bath.	
- 1	The way the pocket hangs, it closes up on itself, so it doesn't catch spills very well. Stick with the OXO roll up for travel.	
- 1	As I have stated with the trainer set, they are okay if your child takes to them, just don't buy more than one set if you are not sure your child will take it. I would recommend buying one set from Target ( or some grocery stores cary Avent) and trying first. If it works, then buy more sets online. You will know within days if your child will take to it.	
1. 	Boppy's done it again!  My grandson enjoys his tummy time so much more with this great pad!  He also likes it for laying on his back and playing, too!  Great addition to his learning skills, highly recommended to all babies!	
1. 	This is the cutest hat ever! I am going to buy the larger size for this winter possibly ( if they have one for one year olds). I will say that he definitely wouldn't have been able to wear by the time he was 4 months though. It took us through the winter ( he is a January baby). So I would definitely suggest it for a winter newborn. Older babies should definitely get the size up or cut the lining maybe as someone else suggested.	
1. 	One did break eventually, but I got quite a bit of use out of them. They're the first stove knob covers that I've found to work. I also cut the backs of them a bit and use them over door knobs. They work well that way too.	
1. 	I purchased this to give my husband for his first Father's Day & he absolutely loved it! I had a hard time getting the hand print to stick with the double-sided tape & it kept falling in the frame. I was desperate for a quick solution & put some jewelry glue (the ONLY kind of glue I had) on the back of it, and it's been sitting in place ever since. I'm thinking of purchasing another one for the grandparents next!	
1. 	These little boats have turned out to be a good purchase with our grandchildren for both bath time and pool time. They are colorful and cute, and the variety makes for good play time.	
1. 	I don't like having lots of gaudy plastic toys in the apartment so this is perfect. Even more perfect because my baby loves it.	
1. 	My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.	
1. 	Very handy - I purchased this after the advice from some friends, and it's been a life saver.  Easy to pump one side while nursing, or pump right after without having to bust out my big Medela pump...makes life easier with a newborn & toddler.	
- 1	Ok, the idea is good, but the way it's made is just awful. These are supposed to be put on baby's feet - maybe on the baby that never ever moves? Is not like a real sock with a foot shape so it doesn't stay on for baby to shake. And the material is horrific.	
1. 	I love this diaper bag! Its so cute and hold just the right ammount of stuff for my 1 month old son!  I have a few other diaper bags too and i use this one because of the great storage! I like how the sides have zippered pockets as opposed to others that only have open pockets.  And this fits under my stroller just fine!AFTER USING THIS BAG ONLY A FEW TIMES THE LINER CAME UNDONE FROM THE TOP AROUND THE ZIPPER SO THE FOAM PADDING IN IT WAS COMING OUT.  GOOD FOR LIGHT USE BUT DONT PACK IT FULL OF STUFF AS I DID, THE STITCHING WONT HOLD UP.	
- 1	My 1 yo didn't care for it. Waste of money, will try again later and again with my next LO next yr.	
- 1	These covers are not efficient. Each diaper change constituted a new cover because they would get so soaked. Her pants would be wet too! I went to the Real Nappies website and was disappointed to read that I had &#34;wrecked&#34; them by not washing them properly. So I swallowed my pride and stripped them. That didn't change anything. I now realize that it wasn't me because I bought new covers (Thirsties) and I have yet to strip them (been using for 5 months).	
1. 	We bought multiples of these, just so we'd have them.  It vibrates while our little 9-month-old bites on it!  He never took a pacifier, but this toy is the closest thing--sometimes when he's screaming, this toy is the only thing that'll calm him down.  So glad we found it.  Definitely worth the money.	
- 1	Those are the nicknames we have for this bag and after reading the reviews I see I am not alone.I will start with things I like about this bag. It's great for packing for long trips and after realizing this bag isn't good for everyday we did find another use for this bag. It's sturdy and for the price has lasted a very long time. The bag is still in good condition and we haven't had issues like the rods that make up the clamshell opening poking through. We've had this bag for quite some time.Now for things we don't like about this bag. It's basically a duffle bag. The bottle holders are shallow and we've always found them falling out of the bottle holding pockets (there are two). The front two pockets can be deceiving. they look larger than they really are and hold smaller things like pacifiers, socks and diaper cream. Then there's the inside. there's no pockets to organize anything on the inside.It's so bulky we stopped using the bag for everyday within the first week. Like other reviewers have said the shoulder strap is oddly placed. It's so huge to carry around along with kids during the day. it's too bulky to hang off the stroller and it's too big to fit in a standard stroller's basket.We did find a good use for it. We store extra supplies in case of an emergency in the back of our SUV. It's perfect to store extra diapers wipes change of clothes blankets etc.I went and purchased a skip hop diaper bag (via in platinum) while it's $80 price tag might be out of the price range most people would want to pay for I went on ebay and found a great deal on one for a great discount (brand new).Columbia is another great brand. I've had friends who haven't had a lot of money to spend on a diaper bag and decided on a columbia and it has lasted through 2 babies. Several guarantee them so if something breaks or tears they replace it. With cheap bags they don't offer that, so by the time your baby is a year you might go through 4 $20 bags. That's $80 and enough for a skip hop or 2 columbia bags. I love my skip hop bag and the long journey into finally finding the perfect diaper bag that fits my needs is finally over.	
- 1	This thing is awful.  It's hard so you have a hard time positioning the baby.  It's uncomfortable, you have to hold the baby into position while trying to get your baby to latch on.  Holding your breast, holding your baby's head, and their body keeps rolling back to their back, add other pillows to get the baby to stay in position.  So frustrating!! If you have had a c-section forget it, it applies too much pressure to your abdomen.  Day 2 of being home I sent my mom out with some money to get the Boppy!  Best decision ever!	
1. 	these are much better than the 2 piece shields that came with my medela pump, they are easy to wash and very easy to use.	
- 1	My child took the newborn soothie pacifiers, so I thought these would be a good option that would eliminate the nose smushing that the big round soothie base causes. The profile of these is much better and didnt contact my child's nose, but she couldnt keep these in her mouth because the silicone on these is much stiffer than the soothie ones.We've kept trying these as my child has grown but even at 10 months she still prefers to play with these than to suck on them.	
1. 	We got the whole system, and it does the job well.  The stroller is light and easy to open and collapse.  It fits against the back of the back seat of our Vue and we bungee cord it up against the back seat to save as much space in the cargo hold as possible.  The basket beneath where the infant carrier sits is huge- tons of space for stuff.  The handle it tall enough for daddy to comfortably use the stroller (he's 5' 11). The main con is steering, especially one handed- it's tough.  But all in all, a good product.	
1. 	I must say I'm guilty of purchasing anything that has &#34;Mozart&#34; in the name, since I love classical music and Mozart is my favorite composer. But this is the best toy ever. When I bought it my baby was a newborn, so mostly I played with it. But now my baby is seven months old and absolutely adores it. Whenever he is fussy, I just give him the cube and he forgets his fussiness at once. Best toy ever!	
1. 	The size is perfect. My daughter is super long and gaining weight rapidly so the changing table on the PnP is starting to buckle a little under her and this worries me. I bought a 2nd hand changing table that is just a LITTLE too big for the pad as the pad moves around a little, but the the strap that comes with the pad buckles around the top pf the table and secures it well to keep from moving. My daughter seems comfortable enough.	
1. 	I LOVE this cover! It is definitely worth the price. Very high quality fabric that is heavy and big enough to keep squirming baby covered, yet light enough to not make us both hot.  An awesome, unique shower gift, also.	
1. 	The Regent is a big seat, and a little heavy when you are lifting it to install, but once you get it in your car, it is good and sturdy! The seat cover is fairly easy to remove and wash, and the whole seat is pretty simple to take apart if you have to clean it thoroughly, which is a huge plus if you have a vomiting kid or one prone to diaper blowouts! The biggest plus of all is the fact that the 5 point harness can be used all the way up to 80 lbs (!) so if you have a special needs child, like I do, that needs the harness a lot longer than usual, the Regent is for you! I think my petite daughter will be able to fit in this seat until she is 18! Also, I can fit two of these in my Toyota Prius back seat just fine, although I try not to take them out very often since they are so big and a little cumbersome to move around. I just leave them where they are and they do a terrific job! This seat is worth every penny!	
1. 	Pros:  -they don't leak unless baby bangs it on something hard, even then only a few drops come out.  Even if you turn it upside down, it doesn't leak because of the valve.-Fairly easy to clean as long as you don't let it sit.-Nice looking, comes in a variety of colors...some gender neutral-You can buy extra valves on Amazon for just a few dollars.  I've had my cups for about a year and still don't need new valves.-You can remove the valve completely and use the bottle for an older child.-Baby sucks it like a straw almost, it doesn't just pour out like other cups.-Very durable, my daughter throws it around like a football and it's still in good shape.Cons:-Because of the way the inside of the lid is shaped (the valve takes some room in the lid) you will ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS waste like a half an ounce of liquid.  It gets stuck in the lid and baby can't suck it out.  So that half an ounce of milk (or whatever baby is drinking) gets wasted.  But in the end this is needed so it can truly be leakproof.-There's no way to measure how many ounces you are filling in the cup, there are no measuring lines which is a little absurd.  This should be an easy fix for Playtex.  The cup is seven ounces, so minus one ounce that gets wasted, you are left with a six ounce cup (but still, it would be nice to be able to measure).Conclusion: It's a damn good cup, I've purchased several.	
1. 	I highly recommend these.  Cheap.  Works.  Come in a pack of eight.  I might get some more just to have around the house or give to friends and families whose homes we go to often.Buy them!	
1. 	I love this blanket! It's great for swaddling and for everything. I like to carry it in my diaper bag when going out just in case as another layer or to shield the baby from any rain or wind.Its a great size, great quality and worth the price of $18-$25 for this blanket. You get a lot of uses from it.	
- 1	Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.	
- 1	Worst purchase yet from Amazon. 9 mo old has a Cosco walker at Grandparents. Flies all over the place. Purchased this for home and he hates it. He knows how to get around in walker, so this one frustrates him to no end. The back wheels do not move! How do you call it a walker if the wheels are too stiff to move?I tried to remove Rubber coating hoping that would be remedy. No such luck, the wheels are too stiff to turn. Now I am stuck with this piece of junk. Alot of people reviewing, have babies too small to use as a walker. That is why review count looks so favorable. They should wait until child gets big enough to use for intended purpose. This is a joke to call this a walker. Truthful rating would be 0 stars	
1. 	This is what our nicu used on our preemie. It's the only swaddle that allows the arms to stay down without being super tight.	
- 1	I washed this book in cold water in our washer on delicate cycle. Not to label directions. Who makes a cloth book that you can't wash thoroughly, that your child will drool, chew and drop on the ground? I was appalled to see how faded the book became once it air dried. My child was sucking on the corner of that book. How much dye was she ingesting? What other substances/chemicals were in the books pages? I am not pleased with this and will not buy Manhattan Toy cloth books in the future.	
- 1	Love the idea but not practical with some Graco or Babytrend carseats. Because of the location of the carseat handles when upright the toys end up being so close to the child's' face that they cannot focus.	
- 1	It's too hard to roll and turn. Plus, I'm not sure if they are swivel wheels or not. But I do like how it's adjustable height (just the seat is not the entire walker), and how baby can stand behind and push it.	
1. 	Our daughter turned one in December and although she is still in her infant seat.  She didn't want to be in it in the stores.  We got this for her stroller to go in and out of the store.  We love it!!!  Keeps her warm and cozy!	
- 1	Sponge fell apart after 1 week's of use. Nipple brush rough and not dense, thus hard to thoroughly clean a nipple.  I would not buy this product again.	
- 1	We used the grovia liners at first, but decided to try these when we ran out because they were cheaper and had pretty good reviews. We hate them! They are so thin and soft that they basically fall apart when anything wet touches them, and we change diapers frequently. Solid material has actually broken through the middle of the liner because of the weight of it and the thinness of the material. Changing dirty diapers has become a messy ordeal, when these are supposed to simplify it. I reordered the grovia liners and will not be finishing this box.	
1. 	I received this as a gift for my first son and it worked great! There is a lot for baby to play with and look at. Pad underneath holds up well in the wash and the music is nice. I just had another son three years later and brought this out again. Looks and works like new. You can't go wrong with this.	
- 1	Doesn't fit at all. Slides right off.at the slightest touch. The opening for the water also doesn't align with the spout and you have to remove it to fill the tub.	
1. 	The lids snap on really well and it was easy to pop out the cubes of breast milk by running a little hot water over the back.	
- 1	This is the second Ergo infant insert I've bought.  I bought this one hoping it would work better than the old infant insert.  It doesn't.  Basically, if your newborn doesn't like the Ergo carrier, it's likely neither insert is going to help.  You should test the Ergo with your newborn before spending the money.My husband and I loved the idea of the Ergo carrier, as the hip belt helps alleviate back problems and is much like our packs for backpacking, so we registered for one.  But however much we like the carrier, my eight-week-old, 10.5 pound daughter hates it. I've been trying to get her into the Ergo using first the old infant insert, and now the Heart 2 Heart, repeatedly ever since she was born, but with no success. The moment I put her (in the insert) into the Ergo carrier, she starts screaming and doesn't stop until I take her out. I've watched the video for the old insert (note: there's no video for the Heart 2 Heart) and am following their technique exactly, but still she just hates the carrier.Neither insert provides enough head support for my daughter, which is why I think she screams. The Heart 2 Heart in particular doesn't work; when she's settled into it as per the instructions, the insert doesn't come up high enough to support her head, and she's not a particularly long child.  So her head flops forward when she tries to look around, which frustrates her.Both inserts feel like a bit of an afterthought -- I'm not convinced the Ergo carrier was designed with newborns in mind. Having the baby's feet out one side in the old insert seemed like a stopgap solution, and the Heart 2 Heart doesn't quite solve the issue, either.  Interestingly, I picked up a used Baby Bjorn as a last resort after having spent all this money on the Ergo and the inserts, and she likes the Bjorn, because it's stiffer and provides more support.  I think she won't like the Ergo until her head's a bit steadier; we'll go back to the Ergo then.So it's worth knowing before buying this insert that it may or may not be money well spent -- it all just depends on whether your child likes it or not, and there's a possibility she won't (as I've now seen multiple reports on various sites saying that their newborns also don't like the Ergo; wish I'd done this research before getting the Ergo and spending the money on the inserts).  It's worth waiting until after your baby is born and trying out the infant inserts before buying them.  Otherwise, you may want to hold off on the Ergo until 4-5 months.	
1. 	These things are bomb (and almost adult) proof!  And, they're the only ones I've found that work on the plugs with the rectangular openings in the face plate.	
- 1	I spent around $50 on a set of these bottles only to find they made her gas worse.  The nipples is big and hard(she was breastfed for the first three months and only took the bottle sometimes at first, now she is on all bottles). I think air was getting in around her mouth b/c milk was always leaking out of her mouth too.  Next......they are a MAJOR pain to clean even with a dishwasher.  I started using playtex nursers during the hurricane because we had no power to run the dishwasher to wash those awful things and found that the nipple is soft, smaller,  more like the breast, they don't leak like Avents if you use a playtex drop in, easy to clean and most important, her gas problem was greatly reduced.  The downside is the cost of the liners. I would buy these bottles as a last resort if all others have failed to help your child's colic problem	
1. 	I have checked out many of the baby foot print frames and this one is by far the best quality and the easiest to use. The plaster is quick to set, easy to do and looks good in the finished product. The frame is high qulity and has great clean lines. This is a great product that has been hard to find in the stores. I have two! Love them! (I have even knocked one off the wall on accident and it didn't break - they are good quality, not cheap!)	
1. 	This is the perfect pad for many uses and not just babies. Although I wish I had it when my kids were little since it is so multi-purpose.It is a great size, not too big, not too small. You can use it as a changing pad, a play pad or for those times that you want to take your baby's diaper off and let things air out but you don't want an accident to mark your bed or floor.There are many other uses beyond babies. If you've ever had surgery and you've had to sit on or lay a body part on one of those plastic, absorbent blue pads, you know how horrible they are at sticking to you. This is a great alternative. For those times that you may have 'leakage' during your period or seepage from anything, this is just right (although if you roll around a lot it may bunch up) but it is certainly good for a chair seat. It is great for an older person who is having trouble with leakage, especially for their furniture or vehicle seat.It washes up nicely and seems to be thick enough to hold a lot of moisture. But it is really soft as well.I was provided a sample for testing and review.	
1. 	Having tried both the 2-sided changing pad and this 4-sided one, I think this 4-sided one wins me over. They're probably both equally secure, but this one makes ME feel safer because the four sides make it harder for my baby to wiggle out. This vinyl pad doesn't require a cover, but I use one anyway. The length would serve us well when my son grows.	
1. 	I love this blanket!  It is nice and sturdy and does not blow away in the wind.  I use it at the park, beach, and many other places.  If the ground it wet it will not soak through.  I guess the only downside is if it gets really dirty you need to go to a laundry mat to use a super sized washer.  But usually, you can just wipe it down with baby wipes and it cleans up well.  It's a material that is slicky and repels dirt.  So just don't set it down on top of dog poop and you will be ok.	
1. 	I have two of these monitors (silver and pink) and they are great.  I love the video, especially since my twins tend to wake up quietly.  It's great to be able to check if they are simply rolling over or are standing up waiting for me to get them without having to open the door.Important to note, if you want to watch two children in two different rooms, you need two complete monitor systems. This is because the handheld monitor can only monitor one camera at a time.  You would only be able to hear/see one child at a time, and unless you wanted to spend all night switching between the two cameras, you need one monitor for each room.If you want to watch one child in two different rooms, you just need to get an extra camera.  Super simple to add a camera; just set one to A and the other to B.  The handheld monitor is set to whichever camera you want to watch.I have noticed that the pink camera seems to be zoomed in compared to the silver camera.  By this I mean that the pink camera gives me a close-up view and the silver camera is more like a wide angle view.  It's not good or bad, just something that I noticed.Here's a quick run down on the monitor.Pluses:-- Good video even in little or no light: We tested this in daylight as well as in a dark room with and without a nightlight.  The video was very clear and crisp regardless of ambient light.-- Easy set-up: It was very easy to set up the camera.  I have them sitting on shelves (with the cord out of reach of my twins) rather than mounted on the wall.  It means that I can move them from room to room as needed.-- Long battery life: I have the monitors on and plugged in over night (about 8 hours) and the charge will last all day (about 5-6 hours of actual usage).  Of course, the battery last as long if you check the video frequently.Quirks:-- Background hum: There is a hum in the background that can be annoying, but it doesn't ever obscure the audio.  The mic is very sensitive and you don't have to turn the audio up very much to hear your child well, which means that the hum is very soft.-- No volume markings: I found this annoying because the on/off dial is the same as the volume dial.  You have to re-find your volume setting every time, and if your child is quiet, it can be hard to tell if you have it set loud enough.  The way to get around this is to take a marker and mark the dial at your preferred volume setting.-- Handheld interference: If you have two handheld monitors, they can cause interference.  All you have to do, though, is turn them to different angles until the interference stops.-- Camera interference: Once in a great while there will be interference between cameras, where you can see a faint ghost image of the other video.  If you don't need both cameras on at the same time, turn off the one you're not using.  If you need both on, as in my case, simply flipping the handheld switch between A and B once or twice will remove the interference.Overall, this is a great video monitor system and I am so glad that I got it.	
- 1	I typically love Summer Infant products, but this was a dud.  I have a wooden kitchen table and could not get the suction cups to stick, thus, the mat moved all over the place-- defeating the purpose.  I even moistened the suction cups as stated by the manufacturer, but it still would not stay in place.  I threw this away and got a refund.	
- 1	1. Steady, non-slip base keeps spills to a minimum ... not even close! There is nothing none-slip about this plate - it slides all over the high-chair tray (and off it) very easily.2. Plate and ring separate for ease of cleaning ... the ring is useless at best and very annoying at worst. It is just one more thing for baby to pull off the plate and launch to the floor. Why it is detachable makes no sense at all.3. The walls around each compartment are far too low - food gets pushed together very quickly. Baby doesn't mind the food all mixed together, but the whole point of a plate with sections is that it will increase the chances of the food staying separate, despite baby's pushing it around with a spoon.This is a cute looking plate, but in my experience its functionality and usefulness are poor.	
- 1	I loved this chair at first, even though the tray didn't sit tight against my (at the time) 6 month old causing me to have to change his clothes completely after nearly every meal because stuff always slid down his bib, despite the pocket and landed in his lap. I made the mistake early on of spraying the tray down to clean it and that has caused some small spots in the corners to wear and puff up- it's particle board, a la sauder brand, not solid wood. I've also had trouble with the screws on the sides coming loose causing the foot rest to slide out and fall repeatedly- usually when the dog is trying to lick it off lol. Now I've owned it for a year or so and there are numerous nicks on the tray, both on the edge and top surface. The worst part though is that my now 18 month old has figured out how to undo the restraint- a simple push of the button and now tries to climb out and even onto the tray. I've looked over several times to see him standing up in the chair with a foot on the tray ready to fall. NOT SAFE!! If it had a more secure buckle, I would have given it 3 stars- it does look nice. But I don't think it's going to hold up for use as he grows, which is what I was hoping for. I previously had a fisher price healthy care booster which I now wish I had kept.	
- 1	While we love the original woombie, this woombie swaddler is WAY too tight for our baby who is 8 pounds.	
- 1	Pros: Out of the box, it does not off gas like the Baby Care play mat out. Also thicker than the Baby Care play mat.Cons: Punctures quite easily. Graphics not as cleanly printed as the Baby Care play mat.It is going back to Amazon and I will order another Baby Care play mat instead.	
- 1	These are easy for adults to open doors, and it seemed like it kept my 2 year old from opening doors because for her, it just spun aroudn the door knob, and she couldn't get purchase. So she figured out how to hit it repeatedly until it came off the knob, on day two. End of story.	
- 1	My breastfeeding and pumping has been a painful experience (with many issues from blocked ducts, mastitis, thrush, vasospasms, milk blisters). In general my breasts have been extremely sore (our baby is now five months and they are still sore). I was hoping to use this product to be hands free while pumping. But due to my pain, it was extremely uncomfortable and more so a hassle to put on/off. This has just been sitting in our drawer and I gave up on using it after two painful attempts.	
1. 	I bought this product after using the standard sized Medela Shield and being refered by a nurse.  If you have larger breasts/areolas, this is the product for you!  I had to pump exclusively with my son, and if I hadn't bought these shields, I wouldn't have been able to do it due to pain and low supply.  This not only increased my supply, the comfort it provided allowed me to pump for many weeks exclusively.	
- 1	I put it under bed for my infant son and he just went right off it. pointless item. I just wanted something to have where his head is a little more up. going to have to find something else.....	
1. 	Folds up so easily!  I have used in the house, at friend's house, in the grass, on sand, it goes everywhere!  Easy to simply wipe off.  Handle is nice for carrying.  Fits in bottom of my Bob stroller.	
- 1	This is a cute idea, but the execution and overall usefulness leave much to be desired.  My daughter purchased this when her son was transitioning from his infant bathtub to an inflatible tub that would fit in the regular bathtub.  She thought this shower spray would help with the bathing process and that it was cute.  Although difficult to attach to the faucet, the Sassy did fit onto the 20 year old fixture and did not leak.  The spray was not forceful which was a positive as her son got used to being bathed in the big tub.Unfortunately, that tub in which the Sassy was being used was the one in the guest bathroom.  Thus, whenever she has guests the Sassy Shower Spray must be removed from the faucet or the pressure from the main shower head would blow it off the faucet and cause damage to the Sassy.  Additionally, there is the question of durability since the Sassy must be removed and put back onto the faucet repeatedly.  It is plastic and does not feel particularly sturdy.I would suggest purchasing one of the hand-held shower heads on Amazon rather than the Sassy Shower Spray.  Those products are of higher quality construction, do not require removal for someone other than the baby or child's usage, and provide greater value for the consumer.  However, if your infant or small child is the only person using a particular bathtub or if you need something to fill an Amazon order so that you get free shipping, this might be something you consider.  Otherwise, there are much better products on the market.	
- 1	I should have checked the reviews before buying. Most reviewers only have this 1 review. Hmmm... Anyways, the holes are too big and too many for young infants. My 5 1/2 month old put it in her mouth, nibbled once, then gagged. I tested it and found that quite a bit comes out. I can just squeeze the feeder and see too much gushing out. It's  good portion for babies used to solids, but not for ones being introduced to solids. Maybe for an older infant it might be better? Grandma noted that the gagging might also be due to the length of the silicone portion (too long). The length would be fine if the width was wider. The width is about an inch...ummm that means babies can shove the whole thing in their mouth. I truly don't suggest this for 4 months and up like stated in the product description...more like 7 months and up. Pros: It's a good concept. It was easy to clean. Daughter held it easily in both hands. Hope that helps with anyone considering to purchase.	
1. 	small, lightweight. easy to clean. Couldn't ask for more from this seat. it's great for trips to my in-laws and restaurants so my son doesn't have to use the nasty ones that are never cleaned at restaurants.	
1. 	I put this crib together within 40mins - comes with easy to follow instructions. It is a sturdy and great looking piece of furniture for the nursery. I bought the Espresso alongwith the 6inch Da Vinci mattress and is definitely a worthy investment :)Preferred this over the Da Vinci Emily crib as other reviewers mentioned the gap between the top bars in the Emily crib where little ones usually get their hand stuck. The design of the Kalani crib does not have that gap which will hopefully alleviate that issue in the future.	
- 1	Having twins, I have washed a LOT of bottles & gone through several different kinds of bottle brushes.My husband & I purchased this thinking it looked neat, brush would last a long time, attached nipple cleaner.Now I will go over each part of this item and explain what I like and do not like.The Silicone BrushPRO- I think it will last a long time and not wear out as regular brushes do.PRO- It doesn't scratch anythingPRO -The brush itself is easy to clean since it is siliconeCON- Being silicone it does NOT clean well. If you have anything dried on you will either have to let it soak or really give it a good scrubbing before it comes cleanCON- it does not lather well with soap, I am constantly pouring on more soap because the silicone will not hold soapThe Soap DispenserThere are no Pro's considering it does not work. I fill this thing up but the soap only comes out of the tip and it is not enough to build up a lather to clean. I have to pour soap onto the brush on a regular basis. It also leaks, no matter what way you put this thing if you have soap left inside it is going to leak out. I lay it flat and it leaks out the bottom.Nipple BrushHad it actually stayed attached it would have been kind of convenient, however in the beginning when it was attached we realized having a seperate nipple cleaner is easier. This one swivels and just seems more of a pain to clean than if it were a seperate piece. With only a couple weeks of use the nipple brush started coming loose so it would come out while we were cleaning the nipples or would twist so we could not twist it in the nipple to clean it. Finally we took it out and held the tiny sharp nub but that was too much of a pain. Now we just flip our nipples inside out to clean them.So, don't waste your money. I recommend the Philips Avent Bottle Brush but I'd recommend getting a seperate nipple cleaner since the attached one doesn't work very well. I also do NOT recommend the brushes with the sponge on top, they wear out & fall apart easily, plus sponges hold TONS of germs! You should buy 2 of the Philips Avent Bottle Brushes because they are great for regular dishes as well.	
1. 	These tweezers are a far more useful tool than those disgusting snot suction things! You have to be quick and precise with these but they do the trick. The tips are small enough to fit into a newborn's nose and blunt enough that if you do touch skin or nose it doesn't hurt. The tweezer is the length of a normal tweezer so it fits nicely in my hand. It is easy to clean and you don't need any filters or hoses. The only downside is I could imagine the tip breaking off if I dropped it enough times since it's plastic. On the other hand, you wouldn't want metal in the baby's nose anyway.	
- 1	Seems to be good quality, but wouldn't stick to our wood dining table - I tried wetting the suction and still no luck. It's been sitting in a drawer since we got it.	
- 1	wanted this to BE THE BAG. but it was not 2b. too small for tall bottles. its small is size, would fit 2 small bottles maybe 3. the willow teal design is nice. and its a little too shiny for my taste tho.	
1. 	For our review, we choose the Twilight Turtle Nightlight. This is a wonderful choice for babies and even older children. He is an adorable little plush turtle with a hard shell. Kids can play with him by day, and at night he turns into something truly amazing. A night light that not only keeps all the scary monsters away, but turns your child's bedroom into a whole new world. The back of the turtle's shell has a star and moon pattern and when the light are out, that pattern is reflected on the wall or ceiling. You can choose between white, green and blue stars. My  toddler was amazed by it, and even my older kids loved it.***I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review on my blog, New Age Mama***	
- 1	I washed this blanket before using.  After washing it was not the soft pretty blanket I bought.  It is a &#34;lint grabber&#34; on the brown hem.I would not buy it again.	
1. 	This item is great for taking on the go--restaurants, playdates, friend's houses... I don't have to worry about plates being thrown on the floor or food getting all over a potentially dirty table. It sticks to almost all of the tables we've used it on and is difficult for my 15 month old to pull up--though he can if he really wants to. It's large enough to cover a nice size area but still rolls up easily and the material is easy to wipe off and take home to be washed. But it is not dishwasher safe and because of the suction cups, it's like trying to wash an octopus in the kitchen sink. I wish I could throw it in the dishwasher, but I understand that this just won't work with this great material. Also, don't cut on it. I made that mistake and easily cut the mat.	
- 1	I'm disappointed. I got these for our baby shower and loved the idea of an all-in-two system where I can swap out the inserts. There were a couple problems. First, the flap that holds the insert is very short, only a couple inches, so with a squirming baby it will be tough to get the insert to stay in place. Second, after one wash under normal cycle, the nylon on the flap (which holds the insert in place) had ripped. The rip is going to get larger each time I stretched the diaper, so these will be useless after a few uses. I think I'll try other systems b/c the quality of this one is really lacking.	
- 1	I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not.  They do not &quot;grip&quot; our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit.  We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners.  They advised us the us to use shelf liner.  I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner.  It works the same and is more attractive.	
1. 	Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It's basically like a really high deadbolt.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this food mill, having purchased it after reading many reviews of this and similar products.I remember a reviewer writing that the space between the grinding disk and the bottom of the plunger was too large when fully collapsed (you push one piece into the other to push food towards the grinding disks).  This is exactly correct.  I tried to puree a small portion (1/2 a pear) and nothing came out except juice!  All the fruit was stuck below the disks.  Since my goal in getting this was the be able to puree small portions on the go it was no good for me.  I returned it.I gave it two stars because it might work better if pureeing larger portions and the components themselves seem well made albeit poorly designed.	
- 1	Interior foam compressed significantly to one side after two months of a newborn sleeping on it causing the baby to move to that side.  Once material compressed it was worthless and we replaced with a natural latex mattress.	
1. 	This is an excellent size, easy to clean and very pretty. I use it to take my baby to the park and sit on the grass! It folds easily and becomes like a hand bag.	
1. 	I purchased these after reading the reviews on how hard they are to remove so I was not too surprised by how hard they are to remove - lol. You just need to figure out how to take them out and find a gadget that can help depress the safety - a screw driver works well for us. We bought two types, put these in the areas our son has a lot of access, and on outlets we dont use much. We used a cheaper, easier to remove style on the other outlets.	
- 1	We have a convertible crib that is barely a year old and this does not fit at all - the ties are way too short.  I already stupidly threw the package away and now I am stuck with an item I can't use.  I will add that it doesn't smell and seems of decent quality - but they should make the ties longer or add that they do not fit all cribs.	
1. 	My little munchkin wasn't much for food, but the baby safe feeder was a great way to get her to taste more foods.  I freeze baby food in BPA free trays, and then I can pop a cube in the feeder, and she'll suck on it.  Then when I try to feed her the real food, she's more receptive because she's familiar with the taste.  Great product!	
1. 	love these! a wonderful staple once baby starts solid foods. we were able to bring a cup, bowl, and spoon to each grandparent to keep which is much easier then transporting it every time we visit. perfect price too! i highly recommend!!!!	
- 1	I returned the first one because the loop that goes over the hanger got tangled up and stretched out and the plastic bar in the self sealing opening broke through the fabric after just 1 wash.  I LOVED this at first and left a glowing review on the company's web page which, I regret.  I have only washed this a few times as to prevent wear and tear on it yet, with each wash, the &#34;self-closing&#34; flaps become weaker and it no longer self-seals so the stench comes out anyways, making this useless and not at all worth the $35 I paid for it.  I loved the color and was excited that it matched my sons room deco but, I have since had to move it to the laundry room to keep the stink at bay.	
1. 	This playyard is very spacious and easy to use. It is simple to set up and take down and easy to move around. The instructions recommend that you set it up as a hexagon or octagon for the most stability and thats what we did. There is enough space in this for my toddler and a lot of her large toys! It's definitely worth the money	
- 1	I wanted to block off a wider area that leads to my kitchen so I bought this extra wide span gate. I own the shorter Regalo gate and really liked it. This is basically the same gate but includes extensions. The problem here is that the extensions don't work very well. They are linked by metal rods that are very weak. My toddler can just truck through this gate like the Incredible Hulk and it'll separate at the links. Regalo should just make a larger one-piece gate for those needing a wider solution.	
1. 	My son really likes this but it is so heavy that I won't put it on his car seat while driving. So I clip it on his play mat.	
- 1	Great idea in theory but very faulty design. Soap leaks from both ends of the brush and makes a mess. The no scratch bristles are nice, so I will continue to use the brush, just without adding soap to the dispenser.	
- 1	I love the idea of these but the execution is terrible. We have tried everything to keep the lid on and nothing at all works. We're going back to the clunkier one we have that's a little more difficult to get the snacks out of, but the bonus is that the lid stays put. And that we don't have quite as much spillage.	
1. 	This unit is ideal for organizing a small space and keeps everything that I need for a diaper change at my fingertips. It's the must have item that I hadn't considered until I started using it. The design and quality of the plastic is very good and I like the fact that the side compartments are detachable. I even bought the wipes warmer to go on top of it. I highly recommend this product.	
1. 	Love these pads.  Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside.  They ar small, yet absorbant.  I have had them leak but only when they got really wet.  I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets.  Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.	
1. 	I love this item. We keep it next to our bed because my daughter will not sleep in her crib. The changing table is great, along with the storage at the bottom. Not hard to put together. I did it myself in about an hour. It is very pretty and convenient to be able to carry baby around.	
1. 	Keeps my son covered up during the night when he tosses and turners. Like that it opens from the bottom. The fabric is soft and strong. Washes great. Wish there were more vibrant colors.	
1. 	I like the Bumkins bibs with the sleeves that tie in the back better, but my hubby prefers to use these. These bibs velcro in the back, and the baby can rip it off pretty easy, which defeats the point. I wish these ones tied, then I'd give it 5 stars.	
1. 	I own this cover in Eyelet Black, and it's awesome.  I have used others Bebe Au Lait covers, and I would specifically recommend Eyelet Black for two reasons.  1) The lighter colored ones allow light to pass through.  My daughter is incredibly curious, and she got distracted when could see shadows and suspected that something interesting was going on outside.  With the black one, it's not an issue.  2) There are two layers, the top of which is embroidered.  Because of this, it's thicker and more stiff than the other fabric options.  That means that it keeps the shape.  When I used a different cover that had been lent to me, it sometimes collapsed a bit and covered her face, which she and I both disliked.  I suspect that Eyelet Ivory would be just as good since it's also lined, but I haven't tested it.  I have never felt like it was too hot under the black cover (even in summer), but I didn't spend a lot of time nursing in direct sunlight.  The size of these covers is good -- large enough, but manageable.  In a pinch, we've used it to cover her stroller and to keep her warm.  The only issue I ever had is that my daughter will sometimes grab the fabric and pull it aside to see out, but I don't think that could be avoided with any cover.  She's just too nosy!	
1. 	Our baby likes to wiggle and kick - a lot!  With the sleepsack, we don't have to worry about baby wiggling and getting caught  underneath a blanket.  The 100% cotton one keeps him just warm enough in the summer/airconditioned room, without being too hot.  And it still gives baby enough room to kick-kick-kick!	
1. 	I purchased this for use while my grand daughter was visiting.  The bed rail was easy to assemble and fairly easy to install, I was putting it on a double bed so I needed help moving the mattress.  As an adult I found it uncomfortable to sleep with because the feet are a higher profile so that the rail itself can slide into them and 'hide away'.  I did not have a comfy nights sleep with it installed.  However, this would be fine on a child's bed but should I ever need to purchase another bed rail, I would not select a 'hide away'.	
- 1	I bought this on a whim and and now I know why I love reading reviews and value their input.  I wish I would have read about this thermometer.  It does not read the same temp. from using any of the different methods.  It also does not read the same temp. when I use one method and test mine or the babies temp. a few times in a row.	
- 1	I love the Aden and Anais Muslin blankets - but I just don't get these bibs.  They're not at all absorbent which is my number one requirement for a burp cloth/bib.  When my daughter spits up on to them the stain just sits on top and the cloth remains wet for some time.  I can't reuse the cloth in that same spot or it just smears around whatever I'm trying to wipe up.  For the same price I bought a slew full of cheap,  prefolded diapers which are thick, super absorbent and last through several feedings.  Granted these are far more fashionable, but basics first, Aden & Anais.  I'll pass.	
- 1	I absolutely love the idea of a duffle type diaper bag for cloth diapers. However this one is entirely too small. It is not a deluxe. The material is great but it only holds 4 diapers at max. Also I would prefer it came in other colors than white.	
1. 	This guard has been fantastic.  Our stove has cast iron grates that get really hot when we cook.  After my child started walking I was really nervous they were going to reach up and touch the grate - not now!  These apply really easy with double sided tape that is included and have withstood the heat.  Come off really easy out of their brackets to clean.  Would recommend if you want a little extra security around the stove!	
1. 	I love this product it keeps my son safe. I enjoy how I can reach my skinny fingers into it unplug one thing and still leave it in the power strip cover but my son can still not get into it at all. It has been great to have especially now for all the Christmas lights we have going on.	
1. 	We  have used  this edging  and corners  on several  pieces of furniture.  It serves it purpose well.  However, our son just started pulling  the trim  off so we  have  had to replace the adhesive a few times.  Overall a  good product.	
1. 	This little guy is an adorable addition to our bathtub.  With the cup, ledge and his fingers/toes, its a wealth of storage!	
1. 	I tried this a few times when I first started breast feeding, and it worked much better than the boppy.  Eventually it just became easier for me to find a recliner with arms on it, and use that.  Pretty soon I was breast feeding standing up anyway.  This nursing pillow is great in the beginning, but eventually, you put it away for the next child!	
- 1	I did not expect this bibs to be so small. I thought they would be the standard bib size. However these were small lengthwise.	
1. 	We had been letting my son fall asleep with us in a family bed, but after a year of this... my husband and I decided it was time to at least let him go to bed earlier than we did so that we could have some alone time.  Putting him down in his crib (in our room) didn't work... he'd cry and cry.  Enter the Leap Frog Dreamscapes Soother.  After about two nights, he stopped crying when being put in his crib... because he was looking forward to the Goodnight Toes story.  I only wish we had bought this sooner.  Thanks Leap Frog!	
1. 	My husband and I love this tub. So roomy and it's very clean/sleek looking! Our son was very cramped in his smaller tub at just 4 months of age! His toes would reach the end of the tub! My son is in the 90 percentile for his height & 60 percentile in weight.Now the reason why I gave it 4 stars: It is not ideal for newborns because it doesn't come with a hammock. From 0-4 months, the smaller tub was great for our son. It also allowed us to bathe our son standing up because the smaller tub fits on top of the kitchen sink. This tub does not. If you have a smaller baby, I don't recommend this for your newborn! In my opinion this is more ideal for babies who are 14lbs and up!	
1. 	Are you ever at a party, and wish that you could see adults fumble with a baby gate and look foolish?  Its always hilarious!  Then buy this right now, dont even think about it.  Don't go look in your bank account to see if you have the correct funds, just stack it on top of your growing credit card bill and GET THIS GATE; I cant recommend it enough. Seriously it keeps nonsense OUT: place all unwanted things in your life on one side, you get on the other.  Oooohhhmmmmmm (yoga bear) life is good.  put out the incense! thats so 90s	
1. 	i couldn't make up my mind about which rearseat mirror to get, so i ordered a few at once to try.  this was the winner.  we have a jeep, with the rear facing carseat in the center of the backseat, this was the only mirror i could position off the back drivers side passenger headrest and get a good angle to the middle of the backseat where the carseat was.  the adjustability is great with it, a much better system than the others had, if they had one at all.minus 1 star because i think the mirror could be slightly larger, or slightly magnified.  my eyes aren't that bad off, but you have to look up for a good long second to focus and really get a good look at babies face	
- 1	I was quite disappointed when I opened the package to see that the wheels are very durty and have a lot of scratched on them. What's more, there were some human hairs sticky on them. I don't know if it is a used one or what? I'm still considering to return it.	
- 1	I bought this because it stated it was BPA free.  However, when I was ready to wash it before use, I saw it has a recycle symbol 7, often used for Polycarbonate which has proven to leach BPA into its contents.  I'm unsure if that is what it is made of, but most baby products are code 5 (PP) for polypropylene which is known to be BPA free.  I was just shocked to see this.  I won't use it.	
- 1	I bought this product to use on my 14 month old's teeth. When I used it I felt like my hands had a weird film on them afterward. It didn't make me super confident about using them in my son's mouth. Other than that it's a great concept, wish it had been executed better.	
- 1	We have a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio infant seat that we purchased in 2008 for our first child. We lived in AZ so we never needed a bundle me. I purchased one with expectation of using this for our second now that we live in the midwest and I am due in December. Lucky for me a friend came to visit and I was able to dry run the car seat with the bundle me, and it does not fit in the car seat due to the wings. However, I love the cover and the snuggliness and will be attempting to modify it to fit around/ under the SIP wings. Once we removed the elastic my friend's daughter was able to recline better, but she was awkwardly sitting in the car seat at first.	
- 1	After reading about how great this kettle was, I finally gave in and bought it. At first use, yes, it was great. But after only ONE month of use, the sensor/connection between the kettle and base stopped working. I tried cleaning the base and the kettle, tried unplugging the unit and replugging, turning the unit on and off... nothing worked. Now it is just a water jug, that doesn't even keep the water warm.	
- 1	Cotton bundled up on it, just not as high quality as the pillow itself. My wife was said it was disappointing.	
1. 	One of the best things created for moms in the last few years. Definitely a must have. It makes breastfeeding so much easier, plus it has other functions like propping baby up and to introduce tummy time. I absolutely love it, and there are so many different designs or covers. Great registry item!	
- 1	its made out of cheap rough towel fabric.its better to put a soft towel on top instead of this thing.thing. i was very disappointed when i opened the package, because of how thin and rough it was. i used once and that was it..i dont like how hard is on babys face.I wish i wouldnt paid 15bucks for that.	
1. 	I use this organizer all the time!! It holds my Avent bottles perfectly.  It has a place for everything!!  I do have leaks somethings but thats only when I don't hang it over the side of the sink (duh, right).  It also doesn't take up that much space on my kitchen counter.**update**My baby is now 7.5 months old and I still use this organizer! She is now learning how to use the sippy cup and it fits on here perfectly as well!  I put the valves in the little valve basket!  I still give this bottle organizer 5 stars!!	
- 1	Only lasted a month until it started malfunctioning. Threw it away at 2 months and bought a different one. Great while it lasted	
- 1	My baby was over 8 pounds when he was born.  I had this, but found it easier to just tuck a blanket under his butt.  This is like a huge winter coat that wraps around them & you still have the Ergo around them too.  I found it way too hot & bulky.  I just took a swaddle blanket, tucked it under his butt & it worked much better!  And as he grew I could change the amount of blanket under him so it was actually adjustable.	
1. 	So easy to put on, use and take off that my two-year-old has no problem doing it by himself.  I have an oval, enlongated toilet that we use this seat on. A twist of the dial in back simply adjusts it to fit. There's no screwing and unscrewing it each time you use it... just do it once for fit.There's a different brand at church that has handles, so I thought he'd miss not having the them to hold onto. He doesn't miss them at all. In fact, if you are potty training, it's best to imitate the really thing anyways.  You're not going to find handles on a public toilet, so why train your kids to get used to them being there?The rubber edge allows it to grip the seat. You put it on there and it's not going to slip.The gentle contour of the front splash guard makes it a great seat for both boys and girls to use. It doesn't get in the way and is still functional.It does what it says and does it well. Very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	Comfy seat, baby enjoys the fish,water,music & vibration.Vibrations is quietOnly flaw is the toys come of to easily they seem to fall off everytime my son sits in the seat.	
1. 	I bought this seat based on all the great reviews and I was not disappointed. My son just turned 2 and is small for his age and he fits perfectly on this seat. What I also love about the seat is that it doesn't move once you get it on the toilet. I don't have to worry about my son slipping and sliding around as he moves on the potty. I bought 2!	
- 1	Despite the smart design of these bottles (nipple is sized and shaped similar to a breast, bottle is comfortable to hold, bottle is compatible with pumps), I would not purchase.  Invariably, there is a fast leak at the lids and a frustrating mess.  They are worthless for feeding and storage.	
- 1	As of February 12, 2014, Graco has a recall on this buckle on other car seats, but not on this model, for some reason.  Graco's spokesperson is quoted as saying that if you have this model and call Graco will still replace the buckle for you.  Ever since we got this car seat we found the buckle to be extremely difficult to unbuckle, so it is not a surprise to find that a recall has happened.  The government criticized Graco for not expanding the recall to this model.  I called the recall number to get a new buckle and a recording said that they are getting too many calls that I should call back later.Overall this system has many flaws, is very heavy, does not ride nearly as smoothly as expected, and now Graco recalls the buckle but ignores this model to the dismay of government safety regulators.	
1. 	I got this Boppy pillow half way through my pregnancy and it made all the difference in the world. I had such bad hip and groin pain from 7 months on (along with the given back pain) and this worked wonderfully! Everyone knows you don't get solid sleep the last trimester, so this made the times I did sleep much more comfortable. In fact, our daughter is 2 1/2 now and I still use it every night! I even take it on trips because I just can't sleep without it. The stuffing is very loose which has it's good and bad points, but as long as I fluff it before crawling into bed each night, it's fine. I tried bigger, body-sized pillows and all they did was frustrate me. I could never figure out how to shift or roll-over in bed while easily moving it with me. Also, I'm a plus-sized woman, so between me, my sprawled-out husband and a huge pillow, there's no room in a queen-sized bed. This boppy is just the right size and you can easily move around with it. I recommended it to other friends and they loved it too!	
- 1	As the other reviewers have mentioned, these disks don't do a damn thing!  We have the Safety 1st diaper pail, and we just ended up using really cheap plastic bags in it and changing the bag every time our son poops so we can avoid any odors.	
1. 	Needless to say, I bought this as a gag pacie! My daughter and son-in-law just moved to his home town in Mississippi before having first baby. I saw this and got a big kick out of it!! It is a great pacie and looks crazy cute in baby's mouth. I am ordering another for my other daughter in Tennessee!!	
1. 	This bag is perfect for my two-month old baby's daily feeding at day care.  I put my pumped breast milk bottles in there (6 five ounce-bottles) and the cooling gel on top or in between the bottles.  I can also add two or three more bottles if I lay them on top. I looked everywhere for something practical, given that I also have a toddler at daycare, for whom I tried different types of bags that would smell as soon as milk would get in the bag...  I would recommend it.  The strap is long enough that I can carry this bag, the toddler's milk bag, the two diapers bags, etc.	
- 1	The whole thing was heavy, so it would still manage to move around after securing it. I've tried to secure it to the graco snugride 30, graco pack n play corners, playzone play yard, anything! The wheel is not easy to spin, as the string catches whenever you pull it. I should have known better than to order the pink one, as the colors are not as attractive for a baby. I love pink, but baby prefers the bright and contrasting colors such as blues and reds with yellows and greens. I usually give any toy a few months of chances as I've noticed that if my daughter doesn't like a toy at 3 months, she may at 4 months, or even 6 months. Since we bought this when she was 3 months old, she still does not like it at 12 months old. Too bad as it's adorable!	
- 1	I thought Dr Brown's products are made in the USA. When this item arrived, I was disappointed when I noticed it was made in China. Decided to return it. I don't care if I will pay the shipping more than the cost of the item.	
- 1	I was hoping it would get more attention from my son... unfortunately he is just not fascinated but it. Not worth the price, IMHO	
- 1	I should have listened to the other reviews about how it's hard to get the treats out of this monster. The teeth are a little bit hard. It's even hard for me to get them out let alone my 18 month boy!	
1. 	This item is absolutely wonderful!!!  My daughter is now 8 weeks old and we have been using this in her crib since birth.  I can lay her down in her crib when she is on the verge of falling asleep and I turn on the what does the world look like story and she falls asleep before it is finished.  She loves the Twinkle Twinkle little star song and we often play it while I am changing her.  I highly recommend this to every parent! It does use up a lot of batteries so keep extra on hand, but it is worth it!!!	
1. 	I like to hang it on the side of my sons changing table and at the end of the day I just take it out. It smells so fresh and keeps odors at a minimum. Sooo much cheaper than those pails and you can bring a few for when you are out in public with no trash bin around.	
- 1	This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product.  How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me.  This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite.  It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise.  In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)	
- 1	Trying several liners to find good ones and these are not it. Too thin and not what we want at all. Don't seem like they'd hold much. Returned.	
- 1	I am 5'10 and very strong--no shrinking violet here--but even I had a hard time carrying this around. I would always wonder what a petite woman would do if she had to lug this car seat around with a growing infant sitting in it. Heavy is an understatement. I have since bought a Chicco Keyfit and have been very pleased. It is the safest on the market and about half the price. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!	
1. 	This princess clock is so adorable to hangin my newest granddaughter's room.  Shewill be our newest princess.  Item was receivedon time and worth every penney.	
- 1	I ordered this for my 2nd baby. I thought this would work very nice for a new born.Installing was already pretty difficult and the quality of the materials is poor. It is not sturdy.The music is not suitable for a newborn. It is not soothing and soft.The quality is so poor of this rocker. After installing it, I just did not want to uninstall it, put it back in the box and return it.Don't buy this, look further for something else. Especially for the money. This is way too expensive for what it is worth	
- 1	I wish the tray was easier to put on.  It has to be put on when the baby is already in the chair.  Of course he wants to grab it when I'm trying to slide it in and I get nervous that I am going to pinch his fingers.  Plus you have to remove the pommel on the chair first.  It seems like it's easy to scratch his legs without the pommel.	
1. 	The membranes arrived slightly curled as if they'd been stored in a hot warehouse for quite sometime. I ran them under some pretty hot water and flattened them on a towel. No harm no fowl so far. Some of them do rip if I'm not careful pulling them off the yellow valve, but I think that's me trying to be quick (and thus too rough) more than anything. I make sure to have quite a few of these on hand at all times, just in case.	
1. 	My granddaughter is eating baby food now, but for the more runny foods, I find it much easier to mix the food with formula & give it to her in a bottle.  I also mix cereal and feed it this way, especially first thing in the morning, when she is impatient to eat.  I had a difficult time cutting holes in the regular nipples to allow proper flow of this mixture.  It ended up flowing either too fast or not fast enough.  This nipple works great, because as she is nursing, I can simply turn the bottle to the best spot for the perfect flow.  What a great idea!  Happy baby makes Grandma happy!	
1. 	My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.  He is getting better now after a few months of having them.  He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!  It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!  Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.  The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.	
- 1	These were impossible to clean, thus making them not &#34;reusable&#34;. I returned them.	
1. 	I really like these caps. They fit the cheap bottles that are sold at Walmart and don't leak. I couldn't ask for anything more.	
- 1	I am so disappointed with this purchase.  The reviews were overwhelmingly fantastic, and even the negative reviews seem a bit like random unfortunate bad experiences that happen with all products.  However, I didn't even need to use this to know it's not for me.  Now I'm stuck figuring out whether it's worth returning.It's the lid.  it's designed in a way that food will get trapped into the crevice the runs around the inside of the lid.  I can imagine using a knife to clean it out, but not sure how much it will help.  Probably lots of soaking.  I don't think it will be worth my time.I have so many different brands of bottles and thermoses and am very particular.  For example, a few years ago it was a huge relief to find water bottles that could be used for smoothies, since caps needed to be simple.  Too many caps had moving parts and crevices that made washing difficult after smoothies.  So it was a huge deal to start seeing bottles being pitched for smoothies, with caps that would make cleaning easy.Why is this an issue?  Because all the trapped gunk will build up into mold and it's something that occasionally will come out in ugly gunks right into your food/drinks.The caps of food thermoses are no different.  The caps have to be equally washable and made to avoid food being trapped.  This product does not do that.This product's cap does exactly the opposite.  It's designed to trap food and no way to make cleaning easy.	
1. 	This seat is a lifesaver for sure. My 3 month old gets mad if she's not sitting up looking around at everything, and if I didn't have this I'd never get anything done! She's a pretty big girl, but not really chunky. I could see her growing out of it by 4 months, but by then she'll be interested in toys and I'll put her in her saucer.Definitely worth the money, especially if you have skinny babies, but even if not	
1. 	this tub side seat is great because:1) it is a very roomy storage box for all of your munchkins bathtime toys (with a lid that the munchkin can't take off himself)2) it is a durable seat3) it is a safe stepping stool that doesn't slipit has proved to be very useful.	
1. 	Hello, I purchased this for a new Grandson who has acid reflux and colic and it's turned out to be a blessing for him and my Daughter. It is his favorite seat over 5 of the newest swings and vibrating chairs etc.Worth every penny. I definately recommend to all Moms, Grandmothers, & for wonderful baby gifts. I happily give it at least 5 stars for sure.The delivery & purchase were everything promised.Thank you Amazon, keep up the great work!	
1. 	These are great for cleaning pump parts for an on the go mom. I have used them at work when I am short on time and can not go clean all of the parts and I have used them on trips when I could not get to water.	
- 1	I washed this book in cold water in our washer on delicate cycle. Not to label directions. Who makes a cloth book that you can't wash thoroughly, that your child will drool, chew and drop on the ground? I was appalled to see how faded the book became once it air dried. My child was sucking on the corner of that book. How much dye was she ingesting? What other substances/chemicals were in the books pages? I am not pleased with this and will not buy Manhattan Toy cloth books in the future.	
- 1	Its hard to get food out of this, I tried it myself and I also have a hard time. i just use the cup without the cover ... My son is not too messy. This cup didn't work for us.	
- 1	I have to agree with other reviewers. I like the concept but the compartments do leak.  I often find some of the formula in one compartment has spilled over into one of the empty compartments.  It's important to get the formula mixed to the right concentration so this worries me.  I'm going to try a different dispenser.	
- 1	I only buy toys made out of wood or other natural materials, and am painfully aware of the cost of doing so. Yet, I'd rather buy fewer quality toys than lots of plastic junk to trip over.Well the Haba discovery blocks are just too pricey and not durable at all. When I opened the box, I thought to myself - 30 dollars for THIS? To add insult to injury, my boy only was interested in the block with the bell. I read one of the reviews here pointing out the presence of arsenic in the bell (?). Had no time to research this claim, but hid the block with the bell anyway for peace of mind. Only a few weeks later, the corners of the blocks were all discolored from mouthing and chewing. I am hoping Haba paints are truly nutritious, or else my boy is in trouble. A year later, the blocks are rarely played with, and yet they look awful. Get some natural wooden blocks finished with beeswax (on Etsy perhaps), and pass on these. In fact, even painted Plan Toys or Maple Landmark toys hold on a lot better than Haba (and are cheaper).	
1. 	If you need a shower gift this is it! I got one and I love it...the Gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing! Mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it.I keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great~!The lotion is good smelling but you can't beat Johnsons and johnstons pink stuff...also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom-to be!!	
- 1	First one we had didn't last a full year, the monitor stopped working unless it was plugged in (we replaced batteries and it still wouldn't work). So we continued to use and then the monitor stopped working all together. We replaced it after it completely died and the second one came straight from manufacture and the monitor didn't work at all.Only comes with one camera. For the price, it should at least come with 2 cameras to one monitor.	
1. 	We originally bought a Land's End diaper bag based on recommendations from the Baby Bargains book. I do not like that bag. Although it has lots of pockets, it was very bulky and didn't fit as much. So, off I went looking for another bag and found this one at a babies store in town. I liked that it was lightweight and that I could carry my purse, the baby's car seat, and have the diaper bag on my back without feeling overwhelmed. The bottle cooler keeps bottles very cold. The only criticism I have is that I wish that there were a couple more pockets in the bag. Otherwise, I love the bag!	
1. 	You have to have this! I admit it looks scary when I try to pick my son's nose with this, but it won't hurt him! Of course you have to be gentle and careful. I wouldn't know what to do if I didn't have this. I am a new mom, so one day soon after my son was born, his nose was so stuffed that he wouldn't eat. I tried the little blue bulb that the hospital gave to me and it didn't work. I was frustrated until my husband remind me that I have this and it worked like magic! It pulled out this huge booger follow by a mile long snout. I have been using it everyday since. Here is some tip on using it. Nobody likes their nose to be picked by another, even baby. I usually I wait till my son is in a good mood and he will just let me do it and smile after I clean his nose. When he is fussy, I gave him a pacifier and then pull it out just a tiny bit so I can use this thing. It has been great! Worth a try and you will love it.	
- 1	I would not recommend this. It's awkward, doesn't distribute weight properly, and doesn't support baby. I purchased a lillebaby carrier after and love it. The lillebaby is pricey, but in this case, for me, I got what I paid for.	
1. 	I had searched high and low for a gray and white chevron crib sheet for my sons room. This fit the bill perfectly.  The cotton is of very good quality, thick and durable. It fit our standard crib mattress snugly. Yes, it's not the softest cotton however I imagine that after washing it frequently over time it will get softer. If you're looking for something really soft I suggest jersey cotton. I bought a second one because I loved it so much.	
1. 	This is a beautiful cover.  I purchased mine in sage green and am in love with the color as well as the softness of the fabric.  This washes well and slips over my changing pad with no problems.	
1. 	I like these and I am using them since I have a tall bed... but yeah co sleeper is wobbly with them. Hasn't been an issue yet with my 3.5 month old. But I get nervous when my toddler tries to hang on the sides to see the baby.	
1. 	I really like this monitor. It works and there is not any feedback and we're in a small place. I also like the ability to use the batteries and put it on your belt. We use it if we go take the dog out or to do yard work while she's sleeping. I would recommend this.	
1. 	Our baby is notorious for hating bottles and pacifiers; he only likes the real thing. I stay home with him, so it's easy to breastfeed him exclusively, but it's nice to be able to have a bottle ready to go if I want to go out with the girls or to a book club meeting. Unfortunately, he has never liked using a bottle, so we have tried a few types, trying to find one he likes.So far, we've tried Breastflow, Dr. Brown's Natural Flow, and these. The Breastflow bottles and Playtex VentAire Wide bottles have wider, flatter nipples that are supposed to be shaped more like mom. The Dr. Brown's Natural Flow have regular nipples. We started with the Breastflow bottles. They leaked and were difficult for our baby to use properly. The Dr. Brown bottles kind of worked for him, but he didn't seem to like the narrow nipple base. We decided to try the Playtex VentAire bottles because they have the wider nipple base and many of the reviews say that they don't leak.The VentAire bottles have a lot of parts, but I find them to be easy to assemble/disassemble and clean because the top and bottom both come off. I haven't had any issues with leaking, but after the initial boil, I have only hand-washed the parts. I don't know how the bottom airflow gaskets would hold up with repeated washings in the dishwasher. While the nipple base is wider than regular nipples with these bottles, they don't seem to be wide enough to satisfy my little one. He keeps trying to shove the entire nipple into his mouth.When reading reviews for baby bottles, it's really important to remember that babies have their own individual preferences when it comes to bottles. These bottles don't seem to be working for my baby, but I don't think it's the bottle's fault. Hopefully, with more practice, he'll learn to use these properly and like them.	
- 1	This is a good idea for a teether since it's basically a bumpy pacifier that's easy to chew. However my son hated it. The actual raspberry part is way too big for a baby's mouth. We tried it a couple of times and he never took to it. Also, like many other reviewers, I wasn't too comfortable with the fact that the berry part seems to be glued on, posing a choking hazard. Overall not worth buying for us.	
1. 	As a first time parent, I was constantly reading reviews of baby items before I made purchases.  This tub was rated very highly and so I thought I'd give it a go.  No disappointment here--its rated highly for good reason.The tub worked beautifully for my premature baby because of the hammock that straps over the top, making it easy to give my baby a sponge bath while he was cradled in the hammock.  Now that he's bigger and doesn't need the hammock anymore, the tub is still working well for both of us.  The plug that changes color when the temperature of the water is too hot is hard to see, but it does work and its nice to have.Of all my baby item purchases, this is one of my absolute favorites.  I highly recommend this product--most especially for bathing your preemie or newborn!	
1. 	These sheets appear to be nice, quality, crisp percale sheets so as that was as expected. However, the color was much darker than the photos. The color is more of a turquoise than the light aqua image on Amazon.	
- 1	I don't know if it's just my dishwasher, but the caps and nipples did not come out clean. The OXO seems to be a better one.	
- 1	I loved this at first.  The product itself works great and I love that I can check the temperature for my son's bath.  But, for some reason, they made the turtle's head come in two pieces and after a short while of using this, the head now comes off and because it's two pieces, they aren't very big, making this a choking hazard for my son.  Also, the piece that the head snaps onto is not good for my son to be putting in his mouth as it's small as well and could break off.  We have only used this in the bath and he rarely even plays with this, so it should have lasted longer than this.I'm very disappointed with this as otherwise it works great.  Not sure why they needed to put small pieces for the head on this.	
- 1	The air dry clay is impossible to work with.  No matter what I did (warmed it, kneaded it etc.) it was wrinkly.  It was also impossible to get the clay to spread out evenly and neatly into the spaces with the little wooden dowel they included.I have also been buying plain wooden frames and putting sculpey in them, and while it's not any easier, it's a lot cheaper and the results look a lot better.In the picture part of this frame, there is plastic instead of glass, and mine was scratched.  So much for a treasured keepsake!	
- 1	Well it does work-ish.  The only part that gets warm is the lid so you get 1 wipe, maybe 2 that is warm.  Also the wipe cools off extremely fast, it needs to be straight from the lid onto the butt or its completely ineffective.  We no longer use it at all.	
- 1	I live in a techie house. Lots of WiFi, Cell Signal Extenders, etc. So I can't honestly say that something else might have caused the interference that I experienced with this model, HOWEVER, I imagine that living in a large city or apartment building that you'd run into the same problems that we faced with these monitors.I wasn't able to use these for more than a week without giving up. While the packaging, design and features were great, the actual quality of the signal was not.I do not recommend purchasing this product.	
- 1	The concept it nice but you can just buy a silk fabric and give it him.  My son does not use it or sleep with it.  Oh well!	
1. 	Even when I bring a bottle brush in the diaper bag I cant always get to a sink. Thats where these come in. They really help make cleaning bottles easier and convienent. Although it is an added expense with the liners, they are pretty inexpensive in bulk and if you dont use them all day everyday. Would reccomend to a mom who doesnt have much time to clean bottles or who wants an inexpensive easily replacable (they sell these pratically everywhere,even gas stations) quality product.	
1. 	I have this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It keeps her busy in the car and in the stroller or if she gets bored with her swing I clip it on that sometimes too. The clips are a little hard to get to work you really have to just use two hands to open them up and push down hard. But it's worth it, in the car when you go over bumps the turtle will play it's little jingle. She loves grabbing the little animals on it.	
- 1	Leans too far back for babies not sitting on their own. The corner pieces on bottom of the frame needed foe balance on the floor would not stay screwed in. Used this twice and it went in the trash.	
1. 	I bought this for our 6 yr. old when she was an infant and loved it and repurchased now for our 6 mo. old. This was one of our favorites and had to make sure my 6 mo. old had the same toy. So glad they still make the toy, and it's exactly the same, well built and very entertaining for her. It's a toy I used for motivating both my kids to start crawling.	
- 1	This worked OK for a few weeks.As some other reviewers noted the vinyl rips when you try to take the bumper out soyou have to be extra careful with that.	
1. 	I'm not one of those people who spend $75 on soy onesies or $1200 on Scandanavian cribs, but the Miracle Blanket is worth the hefty price. Prior to having our baby, we watched the Happiest Baby on the Block videos and read the book, so we knew the value of a good swaddling blanket and had purchased lots of different kinds to try out once hse wwas born. Of all the ones we purcahsed or received as gifts, the Miracle Blanket turned out to be the best by far. It's a little tricky to figure out how to use at first and you'll be tempted to resort to the sack style swaddlers, which are easier to use at first. If you watch a few youtube videos on how to wrap the Miracle Blanket and practice a few times, though, you'll quickly get the hang of it and you'll be rewarded for your efforts. Once we figured out how to use the Miracle Blanket, it's the only swaddling blanket we used and we bought one in every color. If you're having a baby or know someone who is, this is definitely on my list of newborn essentials and would highly recommend it!	
1. 	Before my son was born I bought him fisher price bath tub. I liked to look at it, and imagined how I would bathe my baby in it. So the time came, and Nick was born 9 lb 4 oz. Huge?! Oh yeah - he was too big for his tub. And bathing him was such a disaster :( especially when he started to jump out of it. I couldn't bathe him alone, my first hand was busy with holding him and the other one was shampooing. And my husband was showering. We tried to switch to an adult tub, but as he can't sit yet it was even more uncomfortable: my back ached, the baby was scared, and I was nervous.When my son turned 4 months, he weighed about 20 lb I couldn't wait anymore, and again searched net for bath tubs. All I saw was about same size as fisher price. Finally after googling my baby doesn't fit his bath tub, I found an advice from woman who recommended trying primo eurobath, date of her advice was 2001, but anyway I tried to amazon it and found it to my great surprise. After looking at customer photos I understood this is exactly what I need.So it came, I cleaned it and we tried it same evening: Nick was so happy. He was sitting like a king on his throne in it. Primo is designed so well, like it was created just for the shape of my baby. It has space for his hands, bump doesn't let him to jump out, it's pretty high, and it also holds well.Our bathing time became much longer. The baby was very happy, smiling all the time, and kicking the water. Mommy was relaxed for the first time, and really had fun :)))	
- 1	These bottles suck!  A complete waste of money, maybe my daughter will use them to play with her dolls years down the road.  They are a HUGE pain to use.  For one you can't use a bottle warmer (the water seeps up into bottle).  We had to hold it under running water which takes forever.  It took my daughter FOREVER to drink the bottle from the nipples.  If you are concerned about gas use Dr. Brown's bottles, they have more parts but easy to put together.	
1. 	Diaper Champ works well for me. It holds lots of diapers and I do not have to spend money on refill bags.  I use tall kitchen trash bags. I am starting to notice an oder escape from the diaper pail but it's nothing that I cannot handle.  I just use that as a sign to empty it, spray with Lysol and replace the bag.	
- 1	I have bought this pillow after reading and viewing several videos about nursing pillows.  I think this is a functional and useful design and a useful item to have with a baby (my baby is due in two months, so I only speak from reading and talking to other moms).  However, I don't think I will be using this pillow!  Here is why:  I read up on polyurethane foam (overloaded with dozens of noxious and toxic substances that DO eventually end up in your environment, your body, and your breast-milk) and I did NOT want to use this product!  Instead, I paid for the ridiculously over-priced blessed nest organic nursing pillow filled with buckwheat hulls.  I then removed the latching belt from the brestfriend slip cover that came with the pillow and had it sewn onto the blessed nest organic nursing pillow slip cover... Who wants to be poisoned in their own home, while nursing an innocent baby, with things like polyurethane foam and noxious flame ratardants?  I wish the chemical industry would just stop using us as their guinea pigs for the tens of thousands of chemicals they need to push...	
1. 	It's a life saver for public washrooms that aren't smart enough to have seat covers available.  It's thicker and more comfortable that the flimsy ones anyway.  Sesame Street design made it an immediate hit with our daughter who got a little freaked out by our earlier attempts at lining seats with toilet paper.  Definitely worth having on hand.	
1. 	I recommend this to anyone who has kids starting to eat solids. Its so easy to clean, holds all the mess in place... and a 2 pack would be sufficient for so many months instead of buying a ton of cloth bibs or any other variety of bibs!! Totally worth the price, its so well designed!!!	
- 1	I'm not saying that the quality of the item is to blame, just the concept. If you need to swaddle your baby, use a swaddle blanket. This serves no purpose after you no longer need to swaddle your baby. A blanket still is a blanket!	
1. 	I love this booster!It fits our average (maybe even smaller than average) sized kitchen chairs when other similar products did not.Easy to clean, easy to use, works perfectly, etc... Honestly, no complaints.I highly recommend it for anyone living in a small space. I also recommend it for anyone who is looking for a chair that will last a long time. I bought my first one when my baby was 6-months, just starting to sit at the table. She's now almost 3-years-old and still fits in it and it is in like-new condition. I purchased a second one for baby #2 and it's holding up just as well after 7 months of use.Great item! In fact, one of my Top 10 Must Have Kid Items!	
1. 	The music is very nice (parent friendly)The mobile is very entertaining to babies.ALL remote control mobiles have a big weakness - the remotes only work when they're in the same room as the mobile.  This means you have to get up every time you want to restart it. No one has created an RF remote.  At least this model runds a long time before shutting off.What you read about the poor design of the pole is really true.  It doesn't lock in place, and the segemented pole doesn't even lock together.  Truly a terrible design.I'm giving it 4 stars because ALL mobiles will in fact break apart and crash on a baby that pulls on the toys.  Parents need to be careful with all mobiles - not just this one.  The fact is that this mobile has more useful features and more engaging toys than all the others I have seen.Everybody complains about the poor arm design, yet they buy the product fully knowing what could happen.  The FIRST day I caught my daughter grabbing the toys, I took it down.  If your child can stand in her crib, remove ALL mobiles - period.	
1. 	I used this in our infant tub as an insert to hold our little man in place for the first 3 months.  It made bath time much easier as I didnt' have to be holding him with one hand the entire time.  It is a sponge so it stays warm.  I would definetly get this for newborns!	
1. 	I really like this changing table. The changing table that was supposed to come with my furniture set from BRU was part of a big long dresser thing (not an upright, a long one) and was going to cost $600. For a dresser that wouldn't fit in her room. No. So I decided to find a cheaper one that matched her room, and landed upon this one. It has been absolutely great for 8 months now. I have 0 complaints.	
1. 	I've used the genie in the past and much prefer the Diaper Champ. I'm all about practicality when it comes to baby products and the Diaper Champ is right in line with my views.Very easy to use,(my senior citizen parents figured it out...lol), controls odor well and USES REGULAR TRASH BAGS...woohoo! Who wants to spend money all the time for fancy trash bags. Buy the diaper champ and save the money for something fun for baby.	
- 1	I have been using these Kushies cloth diapers for 2 months now. My son is now 6 months old. They only last about two hours before I have to change him.  If I wait longer than that, his clothes get damp from pee soaking through the diaper. I never use them when I am out and about or know that he will be somewhere where people might want to hold him.  The last thing people want is to have a pee stain on their clothes after holding a baby.  I feel that the pee soaks through so fast because the cotton inside layer sticks out the sides around his legs.  I have found that Flips cloth diapers and Mommy's Touch cloth diapers work best.Mango Snap Easy Clean Pocket One Size Cloth Diaper by Mommy's Touch with Microfiber InsertorFlip Individual: 1 One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover & 1 One-Size Stay-Dry Insert - Moonbeam	
1. 	This base easily converted my Evenflo Embrace 35 into a sturdy stroller.It's easy to assemble. It took me less than five minutes out of the box with no instructions required.It's easy to use. More easy to store, carry and transport than any stroller system I've used. I've found it much more practical than the combination stroller car seat systems that I've used in the past and much more affordable.It looks great. Once paired with the carseat, it doesn't look any different than any other infant stroller.I would buy again or purchase as a gift.	
1. 	I would have given this 4.5 stars. It's very worm, almost too worm. I dress my 5 months old son with only a onsie  when I know he's going to be in the carrier because it gets very hot even when it's 40 degrees out . It's high quality and looks nice but to add it on the carrier is not perfect. You need to slide the carrier &#34;handles&#34; through holes in the cover and when I open the carrier to take my son out, the cover always falls off. I wish they came up with a way to attach the cover so it won't fall off the carrier when it's open.	
- 1	The sling is too tight so the only way baby can be in the water is if the bath is completely full of water, otherwise they just hang above the water and get cold.  The head support underneath is very hard and is right where baby's head goes.  It's really big and doesn't store very well.  Haven't tried it without the sling yet, baby is only a few weeks old.	
- 1	Would give this zero stars if I could.  Every time I wash a bottle, this brush flings soapy water everywhere--all over the sink, counter, and my face!  And the nipple brush is way too thick and the bristles are too hard.  A double-sponge bottle brush is what I had before (a sponge tip and sponge at base, with bristles in between), and that's what I'll be going back to.  And by the way, the tip of the nipple brush rusts right away, as other reviewers have mentioned.	
- 1	we bought this sealing discs to store the access milk in the refrigerator but i was surprised that they don't fit the avent bottles the i bought,so we ended up  throwing them in the trash,if u wanna store milk just use the plastic bags which are cheaper and more effective.	
1. 	My baby is absolutely fascinated with this toy.  You can't tell from the pictures but the teether twists into many shapes which kept my baby busy for what seemed like forever.  There is also different textures on each of the twisting/rotating pieces.	
1. 	what more can i say i like this idea. even my grandmother and aunt in laws are so amazed with these snack catcher. they said they haven't seen one before. this works great on the go, when we're in a hurry to leave i can just pour in snack and my son get occupied eating while traveling in the car. it prevents mess but not 100% unless you teach your toddler not to put their hand in the snack catcher and take the snack out. i told my son just get enough food you can put in your mouth at a time. then this snack catcher has served its purpose well. i'm happy with this purchase i have another baby and she's starting to learn to use this. glad there's two of them.	
1. 	Works out well for the 3 year old that sleeps on it.  She loves it!  I put a blanket over the bed so there are no issues with anything poking her.  Love that it folds up and stores in a small package.  Great buy for the price!	
- 1	I thought Dr Brown's products are made in the USA. When this item arrived, I was disappointed when I noticed it was made in China. Decided to return it. I don't care if I will pay the shipping more than the cost of the item.	
1. 	This stroller is so light and easy to use. We just pop the graco snugride car seat in and we are off. Much easier and lighter than a heavy travel system. And you can't beat the price. Great item!	
1. 	I got these bibs a little while ago when I started feeding my son solids.  I really like the bibs, I love the prints, and the pocket, it catches spilled food, however, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the attachment for the neck should be better, allowing for babies with smaller necks to have a nice snug fit.  The bib does indeed allow for adjustment with the bib, but its still a bit too big for my boy.  I do like them though!	
1. 	This cushion is a must have if you already have the Svan highchair.  It makes the chair much more comfortable for the child.  I would recommend getting two so you have a spare when you need to wash one.  They are machine washable (which is awesome!) and very easy to get on and off without having to remove the buckles from the highchair.	
1. 	This is the only carrier that I found to fit an infant well. Plan on using it for an upcoming flight. Might hurt back when baby gets bigger, but I'll upgrade then if I still want to babywear.	
- 1	This cover did not fit the Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller.  The seams were in the wrong place and the front end of the cover did not reach to the wheel where the slit should sit.  We ended up with no coverage under the tray so baby's legs could be exposed to the cold air while we were in motion.  As we attempted to get the right fit, two sections of seaming tore away from the plastic.  We purchased the Jeep cover specifically because we had a Jeep stroller - so disappointed that it didn't fit.  As for the smell, I did open the cover and hang it in the basement for 2 days before attempting to put it on the stroller and there was virtually no smell.  I can't imaging putting my baby under the cover without airing it out first.	
- 1	I purchased this product thinking it would help with the diaper pale smell and even freshen up my babies room a bit.  They don't work, they smell great but only if you stick them up by your nose and take a deep breath.  I put one in the diaper pale, one on the changing table and on in her small walk in closet.  They have done nothing for the dirty diaper smell and you certainly can't smell any lavender scent in her room (they are lavender scented but only if your nose it to the plastic).  I paid $5 for 5 of them, a waste of $5 but at least now I know not to buy them again.	
1. 	This size is perfect for the mini cribs at daycare. NOT a regular crib, NOT a pack & play! It's also very soft & cozy for the baby.	
1. 	This is perhaps the one #1 MUST HAVE item I would recommend to alllll parents. They tell you, you can swaddle a baby yourself with a blanket but good luck finding a blanket with the right proportions and establishing a good tie down that doesn't unravel. The Miracle Blanket is foolproof, is the perfect size (even as your baby grows), it never unravels, AND it allows your baby's hips room to grow.PROS:SoftEasyDurableMachine washableUser friendlyHip wiggle roomCONS: NAWould I recommend it? YES! I recommend this product to every parent I know.Important note: My baby was in the 90% percentile for height and it fit great even when she was 4 months old. My husband and I were sorry when the baby started rolling and we couldn't use it anymore. The Miracle Blanket is a godsend and I really believe it's the reason she has learned to sleep through the night.	
1. 	I have not had a problem with this swing and my son LOVES it!  I am very grateful that I have not had the experience that some others state they have had (with their baby's heads getting stuck between the bar)...I honestly do not see how this is possible.  I read the directions and put the item together exactly as stated in the instructions.  Perhaps some people did not read the weight limit or instructions?  Also, keep in mind that children should never be left unattended...As for some people saying it is difficult to carry (they say it pops open) let me tell you that you CAN carry it with one hand, as long as the front of the seat is facing your body...against your leg; it will not come undone.  I have carried this swing AND my baby in his carrier with no problems.As for the speed issue, I haven't noticed a problem yet (my son is almost 3 months old right now).  But seriously, how fast do you really need this swing to go?The fish that are attached with the ribbons DO seem to hang a bit low, but if they were higher, baby would have to stretch for them and in my opinion, that's probably not a good idea since their center of gravity would be off then.  I like to use the setting where my baby can activiate the sound & lights by pulling on the fish...he gets a real kick out of it!I haven't had any problems (knock on wood) and I haven't had to change the batteries yet, either!  Good luck!	
- 1	The Pipila seemed like a good solution for sterilizing while outside the home.  Unfortunately, it only sterilizes the nipple of the pacifier.  The rest of the pacifier will remain dirty, including the guard just beyond the nipple.  Baby will soon touch the unsterilized part of the pacifier, rendering the limited sterilization much less beneficial.	
- 1	I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. What they say about the center being weak is true. I have twins and they where born of 3 and 5 lbs and the bassinet started loosing its form. I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard. If I knew that was the use I was going to give it, I would have bought a cheaper one.	
- 1	The pressure mount at 34 inches felt to insecure. We added 1&#34; wood on either side to make it sturdier. Also used longer screws for the mounting rings. Retraining self to be conscious of the white bar at the bottom, not to stub toe or trip over it. Especially as ours is at the top of a stair.	
1. 	This is one of the most beautiful toys my son has. I love the rainbow of colors. The clackety-clack of the outer segments, the colors, and the changing shape of the globe keeps him interested. He'll still look at it now that he's 15 months old. It's also very durable--it shows no signs of wear still.	
1. 	These were a baby shower gift along with a Avent Bottle Set. They were recommended by three different mothers which is why I purchased them.	
- 1	Dont use silicone use natural rubber for your baby. I use Nuk rubber Orthodonic nipples because they are natural and work perfectly.	
- 1	I am VERY disappointed with this product. It worked the first two times I tried it, with an apple and a pear. I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all. I think the blade has dulled... Anyway, I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it.	
1. 	My oldest is now 4 1/2, but we got all of his extra furniture(highchair, bouncer, jumperoo, swing, and mobile) from the Fisher-Price Precious Planet line. We were mostly satisfied with all of them. (We hated the swing...seemed like our little one was always about to fall out). The bouncer was well used by my first two, so it needed to be replaced with our third one on the way. That is mostly due to the fact that I tripped over that old one...while holding my newborn! Thankfully, my baby wasn't hurt, but it bruised me horribly. It hurt worse than one would imagine! It bent it to the point that it was a pain to use anymore. It was a HUGE tripping hazard, and I don't recommend it. THIS one(although a rocker and not a bouncer) is not the same tripping hazard, and I love it!It seems like bouncers are one of those things that are extremely useful, but not for long. Little ones seem to outgrow them so quickly. I adore the fact that this one converts to a toddler rocker, so we get longer use out of it. This is especially appealing since we are not having anymore. I think most of us will feel like we're getting our money's worth when our little one can use it longer! My 1 year old(almost 2) has already been sitting in it, and loves it. I'm trying not to let him use it too much, though, because it is baby brother's.Another feature I like is the kickstand It helps the rocker to lay flat. My first son slept in his bouncer for the first year and a half of his life(he was extremely premature and small). I like this kickstand feature, just in case our newest little one ends up sleeping any in this rocker. (I like having options when it comes to getting a bit of sleep).Overall, I have no reason to not recommend this rocker. We love it so far!
