1. 	The sling on this tub is so helpful when bathing a newborn...perfect for nervous new parents!  My daughter is 9 months old now and still uses this tub.  Even though she has been able to sit by herself for quite some time now, it's reassuring to know that her back is well supported, and there is still enough room for her to play in the water.	
- 1	I don't know if my house is the problem but even with this stepping stool my almost 2 year old can't reach the sink.	
1. 	My 4 yr old hates wearing a blanket and I always had to wake up in the middle of the night to check on him. This works wonders. He loves wearing this because of the foot holes and it keeps him warm. I don't have to worry about him kicking off his blanket. Fits him well with room to grow. He can also unzip himself easily for potty emergencies.	
1. 	My son zoomed all around the house in this. Great walker! I only hate I didn't find it sooner. It works great on tile and hardwood floors but I'm not sure how it works on carpet.	
1. 	We own more than 10 of these bibs, and we love them. As far as I am concerned, they cannot be improved upon. Buy one and see. They are totally waterproof, roll up and stuff into diaper bags easily, and they come out of the wash looking like new. Even after 2 years of heavy use. Seriously, stop researching and buy this product (or any other Bumkins bib!)	
- 1	Haven't been able to use it-it's so hard to blow it up I think we need a bicycle pump to get air into it. Too much work when you have a baby!	
1. 	This stroller is great for parents with two or more kids. We have a couple other strollers but ended up buying this one when we had an infant and a 2.5 year old. We were about to take a trip to Disneyland and thought it would be worth it.The stroller fits one child in the front and the front seat has three reclining positions. When the seat is all the way up in the sitting position, then another child can sit or stand in the back. If the front seat is reclined to the middle position or laid flat (it doesn't go completely flat, but goes down far enough for a child to sleep), then the back cannot be used.The stroller comes with an extra piece so you can attach various models of car seats. We were past that age with our infant, but we kept the part in case we have another.Also, not shown in the photo, the stroller comes with a fabric band that wraps around the top to hold drinks and other items. I thought I had to buy this separately and did so, but ended up returning the separate accessory because it already came with the stroller.The stroller can be heavier than regular strollers (it weighs around 20 pounds) so when pushing our 20 lb infant and 40 lb 2.5 year old, it can be quite a workout. It's not as maneuverable as I'd like it to be either. Also, the rear brakes aren't as reliable as I'd like them to be. You really need to make sure you press down hard.Setup was really easy. I was able to set it up myself in about 25 minutes. Probably would've been faster if my 2.5 YO wasn't trying to help me so much.It was really nice having this in Disneyland. Our infant could sleep in the park and when our preschooler got tired, we could let him take a ride. He is in an age where he constantly wants to run away from us, so it was great to park him in the back when we needed to walk for a long time.	
- 1	I thought this looked awesome just based on the shape and all the different textures, but i cannot get my baby into this one.	
1. 	the traditional swaddle blanket it time consuming and my son can break out with ease. He now sleeps through the night. He's now 4 months. We will continue to use it until he can break out of it also.	
1. 	we had the sleep sheep with our first and now the Gentle Giraffe with our second.  I think that this is cuter than the sheep.  Sounds are great - like it shuts off after 20 or 40 minutes.  Not too loud.  Great size.	
1. 	We could not live without this gym!  Since my little one was a month old, he has loved laying under this, and he probably spends 2-2.5 hours a day kicking, grabbing, smiling, and cooing while laying on this mat.  We have continued to add toys with different sounds and textures as he has grown, and we move the toys that came with the gym around from time to time.  He particularly loves the elephant rattle right now.  My little guy is now almost 4 months old, and I know this will only get used more over the next few months.  On a practical side, it is lightweight and easy to put together, and the mat itself is washable.  The toys can be moved from the canopy to the mat to make tummy time more fun for baby.  The music leaves something to be desired, especially considering how much time I spend listening to it, but it is worth it to see baby so happy.  Of all the gifts we were given, this has definitely been the most frequently used.A note on battery life: after a minimum of 2 hours of use daily over the past 3 months, the original batteries are still going strong!	
1. 	my baby has been not intrigued enough to pull this out. I have it even on the wall corners in my house. It has given me more peace of mind to let him walk without worrying too much.I have brown ones on my wood so it looks better.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this teether based on the other reviews. It looks just as pictured with the ring having several different textures. The textures are great for sore gums, by the way, I think it would be perfect if it fit in baby's mouth. My baby is 4 months old and the ring is way too big. She can't get it into her mouth and ends up frustrated and screaming. Just as another reviewer mentioned, the silicone material is a double-edged sword. It's soft and bendable and good for chewing on, but it picks up dirt like crazy. It's a dirt magnet. First time I gave it to the baby, she dropped it on her fleece blanket and got full f lint. I cleaned and gave it back to her. She put it on her head in her hair, where it picked up hair. Third time she dropped it on the floor and again got full of lint. So I gave up & I'm returning the product. BTW, the baby wasn't into it either. She tried to pull it apart and bend it with her little hands, tried putting it into her mouth but gave up screaming after a few minutes of unsuccessful attempts. I'm still looking for a good teether.	
- 1	I registered for this because I was living in Europe when pregnant with our son and though that (with the size of our TINY European washers) this would be perfect.  It is SMALL - even by European washer standards.  I use bumGenius diapers and I could only fit a few in here.  I did wash every day, but it still filled up fast.  Also, the handle lock was awkward (or maybe it was me?).  I would recommend a pail that has a step-open feature for those moments when you can't bend over and use two hands to open the bucket (where are your hands for holding down the baby on the changing table?).	
- 1	The back of this seat would always slide down the back of the chair so I wasn't able to sit my baby in it securely. After a few futile attempts I decided to send this back and I ordered a Fischer Price booster seat that we love. Easier to secure, very portable also and my baby is so much safer in it.	
- 1	our baby likes the soft part but not the handle so I remove the soft part and transplant it into glow in the dark handles from walmart	
1. 	Our baby slept in our room in this moses basket until he outgrew it at 2.5 months old.  I set the basket on my bedside table, so I could just reach over and pick up our son when he needed to be fed without ever having to get out of bed.  The basket with the gingham bumber looks really nice, and now I use it in the nursery as a cute place to keep stuffed animals.  Because of the low price compared to most other moses baskets, I honestly thought the build of this basket would be quite cheap, but it surpassed all of my expectations.  It is sturdy and durable, and even the quality of the little mattress is just fine for a newborn.  Although, I never did use the hood on this moses basket because it didn't seem to fit quite right the first time I used it.  Five stars for this moses basket by Badger Basket- it made life much easier with a price we could afford!	
- 1	I ended up returning this sippy cup. The silicone sleeve was torn and jagged. It has a Very hard and super long spout. Very not user friendly. My 6 mo old wouldn't use it.	
- 1	save your money. this brush scratched all my bottles and sprayed water all over me when i used it. i'm better off using a soft sponge and a spoon to use as a handle to swirl the sponge around	
1. 	I got this carrier as a baby shower gift and it has been truly a great gift.  I can use it anywhere and it is pretty simple to use.  My son is now 4 mos and still fits comfortably in it.  This is a Must Have item.  It is kind of pricey, but worth the money since it has a 20 lb. capacity and won't just be a couple of months worth of uses.	
1. 	What else can I say? It does its job and I appreciate that it doesn't need anything but pressure to keep it in place. No fancy hinges or anything. You really don't need to buy anything more expensive than this!	
- 1	While it looks like it would be a great color, it's poorly made (thread count must be super low) and when it comes out of the drier, it has balls collected over it which also makes the sheet not-so-soft.  Go for the white!  I have a couple of white pack 'n play sheets and they are holding up much better!!	
- 1	We bought this for a trip I was taking by myself with my large, 34 inch tall 16 month old.  I installed it correctly and put my son in it.  It was very easy to install, but the red strap that fits around the seat was directly behind his head, making him keep his head forward.  Also, as another reviewer stated, the chest strap was right under his chin, which I feared would decapitate him in an accident.  Because there is no middle strap between the child's legs like in a carseat, they do slide down and the chest strap is literally at their neck.  I even brought drawer liner with us and put it under my son's bum to keep him from sliding out, but it didn't help.Lastly, the airplane seatbelt (we flew on American) didn't get tight enough to really keep him in place.  He's a large child and at 26 pounds is way over the minimum weight of 20 lbs.  I cannot imagine using this with a smaller child.I ended up bringing his carseat on with us and using that on the flight back.  I will be selling my CARES and getting this instead for next time.Go Go Kidz TravelMate - Black/ Orange	
- 1	We have 4 of these cups plus a stainless one and loved them. They are easy to drink from, leak proof when the top is snapped shut and fairly easy to wash. These were the only straw cups I used with my toddler for the past 1+ yr. However, I recently learned some disturbing news about the plastic material they use for these cups, called Tritan. It's made by the Eastman company and is touted as being BPA-free and ultra-safe. However, there is some question about their safety testing methods and some suggest that Tritan may leach substances that are worse for you than BPA. There have been some comparisons between what Eastman is doing and what big tobacco did. That's scary, especially when the health of your baby is concerned.I'm very disappointed to learn such disturbing news about a cup we trusted and loved so much and am especially disturbed that these companies would play their &#34;games&#34; with things that affect our babies health (thought I'm not entirely surprised). I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 bc they are very well designed. However, we, sadly, won't be using these cups anymore. Shame on you Eastman.	
1. 	My son loves this. He stares at the fish for as long as we leave him in it. It has a lot of different sound options as well as lights, moving mobile, etc. so you can mix it up and baby doesn't get bored. Also he seems comfy because he is always sleeping in it.The only thing that worries me is that if you have it on some of the higher speeds, and even the lower ones now that he is bigger the swing has a lot of movement at the legs. It sometimes looks like its going to tip. So I keep a very close watch when he is in it.	
- 1	I really wanted these to work. I can't keep socks on my 3 month old's feet, so I gave these a try. She managed to kick these off in her car seat before we got to our destination. Now I'm back to just buying white socks since I lose at least one every time we go somewhere.	
1. 	Both of my kids adored this play gym. Out of all of them I've seen this is by far the best well made one. The colors, music, and toys kept my kids entertained for a very long time.	
1. 	just the perfect thing to  help tiny cloggy noses. my lil one screams at the site of it but it works!	
- 1	This chair looks nice, but it's bulky and such a pain to remove the cover and clean. After a month or so of use, I could not stand the pain of removing the cover to wash and placing it back and decided just to get a easy to clean booster, which I should have done in first place and saved about 80 bucks by not buying this chair.	
1. 	This bib is wonderful! We use it anytime we have spaghetti, ravioli, anything that will stain and is very saucy.	
- 1	I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had. The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side..but the third one was a charm! My daughter loves this swing! The seat is very soft and padded well. The headrest is a must! At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile! The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing. I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound. The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great! I would recommend this swing to anyone!!! I would also recommend getting through (...) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item. Hope this helps you decide!!!	
- 1	We bought this spout cover based on the reviews and the adjustable strap to hold the whale in place on our faucet. Unfortunately the strap will not lock in place and the whale slides off our faucet. Our faucet is a standard Kohler spout without a shower diverter:[...]My thought is if our spout had a shower diverter handle on it the whale would stay in place. The whale did cover everything and if it stayed in place for us I would give it a 5.Back to the drawing board on this one. Help my hand is getting beaten up protecting our little ones head from hitting the spout.	
1. 	Agree with everything all the other (positive) reviewers have said. Used this for two kids. I felt like I could at least turn away from my baby long enough to fetch a washcloth or towel and know he would be safe.  Plus, once they get old enough it's great that they can splash in the water without having to fill your whole bathtub.  It is really huge, though.  If you have a small bathroom, anticipate having to store it IN your bathtub.	
- 1	Very small! Our baby ended up not using this at all. The seams are at weird angles so it fit strange at the shoulder. Made for small babies but the arms are long so it's an awkward fit.	
- 1	The sheep is lovely but the music box came broken. We did not open it until our son was born, so too late for returns.	
- 1	I bought this teether because of all the good reviews.  My baby wouldn't use it.  She spit it out, put her normal pacifier back in, and continued to chew on that one.	
1. 	This is a fantastic and portable blanket...great for picnics or for little ones.  Used this all summer with my son at the park and it's held up well.  Love the pattern and the way it folds up is ingenious.  The strap makes it easy to carry when your arms are full of the ten million other things that you carry with you when you have a child.  Very glad with this purchase.	
1. 	Max is not just the baby's favorite, he is the family's favorite! All the older kids love engaging their little brother with this toy. The colors are vibrant, and the clacking sounds are pleasant sounding when you shake it and/or pull on the wooden ring. We bought the blue polka dot clip to go with it, and clipped it on his car seat. Those bright colors keep him engaged and the sound is not annoying like so many other toys. I like being able to clip him anywhere without the worry that we'll lose our precious Haba toy. We love all the Haba toys we've bought so far, and this is one of the favorites in our growing collection.	
1. 	I love this hamper. It is a good deal. I have seen other hampers similar to this one and they cost good deal more; so this is a bargain. It has a mesh bag inside and you can remove to do laundry. It folds up easily and lightweigh. It can hold an obscene amount of clothes. You can was easily without it shrinking. I bought the blue one for my older son and had it for over a year and we haven't had any problems. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.	
- 1	The elastic in the edges is too short&#8230;so when you put it on the changing pad it causes it to bow up in the middle. I had to cut the elastic in mine so now it is basically just a piece of fabric flopped over the pad.	
- 1	We got this monitor 2 years ago and for the last 9 or 10 months the screen has not worked. It hasn't been that big of an issue since I can still hear through it, until today. I moved the monitor to my daughter's room (from our room about 25ft away) and now I can't get the base and monitor to connect. I cannot troubleshoot the issue since 2/3 of the screen doesn't work so I cannot see if they are on the same channel etc. Now I have to buy another monitor (definitely not this brand!!) as I still use it for my daughter and have a baby on the way. If you are going to spend money, I highly recommend investing it in a worthy product.	
- 1	This is actually a great idea, but the idiots who packaged it created a ton of creases that are obvious once applied to the window and make it look like old window tinting that's coming off.  If they simply rolled the sheet up and sold it in a tube, we would not have this problem.Aside from this major negative, this is a great solution if you want to be able to roll the window down with the shade on it.  You can also cut it up into shapes/sizes to custom fit your window.Based on other reviews, I think a lot of people don't know how to install this correctly (blame it on the vague directions that come in the box).  So I am copying another reviewer's tips on installing from a similar product's page.  If you follow these tips, it should be a breeze (though don't expect the creases to go away):Here's what you do...1. Clean the window to remove any dust and lint.2. Remove the cling from package and avoid too many finger prints on it. Also, try not to place it on your car seats or anywhere that it can pick up dust/lint.3. Spray a light mist of glass cleaner on your window.4. Float the cling on the wet surface until you get it where you want it.5. Using an old credit card, work any bubbles/liquid out from the center of the cling towards the edges. Be careful to do this gently and slowly so that the card doesn't catch on the plastic and make a kink.6. Use paper towels to soak up glass cleaner as it seeps out from the edges.7. If you have any stubborn areas, lift the cling away from the glass, spray more cleaner, and repeat steps 5-6.	
- 1	I bought these thinking they were such a great idea. I had never heard of the woombie though so these were the first zip up swaddler I bought. I noticed my son could get his hands out of the top though and he seemed to wiggle around in them a lot and was always trying to stretch his legs out but his feet were at the bottom in it. Then I saw the woombie here on amazon and even though it cost more I decided to try it instead and I am soo happy I did! The woombie is more snug and he can't get his hands out of the top. They are also longer so he has room to wiggle his feet. The woombie is soo much better, I wish I never wasted my money on these! These would work well for you if you have a short chubby baby though, or if you want your baby to be able to suck on his fingers.	
1. 	No complaints about this one.  Baby loves it.  We love it!	
- 1	the bottle look smokey pink and cheap! not only that, it leaks all the time and the nipple suction is poor!!! have to take it off my daughters mouth to get air and for her to get milk again,	
1. 	This is pretty much a must-have for infant seats, I don't know why they don't just sell them together. Bases are great because you secure the base once with the seatbelt, then just pop the car seat/carrier in and out with a simple little latch. It also makes switching between other cars that have the same base a breeze. Definitely get this!	
1. 	It fits perfectly with my mini crib mattress. I havent had a practice run yet. Im still waiting for my baby to arrive.	
- 1	I bought the pink one...wanted to love this cup...paid $$$ a lot for it. Brought it home from the store...assembled it...tested the nipple part with my mouth...barely any liquid water came out. I had to turn the cup to the awkward edge of the nipple and squeeze and then liquid came out. You naturally want to put your mouth over the obvious wider flatter head of the nipple, but nothing comes out AT ALL. I am an adult too with heavy suction ability...NOTHING....but sideways, at a weird angle, I can get some out. Also, this frackin bottle leaked all over me. You have to really really really attempt to line up the nipple head with the screw indentions on the bottle. It doesn't naturally screw on. Poor Design.Update...the top is getting easier and simpler to screw on properly. But I still don't use it because of the nipple...I don't want to cut it either.	
1. 	These stay upright and don't fall over if you assemble them correctly and keep them in the proper hexagonal position.	
- 1	It fit the mattress but it did shrink even when washed according to the manufacture instructions on the tag. Would have returned if I could but I already washed it.	
- 1	I picked this inflatable spout cover over others because a friend had a similar one and it looked like the best protector - hers was always very full and much softer than the harder plastic versions. Compared to hers this one is okay- but definitely not the same. The two biggest problems are 1) I had a hard time inflating it (whether I tried to inflate it on or off of the spout). The air valve sticks out and it was difficult to get the air to stay in while putting the valve cover on. It doesn't hold much air so it is almost flat by the time I get the value closed. After a few tries it now has a decent amount of air but it is not full. 2) Our faucet has a pull up for the shower and this does not have a hole for it to pass through. We only use that tub for the kids/guests so there is not a regular need to use the shower but if you only have one shower this could be a pain!I will keep the cover because it will serve its purpose and I don't feel like messing with a return but I would not purchase this one again. I would try another brand...	
1. 	Any baby would hate a cold wipe. When my daughter was only 1 week old, I was going crazy and went to the store and bought this. She screamed every time we took her diaper off, and it was b/c she knew that cold wipe was coming!!! After we got this, she dosent mind at all. I haven't had a problem with it at all. Once in a while, a drop or two of water will spill out when you open it (I still havent tried the pop up wipes) but, usually it is b/c I have a little too much water in the bottom. Do keep the wet 'cusion' wet though... if you forget to wet it (usually 1-2 times a week) it becomes hard, and you will have to soak it to get it back to normal. I have bought the refill pad/ cusion for it as well. They come 2 to a pack and I think it cost me about $6 - $7 by mail including shipping. However, I just put the first replacement in - I used the original for almost 6 months.	
1. 	This is better than a Bassinett for the following reasons - when you bring your newborn home... you want to keep an eye on the baby, every breath and noise your baby makes you want to be able to quickly look over to see whats going on. This co-sleeper makes that possible. I baught a bassinett first and the next day i made my husband get the co-sleeper. I was constantly sitting up (straining my fragile post-birth abs) throughout the night. It doesn't look as 'pretty and fluffy' as a bassinett but it is the best purchase. We use the bassinett during the day in the living room or when I am up and walking around anyway. But for sleeping at night this is the BEST. Porta crib sheets fit right onto it too. It doenst come with music or anything but your newborn doenst need that for quite a few weeks. It has great storage underneath it aswell.	
1. 	I want to give it a higher rating, but my kiddo wasn't impressed. It didn't have the desired effect to help her get to sleep.The sounds are high quality (whales, heart beat, rain, water). Having volume control and timer settings are great.It can be strapped easily to a crib with the velcro behind it's head.Soft, fluffy fur.	
- 1	What I received was NOT a Medela plug!! The sticker on the package said Medela, but that is not what I received. It wasn't even what was in the picture. Thankfully I was able to call Medela and they replaced it for FREE with the proper adapter. Not only was it not what it said it made my pump work at half power!!	
- 1	I thought this nursery projector was the bee's knees until it randomly stopped working after 3 months.  It wasn't the sounds, but the projector.  No light at all.  At this time, my baby was an infant, and it was never dropped or damaged in any way.I emailed customer service, who gladly said they would replace the item since it was still in warranty.  I bought a second one, so that I would still have a sound machine while I was mailing this one off (I didn't know how to avoid this).  Munchkin also said that I would have to pay to ship it to them.  It cost me $10.  They send me a &#34;gift&#34; to make up for the shipping cost, which was a stroller cup holder.  Neat idea, but it doesn't fit ANY of my strollers.  It seems that they think stroller handles are very very thin.  I'm guessing they chose this gift because it is a poor seller?It took a while to get the new one, but I did receive it.  On the second one, the projector part stopped rotating after a month.  I'm not paying $10 to ship it to them again.  The other one I bought also had the projector part break very soon after.Basically, these things are a really neat concept, but obviously have very poor quality.  Too bad.  Munchkin.... why don't you just  charge us $5-$10 more and use quality parts that last???	
1. 	I got these after trying out one and falling absolutely in love with it.  First, it is really lightweight and the design is adorable.  Keith Haring being one of my favorite artists with those whimsical designs?  LOVE at first bite:) My little one loves the designs and the fact that it has an easy on easy off velcro is not a problem because when he's done eating, bib comes off quickly.  The pocket is so helpful in catching those little bits that toddlers toss down or drop en route to the mouth.  As well, it wipes clean easily and dries very quickly.  And even despite washing, those fabric bibs will retain some traces of odor or staining from food no matter how many times you wash them.  I love these.  I highly recommend the product for it's design, ease of use, and ease to clean!	
- 1	There is only a small timeframe that this tub is super useful during. When my son was first born, he was too light to push the sling down into the water, so as I was pouring water over him, he was getting goosebumps since he couldnt be semi-submerged. He was born at 8.5 pounds. Now, he is 4 months and about 15 pounds, and is pushing the sling down a little better, so it is working out fine for now. I foresee as he starts getting more and more mobile, that I am going to have trouble keeping him on the sling, because he is already wiggling quite a bit and isn't even sitting up yet. The sling is not adjusteable, but does come off and is washable. It is easy to rinse and get all of the soap off of him with the sling tho, and he seems pretty comfy for now... but as I am looking at the design a little closer, for later use that is, there is a huge plastic BUMP in the middle of the tub, I'm assuming to assist your little one when they start sitting up, but it looks so uncomfortable, and I'm reading everyone elses reviews about how their babies aren't able to stay supported by the bump. What I am thinking that I will try when my son gets to this point is a folded up bath towel completely underneath his butt, for comfort, and grip so he doesn't slide under the water or something. The little plug at the bottom changes from blue to white when the water is too hot, so that's a pretty nifty feature, and I like the side pockets for his baby wash and rinsing cup. Now behind where your baby's head would go, there are two other pockets that I am assuming are to prevent overfilling the tub. Well they defeat the purpose because they don't drain... They hold water, which collects soap residue, so that next time you fill the tub, that old dirty bath water that has been sitting there is now in the tub with your baby. You would have to turn the whole thing upside down after every bath, and who has time for that while you are trying to deal with drying off and watching your baby? I drilled holes in the bottom of these two pockets so that they now work properly. I really wish I would have purchased a different baby tub, but there are good features, and things can be done to make this tub more functionable.UPDATE: Just as predicted, my son is now 5 months old and was too heavy for the sling. He still isn't sitting unassisted yet, and this tub is a NIGHTMARE at this stage. He freaks out a little when the water begins to pool in the tub, and holds his breath while wiggling, and floats right up out of the little contoured spot for their bottoms. So then, the hump in the middle of the tub is jabbing him in the middle of his back and he is just floating in this awkward little bath tub! I refuse to fill it at all now, even though I never leave my son's side through the bath, but it just isn't safe at all! I'm lowering this one star. And the towel idea I had before DID NOT work at all. It just clogged the tub to where it didnt drain, and when my son floats up, the towel does too. Hectic bath time!	
1. 	fitted co-sleeper sheet, exactly like the one that came with the original bed. no shrinking in wash. shipped fast. will again in other colors.	
- 1	My 22 month old is psycho about what type of juicy cup he will use.  This had the type of straw he likes so I was excited to try it.  Everything is great; big size, tight lid, didnt leak, was ready to order more. Less than 24 hours after opening it, my son accidentally knocked it off the highchair onto the kitchen tile - he has done this dozens of times with his other cups except this one shattered and cracked.  I WAS SO BUMMED! I should have put a silicone koozie on it but why would I?  It is a thin glass like plastic- this wont work for us in a tiled/wood floored home.	
- 1	We have been using this baby monitor for almost 8 months.  At first we thought it was going to be a good fit for us.  It seemed almost too sensitive to noises, the red lights would flash when the baby rolled in her crib.  But the out of range light would flash and it would intermittently beep.  It wouldn't beep consistently though, seemingly only at night.  The clicks, pops and crackles are horrendous and wake us up frequently.  With the baby sleeping through the night we often resort to turning off the monitor at night, completely defeating the purpose.  Almost 8 months of use and it is now not picking up the babies noises very well.  I can hear the baby through the wall before the monitor picks up her sounds.  We have tried multiple channels to try and get rid of any interference but nothing seems to help.  About to chuck this monitor and replace it with something that will work.  Don't waste your money on this, read reviews carefully and go for something else.	
- 1	I am giving this chair two stars because I really think it's cute and it does do a good job of supporting my 4 month old who can sit up assisted. The watermelon theme and the tray were a bonus too, since I wanted to have something I could set her in and keep her occupied while I cook dinner and do chores around the house. The fact that it has straps so it can be placed on a chair is a nice touch too, so she could join us at the dinner table prior to introducing a high chair.However, the leg holes are too small. My daughter's thighs measure 12 inches around at their widest, and when set in this seat, the tray cannot snap into place because her thighs extend above where it clips in. It looks like she's a &#34;fat guy in a little coat&#34;. I thought &#34;oh well, we just won't use the tray&#34; but within five minutes she was struggling to gain some freedom. I feel this product would be great for a smaller baby, but for my chubby punkin', this just ain't it. SO BUMMED! Alas, the search continues.FYI: My daughter is 4 1/2 months old, measures 27 inches long and weighs 17 lbs. With super chubby thighs.	
- 1	This has some useful things in it but not enough to merit the purchase.  Get a nosefreida instead of the bulb thing, get baby nail scissors instead of the clippers, the teething tablets have been recalled and I can't get the medicine-dispensing pacifier open to put the medicine in.  Also the syringe tip is too large to fit in the opening of the pain reliever so doling it out is a pain on its own and the markings rub off the syringe making it useless after a few uses.  I don't use the teething toy.  I think the only thing in here that I actually use is the thermometer.  In the end, it's just easier to purchase the things you need separately.  This doesn't have anything magical in it that you would overlook...when baby has a snotty nose, you have to clean it; when baby has a fever/pain, you have to relieve it, etc.	
- 1	I bought this and another one at our local store.I have twin babies that have had this toy since three months old. When they were three months the thing was just too heavy and they couldnt grasp it because of the rings. So i put it away and forgot about it. Now they are six month old and i gave it to them today. Its made of such a hard material, or whatever it is, that when they miss their mouth and hit themselves in the forehead it hurts them! And me (i tried like another review :). The rings around the middle just gets in the way. I will be throwing these away. Its just not a great design for little babies who are still working on their fine motor skills. Way too solid and hard for them.	
1. 	I was a little nervous about buying these based on some reviews that said they got too hot or melted, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they actually work. On the box, it clearly says take them off if you are going to use the broiler. They get warm, but not too warm to open to adjust the dial. My 14 month old son goes straight for the oven when he's in the kitchen, and it's nice to see that he simply cannot get these open.	
- 1	Easy buckle harness in the front. How about the back?? Terrible hand-tie design is clumsy and time-consuming and does not fit tall backed chairs (which we have at home: 35h). I can understand a 1-size fits most issue; however, I do hope they revise this design with buckles on both the front AND back. Time saving features for parents are a MUST. I give it 2 stars for modern fabric choices. I returned this item.Also see my reviews for the BambinOZ travel chair (my final pick) and Snazzy Baby travel chair.	
1. 	Mobile is brighly colored-more appreciated by infants than some of the neutral toned swings.Long life when good batteries are used.Different settings to be used as weight increases. (Someone said that there was not a difference between settings. Not true! You increase the settings to keep up the speed as your baby gets heavier. If you use the highest setting with a 7 lb. baby, she'll turn into a milkshake!)Can light up- great to soothe at night.The mobile & seat are at correct angles so that the mobile can be enjoyed, unlike some other swings.I thought the $100 pricetag was totally nuts- but the entertainment for months & months has been worth every penny. One of my friends has a cheap swing with a stationary mobile- you will appreciate the difference!	
- 1	Warmer keeps wipes warm but the top pops open repeatedly no matter what we try making the top wipe cold and ultimately drying out the wipes.  I wouldn't buy this again	
1. 	I was a little unsure if this would work after reading some of the reviews but has stayed up for about 2 months now. My husband put it up and of course didn't read the instructions, i.e. the wall wasn't cleaned, wait 24hrs, etc. He just slapped it up there and it has stayed. Our shower is a regular fiberglass tub surround so it's very smooth, no fancy tile here so maybe that is helping it stay put. It is about half full and most toys are light weight. We do have one heavy toy that stays out and I am not going to test it out so that one stays by itself. I am very pleased with it and love scooping and rinsing the toys so easily. I will post a picture too.	
- 1	The Pipila seemed like a good solution for sterilizing while outside the home.  Unfortunately, it only sterilizes the nipple of the pacifier.  The rest of the pacifier will remain dirty, including the guard just beyond the nipple.  Baby will soon touch the unsterilized part of the pacifier, rendering the limited sterilization much less beneficial.	
- 1	Look for 100% cotton towels and skip these 80/20 cotton/poly blends.  They're not as fluffy as aden+anais towels, and they're super thin, so they're not warm either.  And because they're thin, they don't last in the washes as well either.	
1. 	This is an excellent gift for anyone who's expecting.  A friend of mine registered for this for her shower and was very happy to receive it.  It comes with pretty much everything a new mom needs and these Avent supplies are great quality.  The bottles seal tightly and all that.	
- 1	so i bought this mainly for the sun protection. while i think it does okay, for the price its not worth it. also i thought it would be good to keep the bugs out, but on both the sides, where the carseat handles meet the seat there is a huge gap that bugs can go into, which worries me more than not having the bubble on because if they get in i wouldnt be able to see them ! personally just a regular stroller/carseat net n a long light swaddle blanket are what i use. the idea is good, but needs some improvements.	
- 1	I was so excited to find a decorative play mat that would match our home decor.  We put it down and then took it up within a week because it shows dirt and footprints and every little thing too badly for our active family.  They are now sitting in the garage collecting dust.	
- 1	I know it says colors and designs may vary, but I assumed since solid colors are pictured I was going to get solid pacifiers...	
1. 	Great for spare parts for vintage baby bottle collection.  These were purchased to complete nippleless bottles I got for my collection (hey, some folks collect fishing lures, salt/pepper shakers, rocks, shoes&#8230;. there are more bottle collectors than one might think !!). Playtex is a reliable brand, and latex is the authentic material for many bottles.	
1. 	We love this high chair and it takes up much less space than our old one!!	
1. 	This product is a great idea, but this was buyer error on our part.  Our eating area was rather small so a high chair would have been a space taker, this product fit the bill EXCEPT we have a lip under the table all the way around and it was useless because by the time our son was ready to sit up and eat his little thighs were too big to squeeze under there (and he wasn't a 'big' baby).  My parents were able to use it with GREAT success for my nephew, so the product itself is wonderful - just MAKE SURE there's no lip!!!	
- 1	these are very flimsy and really don't hold anything. I took them off my grass and use the grass by itself.  not a very well thought of product	
1. 	I live in Massachusetts and wanted to make sure I could keep my baby warm when we went out. I looked at the BundleMe, but then read that it's not recommended by car safety experts because it sits between baby and the car seat bottom, somehow compromising the seat's performance in a crash. So I went with the CozyUp instead, and am very happy with it so far. It goes on very easily. I thought the head opening might bother my baby, having the fabric so close to her face, but it doesn't seem to. Getting her in and out of the carseat isn't any harder, and I feel confident going out that she is warm. I recommend this to other mothers.	
1. 	I LOVE these Under the Nile fruits and veggies. They are so very adorable and soft. I love that they are made of organic cotton, so they are safe for my daughter to chew on. I can't wait to purchase more for her & will be purchasing the entire fruit tote as a baby shower gift! We chose the banana because we thought it would be easiest for her to grasp at 5 months. The dog got some mud on it and so we just spot washed it and it came out looking just fine. I'm not sure if they can be thrown in the washer. We opted not to since we thought it would take forever for the inside to dry.	
1. 	so far so good. the hippo we purchased has been effective at preventing the child's head to hit the water spout. it has not come off yet either, which was a key consideration point, as other devices were too flimsy and easily taken off.	
1. 	These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it.  When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters.	
1. 	Great step stool for my two year old to use to wash his hand all by himself.  The non slip service works great!	
- 1	We loved the looks and size of this seat - thought it would be a great bridge from an infant seat to a booster seat and allow us to keep our daughter rear facing for awhile longer.  However, after buying it and trying to install it for over 45 minutes - we walked back into the store and returned it.  The directions are incomprehensible and the seat is impossible to install (rear facing at least - didn't attempt forward facing.)  No excuse for that - with latch system it should be brain dead simple but for some reason its not with this model.  We had the Chicco Keyfit infant seat and its so easy to to install so we were shocked when we could not get this one in correctly and could not decipher the cryptic directions.  Went ahead and bought the larger and admittedly uglier Britax marathon - had it installed in 5 minutes.  Happy with it after a few weeks of use.	
1. 	Nothing special about these plugs, other than you have to block those outlets!Hopefully the little ones in our home will never be able to pry them off!Will update review as needed.	
- 1	I thought these sounded like a good a good idea but it turned out to be completely weird.  You put food in the little net and then the baby is supposed to chew on it and suck the food out.  However my kids all found it strange to have the net in their mouth and nothing we put in these made the kids want to use them.  We threw them away shortly after purchasing them.	
1. 	I installed this with an infant on the floor and my husband at work - it's perfect. Dont get anything else!	
- 1	I'm going to start by saying right now - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I applied these according to its directions exactly, taking good care to secure the suction cups tightly, while I was cleaning my car.I then went inside. I came outside five minutes later and both had fallen, each time I tried to re-attach them, they fell right after I attached them. I then decided to roll them back up and take them down, but realized that the casing that holds the shade actually cracked by falling on a cushioned seat repeatedly.In addition, I attached them in mild 50 degree weather and the heat sensor said it was 'HOT', much too &#34;hot&#34; to touch!These are the most faulty piece of crap products I've ever purchased! The heat sensor is a sham in EVERY Munchkin product I have purchase, the suction cups are extremely faulty, and the shades never roll back up!Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	
1. 	I purchased this product 2 years ago for my son.  I used it every day until he could sit unassisted.  It gave me the opportunity to get a shower and promoted independence for my little guy.It is durable, cute, and easy to clean (machine wash fabric).My son loved the ocean waves/water sounds when he was younger, and then he enjoyed the baby activated feature (baby's movements activate the sound and bubbles) when he got a little older.Now, I am preparing my nursery for TWINS, and am searching for another bouncer exactly like this one!  Even now, when my 2-year old son sees it sitting in the nursery, he has to sit down and PLAY with it!This is a great, quality product at a great price- WORTH EVERY PENNY!	
- 1	I used this play yard for a couple weeks, until my baby, who is just learning to pull up to a standing position, fell and cut his head open on the rough plastic edges that stick out on the frame!  It's also not very sturdy, and super easy to push around, so when my son would try to use it to pull up, it would slide around the floor.  I'm returning this and getting a different type of enclosure for my son to play in that is safer.	
- 1	There are a ton of parts first of all... And, I don't see the benefit over other products that are far cheaper. Plus, it's only 4 ounces which doesn't seem like enough. I just wasn't super impressed - especially not for the price.	
1. 	good bibs for feeding baby food, as they catch what runs down the bib in the little pocket. NOT so good for using during bottle feeding. These bibs are a lot thinner material than I expected and the formula just soaks right thru.	
- 1	My baby didn't like it to be swaddle in this. I rather use a cotton blanket.	
1. 	Using the wheel to adjust this for a snug fit on our toilet seats was VERY easy, very pleased with this seat, it seems very comfortable for our 21 month old. Also recommend buying potty hooks for a few buck each (may be cheapest at BRU unless things change). I have a potty chair for my son but want him to have the option of using the big potty on a regular basis as soon as possible, so I am fitting each toilet in our house with one of these.	
1. 	Our daughter truly enjoyed this during her tummy time period. We have since given it to a friend who has a little one, and she loves playing with it when we visit... perhaps I was too hasty in giving it away.	
1. 	Short easy to get that cleaned a little oil. Appearance is very cute, I love babybjorn. Children 9 months, holding their own use.	
1. 	My daughter and I have thoroughly enjoyed the Boppy.  I haven't used it quite as much as I thought I would but I am definitely glad that we have one.	
1. 	We have an awesome little girl who just turned 4, and my husband and I thought she would like this. She has Autism, and isn't easy to buy for! She LOVES this! It is amazing how well it projects stars and the moon onto her ceiling, I had no idea it would be as amazing as it is. Even her 8 year old brother loves this thing, and her dad and I like it too. =) The colors are bright and vivid. Beautiful! If you are thinking about getting this, stop thinking and just do it! =) Your little one will LOVE it!	
- 1	The cards are gorgeous and well made, but I was disappointed at how few there are in the box. There are only 6 cards.	
- 1	My son outgrew the sling on his last tub, but he still isn't big enough to sit up yet, so I needed a transition tub.  I bought this one and just didn't have much good to say about it.  1- If you need to fold it up all the time, I could see how the legs are impossible to fold again.  2- The seat bottom is so difficult to blow up.  3- The air plugs for the seat bottom just kept coming open and leaking out air.  4- When he was in it, his head just rolled to one side so his ear and half of his head was resting in water.  5- I can see where this would be extremely difficult to clean (and even dry properly) because there are so many folds in the material.  The only good part I could see about this is when he gets big enough to sit up on his own, it has a nice cushiony bottom to sit on.  Sadly, I won't be keeping it that long to find out.  I'm going with one that has a nice contoured firm back.	
1. 	These are a great price (2 pack!) and cling fine to the window. They go on and off easily, and can even stick back on the window decently after a toddler grabs hold and crumples it into a sticky ball (tip - don't let a 2 year old watch you install it at first... he thinks it is a sticker). HOWEVER, I cannot see out of the rear driver side window of our small SUV with this on the window when trying to merge into traffic looking over my shoulder; we are just using it on the other side.	
- 1	After having for obly 6-9 months the monitor stopped picking up sounds. Over the course of two weeks it got worse and worse until it was completely useless. We could hear the baby crying in pain in her room but not through the monitor.Customer service waa okay. They were a little slow to respond though. They said having a new nursery unit should fix it and sent us the replacement. However,  even with the nursery unit replaced it srarted cutting in and out within a week.For an audio monitor this is not cheap. I wish I had gone with a cheaper brand. I could have replaced it almost three-fold and have it be worth it.	
1. 	I bought this inexpensive chair for use at my parents' house and I wish this is the one I would have gotten for myself instead of the more expensive one I have. This chair is a great space saver, it's an awesome little high chair. LOVE it.	
1. 	Our 3 year old has had these squirters since he was a baby and he still demands the crab and turtle for his baths.  As a baby I think he liked that they were soft and squishy and colorful.  As a toddler he loves filling them with water and squirting them.  When my niece visits, she loves the dolphin and octopus and together they have loads of fun squirting each other.They are soft enough that my son can still fill them with water when he can't with other squirters.  It's just a great, colorful set.	
- 1	I'm a huge Skip Hop fan, and now that my little guy (5 months) is starting to roll around, I wanted a soft surface for him to do his thing.  I really like the plain Skip Hop Playspots, and the cute animal tiles on the Zoo Playspot made purchasing it a no brainer.Sadly, after 3 weeks of light use, 4 out of the 8 animal tiles (which are painted on) are peeling and chipping like crazy.  The paint is actually rubbing right off of the tiles with a simple touch of the finger.  My little guy is certainly not at an age where he could do extensive damage to the tiles, we don't wear shoes in the house, and I've only cleaned the tiles with a soft cloth and plain water.  So I have to think that it's a problem with the product itself - which makes me nervous for when he gets a bit bigger and can chew on the tiles; I really don't want him eating the paint.If I could do it over again, I would just purchase one of the plain Skip Hop Playspots.  I've contacted Skip Hop directly to see if they can replace the painted tiles with just plain foam ones, or replace the Zoo Playspot with a plain one.  I hope they do, because aside from the quality of the painted tiles, I think this Playspot is great.***UPDATE: I'm happy to report that Skip Hop has offered me a full refund.  Apparently they would normally just replace the defective tiles, but because the Zoo Playspot is currently out of stock for a few weeks, they are refunding my order entirely.  Really a great customer service experience - I'm going to go ahead and order a plain Playspot now!***	
- 1	Edit: 6/7/2012Changing my review from 3 to 1 stars. We've only had this unit for 6+ months and after 1 fall on a CARPETED FLOOR it stopped working. I am stuck buying a new system (parent unit + camera), since the parent unit can't be ordered separately. All in all, this was not a good purchase: no support for multiple cameras in web cam mode, no calibration for the thermostat and no durability. Stay away.***We put this monitor through the paces this weekend.  Since we are having twins, we bought an additional camera.  Using the main screen, the images are bright and after some adjustment everything seems to work fine.  I have STRONG words of caution if you are buying this because of the Skype features or are planning to plug it into your Windows computer.*You need a CD drive to install the drivers.  There was no place to download the drivers.  You cannot find the product under the main Samsung.com website, you have to go to Samsungsv.com.  Something not smell right? Yeah...  But SamsungSV.com is no help either - no driver download, nothing.*There is no software that comes with this camera.  They don't mention any software and in fact there is nothing, only a driver that allows the camera to be used like a web-cam.  So officially you can't complain about this... but I do find it very odd.  I was expecting at least a lame viewing interface for your computer.*The image when viewing through the main monitor LCD screen is way larger than what appears when you view it as a web-cam.  So if you are aiming that camera at your baby and it looks great on the screen you are carrying around, odds are that most of your baby will be off screen if you try viewing it as a webcam.  This is aweful - in 2011 isn't digital information being carried through a USB cable still digital information?  Shouldn't the image information like image size and format stay the same??  But no.*When viewing as a web-cam, you can only see one camera.  This is very annoying. When using the main viewer, the cameras can be set to auto-rotate.  Works great.  When in USB web-cam mode, this is disabled for some unkown reason.  You CAN change cameras, manually, if you sit and hit the button on the viewer that is hooked into your computer, but that makes no sense if you are trying to use this device over Skype.  And the reason has to be just poorly written software.  Why sell a unit that can support 4 cameras but then not support all 4 cameras for internet viewing?  Sad, for an otherwise great looking product, especially if you have multiple kids/cameras.*Skype - well it works with Skype - sorta.  I was able to create a Skype account for the monitor that is hooked up to a dedicated computer.  It can be set to automatically connect to video calls, BUT for whatever reason the camera does not automatically come on, I just get an icon without video.  If I'm with the Samsung unit and the computer, during the call I can hit the video button and vwalla! it works.  But again, that doesn't work if you are trying to use it over Skype.  So I am very dispointed with the internet functionality of this unit.  I think the description is misleading in selling the Skype functionality.  Otherwise, I am happy with the portable monitor unit and the cameras.	
- 1	This product works and helps my baby get off to sleep.  BUT!!! As soon as the 45 minutes is up the sound shuts off and my baby wakes up.  If anyone knows how to make it go continuously, please let me know!	
1. 	The miracle blanket is the only blanket that my son won't escape from when he's swaddled.  Unfortunately the brown and green polka dot pattern faded after one wash.  Functionally it's still fine, but I'm disappointed that it looked like an old blanket before our son even got to use it.	
1. 	As with others, I debated on what size to get.  I really would prefer to get something they will grow into more than something they will quickly out grow, so I bought the large.  I bought the lady bug and the bumblebee for 14 month old boy/girl twins.  The boy is taller than the girl, so his feet almost reach the floor, but he hasn't figured out how to make it go when he is riding on it.  They both enjoy sitting on them, but they have the most fun pushing them around.  Bumper cars, anyone?  The girl had fun recently putting a stuffed animal on one and then pushing it around.  It will be interesting to see what they use them for in the coming months, as well as watching them learn to make them go while riding on them.  These are so cute.ETA:  My biggest concern when purchasing this was which size to buy.  I went with the larger and am glad I did.  As mentioned above, at 14 months, their feet didn't reach the floor enough for them to propel themselves, but they still enjoyed them.  They are now 18 months and both are beginning to make them go for short distances.  Their 3 1/2 year old cousin was on them recently and he didn't look too big for them.  They are holding up well.  The only problem with them is when the twins use them as a step stool, but that isn't a flaw in the product!	
1. 	For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item.  It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides.  (If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.)  I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area.	
1. 	We purchased this activity center when our son was about 6 months old.  For the past 4 months, it has been in daily use in our household.  He absolutely loved it, and I loved having a safe place to put him to be occupied for a few minutes. The center has supports that can be pulled up to allow it to rock, but we never used those as our son did not like them. It was relatively easy to put together, although a found getting the chair/sling in correctly a bit confusing and it can be challenging to remove and clean.  We have washed it several times, and it still looks great. The variety of toys was good for him, although we did end up giving a few loose toys too, as he liked to have something to drop on the floor! He is now 10 months old and still uses it sometimes, although not nearly as much as when we first purchased it.____I wrote the above review for son no. 1.  Son no. 2 has since come along, and this product was great for him too.  It has held up remarkably well through 2 kids.  The seat is only slightly faded, and all of the other toys are still working great.  This product was subject to recall, but the company was very timely in providing us the replacement product.  I still use it (rarely), when I need a safe place for the 16 month old for just a few minutes.  He is small for his age and still fits, but won't tolerate the confinement very long.	
1. 	We use the diaper depot for our Pack and Play playard. It's not a perfect fit, but it works, and it sure beats running around to get diapers, wipes, etc. I gave the diaper depot 5 stars despite two things:1) The opening for the diaper stacker is a little big, so sometimes an extra diaper slides out. In Prince Lionheart's defense, this may be necessary to accomodate larger sized diapers.2) The side containers could have been a little deeper.Besides these minor nuiances, it's a great product.	
- 1	These tubes cause WAY more condensation to form inside them than the official Medela ones. I have to keep my pump running for minutes on end after I'm done just to get rid of that condensation and make sure no mold grows in them. I don't quite understand how the different material can cause more condensation, but it does. Next time I'll get official Medela tubes.	
- 1	Pros:- Excellent picture quality- Great color and night vision- Both units operate on battery, with some power saving options built in.Cons:- Super janky design.  Camera unit is white, monitor unit is a pale, hospital yellow.  Yuck.- Camera unit has a 2-3 inch &#34;tale&#34; sticking out (which I think is the microphone), which is only shown in 1 of the many marketing photos.- Battery covers were VERY hard to remove.- Monitor settings are VERY confusing and not well explained, even in the detailed operating manual (which was not included in the box, I had to go the website to get the PDF.)	
1. 	Great cups, last a while and last through many dishwasher runs.  However, it's so strange that the tops come in colors that are different from the cups.  When you have a picky toddler who simply MUST have the green cup with the green top, that makes life tough as you try to explain there simply is no green top.	
1. 	I bought 2 of these and am very happy with them. I have one up using the pressure mounted. That one stays up most of the time and is not moved often. I have the other one installed. It swings like a door and locks into place when closed. That one is opened and closed all the time. I have had no issues with them. I like the fact that she can't climb up them either.	
- 1	This thing stinks.  Literally.In no time at all, your bathroom will smell like a truck-stop restroom.  This thing has so many cracks and crevices, that any aim that isn't spot on leaks into the interior, where it dries and starts to stink.  See those green handles?  Well, they attach to the rest of the toilet through holes in the top.  If your kid misses a little and pees on the seat, it runs into the handles holes and drips into the interior, where it pools in various chambers.As others have mentioned, the pee shield is worthless.	
- 1	I was super excited to learn about these testing strips but I have not used them more than 3 times in the past 3 months. I wish they would have varying shades for levels of alcohol detected to I knew exactly how much was in my milk. Instead, they turn dark brown even at the slightest bit that may not harm your baby, which causes you to waste milk. Now, I just use good old fashioned common sense. If I have a glass of wine, I wait an hour or two to feed my baby. If I feel buzzed, I pump and dump  and then wait to feed him for the next feeding.	
1. 	My 9 month old loves tags and strings that stick out from anything.  So I thought these taggies blocks would be great for him.  The blocks are colorful and each block has different tags and strings and crinkles and jingles.  Absolutely adorable!  You can hang them in your stroller to keep them busy.	
1. 	Love these things.  I would give a 5 star, but they are hard to keep clean.  As some reviews noted, bananas are hardest to clean out of these things...but I find if you soak it in a cup of water as soon as you are done with it, they rinse out well and then I clean in the dishwasher.  My 6 month old can hold it, and chews/sucks on apple and pear slices.  He is a little young to give a whole apple slice to chew on...but this way he gets the same benefit with minimal supervision.  Would also work well if you put in the freezer when they are teething.	
- 1	This thing is a waste of money. It's bulky, and I honesty don't care if it clips to the stroller... My diaper bag clips to my stroller and guess what, I can take wipes out of my diaper bag when I need them. Also it does not stay closed and even if it is closed, I found that my wipes were drying out in it. Let me save you first time moms some trouble... A ziplock bag makes an excellent &#34;wipes case&#34;. This is another one of those baby products that you don't really need.	
- 1	This adorable little turtle (so cute my kids fought over it) does not keep an accurate temperature.  In a tub full of ~100 degree water, he consistently read 72-74 degrees.  Tried resetting, no luck.  If I didn't already have a pretty good idea about the water temp, I could have really scalded my kids.  Cute, but unsafe, unsafe, unsafe.  Returning it immediately.	
- 1	I've owned this carrier for eight months and I'm getting rid of it.  Based upon the positive reviews, it works for the majority but not me.  I was very hesitant to spend a lot of money on a carrier but based upon much research, I was convinced that this was the one.  After seven children, I've tried many carriers but cannot say that I have a favorite, yet.  Most carriers have cons and this one had way too many for me to continue to use.  First of all, from birth, I could never get my baby's face to stay up.  She always managed to turn inward no matter how I adjusted everything.  That made me nervous because I was afraid that she couldn't breath.  I had to support her head while in the sling with one arm which was very inconvenient and uncomfortable.  As my baby grew, I used this carrier less and now that she's 8 months, I can't bare to have her in this sling longer than 20 minutes.  I'm always adjusting it because it rides up my neck and all her weight baring down over one shoulder HURTS!  I don't see how anyone could carry a toddler in this thing.  The instructions make it seem so easy to pull the sling down a little over the opposite shoulder to tighten it, but it's not that easy.  It's versatile and I did like that I could nurse her while staying covered and multitasking, BUT that alone wasn't worth the price if I really couldn't use it long.  I toggled back and forth between this carrier and the Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier.  The Infantino carrier isn't really useful during the newborn stage, but once your child grows, it's much more supportive,  comfortable and cheaper.  I can't recommend spending so much money on a carrier that isn't comfortable after a few months.	
1. 	I bought 4 packs of these lids...they fit my ameda pumping bottles too.They are great lids to have for almost any baby bottle or milk storage bottles. No leaks, easy to clean, easy to store.Fast shipping.	
1. 	my son has had this for a little over a year now i'd guess.  it is cute and the suction cups work very well on the two different baths/showers that we have used it on.  my son played with it as a basketball hoop at first, and now we just use it to store some of his bath toys in because his other storage container is too large for our current bathtub.  overall, very happy with the product because even if it is not played with much any more it is still useful to have around.  would buy again.	
1. 	She's 7 months and the batteries have just now needed replacing.  She can turn it on all by herself now by kicking the huge buttons or if i give her the remote. And it's so high there is no way she can get herself tangled in it, so it is not a hazard!  At first I thought it was too stimulating for her but now it is just what she needs to entertain herself while I get 30 minutes more sleep	
1. 	We've not used this long, but I like it so far. It's lightweight and easy to attach to a chair. The slick plastic material is easy to clean off, and I love that it doesn't take up much space. Would be good for travel, too, I imagine.	
- 1	It was so heavy I was afraid it would fall off in the middle of the night. Ended up going with the Dreambaby Stove Top Guard instead.	
- 1	I really wanted to love this bath, but I don't.It is just too big even in my rather big bathroom.My baby wasn't really into this tub either.I'm still keeping it in case if we have another baby.If you are having a first baby, I would recommend using Infant Bath Seat from primo.It is easy to use, clean and store. My baby liked it better.	
1. 	I tried 6 different cup holders for my Baby Jogger City Versa (LOVE the stroller, by the way) and none of them worked until I tried this one. It was relatively easy to install and it fits great. The cup holder is big and feels sturdy. I was also able to easily remove the stickers so the cup holder looks like it belongs with my stroller. The stroller folds easily with the cup holder attached so there is no need to ever remove it.	
- 1	I thought I was purchasing a stroller that would fold up nicely in the back of my car, but even folded up it is too big. The stroller takes up the back of my SUV and leaves barely any room for anything else. Wish I had bought some thing smaller. Definitely cannot pack the stroller if I'm planning to get groceries.	
1. 	This is great for anyone with the Avent bottles.  A friend of mine got some of the bottles and the breast pump at her baby shower.  After a couple weeks of use she decided to get this sterilizer.  It's just much more convenient for her.  Takes much less time than the alternative!	
- 1	These toys are fun, but it seems no matter how dry you get them, black mold will eventually form inside.	
- 1	You are NOT to leave a child unattended in this chair, however, I immediately returned this to the store, in lieu of its rewards, when I observed how my baby would arch her back and lift out of the chair.If you are considering this maybe try the one with the tray which would prohibit such movement and possible injury.	
- 1	The picture is misleading. It will give you the impression that there were 5 pcs you are buying although you are just really buying one. The price itself is too expensive for a 1 piece garment. On top of that, returning it is so difficult because you cannot use online service to do it. You have to call customer service to actually do it because &#34;it requires special handling&#34;. Don't buy this.	
1. 	We love this!  We got it for our baby trend carseat and it fits perfectly and the color matches perfectly.  It's like a sleeping bag for babies and keeps our little one super warm and cozy without sacrificing safety.	
1. 	we bought this almost a year ago- when my daughter was just a couple weeks old. we have used it at every nap and bedtime (if we were home) she LOVES the ocean waves, but the whales make her fussy. anyway- when she was newborn, the sound would immediately put her to sleep, now, when we lay her down and turn on her sheep she just rolls over and listens til she falls asleep. she can and does sleep without her sheep, but with two other kids in the house i needed something to drown out the constant noise, and this did the trick. i still have it attached at the foot of her crib, hanging from the top, facing her, i just push the button through the slats of her crib, no problem at all.batteries last a very long time, volume goes up much higher than i have ever needed, you can have it on for 23 or 45 minutes, usually 10 is plenty for us. definitely would recommend this sheep.	
- 1	Pros:-Inexpensive-2 parent units-Good sound qualityCons:-Battery life is aweful - turned off completely, the battery didn't even hold a charge a day.  When on, maybe got a couple of hours tops - nowhere near the 9hrs claimed.-Frequently lost connection at seemingly random times.  It does beep to let you know it's lost connection which is helpful but also very annoying as it would happen half a dozen or more times per day.  You need to power off the unit, power back on and it will reestablish connection which is very tedious.  Range didn't seem to make any difference and my setup is definitely on the low end of the range scale (30-50ft max). After reading other reviews this issues doesn't seem to be isolated but a frequent occurence with this model.Overall, the 2 cons make this product unfit for its intended purpose. Fortunately Amazon is great about returns and I was able to return 6 months later no questions asked.	
1. 	I had one of these on loan from a friend with my son and it was absolutely perfect for an in room crib/bassinet. It allowed me me to feed him and get him back down without all the extra fuss since he was such a gassy baby. We actually disassembled and took everywhere we went where he would be sleeping (friends, vacation, family) it was a great product because of the gliding and music. Even recommended to a girlfriend who was having a hard time with a baby who didn't want to sleep more than 2-3 hours- first time she used he slept for 2 more additional hours and cried telling me thank you!	
- 1	The pattern is not worth the price difference. You can get a plain organic cotton cover for the same money & be much better off. I bought a few Summer Infant patterned covers like this one along with a solid organic terry cotton one (also Summer Infant) and now I wish I had gotten all of them in organic cotton.The material on these feels very plastickey to me, almost like they would not absorb water. I don't like touching it let alone have my baby's head rest on it. The pattern is very cute but I use a pad liner which covers most of the surface so I don't get to see pattern too often.LOVE the 100% solid color, organic cotton version of these though.On the plus side, they fit the pad very well and I like that they have slits on the side for the safety buckles to come through though I am not using the buckle yet, I guess I will when baby is older.	
- 1	The connecting parts between the units serve as perfect little ladders for a baby to climb up and fall out. And the suction cups don't stick to the floor. So my 17 lb baby is strong enough to push the whole play yard wherever she wants it!Don't waste your money on this unsafe structure...	
1. 	My baby wears one of these every day, and they are holding up well.  I like how they don't have cutesy sayings or pictures on them; they can just blend with whatever outfit she has on.  One word to the wise: the velcro is very strong (which is a good thing!), so make sure you have the velcro clasped together when you wash them.  Otherwise they will snag everything else in the wash.	
1. 	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.	
1. 	I would recommend this product. This elephant has provided many hours of enjoyment for my grand daughter. It is sturdy and she loves the musical sounds that go off when she puts the balls into the elephant's head. I love it because it is not too loud. She is creative with the rings--putting them on her arms like bracelets.	
1. 	My son could not get enough of these.  We would put a piece of melon in them and put them in the freezer, he would get so happy and excited as soon as he saw the colors and knew he was getting some relief and some sweet melon.  We tried grapes, bananas, carrots, and several other things.  The veggies did not go over so well, the bananas were kind of hard to clean but most of the other fruits were great.	
1. 	In the middle of the night when the baby is screaming and you need milk - FAST.  Carefull to check the milk, sometimes can be too hot too fast!	
1. 	Being a new mom after many years is a wonderful feeling! I love the ease of using these bottles. It is must better to just toss the liner when baby is done instead of cleaning bottles every night. It makes being a mom so much easier! I would highly recommend these to any new parents.	
- 1	you obviously need this to clean the straw cups but within a week of using them the long piece that you clean the actual straw insert with came apart.  not well made.	
1. 	We got this mainly for beach trips.Note: It does have quite a chemical smell to it when first opened.  We aired it outside for a few hours.  It was fine after that.It's soft and has a small amount of padding.  Its a very slippery, smooth material that is easy to clean.  After being at the beach with it, we just shook it off and all the sand came off.I like how easy it is to fold and take with you.  No more shoving a giant beach blanket in our beach bag.  This bag can easily be slung over the shoulder.  Colors are cute and vibrant.A good buy for families. I see us using this ALL the time, just keeping it in the trunk for when we need it.  We have three kids, including a new baby, and this is just perfect for park trips, picnics, parades, beach trips, whenever the grass is wet!	
1. 	Babies spit up/drool A LOT, and you have to keep it dry or they'll rash up under all their chins.  I had a surplus of baby clothes, but never enough bibs as the baby would go through 7-8 a day.  I liked these bibs so much I ended up ordering THREE sets of these.Pros:-design of the bib is great.  The liner between the terry ensures maximum absorption but no leakage through.  So many bibs get this part wrong: it's either not absorbent enough (so the spit up just rolls right off and INTO YOUR LAP), or it absorbs completely through (and gets baby's clothes wet).  You need the terry to capture the spit up, but you also need the liner to keep it contained.-price is good/cheap considering it's a 10pack-nice bright colors that hold over time-liner also gives/keeps bib in a nice shape (the bibs don't just wrinkle into a mess like some other all-cloth ones do)-machine washable/dryer use is ok.  I think on the instructions they say to hang out to dry or dry on low, but I just toss them in the dryer with all the other items and 4 months later they are still in great condition.  Moms with babies don't have the TIME to hang things out to dry!	
- 1	I like the scent but if only i was a litle stronger tocarry all around the room, youhave to place like one on each cornerwhen you walk into the room youwon't smell it unless you actually sniff it	
- 1	When my baby was born, the only bottle she took was the Breastflow bottle because all other bottles' nipples had too fast of a flow.  So we used the Stage 1 nipples until she was 2+ months and then I switched to these nipples because I thought they'd be faster.  Well, they are SLIGHTLY faster.  Really, the design of the nipple (the inner and outer nipple) really slows down the milk flow REGARDLESS of how big the holes are... so at 5 months, my baby was SO frustrated with this bottle.  It would take 40 minutes to give a 7-oz bottle.  I wish The First Years made a nipple and collar that transitioned to just one nipple so you could reuse the bottles, but we ended switching bottle entirely to the Avent Natural line.For comparison, my baby took 40 minutes for a 7 ounce bottle with this nipple.  With the Avent Natural line, a 1+month nipple and bottle resulted in a 10 minute feeding - BIG DIFFERENCE!Don't bother getting these nipples... if you're looking for faster flow, invest in a new bottle.	
1. 	I got this for my 11 month old because she was starting to tell us when she was wet and needed a change by pointing to her changing table or upstairs. Sometimes she would even tell us ahead of time. We are not planning to put any pressure to train at this age but we thought it would be good to have it on hand and get her familiar with it.To our surprise she figured out what it was for without a lot of fanfare and will go and stand on it or near it when she wants to use it. She doesn't use it every time, but has a handful of times and for sure is on the path to diaper freedom.Pros:Comfortable for the little one (she is about 20lbs)The inside comes out for cleaning and there are not any seams to gather gunk.Looks like a real toilet.Cons:Won't work as a seat on a real toilet.The back is smooth, slippery and tapered with no handle which makes it hard to grasp.Pro tip: If you are going to wear the inner liner like a top hat to make your child laugh, be aware she may try it on herself at some point. D'oh.	
- 1	The suction cup at the bottom really is there to prevent it from tipping or moving with gentle movements. Not by a determined infant.	
1. 	baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome. especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty. Ziplock is useful but not reuseable. It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots. This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.	
- 1	Many moms swear by amber teething necklaces. I purchased this one out of desperation. My infant son was constantly fussy for no apparent reason, so I tried the teething necklace. I guess teething wasn't his issue at that time, because it made no difference. It also annoyed him. When he was older and I was sure he really was teething, he hated the necklace and wouldn't even let me put it on him--neck, ankle, wrist, anywhere. Eventually I gave the necklace away to a neighbor.It is well made. The clasp and the beads all seemed secure. No problems with quality.	
- 1	i didn't like these. for some reason they would leak if i didn't take my time and do it exactly right every time. it would &#34;click,&#34; but would still leak.oh well, bout some at target that i love and don't leak.	
- 1	The sticky pads that hold the base onto the side of my dresser didn't stay sticky for long, and my son was able to pull them off.	
1. 	Working full-time and pumping at work and at home.  Needed the extra set.  Didn't hurt when I saw them come with the nipples for those emergency feedings in the car!	
1. 	My wife and I chose this Playtex feeding system for our first child.  We had some standard bottles, also.  We found that the Playtex system avoided the baby ingesting a lot of air when sucking.  Therefore the baby got more nutrition and we had to do less burping.  I highly recommend this system as a baby shower gift.Be careful putting these plastic bottles in a bottle warmer and dishwasher with a drying coil.Gunner  March,2012	
1. 	When my baby started walking the knobs on the stove were his obsession...we found these and they solved our problem!! at first they are a bit annoying but you get used to them...we've had them on for 2 years now... i just have to clean them every couple of weeks...Great idea!	
- 1	Nice sling, well made with very pretty fabric BUT IT DOESN'T FIT! I measured myself with a tape measure and according to the official Hotslings size chart I measure a 24&#34; from shoulder to hip which is 2&#34; below the maximum size for their regular size sling.when it arrived it barely fit over my frame at all- let alone with the baby in it! I had it adjusted so the buckle's cinches were all the way out and it was as big as it would go. It was way too small. So irritating!	
1. 	Our oldest is 3, and this diaper pail has been doing its job, right next to my bed that entire time (now containing the stinky diapers from our younger son for the past 19 months).In light of the 600 other reviews for this product, I'll boil it down to these four points:(1) It really does contain smell, despite its simplicity. I have a very sensitive nose, and the only time I catch the odor from within is if I purposely hold the two flap doors open and take a whiff, or when I'm changing the bag and compacting the full one with my knee to squeeze all the air out (definitely an outside task -- stinky!).(2) Price the bags before hand, because as others have pointed out, they're the real expense over time.(3) Our secondary flapper door was hanging open the past few weeks, probably the result of a loose spring affected by corrosion (the air stays moist inside this pail). I shopped around for a repair kit and came up empty, so emailed the company. They quickly -- and gratis -- sent out a replacement flapper door that easily snapped into place.  Problem solved.(4) It's pretty durable. Our oldest regularly climbs and sits on this -- says it's his rocket. He hasn't managed to break anything, despite it being very conventional construction (i.e. lightweight, not overbuilt, though I hesitate to call it flimsy).	
1. 	I have a week old baby and he falls right asleep in this.  I put the side guards close enough together for him to feel really snug so he feels like someone is still holding him.  I'm able to put him down and hold the sides close together and rock him for a few seconds and he falls asleep really fast.  I feel more secure knowing that he's nice and secure in his basinet.	
1. 	This protector does the job on preventing dents in leather seats.Remember that these days any type of professional is afraid of a lawsuit, and do not want to use any type of aftermarket product that could interfere with their professional installation. That is why no one will approve these mats, or even cupholders on strollers anymore!!!As a carseat safety fanatic, and being pretty educated on carseat installations I felt confident that I could make a decision if this was inhibiting a proper installation. I see no problems. To be sure the carseat is strapped in super tight, I sit in it as I pull the straps. It doesn't budge one centimeter left or right, or front to back.This saver was easy to put in the car, and did not need to be adjusted a million times as I tightened in the carseat using LATCH & tether (we use the Britax Marathon). A previous saver bunched and made installation impossible, but this one is very thin, firm and stays put. The add on back was the perfect height, and did not block the tether strap in our F150. It also stayed upright as I put the carseat into place.This blends in nicely with our black seats and looks good. It's available in three colors - black, tan, and grey. Let's face it - if you're interested in this product it's because you care how things will look long term!This saver is a great combo of safety and function. While it may not perform perfectly with every single carseat/car combination - if your seat is moving more than an inch in any direction it's not installed correctly whether you are using seat saver or not!	
1. 	We LOVE this product!  I got it for my little girl and now my older (6 & 8) boys want one!  It does exactly what it says it does, simple functions that the kids can operate themselves if needed and it's adorable to boot!	
- 1	My toddler hates this thing! The only time she will go near it is after I've put it in the freezer and give it to her chilled. Being that it's marketed as a training toothbrush and I wouldn't allow my daughter to chew on it unsupervised, I would never use it at a toothbrush. The bristles are actually the same material as the rubbery banana.If I hand it to her she walks away from it and says No. She's perfectly happy with her brand new big girl tooth brush. It depends on the child I suppose. But the bristles on this thing are completely useless. I brushed her teeth with this, noticing areas that were not very  clean. I switched to her other tooth brush that she likes much better, and the spots this tooth brush left behind were cleaned without a single issue. It's unfortunate that I wasted money on this product.	
1. 	Seriously, she made me stop using these on cabinets she needs to get into.  I think they're very easy to use, so there you have it.  Remember if momma aint happy, aint no one happy.	
- 1	Our Summer Infant Best View (no longer in production) finally stopped working.  We had a tough time finding a replacement product that had all of the same features we loved: good range, quality picture in both light and dark, remote pan, portable handheld monitor, and good parent reviews were a few of our top priorities.  The description of the Graco True Focus, along with the price and reviews seemed to fit the bill with the one exception of remote pan, which we could live without to save the extra $70 it would cost to get that feature on another model.Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and we ended up returning it.  The biggest drawbacks for us were the night vision picture, and the limited range, which came in nowhere close to the claims on the box and the website.  After having other video monitors work well in our house - both our Summer monitor as well as visiting friends' other brands, we were very disappointed at the constant Linking error that would come up regularly when we were a mere 50 feet away (again, nowhere close to the 1000 ft claim on the box).Pros:- Price for the features claimed- Daytime picture clearer than other video monitors I've seenCons:- Effective range of less than 50 ft. compared with well over 200-300 feet with other monitors (we were able to walk a few houses away with the old monitor, and still have a reliable signal)- Night vision picture required constant fiddling with brightness settings - sometimes appeared to just be a big white screen, with little definition of what was on camera.  I could have lived with this if the range had lived up to claims.Luckily Amazon took the return after we tried it out for a little over a week - desperately hoping that it would somehow begin to link more consistently.  We definitely wanted it to live up to expectations, but unfortunately it did not.	
1. 	This is SO much easier to bath my little boy in than the big tub. He loves to splash in it and can even lounge on the duck tail when he feels like it. There are a few down sides, though. I was expecting it to be a little bigger than it actually is. My baby is 28 inches long and when sitting in the back (by the tail), his feet almost touch the front of the duck. I was really disappointed about this. That means we can only use it for a few more months before it will have to retire. Another thing, by looking at the pictures, I thought maybe the blue part on the inside of the duck changed color from blue to white if the water was too hot, but no. That's not the case. There's a little blue circle on the bottom of the tub that says 'HOT' and you can only see it if the water is hot (obviously). You have the option to hang the tub up with a little suction cup on the bottom, but I haven't had any luck getting it to stay. Our bathroom (and apartment in general) is pretty small, and the duck, when blown up, is pretty big. It takes up a lot of space, and I really don't want to have to blow it up every night to give the boy his bath. We still haven't found a place to put it. Anyway, overall, I think this was a great purchase for the time being!	
- 1	I got this pump, because my electric one was a little noisy and I didn't like waking up my daughter in the middle of the night. At first the pump worked great... getting rid of the engorgement and pumping out most of the milk.Then it started making slurping noises and the rings for suction started to not go on properly (I have never sterilized any parts in a sterilizer or anything else or placed any of the parts in a dishwasher, so the reason for the parts not fitting right can't be because of them being warped or damaged in someway by me).Then, my milk supply started to diminish, due to the pumps inability to stimulate my breasts to keep producing, but I guess this feature would be good if you wanted to stop breastfeeding and ease the engorgement. I had to switch to breastfeeding exclusively, with no bottles, to stimulate my milk supply back, but now my daughter refuses to take a bottle what so ever.So now the pump just sits in it's little travel bag collecting dust, what a waist of $50.00.	
- 1	I bought this product because of the reviews I read about it.  However it DOES NOT keep out the smell of dirty diapers.  I have used it for 7 months now and had to go buy a different one. If you are like me, you want the products you buy to do the intended job.  This is not what you want.  Get the Diaper Champ or use a regular trash can and put it out of the way (extra bathroom, laundry room, etc.)	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for. this does not work. I ordered it to replace that horrible bulb but it does get anything out of my baby's nose! Had to go back to the bulb	
1. 	I got this for my daughter when she was about 4 months and it was good to help her learn to sit up. She liked having a little independence (I didnt have to hold her up) and we could play. Now that she is 6 months and sitting on her own, I think she wont want to use it anymore, so Im a little sorry we didn't get more use of out it. The strap is good in theory, but never really fit her right and is hard to open and close, so we rarely used it. I just never left her side when she was in it, and she did try to move a lot so I could see how she might be able to fall over if she really tried.Good for a short time, don't know if I would buy it again at full price knowing that.	
- 1	I am a new mother and my daughter is now almost 5 months old.  We have had this toy since she was born.  I thought it would be a fun toy for her but so far she has not been very interested.  Occasionally she will pick the wrist rattles up and look at them.  When I put the socks on her they do not help her find her feet.  The rattle does not make enough noise to hold her interest.  If you are a first time parent considering this toy I would skip it.  Your baby will find their feet on their own.	
1. 	This is a wonderful product. My 14 month old loves to look at the stars on the ceiling before drifting off to sleep. This mama loves looking at the stars too! =)	
1. 	This is the second swaddling blanket I have bought.  Both helped my baby sleep better and longer.  The first one was a different brand and used Velcro to keep it swaddled.  The Velcro didn't stick well for long.  It only somewhat keep my baby swaddled.  This one does not use Velcro and stays swaddled all night.  It signals my baby that its bedtime and keeps that jerk reflex from waking him up.  We get much longer periods of sleep as a result.	
1. 	My baby loves this teether.  In fact, this teether -- and the green 4 month Combi teether - are the only ones she's ever actually used.  The quiet rattle and shape keep her attention and make her reach for it when I hold it up.  Plus, the ring shape makes it very easy for her to grip and crawl around with.  A good girlfriend recommended this product to me when I told her I couldn't find a pacifier or teether my daughter would use(and believe me, we'd tried a lot--MAM, Green Sprouts, Nuby, and on and on). I'm so glad she did!	
1. 	I have to agree with many of the reviews here...these outlet plugs manage to keep babies and adults from accessing outlets pretty effectively, but that was why I bought them.  It seems there are two types of outlet plugs available at this point: those that babies can figure out in very little time (and are easy for parents to remove too) and those that keep babies out (yet give parents trouble as well.)I have lupus and even in the middle of a flare, when my hands are very weak and stiff, I can still get these plugs out even though it requires a good deal of effort.  They do give me confidence though that my baby is safe--now he's only 8 months, but is very active and I'm sure would figure out other plugs in no time.  So far, he has seen these, touched them, and lost interest pretty quickly.  I do have to say, though, that I have access to some outlets placed higher on the wall that I use for vacuuming, kitchen appliances, etc. and have tried to minimize the need to take these plugs in and out of high-use outlets.	
1. 	Awesome idea!! We love these snack cups. The lid is made of soft silicone and allows for your little one to reach in and grab a snack but not dump them out when they decide to dance and shake it.Great product! Super glad my sister in law got these for us and I will definitely pass them on to all the mom to be's I know!	
1. 	We bought this as a play mat for our new baby... but her big sister loved it so much that she &#34;borrowed&#34; it before her sister was born and has not slept without it since (almost 6 months ago).  Highly recommend and will probably buy another.	
- 1	The covers didn't stay on very well.	
- 1	I bought this to go with the set of Dr Brown's Bottle set I bought my daughter for her baby shower. She didn't like how complicated the system was to clean the bottles and ended up using another brand of bottles.	
- 1	i have my issues with these. the cleaning instructions make these a chore and a half - do not soak, and then wash first in cold, then in hot. seriously, who has time for two washes? i might be a SAHM but i have a lot to do besides washing diapers all day. too, the energy required for washing diapers twice kind of negates the earth-saving, keep non-biodegradable crap out of landfill reasons i wanted to go cloth anyway. so...  i wash the covers by hand when they need it, and i soak the inserts in cold water with a bit of oxyclean overnight prior to a hot wash.also, no one warned me that once you get yer babe all decked out in one of these setups, none of your cute newborn clothes will fit her, especially if you've got a little fatty like i do - she's got really limited time in those adorable newborn clothes everyone gave her anyway, and so...i signed up for Amazon Mom, got myself a subscription for Nature Baby eco-disposables and got 160 of them for $30 - yep, she's a breastfed newborn who goes through about ten a day, and disposables are a money hemorrhage for sure, but other than the elastic and the tabs, they're natural (no gel) and quickly compostable in a landfill. i'm putting the flips aside until she poops a little less constantly and we have some clothes that might actually fit over these things... we're also starting a little bit of Elimination Communication since she's pretty easy to predict - and perhaps that will save me a little effort in dealing with having to wash diapers all the time.	
1. 	This set contain all the bottle that you need for the first six months. good product and I had been use this over six months. Highly recommend to other first time mom.	
1. 	Baby #4 is due in a few weeks and we just assembled this today.I think my biggest concern (ordering site unseen) was the scattered reviews that said a normal mattress didn't fit the crib.  I have a Sealy baby mattress (probably really Kolcraft) - nothing fancy - and it fits just fine so that worry has been laid to rest.  Maybe some people had wonky cribs or wonky mattresses, I don't know.My other big concern was how solid is the crib.  I had a crib collapse on one of my daughters - luckily she was not hurt, but she was stuck by her neck which is not something I ever want to experience again.  What happened with that crib was one of the bolt plugs that the mattress support screws into popped out of the wood.  It was a drop side crib, but not exactly a drop side issue.  Still, I am sure the extra wiggle of a drop side crib added to the plug working lose.  For the record - I think drop sides CAN be made safely.  The problem is nowadays things are being made CHEAPLY - which is the real issue.  This crib is not a drop side, so it is super solid to begin with.  Then at each corner of the mattress, rather than a single bolt plug (sorry, I don't know the wood working term but you know it if you see it!) is a strip of metal with 4 holes, held in with 3 screws - which seems MUCH more secure to me than one single bolt plug.  This crib DOES NOT move when you shake it.I'm a little concerned about the gap between the two top rails that some have mentioned their kid getting stuck in.  Truth to tell we'd have gone with Kalani to skip that issue if Kalani was available in natural - but everything else we own is natural and I really wanted natural  so I am going to hope that is not a problem for is - or if it is it is something the child does once and learns not to do again.  Time will tell.  There are covers you can tie on to prevent this if needed.The wood IS on the softer side - I am hoping having it in natural will make scratches less apparent.  We live in an 80+ year old house, so I'm used to things having character.  None of my other kids have been crib chewers so I am not too concerned about that being a problem - if it is there are covers you can buy (the same ones to prevent the arm wedging).I love that it comes WITH a real toddler bar - none of this take a side off and call it a toddler bed when it's not, or having to order the toddler bar as an extra piece for a LOT of money.  That's just baloney.  LOVE that this includes it.OK all that said.  It's gorgeous.  It went together fairly easily (though I was surprised at how many pieces it came in - but I managed to get it all together myself except for the mattress support, even 9 months pregnant with 3 kids under foot).  The price is nice.  It's SOLID.  There is one thing I hate about it, though.  The curvey fronts make it very hard to side-car against an adult bed, which was my plan with this crib.  There is a BIG gap.  I don't like this at all.  So it's possible for the first year we might put one of my twins in this crib in toddler mode, and sidecar her current crib to our bed - or I might devise some sort of sling to go between this crib and our bed to close the gap (would also prevent the crib from sliding away - we have hardwood floors and the crib moves very easily).  I'm not annoyed enough by the problem to pack the crib back up and ship it back, but I wish I had gotten a crib with a flat front.  If you're planning to side-car, keep looking.  If you want a gorgeous solid crib and don't care so much about that, this one should do nicely.But stick with natural, since it scratches somewhat easily.  And because natural looks nicest anyway, LOL.  (I think I am out of the loop here, espresso and cherry seem to be the current trend in nursery furniture...  but I just love the look of real wood myself)	
- 1	I bought these JJ Cole bibs a few months ago, loved them.  They were high quality waterproof with canvas backing.  sturdy, machine washable.  These are flimsy plastic, no canvas reinforcement, hand wash only, and sold AT THE SAME PRICE.  Returning both the bibs I purchased.	
- 1	I got this for my eight-month-old since we were working on baby-led weaning (seeBaby-Led Weaningfor more information) and I didn't love putting food directly on the table, especially when we were eating out.  As soon as I put it in front of him, he made it his job to dislodge it from the table.  The suction cups were not match for his curiosity and fearsome pull.Not wanting to fight that battle, I rolled it up and put it away for later, a time in which he'd be more interested in eating for sustenance than exploring his food and surroundings.  That time never came.  At almost two and a half years old, he'd much better about not dropping food, so the little pouch would just be an invitation to store food in.Quality-wise, it's fine.  It does roll up and tuck in the pouch, which is cute, but then it doesn't lay flat on the table even with the suction cups engaged.  And since it doesn't work as a placemat, it really doesn't matter how easy it is to store and transport.  I didn't return it, but I'm also not going to use it with his younger brother (now eight months old).  I guess I'll eventually donate it to Goodwill.Bottom line:  It's more fun for babies to play with than eat off of.  The suction cups can't withstand the single-minded focus of a determined infant/toddler.  Skip it.	
1. 	This has worked pretty well for us on the mattress in our mini rocking crib. I haven't had any issues with leaking through this, but we haven't had any major messes either. It's a good fit.	
1. 	Snuggly soft, gives me peace of mind that she stays covered all night.  We've used this brand of sack since she got out of the arm-wrap swaddle type, and it was now time for the next size up.  It's as awesome as I expected.	
1. 	Very soft and easy to wash. Works with my changing pad. The color was quite accurate to what was listed on the website	
- 1	Many moms swear by amber teething necklaces. I purchased this one out of desperation. My infant son was constantly fussy for no apparent reason, so I tried the teething necklace. I guess teething wasn't his issue at that time, because it made no difference. It also annoyed him. When he was older and I was sure he really was teething, he hated the necklace and wouldn't even let me put it on him--neck, ankle, wrist, anywhere. Eventually I gave the necklace away to a neighbor.It is well made. The clasp and the beads all seemed secure. No problems with quality.	
- 1	This monitor made a low clicking noise about every 20 seconds when we had it in use even at the lowest volume setting.  Without any baby noise or background noise the sound lights were flickering constantly.  I couldn't keep the monitor on because it was misleading that something was going on in the baby's room when in fact it was perfectly quiet.  We tried switching locations and directions of the camera and the monitor and nothing helped.  I couldn't find any way to adjust the sound sensitivity.  The video quality was good but the otherwise we were very disappointed in this model.	
- 1	These bags leak everywhere. I just finished pumping and sat the bag down in my bed and now my bed is covered in breast milk. All that milk wasted. Not the first time either. My complaints -1- they leak2- the measurements dont seem to be as accurate at all my bottles and other breast milk bags.3- they are  suppose to stand. They absolutely do not.4- the bag is very sharp and stabs my inner thighs when I pump.5- does not hold 5 oz with room to expand.One good thing- the pour spout. That's it. Will never buy these bags again.	
1. 	Great for young babies/toddlers to eat their snacks without a big mess!  My twin boys don't like to sit still when they eat and with these I can let them roam around without me worrying about snack pieces spilling all over the house or where ever we happen to be!	
1. 	I used to have the most difficult time swaddling my son until a friend recommended this product. It made swaddling him super easy. I also love that I don't need to completely unswaddle him to change his diapers at night - helps me put him back to sleep all that more easily!	
- 1	I honestly think that this made no difference with the wipes. I still had issues pulling the wipes out and often times they would tear before I even got them out. Needless to say I returned it.	
- 1	This seat worked a total of two times before collapsing & dumping my son in the toilet.  Worst travel toilet seat, ever.  I followed the directions, making sure it sat well back on the toilet when in use, but it still sagged every time he used it, and then it just folded inward while he was sitting on it one day.  Now he's scared to go on the big potty and begs me not to drop him in the potty whenever he goes.  Thanks for creating a phobia for my son, Mommy's Helper.  Don't waste your money on this product.	
- 1	They aren't absorbent.  What else matters?  Granted much cuter than a cloth diaper / but that works and these don't.  I pass.	
1. 	Our 2-year-old LOVES his new bright orange booster! He was outgrowing his old booster- we had the Fisher Price Space Saver highchair and were using it as a booster. This is one is considerably lower, which is what we needed. Plus it's lightweight (he loves to carry it around the house), doesn't slide around, and very easy to clean. If food sits on it too long it can set into the bumpy surface, requiring scrubbing, but if wiped promptly it's a breeze.	
1. 	I liked this product although I did find it somewhat of a pain to clean after putting someting like avocado or banana in it.	
1. 	Though it took some time to put together, after we were done, the crib looks beautiful! It is really sturdy wood, and the espresso finish is great. We put the toddler rail in the closet for later, and the naturepedic mattress fit snugly inside. I highly recommend this crib!	
- 1	The concept was great, and I love the fact that they are not potential projectiile risks in an accident (like the suction cup sunshades)....however, they do NOT stay on your windshield at all, especially in weather warmer than 75 degrees. I live in Southern California where it is always sunny and needed to shade my daughter when the sun hits the back windshield at a certain time during the day. THey work well when they actually stay on the windshield, but they inevitably start to peel off, which is incredibly annoying. What is more annoying is that it is also very difficult to apply this onto your windshield in a smooth fashion-there are bubbles that I can't avoid, and unless i had anothe rperson helping me, I don't see myself being able to attach this thing without bubbles and smoothing it out on my own. I wish they would make it so that it clings to your windshield better, but I guess that's why the price is so low....you kinda get what you pay for.	
- 1	The size was not what I expected. The quality of the brand is uncontestable and I have many other products.	
1. 	This is a genius product, we always have one of those right on top of our changing pad (we still use a changing pad cover of course) and we also use it on the go when we change our baby outside. This disposable pad saved us lots of trouble in those times when accidents happen, it is just does not let anything go through it so the underlying changing pad remains clean, just finish the change and throw this paper away. We keep using the disposable paper until it gets dirty and only then do we throw it away, so that we do not use too many of them, but when an accident happens at 3 in the morning these are a saver!	
1. 	When we first purchased this product new and took it out of the box, there were a lot of pieces to put together (but that is like any child's toy) which was modestly easy to do with the instructions.  It took both me and my husband probably around 20-30 minutes to get it up and running.  We bought this for my daughter when she was about 5 months old and stuck a thick blanket behind her to give her extra stability.  The ExerSaucer has easy adjustable legs to make it taller as your baby grows (3 total height adjustments).  My daughter is 7 months old now and is on level two and she is 27 inches tall.  The seat spins and has a locking clip underneath if you wish for your child to stay in one spot.  It can be claps with SOME effort.  It took us a little bit of time to learn how to collapse it.  The plastic clamps were really tight and we had to pop them open with some effort, but now that we did it a couple of times, the plastic has softened making it quite simple.There are springs in the legs so when she jumps it has a small bounce in it (though it isn't made to be a jumper.  The little circus tent spins around (on/off button) lights up and plays circus songs.  There are a lot of different toys that teaches the child to spin, rotate flip and slide along with different textures and sounds that the toys make.  It is a great investment!  I often sit my daughter in her ExerSaucer while I am making dinner and the only sounds I hear from her are giggles.	
1. 	I searched the web for some time trying to find some COOL and different toys for my newborn son. When I found this rattle I knew it was a must have. Bright colors and easy grasping for small hands many for hours of fun for your little one.	
1. 	I can't believe there is so much controversy about bottle warmers and wipe warmers!  If you choose to get one, this wipe warmer is great!  The heating element is on top, which makes it safer than other models.  This also ensures that the next wipe (the one on top) will be the warmest...that makes sense!  I haven't used the night light yet, but I may in the future.  Besides, this model doesn't cost any more than the one without a night light.When we are out, obviously my baby gets treated with cold wipes, but at home we always change her in her nursery with warm ones.  I am glad to have this luxury for my baby. I am pleased that I can avoid cold wipes especially in the middle of the night or after a particuarly bad BM.  It's nice to be able to provide a little extra comfort.I use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes, and sometimes two pop out instead of one, but it's really no problem...how many times do you use just one wipe anyway?  I've had no issue with dry wipes because I read the directions.  I just add water whenever I add wipes; it's a no-brainer!  If I'm going to be out, not using wipes at home all day, I unplug the warmer--according to the directions.  I keep my warmer by the changing pad, and I always have very warm, moist wipes to tend to my baby...just like a gentle wash-cloth!	
- 1	We have had this dresser/changing table for 18 months. It's sturdier than Ikea and that's all I can say for it. It worked fine for almost a year, but gentle regular use is showing the poor quality of the construction. One of the drawer slides keeps popping out of the track and leaving the drawer jammed shut; the cam locks that hold one of the drawer fronts on won't stay secure, so our daughter kept pulling the drawer apart, finding little pieces of hardware, and popping them into her mouth. Wood glue didn't help, so we've just taken the drawer out, leaving a large portion of the dresser unusable, wasted space.	
- 1	Theses bottles leaked pretty bad. So badly that I sent them back. I read great reviews and the bottles were heavy and the tops leaked.	
- 1	Nice product and concept, although we only used it for 2 weeks before it quit working.  Started to leak and just wouldn't heat up our bottles.  The bottle itself would be hot but the contents would still be cold.  Never tried to use the cooler.  Was using Dr. Brown bottles in it.	
1. 	We bought this item for our 2 year old.  He has a habit of climbing onto boxes and jumping off of them if we don't keep an eye on him, so I was very weary about putting a toy box in his room.  This toy box really holds a lot of stuff, but because it's soft, my son couldn't really climb on it.  Every thing we wanted to put in there fit and the extra tote is nice - you can just grab it and not have to worry about picking toys out to take somewhere!  I felt safe enough to leave this toy box - unlike the others which are in the living room - in his room.  I knew he couldn't climb on it, I knew if he fell against it, it wasn't going to gouge out his eyes, etc.  Now that he's almost 3, he flips the front open and plays with his cars and tucks books into the side pockets.  This was the perfect toy box for our family!	
- 1	Cut 2 holes out of old sports bra.  Voila!  A cheaper, better fitting, better looking alternative to this overpriced product.	
- 1	I bought these for my newborn. He moves around too much and they fall off. One time, the urine stream made it fall off. They are cute and a great idea, but just not worth the money. They just don't stay on.	
- 1	The bag has a very hard plastic as the wet bag part. Not recommending for cloth diapers! Maybe a good swim bag/beach bag! Cannot wash in the machine like instructed to do the plastic gets weird. Returned it!	
- 1	I like it more than my son does. He was 9 months when I got it, is 10 months now, and has never showed much interest in it. He likes his other book toys, peekaboo by Lamaze is his favorite!	
1. 	Just received these in the mail-- I also ordered the NUK version for comparison.However I was concerned after I ordered this item about a reviewer stating that these were NOT BPA free.  This is incorrect.Says right on the package that these are BPA free (of course there is no picture of the package for this item only the feeders themselves).  I also checked the product description and it says nothing about BPA.I've been vigilent about making sure that everything that goes into my baby's mouth is BPA free so I will admit I was relieved that I dind't have to return them or throw them out and was kicking myself for not checking more carefully before clicking buy on my Amazon iPhone app.So I'm not sure if it's an issue with older version of this product, but it seems to me that any baby brand worth their salt these days are eliminating BPA from their baby products. And Munchkin seems to be a very responsible brand.So don't be alarmed and rest assured that the package for the Munchkin Fresh Food feeders says BPA FREE.	
- 1	I bought these to use as burp rags because I was unhappy with the quality of the gerber cloth diapers I was using as burp rags.  My 3 month old spits up a lot. While these were much softer than the gerber diapers, the absorbency, at least when it comes to spit up, was not good at all.  The spit up just sits on top of the rag instead of being absorbed inside.  Not sure how these work as diaper inserts, but I would not recommend them as burp cloths.	
- 1	This bowl is attractive and well-made.  We haven't had any trouble with it in the dishwasher on the top rack.However, don't buy this bowl if you are looking for something that will stay stuck to a high chair tray.  I thought it would work better than other bowls because in the packaging in the store, it looked like the entire bottom was a suction cup.  Not so.  There's a rubber suction rim attached around the bottom of the bowl (that's the colored rubber you see), but the suction cup doesn't extend under the bowl itself.  It's just bare plastic. Perhaps that's why the suction power is so weak -- it's not in fact a suction cup, just a suction rim.My daughter isn't a huge bowl thrower, and she doesn't generally try to tear the bowl off the tray if she's focused on eating.  (I wanted a suction bowl just in case that changed.)  We attach the bowl to the tray at the beginning of dinner, and it stays on for maybe two minutes, then the suction power gives up and the bowl comes loose by itself.  It'd be off in a few seconds if she were focused on ripping it off herself.	
1. 	i love this bouncer!  i have used it for both of my kids, and, even though i had to return it three times because of a faulty vibrations switch, i never once regretted purchasing this seat!  you can switch it on so that the music, fish and bubbles all move around for the baby to stare at! my son used to sit in the seat for 20-30 minutes at a time, and my daughter, who is much more active than my son was, would sit for 10-15 minutes at a time, which is a HUGE amount of time for her!  i love this bouncer and would buy it again if i ever have more children.	
1. 	My daughter still loves this mobile and she's 13 months now.  It's so cute with all the flowers with happy faces that she can see when she looks up.  We have it over the changing table because it's a great distraction.  Definitely recommend it.	
1. 	I purchased this booster for my 6 months old son and we both love it :) Not to mention the super easy cleaning! The booster is not only used as a travel feeding chair but also as a play chair - my son can stay in it for a while. For play time I place the booster on the floor and put toys in the tray. The booster is also super easy to carry - I usually take it with us when we go to the park as it does not take much room in the car. The comfort of feeding the baby outdoors in a comfortable chair is tremendous. I give the booster 5 stars and highly recommend it!	
1. 	I wouldn't use on an 8+ month old (or so), because it really isn't that good for a sitter upper who isn't very good at safely climbing off things, and worse for an active toddler trying to climb on everything.It was very nice before then, because it laid back nicely and reclined nicely, and it looked comfortable for a little baby, and later less reclined for an emerging sitter.  It was also good for training him to drink a bottle by himself, and he seemed very comfortable in it.I used it one day with my 16 month old, when he was very sick and just wanted to recline and relax in front of the TV.  The next day, he was once again trying to climb up the back of it, and I had to put it back away.  Not that a toddler wants to sit around in a chair anyway.	
- 1	This is a love/hate relationshipLoveThat they work so well with bottle accessories and cups stuff later on.They tack nice and don't take up too much room.Fit right onto the Avent pump.Store nice and works well for freezing.Great stackability.Easy to write on in pencil and erase (to know which batch comes first).HateThey were hard to screw on (the flat tops to the bottoms and many times were on crooked).Leaked too much milk (and as any BFing mother knows... losing milk is well like losing money).	
1. 	I almost didn't purchase this item based on the reviews.  I would have been sad!I deliberated a long time over which walker to get for my daughter.  I have other Chicco products and do like them a lot.  So many of the reviews mention things like tipping, etc.  To be honest, I don't think there is a product out there that can save our kids from themselves (a rubber room?!).  Of course a baby will find a way to tip something over or fall and bump their heads...but that's why parental involvement is always necessary.  Who lets their very young baby out of their sight for more than a second or two?Our daughter loves this toy.  She actually laughs and smiles when she sees it and immediately crawls to it to start walking or playing with the front.  The music is silly and cute, but I'm glad it can be turned off and has two volume settings.  The shape sorter on the front and ball chute (which makes noise) are the perfect size for baby (our daughter is 9 months old).While it is lightweight and not perfectly designed (I've rarely found anything that is), your child should only need to use this toy for a few months at the most before they outgrow it or learn how to walk on their own.I do think it is a bit overpriced for what it is mostly because it does have such a short lifespan (not that it will wear out, just that baby won't need it for too long).I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has hardwood floors.  When our pediatrician mentioned getting a walker, she asked if we had carpets or hard floors.  She said carpet is better for all of these types of toys.  Not only because the toys function better (don't move as fast), but safer for the babies in general (not as many bumps and bruises when learning how to walk).	
- 1	I wish I had read all the reviews. These are frustratingly impossible to open. I hate them and am throwing them away.	
- 1	Just received this item today. I purchased it because of the front-facing-out option, but will be returning it. I am being generous to rate it 2 stars because it does support baby's legs much better than other popular carriers that allow the baby's legs to just dangle. HOWEVER, it still does not even come CLOSE to supporting my daughter's legs knee-to-knee, which is what is really recommended in a carrier, and she just turned 6 mos today, is 28 long, and weighs 17 lbs- not an abnormally large baby. As others have mentioned, the fabric that supports the leg was so rigid and tight that it was a struggle for me to put my finger between her leg and the carrier- again, not a chubby baby- and it left indentations on her thighs after 10 min of wear. I can't imagine what it would do if she were in it for an hour! Also, she is in the 99th percentile for length and in the front facing out position, her face was shoved into the front of the carrier, even with it folded down, If a smaller baby were to be in this position, they would be face-first into the fabric, which defeats the purpose, not to mention would be uncomfortable and possibly a suffocation risk. Because the fabric was crossing her cheeks, she was constantly looking up to get away from it, which would get uncomfortable pretty quickly. The dangling straps were also fairly annoying. I was really hoping to love this carrier and it seemed like the best option, but sadly, it will be returned.	
1. 	I got these spoons for a trip and planned to throw them away but like them so much I had to keep some of them, and plan to buy more if we ever run out. They are thicker and more durable than I expected and fit great in the diaper bag, yet the handles aren't too short to use them as an everyday spoon. They go through the dishwasher fine. I am super impressed with these.	
1. 	The Colgate Classica I is a perfect fit in our Jenny Lind crib. It's definitely firm, but baby mattresses are supposed to be firm! Our little guy has slept well on it since he started sleeping in his crib. It's super lightweight, and all of our crib sheets (all from Meijer!) have fit easily.	
1. 	good price, good product and saved me a drive to go buy these items seperately.my sister is having her second baby and we gave her back the breast pump which she lend us when we had ours, this kit contains all of the parts which can not transfer from one mother/child to another. and then some.good value.	
1. 	This is the first bottle we tried with our then-3-week-old baby. She had been exclusively breastfed up until that point, but I had started pumping in preparation for going back to work, so we wanted to try her on a bottle. She immediately went for it with no problems! Now, she never had any latching problems anyway, but I was concerned she'd be confused by the bottle. She's still not had many bottles, but had no problem switching back to breast after. We also have AVENT bottles that we have yet to try, but I think the VentAire will be what we send with her sitter and leave with dad when I'm not around to feed her.She was more gassy than normal after her feeding, but from what I hear a bottle will always make them more gassy than the boob - so I guess this bottle is better than others (can't compare there). The only real bad thing I can say is that there are a lot of little parts with the screw-on bottom and vent piece (they do give you one extra vent in the pack in case you lose one). That's a necessary evil of the vent setup though, I guess. I do like that they open up at both ends - makes cleaning pretty easy.	
1. 	I searched for weeks for a decent bedding set for my 2.5 year old. She wanted to pick out a new set of bedding for her big toddler bed.We went to all of the major retailers, and I was shocked at the terrible quality of the bedding--the sheets with characters (Lightning McQueen, Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora) were consistently made of sheets that were see-through and felt like plastic or sandpaper.These sheets are wonderful! I am so pleased! They are soft, smooth, and I love that the flat sheet and comforter have one fitted end, which keeps the bedding on my daughter while she sleeps. The comforter is light but is quite warm, even for my daughter, whose bed is near a window. I'll probably toss a throw on her when it gets colder, but for a primary comforter it's perfect.	
1. 	I just love this crib.  It is so pretty.  I love the design of it.  It is also very sturdy.  More sturdy than I expected it to be.	
1. 	I LOVE this blanket and everytime someone sees it, they ask me about it.  I keep it in the car and we use it all the time.  Washing is fairly easy.  I put it in the machine but then air dry it as I don't think it would stand up to the dryer.  Great item!	
1. 	I use this with my now 9 week old daughter and really like it. I was able to fit it in my kitchen sink and use it easily, before the cord fell off for sponge baths, because you let it absorb the water and they lay on it. We were given a baby bath and I tried using that a few times but I have to say, all I need is this sponge. She is so comfortable on it, unlike the other baby bathtub, with a sling insert. This is easy to use, makes her the most happy during bath time, and is easy to dry. For now its all we need.	
1. 	This is a simple, inexpensive guarantee of finger protection.  We purchased these a few months ago when our son became very interested in opening and closing (and opening and closing . . . ) doors at home.  The finger guards are unobtrusive, easy to place and remove, and durable.  They prevent finger pinches on both sides of the door/frame.  Highly recommend.	
1. 	I pumped exclusively after my daughter was 2 weeks old, so I had lots of milk to store. I pumped my breast milk directly into these containers, then stored them in the fridge for bottles or transferred the excess milk into freezer bags as I produced lots of milk and I thought these containers would take up too much from in my freezer.Things to consider:- I have an Avent breast pump and could pump directly into these containers, which was wonderful- I did spill milk twice while pumping when I had not screwed on the containers properly. I learned quickly to double check the seal and never had problems again- I did not like the bottle adapter and always transferred my milk to bottles for feedings- I used masking tape to label the containers so I could reuse them easier- The volume marks on the container were a little difficult to read- I hand washed them in the sink with the rest of my bottles and pump parts, so they still in good shape- The lids were sometimes difficult to line up properly, requiring more than one attempt at times. Worked better when container was flat on the countertop.- The containers will be nice to use for food and other snacks once I am done pumping- I plan on using them again with our second child as they are cheaper than bottles and stack very nicely in the fridge, but I will probably get bags again for freezer storageI would recommend these to a friend	
1. 	Cute blocks, great quality. I'm using them as decor until my baby is born - they can be used for decor OR for play, which is really nice. Only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because the box they come in is not re-usable to put them back in - it has an open hole in front and the plastic is what you have to tear open in order to get the blocks. I guess that's why they sell a different set that comes with a storage bag for a little extra $$. Other than having to figure out your own way to store these blocks, they are great!! And will probably last a long time.	
- 1	Can't comment on the quality of the product because I didn't get to the point of assembling it. On the lower right side of the product description page it says Birth to 5 months+, but on the arm of the mobile it specifically says WARNING From birth to 5 months.  I was hoping to get more than 5 months use out of this. This is going back to Amazon.	
- 1	My 11-month-old can easily remove these protectors, making them worse than useless--they're actually an additional hazard. Buy something else instead.	
- 1	There are two pieces to the outlet cover: back part replaces the outlet cover (and needs to be screwed on) and the front cover, which is released from the back cover by squeezing the two plastic pieces on the sides. The plastic side pieces are part of the back part, made of stiff plastic and extremely difficult to squeeze. This outlet cover also did not fit one of my outlets (it would not stay flush to the wall).	
- 1	This item was not at all what I thought it would be. I only recieved two of the toys when I orderd the set. :( WHen I looked it up I searched by musical toys and there is no music. They are very plane and boring. My child doesn't like them at all.	
- 1	I got this pale b/c it was cheap. Yes you can use any bag for it but it doesn't hide the smell and the lid slams down on its own almost catching my fingers while I'm changing the bag. So unless you like a smelly house and have 3 arms to change a bag dont buy!!	
1. 	With 4 of us it gets a little much to have everyone in the bed when we travel, this was perfect for my 3 year old when we traveled for the holidays and even when we moved and had to wait a few weeks before getting an additional bed for his room.	
- 1	I'm going to buck the trend here.These bags are very cute and stylish.  They are effective if you want to reduce your usage of plastic baggies.  I like how they are zipper and not velcro.  They do a good job, for the most part, of containing foods, although, if you're trying to store something juicy (like cut up oranges), you might be pushing your luck as the moisture will gradually seep through the seams and make the fabric outer cover damp.If the only things you're going to use this for are dry snacks like crackers or cereal, you're probably fine just wiping the interior with a damp cloth after each use.  And then once a week throwing it in the laundry for deep cleaning.But if you are using it for anything that is going to leave any residue (juicy fruit, oily chips, PBJ sandwiches, you get the idea here) these are really not practical.  Turning inside out and wiping the interior doesn't get it clean enough for me.  You can do a load of laundry (but most people don't do laundry every day) or hand wash and submerge it in soapy water, but the fabric outer takes forever to dry.  So you really end up having to buy a 2 day supply of these to rotate through if you want to use them everyday.  And they are relatively expensive, so buying several might be cost-prohibitive for some.Also, the outer fabric, while cute is... well... fabric.  So it can stain.  Making your cute bag not-so-cute anymore.  Also, it fades and shrinks a little, so the bag doesn't lay nicely after a while.  Not huge deals, but worth mentioning.  Your kids probably won't care.If your looking to buy this for your kids, I would instead go with theBumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Yellow, LargeorBumkins 2 Count Reusable Snack Bags, Blue/Green, Small.  They are about half the price of the Itzy and for anyone who has used the amazing Bumkins Bibs, these are the same material.  They are a breeze to wash, dry super fast and I've never had it hold a stain.The prints are loud and garrish, but my kid likes it fine.  Much more practical for busy moms (and dads!).I have both the Snack Happened and the Bumkins bags, and I reach for the Bumkins every time.	
- 1	There's lag in the video, and the camera unit is incredibly annoying with it's notification beeping.  It doesn't hold a charge worth a crap and it loses signal all the time in a less than 1700 sq.ft house.  I wouldn't purchase it again.	
1. 	I had purchased this before my daughter was born and used it often to BF.  After about 6 months of use, some of the plastic tubing in the neckline poked through the fabric and began scratching my neck.  I was disappointed and decided to reach out to Bebe au Lait.  Within 24 hours of my email to customer service, they responded with an apology, a pre-paid UPS label to send them the defective one, and a confirmation email to send me a brand new cover.  I love when companies make sure their customers are happy!	
1. 	There have been so many times we really loved this carrier.  Originally, though, I wanted a sling because I thought they were better for baby, like the previous reviewer, and all my crunchy friends recommended them.  They may be, but we've tried the hotsling, the maya wrap, and even the ergo baby carrier, and this is by far the best and easiest for us.For months, the only way to get my baby to stop his colicky crying was to put him in the Bjorn and go for a walk.  It would put him right to sleep like magic, and we'd come inside, lean over his rocker, and unlatch the Bjorn with him in it (the outer piece comes completely off) and he would just stay asleep.  Try that with a sling!Now that he's past his colicky phase, I use the sling a lot and it's great, but for a quick run to the store, nothing beats the Bjorn for speed.  It's so easy to put on and take off - and it's also easier to get my husband (and my dad!) to wear the baby with the Bjorn, he thinks the sling is for moms.I had two problems: at about 20 pounds and 27 inches, his arms don't fit in the arm holes, and they don't fit above them either.  It still works without the top latches, though, and it's cooler in summer.  I just keep a hold on him to be sure.  And when he was a couple months old and I was wearing the Bjorn a lot, I got a plugged milk duct.  I thought it was about where the strap lay on my chest, so I stopped wearing the Bjorn for a while.  I was having other breastfeeding problems at the time so it might not have been the Bjorn, but who knows?I got this as a hand-me-down, and I thought it was going to just collect dust, but boy was I wrong.  It's in the washer right now!	
1. 	We liked this sleep sac very much. We bought it a second time once our daughter grew out of the large.	
1. 	I did not get the exact bibs pictured: please see my uploaded image to see what I got. It was a real surprise because I was expecting a blue, yellow and orange bib. Instead I got a blue, yellow, and green bib and two of the three had different graphics than what was pictured on Amazon. So when you order these, apparently you should expect colors and designs to vary (would've been nice if Amazon said this on the product page when I ordered these).Aside from that, these are good bibs for feeding solids. I bought them because our baby is a messy eater, she'd stain all her cloth bibs and they quickly molded (Gross!). These are very stain resistant, dry super fast and are a generous size. The pocket does catch about 95% of falling food (baby's still on runny baby food). She was very distracted by the bright colors when I first started using these, but I fixed that by putting the bib on her about 15 minutes before the meal. The only down side is that these are not good for bottle feeding because they don't soak up liquid, it just runs all over. So for bottle feeding I use a cloth bib. Overall, I bought these cause they don't stain, they dry quickly on the kitchen counter and make feeding solids easier - I wasn't too concerned about bottle feeding so it's not a big deal. Very happy with them!	
1. 	I had this at the top of long, very steep stairs in a loft apartment with my toddler. Worked well, no accidents or mishaps with this gate. Really happy with this product.	
1. 	Makes it very easy to take temperatures rectally which is the most accurate way! Love how it folds and is always accurate.	
1. 	Have so many different kinds of bibs to use...this is our favorite brand.  Attaches quickly & easily.  Easy to clean.  Daughter likes to find food she's dropped in there & sometimes she spills a large amount of milk or water onto it & it catches it...thank goodness as she's not so good with a cup yet.	
- 1	We bought a variety of cloth diapers to use with our newborn. We are not new to cloth diapering as we diapered our oldest in cloth until she potty trained. We used the one size Fuzzibunz for my oldest without any problems. However, we didn't start until she was 10 weeks. We bought this diaper to try and did not like it. The insert was difficult to get in. It leaked almost every time we used it. And my daughter seemed to outgrow it by one month old at 10 lbs. It was, however, soft. I would not purchase this again for a newborn.	
1. 	We have a few awkward spaces with large gaps that we wanted to keep our child from. I had to look around to try and find some kind of gate that might fit one of these space without us having to mount something to the wall.  I did not want to have to do a hardware install for something I will have up for only a limited time.  We bought two of these and they have worked great.  We were able to take some large gaps and make an effective barrier to keep your child out.  Sometimes we had to be creative with the angles and placement of the gate but I don't think I could have found another product that would do the job.The biggest con here is that they can be hard to open and close which is probably a good thing since it makes it harder for the child to do so.  That said it can make setting this up and taking it down a bit of chore.  Not sure if anything could really be done to fix this.	
1. 	Love love love these Blankets!  They wash up well & are so practical.... they can be used in multiple ways.  I've given them as gifts and everyone loves them.  Much larger than the average flannel receiving blankets that you buy in the stores.  Everyone should have at least two!	
1. 	This simplified bathing our baby by 100 times.  with the traditional hard tubs with the incline and hard plastic, i was always afraid to have my baby slip on mine or my husband's hands.  When we received this, bathing became enjoyable instead of a nervous event.  The baby seems to enjoy bathing more too, as the material absorbs warm water and is soft and secure feeling.  We place the bather in the infant tub on our bed for easier bathing.  After we are done, my husband rinses and rings the bather for it to dry.  I have thrown the bather in the washer a few times too with no problems.  It did develop a mildew smell after awhile but a soak in diluted vinegar in the baby's tub for a couple of hours kills all the smell. Great product.	
1. 	i received three different bath tub as gifts for my baby shower.  i disliked all three but had to pick one for my baby's use.  i always wanted to register for this tub because of its hammock feature, which i believe would cradle my newborn the best.  at that time, my only concern was for my newborn's comfort. i was so thankful to  get this tub a month later when i gave birth to my son.  my hubby wanted to return this and exchange for much more needed  baby supplies since we already have a tub in hand already.  but i was happy to have kept this one because my son, now 5 months old still enjoy bathing in this tub using the hammock.  i never had problems bathing him in this tub except when i take out the hammock feature.  i guess he was just not ready to immerse himself in water yet.  the caddy works well with me too because it holds everything i need to bathe him.  i believe, i had NO REGRETS using this tub.  just the perfect one for every babies.	
1. 	My daughter has loved this toy since we got it for her 18 months ago when she was 6 months old.  By the way, this review is for the Lady Bug version of the night light.  If the room is mostly dark then you can definitely see the blue and green stars. The red stars are hard to see if the room isn't completely dark.  Although my daughter is not old enough to recognize or learn constellations yet, she has learned to recognize the moon that is projected out, and it's always fun to turn on the unit and have her find where the moon is in the room.  Also, the unit has proven very durable, it has a few scrapes on the shell to prove it can handle some abuse at the hands of a child.	
1. 	This is a great little pump. I have the pump in style as well, but sometimes if I just needed to pump off excess breastmilk I didn't feel like hauling out the whole thing and plugging it in so I would grab this and it worked great! I love being able to just throw it in a diaper bag or, if I'm out with some friends without the baby, into a large purse so I can stay out longer than I would if I had to go home when my breasts got too full.I don't think I would want to use it as my only pump since I do pump often even though I am a SAHM, and if I were a working mother pumping while at work this CERTAINLY would not suffice, but it does the trick as a handy little stand in!	
1. 	I bought a changing table that came with a thin, flat changing pad.  This is one of the only covers that works.  Yes, you do have to put something absorbent underneath, but this keeps everything in place and looks nice.	
1. 	So soft and my baby loves being on. I haven't found she sleeps any longer on it but its a great play time mat for tummy time etc...	
- 1	This monitor is great, if you don't have wireless. If you do have wireless, then expect to hear the monitor turn on and off. When I wrote to the company, they seemed to imply that it was normal for the wireless signal to interfere. Now, we're shopping for a new monitor. The video is nice, except when the little one moves around in her crib and wedges herself into the corner.	
1. 	This was my favorite bottle bag for my son.  It will hold six bottles with the ice pack going on top of the bottles.  I usually only put five in at one time so that I could use additional ice packs.  The storage on the top is small, but will fit two Gerber baby food containers, spoon and bib.  I used this to take his bottles to daycare and on all-day trips.  For short trips (to daycare), one ice pack would work.  For all day trips, we used additional ice packs.	
1. 	These little cups are a good value.  My grand daughter is only old enough to knock them down at this point but she's having fun.	
- 1	i dont like the feel of it, (im picky with feelings,..but this bothers me) and VERY thin, my boopy pillow is not white.. so u can see threw it,.. i guess if u had a white one..the thinness would be fine... but the feeling still sucks imo! ... its cute pink and polka dot.. but its cheap... OHHH and the fabric pokes out on the inner sides... it looks weird???	
1. 	Reviews on baby bottles are wide ranging. What works for some babies doesn't always work for others. All I can say is that these have been perfect for us. No spills. No bad seals. Slow / medium / fast nipples have brought our nine month old along perfectly. I would rate the VentAire system 6 stars if I could.	
- 1	I have tommy tippee pacifiers for my child & this pacifier keeper does not work with those pacifiers because they do not have a ring coming out of them to attach the keeper to. It may work well with others, but is useless for my pacifiers. The MAM clip & Cover pacifer keepr & nipple cover works MUCH better.	
- 1	When I place the baby in the car seat the straps get pulled off the magnets and stuck under him anyway. A hook or clip design might work better	
1. 	Not only does it look amazing, but it does a great job getting inside all the different sized bottles I use for feeding baby. I pump so the bottles for catching milk are narrow, but the bottles baby drinks from are wider mouthed. Works great at cleaning them both. The nipple cleaner isn't anything magical though, and I haven't really found anything that does work well other than my pinky finger with a washrag covering it.	
- 1	Cheap Cheap Cheap Only thing good is the finger nail clippers. We got a better pair free from hospital. Everything just screams cheap!	
1. 	I would buy this over and over again. Best quality gate I have ever purchased as a mother. I tell everyone how wonder it it. We bought 2 to make it bigger for outside use and take some sections out and use it around the christmas tree. Absolutely wonderful!	
1. 	I like the fact that you don't have to purchase brand-name insert for this product, but can use any garbage bag.  I have to say, though, that after my daughter started solids, the odor control has not been great unless the bag is changed frequently.	
- 1	My 2.5 year old toddler had a peepee accident in the car.  The toddler was soaked, the pad was soaked, and the carseat was soaked through to the foam.  This was just another piece to wash.  Totally useless.  Its going back.	
- 1	The gate stops being effective. We purchased it to keep the kids out of the kitchen and my husband keeps tripping over it, because he cant figure out the latch. Our four year old niece just pushes on it  and pops it open, so it wore the latch down, Our toddler has however figured out that if you push hard enough on it that it will just pop open too. IT sorta works.  with modification, I am sure we can make due.  It got a 2 because its supposed to last longer.	
1. 	This product works well when you abide by the instructions and put in the suggested amount of water; not a drop more. It's important to keep the bottom of the reservoir clean, otherwise minerals in the water start collecting and will burn and smell. It looks like rust, but it wipes right out. I was pleased with the performance for the price paid.	
1. 	our daughter can roll on her side but when we use the Halo she stays on her back. We still haven't figured out how to keep her arms in (she's a bit of a Houdini since birth). I totally recommend this the Halo swaddle	
1. 	These are great. Simple, straight forward, easy to use and remove when you don't want them. I take them off the door and perch them on the molding over the door when not in use.	
- 1	I purchased this product to insert into a big Coach bag i bought to use as a diaper bag. It had no pockets so i bought this to use. While it fit perfectly inside, the product itself was emanating some horrid chemical smell! I kept it in my garage to air out and it did air out some, but it is still definitely a noticeable smell and I will not put this around anything that my son will come into contact with. Returning ASAP!	
1. 	This little cake is Adorable! I love all of the little items inside, I think it's a lot cuter in person!! It's perfect for little fingers to pick up! I think I am going to put my Son's birth photo in this when I give it to him for his first Birthday!	
1. 	Happy i bought this play yard. It came on time and was well packed. It was easy to put up and its easy to move around the house. It kep my baby safe while payhing around when she started crawling and it saved me and her nanny time and energy of running around after her. Good invention, will reconmmend to all mums!!	
1. 	i first sat my baby on this when she was about 9 months old, and we've reduced the number of diapers significantly, with very rare #2 diapers, woohoo!!! of course i had to hold the baby, but at 11 months, holding is discouraged. there are occasionaly wiping of the front lip, but it seems much less ickier than cleaning out a typical potty.this fits almost all toilets except some smaller-sized apartment toilets, though i was able to place it on the toilet seat without having the trainer fit properly. (but then if your kid isn't too young, you probably won't need a trainer for a small toilet.) i even take this to other people's homes and have used it successfully everywhere.i'm so relieved that my baby cooperated with early potty training, and this product enabled me to accomplish that.	
- 1	I have a set of these and they are awful! The Take and Toss brand is a quarter of the price, BPA free, and the lids don't need to be heated in order to fit the cup. I don't have room in my cabinets to store cups with lids on them- I need to stack my cups.	
- 1	Just cough up the extra money on an electric pump. I got this trying to save money and it was very painful and didn't really work. I ended up having to get an electric one anyways after a week of using this one and giving myself horrible blisters.	
1. 	This toy is so much fun for a little guy, mine was six months when we got it a month ago, and he just can't get enough of it.  Each week he finds new things to do with it.  At first having the balls on the spinning surface was just too noisy, it frightened him, so we left them off.  But now he loves putting them on and taking them off and watching them spin.  His latest is using it to stand up (using the trees to push up).  It is very sturdy, but of course once he's up he can't get down without crashing, so that is my one caveat, keep a close eye if your little one is pulling up.	
1. 	Our little one loved being swaddled, however outgrew or was able to get his hands out of other blankets. Not this one! After first we thought it was too big, but tucking his arms in and wrapping him up, he loved it. Washes up great and just gets softer. If you are looking for help with getting your baby to sleep, this is worth a try.	
1. 	Finally!  A product that is easily adjustable for every type of vehicle!  I've battled my old car mirror for a year and rarely get the perfect spot to be able to actually see my child!  If i forget to push the carrying arm back then I'm out of luck and I would have to move my mirror to be able to even see her mirror every time.  Very frustrating!This mirror is wonderful!  I bought two!  I can see both babies faces in my mirror without having to move my mirror.  It took just a few seconds to attach them and position them properly.  Great product!  Highly recommend!	
1. 	This is a great idea and I can see how it would be convient to protect your seats but it doesnt work well if your seats in your car do not have a gap to slide the back of this into between the top and bottom part of the cars seat.  Otherwise good, my car seat base doesnt seem as solid with this under it.	
1. 	Love this dispenser.  I had a hand-me-down one that was absolutely horrible but this one is very easy to use.  Easy to open and close to add formula, I like that it converts to a snack container later, it turns easily between compartments, and the handle to the top for dispensing formula is made so that it will stay standing up or flip all the way back when open.  Not sure why having to shake the container when dispensing the formula is a problem, this isn't a big deal for me.	
- 1	I purchased this potty seat for my 2 1/2 year old son.  While the quality is excellent, it simply doesn't function as a potty seat for my little boy.  Considering there is no shield for urine, and given the size of the opening, the pee would just go all over the floor and not in the potty at all.  Will have to send this one back and purchase another seat with a shield for little boys.	
- 1	I love the concept and thought this was the answer to my prayers.  However, the cap doesn't snap well and the pacifier hole is too big.  The result is a mess.  Thin meds drip out right away and I had a problem getting thicker meds into the pacifier.  It also seems a tad small for larger amounts, although this didn't affect us yet.  Lastly, it is impossible to clean the inside of the pacifier because the opening is so small.  I also tried the Ken Med and the Safety First bottle.  I liked both better than the Numimed, but the Ken Med cracked after 3 weeks.  Eventually, we just used a small nipple and that works great.	
1. 	I got this when musings started crawling so I would be ready when he started walking and I'm glad I did. This product works great on my entertainment center and my lower window sills. The product sticks great and my little one can't pull them off. Just this morning he walked over to the window and fell and hit his head on the sill and he didn't get hurt. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones.	
1. 	I purchased this as replacement parts for my pump in style, and everything is perfect of course. I love that the caps fit my glass evenflo bottles.	
- 1	Since my nursery has a penguin theme, I thought this would be perfect. Let me say that the lights are just awful. They don't even project clearly two inches from your hand. How on earth do they expect the lights to reach the ceiling? Impossible. I have a blackout curtain the nursery (so dark that you can't even tell if it's day or night when the door's shut) and even then, the lights don't project. It's really terrible.However, the music is great, my 3 month old adores it, and the nature sounds are soothing. I will keep it for the music (a mix of lullabies and classical) and for the nature sounds. Other than that, it's junky and cheap.	
- 1	I ordered these as my nipples were sore and I wanted a soft breast pad.  After washing, these are not soft.  I prefer my cotton breast pads.  Also, the care for these involve many steps and not worth the effort.  I bought more cotton pads to replace these.  They also can stick to your nipple if your nipple is slightly damp and can leave fuzz.	
- 1	The bowl is nice and big, the insert fits well into it, the utensils are as they should be, and the plastic seems sturdy enough to withstand a toddler.  However, the suction part of the bowl is absolutely useless.  It will stay stuck for approximately one minute, sometimes a little longer, before it slowly releases.  One hard tug from my child (13 months old) and it's off the table and cheerios are flying everywhere.If you just want a bowl, get something less expensive.  If you're looking for something that stays stuck to table or tray, well - look elsewhere.	
- 1	my son got hold of it while it was clipped to the stroller... well that was the end foam blades.	
- 1	I got this infant toothbrush because my son started teething really early. I thought it would be easy for him to handle but the shape fits awkward in his little hand. But that's not my biggest concern with this product, after all, he can always grow into it. My biggest problem is that it picks up lint like crazy. I have to wash it before every use and in a matter of seconds (that's not an exaggeration) it's already full of lint and stuff. It's gross. It seems like the product is made from a sticky kind of silicone. Bummer, I had really high hopes for this product. For the price I paid I expected much better quality.	
1. 	I have this carrier and the maclaren one.  This one has the back support strap (which makes a difference), but the clips to hook the baby in is a little trickier than the maclaren which just snaps together.  for the price though, this carrier is great!UPDATE:This carrier is AWESOME!!!! I've been reading other people's reviews of this carrier... and I think they aren't using this carrier properly. one complaint I have seen is that the leg holes are too small and that the baby is up too high. When the baby gets bigger, there is an adjustment that drops the bottom of the seat down which does two things... 1) it makes the baby sit lower and out of your face! and 2) makes the leg holes bigger. Imagine that!!! Another complaint I have seen is that the front doesn't fold down and when the baby is front facing, the carrier is in their face. There is also an adjustment for this!!! The front vent folds down inside the carrier. You have to read the manual... it took me a few minutes to figure it out, but voila... the baby can see! I also have a much more expensive Maclaren carrier that was given to me as a gift, and I like the snugli MUCH better!!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!!!!!	
- 1	this item was definitely better quality then the last set i bought for a lost pair. hope they last a lot longer and don't get lost.	
- 1	This is a good enough idea, but it doesn't work.  I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on.  It falls off about 3 times a day.  If I use the oven it falls off within minutes.	
- 1	The idea of something that makes boingy noises as your baby jumps on it seems to be a good one, but when they implemented the concept into this item, it came up severely lacking. If on music mode, it doesn't complete one song before moving to the next. So as your baby bounces, you get the first 3 notes of one song and the first 3 of another all mashed together. The jungle sounds are about the same level of annoying. The sound effects are somewhat tolerable, but not really engaging to the baby. As if those annoyances weren't enough, this thing slides all over the joint as baby bounces. I was constantly having to move it back under baby's feet. Really not worth the money. Just put some crinkle paper under baby for the same effect with no money out of pocket.	
- 1	I have owned and used the baby bjorn carrier for just over a month now. It is ok for the first thrity minutes to an hour in comfort. Anything beyond that you can expect to have a soar back. This was my second choice for a carrier. I first purchased the moby wrap, and absolutely love it. However, we recently traveled out of the country when my little guy was only two months old and did not want the hastle of the moby wrap going through security. I used this on the first flight to Bogota, Colombia and the first day we were there. After that first day I was absolutely miserable.It was so very uncomfortable. I would hold my son up with my hands to give my shoulders and back a break.The remainder of the trip I used the moby wrap and stuck the baby bjorn in the closet.Pros...ConvinientEasy to UseCons...Shoulder discomfortBack pain and discomfortMy child sits to low even when sized properly according to his heightCarrying any infant facing out is just cruel imo...when they are over stimulated they have no escape...it is much more comfy for babies to have the shelter of their mother or father's chest...I would not reccomend wasting your money. Instead...if you do not mind all the fabric...invest in th moby wrap or if you're looking for somehting a bit easier to get on and off try the Ergo baby carrier.	
- 1	I didn't keep this chair long enough to try it out but I still feel the need to comment.  The new straps are too long and stick out so much no matter how much you tighten them.  My daughter didn't like the way they stuck out in front of her, hitting her chin.  They might be easier to clean but they look and feel uncomfortable.  The cover didn't cover well.  There were large gaps between it and the seat on both sides so I can imagine that food would always get trapped there.  The tray did it for me.  There was no way I could only use one hand.  I had to kneel and watch closely while putting the tray on track.  With five kids, I knew that I wouldn't have time for that.  Back to the drawing board.  Also, not worth the price.	
- 1	I'm not too fussed about keeping everything sterile for my baby, but I did want a separate brush for the bottles and pump accessories, and I usually like OXO products very much. This brush, however, hardly makes my life easier.Pros:- pretty colors- soft and gentle on the bottlesCons:- the bottom unscrews if you brush counter-clockwise- the nipple nub is completely useless (maybe okay for nipples, but cannot really reliably clean any other small parts, e.g. Medela pump accessories)- the brush sprays, no matter how carefully you move it- after less than two months of limited use, the brush bristles are starting to look tangled and worn- if it leans against anything, the brush gets flattened (so you pretty much have to buy the stand)	
- 1	The bottles keep breaking when we are warming up the milk. The bottles have a warning on them that extreme temperature changes may lead to breakage so we are heating them up via a pot of water on the very lowest setting on our stove. We bought four bottles (2 of the 2 packs) and have been using them for a few weeks and have already had two bottles crack/break. I am also using Born Free glass bottles and they are all fine. It is very frustrating since I am pumping milk - everytime a bottle breaks, I am losing all my milk from that bottle, plus the baby is already hungry and we've got to start heating up a new bottle. Don't waste your money, or your milk!	
- 1	I bought this monitor from Target after we had a major issue with our Infant Optics video monitor. It was supposed to be a temporary monitor until we could do some research and find a better video monitor to buy. I figured we'd use it for a few weeks. Nope, I used it last night and it's getting returned today. The monitor is fairly simple to use. The big issue I had with this is that the parent unit kept losing signal with it's counterpart continuously throughout the night. This thing has a 1000 foot range, so it wasn't a matter of being out of range, but the signal b/w both units was continuously dropped throughout the night. And when it loses signal, it beeps obnoxiously and I had to walk it closer to the other unit to get it to link up again. I mean this happened about 10 times last night. So I got up 10 times. Guess how many times our baby got up? ONCE. This thing woke me up 10x more than my son. Ridiculous.Also, after the issue with our old monitor, I'm paranoid about the monitor kicking off in the middle of the night and not being able to hear the baby. There is no &#34;ON&#34; light or any indicator that the unit is on that you can see in the dark. There is a light to show it's plugged in to charge, but that's it. I couldn't even get the backlight to stay on, so I'd have to hold my cell phone to the monitor to see that it said &#34;LINKED&#34; and was still on. Terrible product.	
- 1	These are ok but quality didn't impress me and not that absorbent. I end up using cloth diapers as burp rags most of the time. And FYI. If you are a first time mom, you need like 20 burp rags or cloth diapers to use as such.	
1. 	Getting a second car seat base is a good idea if you like to switch cars with your partner a lot	
1. 	Love this stroller frame.  I have the Graco Snugride 30 carseat and thought this would be perfect to use with it b/c its so lightweight.  This frame is also really easy to put together. All you have to do is put on the wheels and they just click on.  Easiest assembly I've ever seen.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to deal with a full size gigantic travel system stroller for their newborn.  If you buy the larger style Graco carseats, you'll be able to use this stroller frame for longer.	
1. 	Our 6 month old outgrew her 4 stage bath tub & I wasn't comfortable readjusting it to fit a toddler.  This Eurobath is wonderful.  It is VERY roomy & baby enjoys splashing around. There is plenty of room for her toys.  It has a drain & I haven't had any problems with it.  It seems like it would have been perfect to bathe an infant too (since it has the special design to do so), but I didn't have it at the time.  I definitely recommend this tub!	
1. 	I wish these bottles had been around when my boys were babies but am glad they are here for my grandchildren.My son and daughter-in-law wanted bottles that would switch well with breastfeeding (so my son and the grandparents could also be involved).  These have been a good choice - the babies didn't take long to learn about the switchover between Mom and these bottle nipples.I love that the bottles are BPA-free. The nipples are a little large for smaller (think preemie) babies but are great shape and size as babies are a little older, say above 8 pounds.  I had no problem cleaning these in dishwasher (I used added heat cycle to sterilize) and basket for nipples and rings. I love that both ends come off the bottles to make cleaning easier.The angled necks work well as far as less gas as the babies drink. I wouldn't say NO gas but a lot less air taken in when drinking than other bottles that were tried.Since babies are able to sit up more to drink, I am hoping these bottles work as advertised as far as no ear infections - a real problem with both my sons. So far, none - and no leaking either. I'll update if this changes as nipples get older if there is a leakage problem.All in all, these have been a great choice.	
- 1	Nowhere in the description of these 'cloth' diapers does it mention that they are 100% synthetic.  I couldn't stand the feel of them on my fingers much less putting these next to my baby's skin.  I like the idea of a one size diaper - but not the idea of nothing but man made fabric.  Wouldn't recommend them for anyone.  Am selling the ones I bought.	
- 1	This bottle cools way way too fast.  And when you do warm it in water the stainless steel burns you.  I do not have a problem with this on other bottles I've purchased.  The bottle also leaks with the nipples that were supplied.  My precious breast milk would just run out.  I tried replacing the nipples with other recommended ones and the milk still leaked.Other bottles keep the heat in longer or the cold in longer.  These do not.  They immediately go to room temp much faster than any other bottle I've used.	
- 1	This pad works well , but beware it has that California 117 flame retardant material that is in question.  I use it for my grandson when he comes to visit.	
1. 	What can I say, the product simply works. I only use it on long trips but there is where it makes all the difference. I happen to have a convertible and the strap hits me at a terrible spot. This becomes an issue on long trips. This product has enabled me to stop constantly pushing the belt down and watching it ride right back up and then cutting into my neck. So, bottom line, if you have a seatbelt such as mine I wholeheartedly recommend this product.	
- 1	[...]I don't know how many times my fingers have gotten caught in the pack `n play when I am trying to break it down and unlock the sides. I thought this thing was suppose to be for convenience not butchering your fingers?! How many of you have gotten ouchies from a pack `n play ? I'm just glad little fingers are not strong enough to unlock the sides and get their fingers caught!	
1. 	This item is perfect for sitting next to the tub while I bath my daughter.  It's easier on your back & knees.  It's also great for holding her bath things.  We love it!	
- 1	We bought these for our 3-year-old son, who is in underwear but still has lots of accidents, to cut down on leakage when we're places where a damp child might be unwelcome. They only &#34;sort of&#34; work; if we catch the accident right away, the pants can hold some of it, but if we wait even 5 minutes there's a total deluge with or without the plastic pants. The pants can actually make cleanup harder, as they are one more thing to wash, and as my son views them as an almost-diaper, he tends to have more accidents with them on. I think psychologically, some kids react to an article of clothing that reminds them of diapers. So these were not a good solution for us.Also, the sizes run GINORMOUS. My son wears size 4T shirts & underpants, and the 2T plastic pants were still so huge and puffy on him that he probably needed the 18-month size.As for using these as low-budget cloth diaper covers, I cloth diapered our son for 2 years and I can't imagine how messy and inconvenient these covers would have been. If there is poop, there is no easy way to get the diaper out of the cover because the cover doesn't have side closures. Poop smears must be common. I also don't think the leg elastics are strong enough to contain what an infant or toddler puts out. You can get Proraps or another basic cover with Velcro side closures and far superior durability for about $8 a pair. Don't waste money on these.	
1. 	I thought a fold-up tub was a great idea, but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months, the maximum age of use.  I paid only $10, so not much loss.  She objected the first time we tried it, at about 2 weeks, and so we went back to sponge baths for a while.  I would suggest gradually introducing your baby to the tub.  Toys helped distract her when she was a little older.  My daughter seemed too big for it even at 3 months, though she was always 97%+ in height & weight.  To wash her backside, you of course have to take her out of the tub.  I usually forgot to plug it before filling it, and so usually had water all over the floor.  Instructions say tub is supposed to be supported by a sink; it certainly doesn't fit in our oval bath sink.  Maybe it would fit a 2-part kitchen sink.  The folding feature did make it easy to store on our closet shelf.  For a little tub bath, I liked it.  It was good for a quick bath or to really soak her, but in the end I prefered a unhurried sponge bath on a waterproof pad on the bed, which I think got my daughter cleaner.	
1. 	This conversion kit allows me to pump into the large 9 oz Avent bottles, which is very helpful as the Medela bottles only allow up to 6 oz.	
1. 	For the most part, I like this product. The first one I bought died after about 15 uses. The second one outlived my son's bottle use, and it worked great. You do have to shake the bottle to distribute the heat evenly and test it, but that's normal for any bottle warmer. Ours worked in about 10 minutes, but it depends on how warm your baby likes their bottle. For $10 I was happy with it.	
- 1	I ordered this over 2 months ago. The claimed they shipped it over a month ago. I have written to the distributor and complained that this never arrived. but they never responded. The money for the product was taken from my account but i have no word about the item at all. I will never EVER EVER buy from this distributor again!! I Hate that i have to give them my money!! They just ripped me off!!! If the item i bought ever arrives i will update this post..... but i'm not holding breath. And now it looks like i need to buy another 1 from someone else because my daughter still needs one. makes me soo mad. i worked hard for that money that they basically stole.	
1. 	When our baby started standing up, I held him under the armpits and helped him walk while supported.  It's not the most comfortable position to hold over the long run - for me or for the baby.  This harness distributes the support over his whole torso using a durable foam-padded soft wrap-around chest piece connected to nylon web belt and soft loop handles for the adult to hold.  The loops can be adjusted in the length to adapt to your height.  There are no pressure spots so this makes wearing the unit comfortable.  Baby can take supported steps while you hold him from above.  Our baby enjoyed this activity so we spent a long time each day walking around the house.  I credit this item for making this activity a comfortable and fun way to spend time with our baby and for helping him develop good leg strength.  We stopped using it once he was able to stand and support himself using a push-cart with wheels and used that to walk while supporting his body until his balancing skills developed.	
1. 	We needed something to put on the side of our changing table for our wipe warmer and this really was our answer. Although our crib is curvy and not straight on the sides it still holds everything just right. A must have if you have the prince lionheart wipe warmer.	
- 1	I had this pump on my registry but then was also given a double electric pump (Medela Pump in Style) all I can say is GOOD THING I HAD THE DOUBLE PUMP! This single electric one just cannot get enough pressure/suction/whatever. plus even if it DID work, a single pump means double the pumping time. I know double electric pumps are expensive, but beg, borrow, get your family to go in it as a gift - you NEED it and this single pump is NOT an adequate substitute for a real pump! You can even rent a double pump from the hospital or a lactation consultant. Just don't bother trying this one.	
1. 	I really like this gate, it was easy to install and it looks great.  I highly recommend it but I also have metal door frames so I don't know if this would dent the wood in a regular door frame.  Though I think a small dent would be better than a screw hole...	
1. 	We have a dishwasher and had a full term very healthy child, and still used this product. Lids and nipples tend to turn up in the dishwasher and retain water, and sediment..so what is point if I have to just rewash them?This sterilizer holds 6 bottles, nipples, tops, and pacifiers all at the same time. You can put breast pump parts in it, and anything else that you need to sterilize. I washed everything, filled this with the items and water, and popped it in at 6 minutes in our microwave to have perfectly clean and sterilized bottles, pacifiers, or breast pump parts. I used this everyday until my son was 6 months old, when we stopped sterilizing bottles. Its easy, safe, convenient, and fast.	
- 1	The music is pretty nice and not annoying. However, the images really aren't that interesting. I think my baby finds it pretty boring. It doesn't seem to soothe him much either.	
1. 	These snack containers work well as, well snack containers...but don't think they will keep the snack from spilling or going all over the car.  It takes about 5 minutes for a toddler to figure out how to make them through cereal all over the place. LOL!  I had high hopes the cereal would be contained...but no.	
1. 	My daughter uses the rapid flow during the day, however at almost 6 months we are still using the slow-flow at night, or before naps, when she gets sleepy and too tired to guzzle like she usually does.	
1. 	I like this pillow, its my second being that im prego again. the first pillow and already this one after only a month has little pilthy balls on the underside already. I obviously STILL love and bought a second because you don't have to keep moving a body pillow side to side. this is a LARGE pillow, Im glad  we have a king size bed.	
1. 	This is the best thing I've found in a long time.  I tried one of those cheap sponge things from [a store], and it just mildewed and was disgusting after a VERY short period of time.  I went to babiesrus which is where I should have gone in the FIRST place and there this was.  The last one too!  Boy, I just don't know what I would have done without it. Especially for a first baby and you're nervous about bathing anyway.  This thing keeps the baby warm, snug and safe in the baby tub or sink.  It just is a great thing and the baby loves it!  I try to buy one for every baby shower now but they usually run out at babies rus!  Great, great item!  One of the BEST parts is that it's WASHABLE!	
1. 	These are great for distraction-type snacks in our jogging stroller since it has no snack tray.  I worry that repeated removal of the lid will stretch it so the child will be able to remove it easily, so I don't take it off unless I have to - I just shove food in through the slits.  My only complaint is the lack of a lid so I can store in in my diaper bag already to go.  Not a huge deal though.  Very glad I bought these!  One of my girls hates to ride in a stroller (she likes to ride on my back) but sometimes she has to - this helps a lot.	
- 1	I'm pretty annoyed because I didn't realize it wasn't working right until now and I've had it a couple years. Thankfully, my family hasn't had any high fevers, so it really hasn't been needed. I most recently tried using it to chart my bbt, since it reads in .1 increments. I can't even get it to give the same reading twice. It's ridiculous. Do not buy, unless you like throwing your money away.	
- 1	I guess when they say &#34;colors may vary&#34; they don't consider the boy/girl factor. I have a boy, and would have been happy with any other color than pink, but that's what I got. Sending them back, probably not going to order another.	
1. 	I got this for my son's first birthday and it was an instant hit. He loves to chase this ball around the house! The little people that pop out as it rolls makes it more exciting than a regular ball.	
- 1	I never used this.Any way the milk needs to be heated before putting it to the liner and liner cannot be heated directly and is small for even the one time use	
1. 	These are adorable and soft enough to keep baby comfortable as well as entertained in the car ... I bought these in the pink bunny option also!	
- 1	My daughter is 3 months and weighs about 14 punds.  But she is tall and thin.  She is too small for it and doesnt like to slumped over.  Maybe it will work better when she has head control?	
1. 	Keeps my newborn son in position I put him.  It makes me feel good that my son will not have square head because he always sleeps on one side.	
- 1	The toddler has a hard time gripping these because the handle is thin with a slight curve to it plus the spork like fork doesn't stab or hold food very well. We just switched let him use a regular fork and spoon instead. I wish I had not have bought these.	
1. 	I love it and so my baby. It is very comfortable and soft. My daughter cannot sleep without a sleep sack. And I do not worry that she will kick off a blanket and get cold at a middle of night. With a sleep sack everybody sleeps better :)	
1. 	Not sure why this is listed as a toy; i rated this as functional dinnerware/cups not a toy.I purchased the original First Years cup set with the sippy cup style and moved on to the straw set when my toddler was ready. They are just as sturdy with a non-flexible straw. The colors are very vibrant with matching tops and straws.The only suggestion I have is insert the straw AFTER you have placed liquid inside and capped it. Otherwise the liquid will squirt right out.The cups wash up really well in the dishwasher. The straws fall through my utensil container so i do have to hand wash those, but that is the only hassel.Overall the cups are great for toddlers. My daughter can drop it and as long as it does not land on the top side it rarely leaks.	
1. 	Purchased when my 4 month old seemed to be getting bored with her sea gym. She was excited and engaged from the moment we put her down with this. Fairly easy to assemble and can be kept clean easily. Very pleased with this purchase!	
1. 	I purchased this item for use for cloth diapers. I have purchased a cloth liner that fits well in it and the one button touch opens easy to slide diapers in. the pail cleans well and haven't had any issues with smell as of yet.	
1. 	So, at first glance I thought that this booster seat would be uncomfortable for my son because it has not cushioning, but that's far from a concern now. My son loves his seat, seriously!  I love that it is very safe.  It snaps to the chair really tightly, it snaps to my son, and the table snaps as well.  I also like that it has a cover.  I really like it, and I recommend it for anyone to buy :)	
- 1	We got these after trying avent, medela, nuk, breastflow and a few others. I thought I found the answer to my son's excessive gas/acid reflux in these bottles as it seemed he reacted right away by burping less during feedings. However, after a week or so- I noticed leaking. A LOT of leaking. This includes the glass bottles and the plastic. I tried taking them apart, reassembling, making sure the nipple was pressed in all the way, unscrewing the lid, tightening the lid, switching parts... Nothing. I pump exclusively and fill these bottles. After all that work pumping, cleaning of those parts then cleaning and setting up of all these dr brown parts- the last bs I want to deal with is leaking! It leaks so much we have to wrap a towel around the bottles while feeding! I'm NOT happy I've spent over $25 on dr brown's bottles for this to happen. I JUST threw away the packaging, of course! I wish I could return them and get my money back. I do however, LOVE the warmer by dr brown. That is an excellent product. By the way, if you're baby has COLIC look into acid reflux. 1 out of 5 babies have it- and supposedly drs now think colic is actually stomach acid burning the baby's esophagus. Does the baby arch his/her back and get fussy after meals or when you lay them down on their backs? You can DO something about their pain. There is no such thing as colic.	
- 1	I bought two. Threw them both away after cutting the pacifier off. So I got a pacifier for 12 bucks	
1. 	Similar to a Boppy, but the extra strap is neat if you want to sit your child in it. And it is great for breastfeeding support. I wouldn't go without it.	
- 1	The guard to prevent choking is useless if, say, your child decides to put the hard end in her mouth. They should have designed this with the soft parts at both ends. Also, the end harbors bacteria.	
- 1	I wanted to like these so bad but they're useless.  First of all, they leak right through (for me).  I don't mind but they are also quite bulky and thick.	
- 1	updated review...17 months later. i purchased this because i liked that its a reusable and i love skip hop items i have their diaper bag!!i thought hey i can refill as needed and attach to the stroller etc. however the strap on it broke and it would no longer hang or attach to the stroller and the slider was not the best. It would not hold any moisture for the wipes. i have plenty of those cheap wipe holders you get and they hold moisture better than this thing. Not to happy about this item after all.	
1. 	Nice bib.  Rinses clean and dries quickly.  Fits my baby well at 18 to 20 months.  Very good for particularly messy eaters.  Should fit her well for at least the next 6 months and possibly longer.  Pocket is only good for catching liquids that drip down...not really good for food particles because it doesn't stay in an open position.  Ties behind the neck so baby cannot remove easily like velco bibs.  Also, can get the neck fairly snug because of the ability to adjust the size of the neck opening with the tie closure.  I don't know that I would recommend this for babies less than a year...would probably be too big.	
1. 	I like having this around for easy bath time readings cause some times you think its fine, turns out its hot.	
- 1	I would get something without the little stuffed animals on it.  They are in the way -- they push up around babies face.  Really uncomfortable for little one.  Shouldn't have worried about being cute...	
- 1	This definitely isn't a great buy. I don't hate it, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. The sprayer leaks, not by the connection to the toilet, but at the handle. Obviously, I wash my hands after changing a diaper anyways, but I could do without getting soaked from the handle anyway.	
- 1	I had heard such great things about the woombie and was so excited to use it but the neck is way too small and chokes baby! I would buy in an instant if there was a larger neck hole. My baby is 14 lbs and his neck isn't oversized and it was waaaay too small. This is supposed to fit babies 14-19 lbs... bummer!	
- 1	I laughed out loud when I opened this. It is a small SMALL piece of fabric with some ties on it. It covers about 1/4 of the sheet. What are the chances that my son will wet/throw up./whatever perfectly in that spot? Some people say to get two, but why dont they just make it bigger and charge more? It seems silly to me. Not happy at all with this. Sending it back for sure!	
- 1	I purchased this for my in-laws car. One BIG problem is that the &#34;Grey&#34; button you have to push to lower or raise the seat for proper adjustment is nothing like the original that comes with the seat. This one is very hard to push and if you are not careful, you will lose your fingernail. Hurts like crazy trying to push the button back so you can adjust it. For the price, I would expect it too be more like the original. Buyer Beware.	
1. 	This sling was absolutely terrific, especially when my son was a newborn to about 5 months.  I also have a Baby Bjorn, but that was better for later on.  At first, the Nojo is excellent because the baby doesn't have to be upright and you don't have to worry about the head floppiness.We had actually purchased another, more expensive sling but it had more of a bucket for the baby to go into and my son hated it! With the Nojo, you really can adjust everything - where you put them, how you put it on, how high or low you wear it, etc.There are two excellent uses that I found for the sling, but DIDN'T like the Baby Bjorn for:1) At night when the baby is very young (up to about 4 months), you can wear the baby down in the sling by walking around till the baby falls asleep.  It's a great way to calm/ quiet and get the baby to sleep.  It used to work when even rocking wouldn't work.2) You can literally do the dishes, laundry, even have a snack while wearing the sling.  This was somehow a lot harder for me with the Bjorn because I kept bumping the baby.Don't get me wrong, I love the Bjorn too and find it much better for walks.  But around the home, the sling was always the carrier I would turn to.  It's just so easy to throw on, throw the baby into - not a lot of straps and so on to deal with.Outstanding purchase for yourself or a shower gift!!!	
1. 	This is a great product. It is light weight and can carry it anywhere. Love the feature that can fold nicely. Good to have it if you live in the apartment.	
1. 	Seems to help with my son's colic. Be sure to push the air out once the bottle is put together and formula/breast milk is it. Air will flow through the nipple. We used it until he was eating around 6oz a serving.	
- 1	This thing made us crazy. Usually Nuby products are well-made and reliable. This one leaked everywhere, no matter how carefully we secured the lid and handles, and no matter how often we cleaned it, it smelled like sour milk. Even after being run through the dishwasher on the sterilize setting. I threw it out about three weeks after I got it, because Nuby makes much better sippy cups and bottles for less expense.	
1. 	After trying the Brica mirror, the Diono is a MUCH better design. It actually stays in place! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I do wish it was magnified more, but overall I am very pleased with this product.	
1. 	I didn't even know this existed for my first baby and thankfully i received this as a gift for my second baby. wish i had it sooner!  we're in nyc frequently and it's great to be able to strap this on with my baby and still have 2 hands free for my toddler.  i think this is much more comfortable for my baby than keeping her in the stroller with the cover.  it is definitely wind resistant and light rain resistant.  not for heavy rain.  keeps her very warm and comfy.	
- 1	This brush is huge. The size is a positive because it cleans the whole surface of the bottle. However, when you pull it out of the bottle the bristles cause soap to splatter everywhere. The bristles are very rough so it does scratch the bottles.The nipple bristles are firm enough to clean well. I also like that the nipple brush is longer than the recent nipple brushes I have seen.  The suction does work well. One major negative about the nipple brush is the wire that it is made out of is rusting at the tip.I would not purchase again.	
- 1	I thought this would be a nice teether for my three-month-old, since her mouth is too small for most teething aids. Wish I had looked at it in person first - it really is nothing more than an organically-sourced dog toy. The thing even smells like a dog toy, not something I would want in my mouth, let alone my daughter's. The squeaker is loud, not soothing at all, and the skin has an unpleasant texture, like the inside of a powdered latex glove. I would recommend this to the owner of a small dog, but not to a parent.	
1. 	Works well for a booster.  Food cleans off easily, but because of the material, things like fuzz/dust do not clean off as easily.  They tend to stick to the material.	
1. 	These are really great if your kid kicks off the blankets, then wakes up because he's cold. They are roomy enough for them to move around in, and sized generously. My son outgrew the small size by 6 months (29&#34;), and I skipped the medium size entirely and went right to a large, which he will be in for several more months.	
- 1	Too small, didn't work on any of our cabinets.  I returned them and replaced with better universal locks from Buy Buy Baby.	
1. 	These are cute boats for the bath. Like all bath toys, after about 3 months they are starting to get moldy on the inside. Happens to all bath toys so I knew that when I bought them.	
1. 	I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).	
1. 	I have tried several other kinds of bottle brushes & this one works best for me.  It fits well into most sippy cups as well as the Playtex Drop in bottles.  The nipple brush is great for cleaning the nipples, which I do by hand every day.  It only lasts a couple weeks with heavy daily use (the nipple brush is first to go) so it would be awesome if there were replacement nipple brushes.	
- 1	For the price, at about twenty bucks, it isn't horrible. But it isn't as convenient as I thought...I bought aThe First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Rev and Go Sounds Potty Seat(which is cute, but no longer makes any noise and had the battery explode and leak battery acid onto the seat) to use in our upstairs bathroom and I figured this seat would snap off and be the seat for our second toilet once the little potty was outgrown...but you have to take off the entire top half - lid and green handles and all to place on top of your toilet seat. The thing is HUGE and not easy to store in the bathroom when not sitting on the potty. The step-stool feature is equally annoying because it is shaped, well, like a potty, not like a stool and is too short to get my son onto the toilet or assist with hand-washing.Basically, if you are not sure whether you child will prefer a little potty or the adult one and you need to break him/her into the idea, this isn't awful. I honestly wouldn't recommend it. It might be ok if you got it on super sale and it was for a grandparent's house where it would be lightly used, otherwise, keep browsing and find something else!	
1. 	it's cheap and comfy; my baby doesn't like any bib, but this one is the only he accepts; the other expensive ones became toys or trash .... never used them. I do recommend it 100%	
1. 	These were a great size for homemade baby food and milk.  I was able to freeze milk for daycare and send frozen cubes in a bag instead of using milk bags or freezing bottles.  They are easy to clean.  I found that if you set them out on the counter for a couple of minutes, the food just pops right out of them easily.	
- 1	I managed to get this seat in and secure it well in my 2009 Scion XB, but even at the most reclined position, it seems like it is sitting straight up. My sons head slumps forward and it looks so uncomfortable. I did get a good deal on it, but I dont think I would recommend it. Needs to be able to recline a little better. Not impressed.	
- 1	First off, the suction cup only works on glass tile or very smooth tile.  The majority of the tile in our bathroom has some texture to it.  The suction cup never would stick to it.  However we had a small amount of large glass tile and it worked very nicely... for about 4 months.  Then it stopped working and now won't even stay on without any additional weight.  Very disappointing.	
1. 	I have a number of different sized windows (sash, new plastic type windows) in my baby's room and I installed these on each window - two on the wider/larger window. Easy to install and works well. Even when I open a window and forget they are on the window, they stop me opening the window too far.Just follow the instructions, to make sure the wedge is secure. Can be easily repositioned.	
1. 	This product works but I'm not sure why it is so expensive for each individual lock. I'm looking forward to see what happens when we remove them.	
1. 	If I could I would give this product 4.5 stars because it really only has a couple of minor things to take away from it. We bought this monitor before our second child was born, after discovering with our first how tricky it is to figure out if your baby really needs you to come in the room or not. Many times I would hear my son crying and not knowing what the problem is, sneak into his room- only to find he had fallen back asleep and then heard me come in and woken up again. Very frustrating at 3am. There was also the constant worry as a new parent whether or not he was ok- didn't have his leg through the bars or something else going on.This monitor is awesome and has come in SO handy for us, especially since we live downstairs and the nursery is upstairs. With a click of the button on top I can turn the screen on and see her sleeping peacefully. Or if she is crying I can click on it to see if she is crying in her sleep (crying but not moving), or really awake (squirming, eyes open). I can also tell if she has spit up, wedged herself into the corner of the crib, etc. Then I can run upstairs to help her instead of wondering what the problem is and whether I should risk waking her fully by going in her room. Not to mention she looks so cute when she is sleeping and I get to see her all the time. :)Things I like:Portability- battery lasts forever and recharges every night while we have it plugged in.Volume control- Very sensitive. I can make it loud or extremely soft.Screen size- Seems just right. The smaller one would have been a little hard to work with I think.Clarity of soundThings that I wish were better:Sometimes the video and sound flicker with some interference. Mainly in my kitchen for some reason. Or when I am using the cordless phone right next to it.The video can sometimes be a bit grainy, but most of the time we get a good picture.The camera could be little more adjustable. It goes in most directions but is tricky to adjust if you have it mounted on the wall instead of the crib.That's all I can think of. By the way, we also have the angel care movement sensor monitor, which sounds an alarm if it does not detect movement (breathing) for 20 seconds or more. In conjunction with the video monitor we joke that our daughter is under surveillance- but I love the peace of mind and convenience of both monitors...	
1. 	I go through these quickly, so I get a couple boxes at a time.  Worth the price; and that price is better than the price in the store.	
1. 	We've loved this little tub!  We used the sling insert for the first few weeks, then moved our new baby girl to the infant side.  The non-slip coating on the infant ramp and bump in the bottom of the tub kept her safely upright while I washed her.  She quickly discovered how much fun a bath can be!  When she was able to sit up on her own, we moved her to the toddler side of the tub so she could sit upright.  Baths became even more fun (and the kitchen even more wet!).  I've recently retired this tub and moved our now 1 year old to the big bath tub and I must say I miss how much easier it was to bathe her in this tub.	
1. 	My son started to like this mat around 4-5 mos. He's 8 now and is still entertained by it. Our 45 lb bulldog pounces on it, runs across it and stands on it multiple times daily, I can't believe it hasn't popped...is a tough little mat!!  Have recommended to multiple friends, and the price is right on Amazon! (I bought at a local toy store for about 40% more).	
- 1	I couldn't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase. I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and sticks the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes. Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side. I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields.	
1. 	It is fast and works great!  It is much faster than the old fashioned way of warming bottles, and it is portable.  We've taken it out of town several times.  Plus, it doesn't leak!	
1. 	This dresser is beautiful.  Listing says solid wood but drawers are particle board except for the front.  This was a little difficult to put together.  The previous reviewer complained of the drawers falling apart, I can see how that would happen if they were not put together correctly.  Mine came with all the parts and instructions so we had no problem with that.  It is sturdy and drawers open and shut properly.  Very nice.  ([...], it is cheaper there).  Shipped within 2 to 3 weeks from manufacturer.  This furniture seems to be in high demand and is on backorder often, so check before ordering.	
- 1	I am not at all impressed that this arrived 'brand new' in packaging, yet when I opened it it has a large stain on it.  You can't even miss it!  I am yet to see if it will wash out.  That said, it is soft and the colours are gorgeous.  I hope that don't fade in the wash.	
1. 	This is a fun toy for babies as the sides move into different shapes.  The plastic surfaces have various textures for chewing and touching.  Simple, yet a great product.  I recommend it.	
1. 	not too sure what others are refering to when saying this gate is difficult to use... it sets up like any other pressure mounted gate out there.  to set up, of course you need 2 hands [another person is so NOT needed] line it up with your wall, choose the size, and push the bar down.  to take down- you only need 1 hand, simply pull the bar up.what i love about this gate, is that when taking it down you can pull the bar completely up and not have to worry about the gate coming apart.  there is a locking feature that prevents the two slats from going out the other end.  you'll know what i'm talking about if you've owned the cheapy 10 dollar gate.it's tall, very sturdy, and fits bigger doorways.  i use it both for dogs and children.  perfect for both uses.unless you're using too tight of a setting it will not damage your walls.  and of course if it falls down easily, your setting is too loose.  other than that, it's easy to get up and very easy to get down.	
1. 	I was having a huge problem getting my son to sleep in his own room.  However, when I put the Dreamscape Soother in his crib he would fall right to sleep.  Now he sleeps in there all night every night.  This product also has a night light and a volume control button which are two excellent items to have at night.  Great product!!!	
- 1	Yes I read the directions. About 4 parts just do not fit. One main piano piece is about 1/4 too shallow for the screws to reach and hold it in place. It won't even balance on there. And the other 2 or 3 tall pieces won't hold even the slightest tug. I'm telling you, the entire thing is garbage. Maybe you will have a better experience, but keep reading reviews. Off to Babies R Us to see if they will let us return it.Maybe I will upload a videoFrank	
1. 	I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it.	
- 1	I originally ordered the safety first kensington bc of its beautiful looks, wipeable seat and small fold. When I got it together it didn't fold as compact as I needed so I ordered this graco in rittenhouse. I thought based on positive reviews id love it even though it wasn't my first choice. First thing I noticed is it is significantly heavier than the s1. The fabric is super cheap feeling. It's white and black which looks like cream and black on the photo and doesn't really make sense bc the frame is cream. It'snot made of a even slightly wipeable material. Its plan fabric which would stain horribly. It's way too short and the seat sitting area is not very deep and looks way uncomfortable. Needless to say,  id rather the other take up room in my teeny tiny kitchen than put up with this garbage. If you want something better quality with a beautiful look go for the safety 1st kensington from babies r us.	
- 1	I got this cup for my 6 month old baby, she was always breastfed so I wanted to introduce juices with this cup.PROS: it doesn't leak, it looks beautiful, it's the perfect size for my baby to hold by herself, the handles are absolutely amazing because I can use them in my other tommee tippee bottles.CONS: you need to clean it extremely meticulosly because mold builds up. If you use it for something else than plain water, be really careful to put every piece apart and clean it perfectly. Then let it dry for several hours until COMPLETELY dry and then you can use it again. Handwash highly recommendedAgain nothing wrong just too much work for a 6 month old baby mom. I want every that goes into my baby's mouth SUPER clean, but don't have time to spend 10 min cleaning just one cup.	
- 1	This toy will turn itself on without anyone pressing on its hands and feet. One time it started playing music while on the couch. No one was touching or sitting near it. Either way this toy is not a motion activated toy, so it shouldn't have done that. Most recently I heard it go off several times in the middle of the night! It really creeped me out! Needless to say it has been off and will remain off from here on out.Other than that I've also experienced similar issues other commentators complained about such as:1. The maraca hand sometimes works, but not always.2. My daughter has never really shown much interest in it despite how visually stimulating it is. I bought her a classic Glow Worm yesterday and she has taken way more interest in it in just one day than she has in this Panda that she has had since she was born.3. I agree with other commentators saying that the tunes are short and the instruments all sound very similar. Not that my daughter knows any different or cares, but I know it's not supposed to sound that way and having very short tunes is a rip off. Again, the Glow Worm has a similar yet much more basic concept and yet the tunes sound much better, are more complex, and last longer.4. The velco opening on the back is not big enough,which makes it hard to close. Which is a bummer when regulating the volume and the on/off switch.	
- 1	I haven't opened the packaging so cannot comment on the functionality as I will be returning these spoons.  I did not realize that these were disposable spoons - I found that description in the very small print at the bottom of the item page.  Very disappointing. I already create enough waste to not add these spoons to it.UPDATEIt was more trouble than it was worth to send back the spoons so I have been using them, or that should be I used them.  Once.  The plastic is scratchy around the spoon (you can see the seam) and I was not comfortable scraping the excess food off of my 6 month old baby's face with them as they looked very uncomfortable on her skin.  I think I was lucky not to actually scratch her delicate skin.  I will still pay the $7 odd to get the OXO spoons which I love, though whilst I only get 2 for $7 compared to the 10 for $8, I will be happier with them and I won't have to throw them away as they break down.	
1. 	If you want a soft-hanging organizer, this is the best you'll get. It does tip forward a bit, as any hanging fabric organizer will, but it has compensated for that with pocketed shelves (as opposed to open shelves like on theDex Products Ultimate Baby Organizerwhere everything slides right off). I use this Munchkin organizer with thePrince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmerand it fits great right on top in a very convenient place. It fits everything I need in the organizer, whereas with theDex OrganizerI had to use an extra TV table tray to handle the overflow. The pocketed diaper middle section is great! It actually holds the diapers in! It's tricky to restock it, but the fact that the diapers do not tip out more than makes up for it! If you want something sturdier, you'll have to go with hard plastic, because you won't find a better fabric organizer.	
- 1	I really wish these wipes are what they are advertised to be, but to me they are just regular natural wipes packed for Medela and with a ridiculously high price.	
1. 	Thank goodness for these!  Great packaging because I go through a lot as they should be changed often.  No plastic so they breathe.	
1. 	The first time we used these we tried to spell out our sons name only to realize there is only 1 of each letter.  Makes spelling things tough.  They stick to the tub well and the bright colors are great for our son.	
- 1	I have a Graco travel system and a City Mini stroller. This arch didn't fit on any of those items. It was too short to stretch and attach to the carseat or strollers and when I tried to attach it, the toys were right in my daughter's face. I was able to attach it to the bouncy seat on the floor but that already came with a toy bar so this was pointless for us.	
1. 	My little guy was getting too big for the normal plastic baby tub and I am not quite ready to have him be on his own in the tub right now.  I like that I can &#34;be in control&#34; a little bit more with this bath tub.I really wish that I would have gotten this when he was 4-5 months old when he could sit upright by himself.I make sure that I rinse it out and hang it up immediately so that it can start drying out.  So far, I have not noticed any musty smell.What I also like about this is my son burnt his foot and we were having to elevate it and keep it out of the water for awhile.  This tub was perfect.  Since the sides are soft (think bean bag chair) we propped his foot up on the side and he left it there because it was cushiony.  I also like that I can lay him down to rinse out his hair and he is comfortable and doesn't fight it like he did in the plastic tub.You can't go wrong with this purchase!	
1. 	I was definitely skeptical after reading the mixed reviews for this product but I decided to try it anyway.  It is hard to get the amount of water just right but I really like it anyway.  Remember, different bottles will necessitate different amounts of water.  It heats quickly, is small enough to be portable, and is inexpensive.  I highly recommend it.	
1. 	We've used several of the bags to keep smellies at bay in our diaper pail.  These have been our favorite.  We used the Arm and Hammer ones but the preferation is hard to get them pulled apart, same with the two other eco friendly ones we've used but these fit the bill.  They are easy to get apart when you got a squirmy baby on the changing table, have a nice soft powdery smell and are very sturdy.  I've been very pleased with these and will be ordering these again.	
- 1	I like the look, fit and ease of these cloth trainers... but one of the snaps broke off when I was unsnapping an insert.  So now, they are useless (I can't get an insert to stay in place without the snaps).  Major bummer!	
1. 	Honestly, I don't just use these for babies.  In fact, it's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids.  They won't touch the metal ones, but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails.  The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails... but you can't beat the ease of clipping with these things!	
- 1	This would have barely covered my lap. How I use these now is just for under my baby's butt whenever she gets changed on her changing pad in case of accident. It helps delay us from having to wash the Kushies waterproof pad that we have over our changing pad cover, which are much better for the job. Our baby tends to have lots of accidents so it worked out I guess but I would have never bought these if I had realized how small they were.	
1. 	Easy to use, easy to travel with! Works great in crib or playpin.  Our son is now able to rest thanks to this product	
- 1	I bought this as I was planning to have a home birth and realized the initial footprint isn't taken like it is in hospital, and I really wanted that first footprint.  I liked that it was inkless and came with paper, but to call it deluxe is a complete overstatement.  The paper was nothing more than thick printing paper and the inkless wipes left more than just a footprint on the paper - like inkless blots.  I followed the instructions and the result was a messy, ink-like footprint on paper.  The only saving grace was there were no inky feet to clean off afterward - a simple wipe down with a wet cloth did the trick (though, I'd highly recommend a thorough hand wash if you do handprints).  There were other products just like this for far less and I'd have been equally happy with those.  Would not recommend this product.	
1. 	Ive tested a few seat covers and none really worked well.. this one comes real close. It does its job in terms of covering the seat but it however fits a little loose on some seats and the tightening straps dont really do the trick. Its a solid investment and something that minor can be overlooked. It has no chemical smell right out of the box and the material works well with the baby carriers to keep it in place.	
- 1	I read some of the reviews written here before making the purchase. And I had seen people complaining about the zipper falling off in the wash soon after getting it. But I've purchased a lot of different aden + anais products (bibs, burp cloths, swaddles, bamboo swaddles, blankets) in the past and have always been happy with the quality. So I decided to go against my better judgement and purchase this sleep sack, even though it is way more expensive than some of the other ones out there.Well, I really should have listened to the reviews!! Returning this tomorrow. It truly is very poor quality. The zipper fell off after two washes!! Don't waste your money on this product - it's not high quality like all the other aden + anais products!	
1. 	Great night light. Our kids love the different colors. I love that it turns off in 45 minutes. Cute design!	
- 1	I was so excited to find a pail specifically for cloth diapers that I eagerly awaited it's arrival and as soon as I opened the box my heart sunk I was so disappointed and wanted to return it. The bin is so small and I felt not at all worth the price. However, after realizing the $12 shipping cost to me would come out of my pocket, as well as the cost to send it back, it felt like I was stuck between a rock and a hard place-either pay $25 to return a $38 bucket or just keep it, so it's now sitting in it's box in a corner of the nursery.I looked for cloth diaper pails everythwere (online, that is) and couldn't find another that was larger and sepcifically for cloth diapers. I would recommend someone get a simple plastic bin and stick the air fresheners/filters onto the inside of the lid, it would save significant $$ and I wish I had thought to do that instead.Currently, I have a nice big one from the gal who owns the diaper service we use (I didn't realize she was providing a pail when we ordered this one) I asked where she got it and how much it costs. Found out it comes from Canada and she can get one for about $40. I'm not sure of the brand or how she orders them but if I find out I'll add it to this review	
1. 	This is a great item to help your child strengthen their legs, plus the added bonus of wearing them out before nap time!  The look of joy on their little faces, once they figure out how to jump, is the greatest thing ever!	
- 1	I put new batteries in both units & only 1 unit worked.  I returned the & amazon.com was quick to send the paid return UPS label.  They refunded my money as soon as they were notified I dropped the box off at UPS.  Thanks again Amazon'I bought Safety 1st Crystal Clear Audio Monitor (1 RX) & it works great.	
1. 	I used to use cloth bib during solid food time. You could imagine it would involve a lot clean up work after each feeding. However, this bib ( i think it made of some kind of rubber) is quite soft and the surface is easy to clean. My son was easily vomit after solid food at the beginning. This bib save a lot time.	
- 1	The red closure button doesn't stay put well and often slides open in the diaper bag, which dries out the wipes.  The case is also bulkier than I expected.	
1. 	I love this cart cover. I had doubts about ordering it at first because some people said that it didn't fit bigger carts; however, it has fit every cart I tried so far. I have used it at Target, BJ's, Wal-Mart, and other places. I haven't had any issues yet. It is perfect for babies who need a little support to sit up. It has two cushions on both sides in case they topple over so the baby won't get hurt. My son is 6 months old and had to transition to a convertible car seat. That meant no more car seat base combination so I didn't have the car seat to pick up and balance in the cart. This was the perfect solution.	
1. 	We chose to use the Playtex Nurser Drop-Ins system because of convenience and sanitation. I'm so glad we did! We've been using the 4 ounce liners for 4.5 months now and we have never had one leak or break. They're very easy to use and reduce my time doing dishes. I've used the 8-10 ounce liners a few times as well with no issues. For those curious about measurements, it's very close to the measurement on the Medela bottles I pump into and Nuk bags. Sometimes after pouring milk into the liners they will expand just a tad more once the weight of the milk pushes the crinkles out, but it's not a large amount at all. I've used the 4 oz Up and Up Target brand liners as well, but when these are on sale at Babies R Us they are usually cheaper than buying the generic from Target.	
1. 	There have been so many times we really loved this carrier.  Originally, though, I wanted a sling because I thought they were better for baby, like the previous reviewer, and all my crunchy friends recommended them.  They may be, but we've tried the hotsling, the maya wrap, and even the ergo baby carrier, and this is by far the best and easiest for us.For months, the only way to get my baby to stop his colicky crying was to put him in the Bjorn and go for a walk.  It would put him right to sleep like magic, and we'd come inside, lean over his rocker, and unlatch the Bjorn with him in it (the outer piece comes completely off) and he would just stay asleep.  Try that with a sling!Now that he's past his colicky phase, I use the sling a lot and it's great, but for a quick run to the store, nothing beats the Bjorn for speed.  It's so easy to put on and take off - and it's also easier to get my husband (and my dad!) to wear the baby with the Bjorn, he thinks the sling is for moms.I had two problems: at about 20 pounds and 27 inches, his arms don't fit in the arm holes, and they don't fit above them either.  It still works without the top latches, though, and it's cooler in summer.  I just keep a hold on him to be sure.  And when he was a couple months old and I was wearing the Bjorn a lot, I got a plugged milk duct.  I thought it was about where the strap lay on my chest, so I stopped wearing the Bjorn for a while.  I was having other breastfeeding problems at the time so it might not have been the Bjorn, but who knows?I got this as a hand-me-down, and I thought it was going to just collect dust, but boy was I wrong.  It's in the washer right now!	
1. 	This pad is wonderful!  The pad fits perfectly in the crib and stays nice and flat on the sheet.  So far, nothing has gotten through this pad.  It is much easier to take off and wash than the crib sheet is, making it a real time-saver and back-saver.  I actually bought an extra one and cut it up into 1.5 by 2 ft pieces and use them on my changing table.  They do sell changing table sized, but I found I got more for my money by using this larger one and cutting it to size.  The pad is reversible, and the back side of this pad is white.  If the polka-dots don't fit into your nursery decor, the white will probably go just fine.	
- 1	I have been searching for items on the net to purchase that will allow my son NOT to throw his plate on the floor.  I purchased all different kinds of products/brands, and nothing has worked at this point.  The suction cups on the bottom of ALL the items/brands I have bought, don't work.  There is just not enough suction behind them.  I would apply pressure, wetness, you name it, and nothing worked.  After about 3 minutes, the product would unstick itself and the plate/bowls/cups were tossed.  This product here is a waste of money and your time spent returning it...TRUST me!	
- 1	I have 4 of these, that I use to protect the pretty nursery changing pad cover, and the changing part of our pack & play on another floor.  They do the job of protecting these things from baby accidents, and initially they looked pretty too (love the pattern, and the fact that they are square), but after a few washings/dryings, they are massively pilled and look older than the month that they are.  I don't see them lasting around here more than a few months.  Disappointing, overall.	
1. 	This thing is a life saver for me! I don't have a huge car to store a bunch of &#34;On The Go&#34; extras in the trunk and usually just carry my baby in a Ergo carrier for errands (I live in a big city, so everything is relatively within walking distance) but sometimes I have to be out for a couple of hours (aka Christmas Shopping!:) and can't keep my baby in his carrier for that long. that's where this little handy stroller comes into play!It is very lightweight, yet sturdy and is impressively compact compared to a standard stroller. There is a one handed fold and unfold mechanism (I found it stuck a little when it was brand new, so I would have to jiggle it a little but this disappeared after a couple of uses) and a deep basket underneath for storage.  The &#34;snap&#34; part of this stroller doesn't not mean the actual car seat is &#34;snapped&#34; into the frame, it has two straps the come from the bottom and buckle (there's the &#34;snap&#34;) together on top of the car seat to keep it in place. When installed correctly (meaning buckled tightly) it feel very secure and safe. I was also impressed with its smooth ride and oscillating front wheels. :)One thing to Be Aware of: It is a little difficult to access the contents of the basket when car seat is in the frame. But this is only true if everything you need has been stuffed underneath in one big diaper bag. I found a bunch of cute smaller zipper pouches to hold various things - one for diapers and wipes, one for formula and bottles, one for extra clothes, that way I only have to retrieve a smaller pouch instead to trying to wrestle the diaper bag out and THEN rummage through that to find what I need! It just makes life easier for me :)	
1. 	This swing is great, my baby is both entertained by it and put to sleep by it, it's really comfy and soft, he loves the noises and especially the mirror.  The cover is easily removable and washes up great.  I gave it only four stars because it's larger than most swings and does take up a bit of space, so if you don't have a lot of room this swing is not for you.  But if you do have the room this is the swing to get.  I love that it goes either back and forth or side to side, it also reclines for sleeping!	
1. 	Our  son  enjoys his  swing  time. He' s  really very  happy  to  swing  but also to  just  sit  and play  in it. Ocasionally  he falls  asleep  although I  try  to use the swing distinctly for playtime. He  enjoyed sitting  in it  from  day 1 as it  gave him good  angles to check out  his  surroundings and  during his  colicky  days it  helped to  soothe  himself. He  seemed to  be interested  not  bothered by its clincky noise. I  gave it 4  stars  because  I  did  not particularly liked its fabric pattern and  because, while  the  baby  enjoys  it for some 20  mins, it  does not seem to be  his favorite place to  spend  time in.	
1. 	You can open both ends of the bottle. Makes for an easier clean up. Does not leak. Designed for an even flow. Great product!	
1. 	It's bit pricey but I love it. I can do light scrapbooking while adding family history and little antedotes about me and my husband for our son. I recommend this photobook.	
- 1	I don't know if we have a faulty cup, by my 7-mo old cannot suck any liquid out of this. I finally tried it myself, and I could barely get a drop out either. No wonder my son gets so frustrated with this thing. I am still on the search for a good sippy cup...	
- 1	My 6.5 month old son LOVES his stand alone jumper, hates laying down, loves his car walker, etc. I thought this would be a great addition to his toys since he's a jumper and my arms can't handle all the jumping he likes to do. I insisted we needed a door way jumper and went with this style. It was the only one the store had at the time, but looked cute and fun. To get my son in it took my husband and I otherwise it's pretty difficult with just one person. Then once he was in he was smiling and having fun, but then it started spinning - not so bad. The real problem though is that he can't just sit there and play with the toys or &#34;hang out&#34; because leaning any way to one side is super dangerous. He nearly fell over on his head! He's average height and size so that's definitely not an issue. This is a poorly designed product. I would not recommend it at all! Even sitting right next to him he couldn't have fun let alone something I'd trust to step 2 feet away from! DO NOT BUY!!	
1. 	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the Shop'n'Dine) didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.	
- 1	This was returned right away, for two reasons. One, it actually complicates the swaddling process...and when you have a baby who doesn't like being swaddled, you don't need more complications. We gave up on swaddling him, which was reason number two why it was returned.	
1. 	I purchased this to use on the nightstand or for keeping breast milk out.  Unfortunately I ended up having to feel formula, so I used this as a bedside bottle keeper at night.  Two bottle fit in a cooler compartment and one fits in the warmer.  I had absolutely no issues with this item, did what it said.	
1. 	Nice, I like how I can write on them with a dry erase marker.  However, they don't work too well on my gerber bottles. I put a piece of Saran wrap on before the cap and that solves the problem.	
1. 	We use this mobile in the car seat and also attach it to the middle of our Tiny Love play gym on occasion (have never used the clip, just the velcro - works great).Baby loves to watch it, keeps him entertained (nice that it has two sides for something different).4 stars because motor is a bit loud, but hardly noticeable with other background noise.	
1. 	I like that this has more room than the standard rectangular Graco Pack 'N Plays. It's easy to set up and works well.	
1. 	We've been using this (and several other Mustela products) on our twins since they were born and never had any reaction to it (they're 18 months). A little goes a long way. It's mild and i have never been bothered by the scent.	
- 1	This thing is awful.  It's hard so you have a hard time positioning the baby.  It's uncomfortable, you have to hold the baby into position while trying to get your baby to latch on.  Holding your breast, holding your baby's head, and their body keeps rolling back to their back, add other pillows to get the baby to stay in position.  So frustrating!! If you have had a c-section forget it, it applies too much pressure to your abdomen.  Day 2 of being home I sent my mom out with some money to get the Boppy!  Best decision ever!	
- 1	Let me start by saying, I LOVE my Britax Car Seats and I suppose this cup holder is better than nothing.  However, I think it has several design flaws.  We have two Britax Marathon car seats side by side in the back seat of our Yukon.  The cup holder will not fit on the forward facing car seat by the door, or the door would not close.  So we had to put it on the side that is next to her sisters rear facing car seat.  It is literally wedged in there and leans forward.  Therefore half the time, my daughter cannot get her drink out b/c the cup holder is leaning too far forward out of her reach.  On the rear facing seat it works ok, but is still too far out of reach in my opinion.  It is more there for my convenience than hers.  My husband wants to know why in the world a car seat that is so expensive does not come with some sort of cup holder built in.  It seems like they could do a little better with theit cup holder design.	
1. 	This diaper pail has NO ODOR and is the perfect size.  I use normal 10-gallon trash bags from Target.  No complaints at all!  Very easy to use and seriously, you do not smell any poopy diapers!	
1. 	we did not buy a traditional high chair, one because this one received so many great reviews, two, because i didn't want another item at the dinner table taking up too much space, and lastly, because i wanted something EASY to clean and many high chairs have the seats that you have to take off and throw in the laundry. This booster is perfect - just like everyone else seems to think. as soon as my girl could sit up, we put her in this at the dinner table and it's been great ever since. wipes up easily on the sides where her food-dirtied hands touch, and the other peices clip right off and fit into our dish washer - easy breezy! love this and highly recommend.	
- 1	I am so sad to be giving this a 1 star review. My daughter has a dog blankie that was a hand me down, bought in 2010 that she loves. It is thick and durable. The quality of Angel Dear products has diminished to the point that this new one was washed once, before she could use it, and it now has a hole in it. This one is thinner and feels cheap compared to our 2010 doggy. What a shame. I am hoping Amazon will honor a return even though it's been washed.	
1. 	We have these locks installed on our cabinets in our home. I've tried other brands without success.. my kids always figure a way to get in. With this system, they can try all they want but they cannot get in. Sometimes the doors require pressing to open, but after I figured it out.. I never have an issue opening the doors. This will be the system of choice in any additional homes we buy later on... I don't think I'd ever want to change after having such a positive experience. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member, without hesitation!	
- 1	The ink is so faint and equivalent to a dried-up ink pad.  Had to wipe baby's feet on it many times to transfer the ink and even then the print was so light.  Not sure how it will hold up for archival purposes in a baby memory book.	
- 1	We tried the Diaper Genie and found it to be a hassle and more expense than we wanted (2 sets of refills every month). After using the Genie, we switched to the Diaper Champ which uses regular trash bags (we like the scented 13 gallon bags by Ruffies) and is absolutely a no-brainer to operate!  With the Genie, you have to fold the diaper into a teeny, tiny ball before you can shove it through the opening and keep shoving past the teeth into the belly of the pail.  Then twist the top and close the lid.  At the end of the day, you twist the outer lid and cut the bag with the sharp blades inside the pail.Not only did we not like having to handle the diaper so much (yuck!), it bothered me to have a diaper pail with sharp blades in my nursery!  The thought that someday my daughter might be under the care of a sitter and accidently get into the pail, possibly cutting herself on the blades made me banish the Genie altogether.  Call me cautious, but it was one last strike against the Genie that I felt just wasn't worth keeping it!  After that we switched to the Champ and no more twisting, shoving or cutting - simply drop and flip.  Why spend so much time with a diaper when there is a better alternative out there?I would definitely advise against the purchase of the Genie and recommend instead, the Diaper Champ.  It's safer, cleaner and cheaper to maintain.	
- 1	I gifted this to a friend. It worked well for all of 1 day, and completely stopped working after that. They have since bought a simple one (unknown brand) which is working just fine. Amazon was amazing and gave me the refund even though my friends had thrown away all the packaging. I returned it in a sandwich / freezer bag.	
1. 	i love this bouncer!  i have used it for both of my kids, and, even though i had to return it three times because of a faulty vibrations switch, i never once regretted purchasing this seat!  you can switch it on so that the music, fish and bubbles all move around for the baby to stare at! my son used to sit in the seat for 20-30 minutes at a time, and my daughter, who is much more active than my son was, would sit for 10-15 minutes at a time, which is a HUGE amount of time for her!  i love this bouncer and would buy it again if i ever have more children.	
1. 	At first I had to play around with them to get them fitted correctly, but pretty easy and self explanatory.	
1. 	This was awesome for our little one for her first 6 weeks!  It made it easier for all of us to rest easy knowing a blanket wouldn't come loose and possibly cover their little face.  After 6 weeks, little one was able to wriggle out and decided swaddling wasn't their thing! Every baby is different, but this was a must for the first weeks.	
1. 	I waited a really long time to buy this because it felt like a lot of money to pay for a smock. I regret waiting at all. It makes feeding time infinitely easier- I don't have to completely strip down my toddler anymore or spend hours trying to clean out stains. It's long enough to cover his lap beyond the highchair tray (if you don't use a tray, part of the legs will still be exposed for spills). The neck is high enough to cover his collar which used to get hit even with a bib.  It's really easy to clean, and I'm no longer afraid to let my child feed himself goopy, staining foods! It's completely worth it and I wish I'd had it since he started solids. Later edit: We've now had this smock for about 2 years and it's barely showing signs of wear. I throw it in the laundry about once a week for a thorough cleaning and just wipe it down with a paper towel between meals. The best way to get it clean is to turn it inside out in the wash and then hang it over a chair. It will dry extremely fast and get really clean. If you don't turn it inside out, the sleeves have a hard time drying on the inside where the absorbent fabric is. We LOVE this smock and just ordered a second one for my daughter.	
1. 	This is really compact and comes with 3 bags to get you started as well as a plastic carrying bag. We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car. This is small enough for a diaper bag or under the stroller.  Really great idea for potty training and young children who can't hold it for very long.	
- 1	I bought this for my twin girls and was really excited to use it at bath time, it worked for about five minutes and hasnt worked since.	
1. 	My daughter will play with these, but they are not her favorites. She likes to study them and then throw them down. She likes the one with the pop-up faces and the gear-like one the best. I think they are pretty neat, too. Well-constructed, good size (smaller than a tennis ball, I think--maybe a racquet ball?) for small hands. They are hard plastic, though, so be careful if your little one likes pitching baseballs!Overall a good toy, and I'm glad I got them for her.	
- 1	Look for a larger, better padded changing pad! This one is very small and not padded at all.  My baby is small and this pad is still not big enough!	
- 1	I have been cloth diapering my fifth daughter since she was three weeks old.  She is now seven months old.  Thus far, i have only used grovia aio's, gerber flats and these osocozy flats.  My favorite of the three is the gerber flats.  These osocozy flats are absorbent but they are a difficult size for me to fold.  I can't do the origami fold b/c of their very nonsquare shape.  Kite fold is out too b/c of their shape.  I prefer to fold them into a prefold style.  My biggest issue with these flats is the big honkin' hem on two edges.  Okay, so it isn't such a big honkin' hem...but it is big enough to be uncomfortable, i think.  PLUS, the edges that are not hemmed wrinkle up after laundering.  I line dry and THEY STILL WRINKLE.  Grrr!  Gerber flats are serged on the edges.  Gerber flats are easier to fold.  Yeah, they're smaller.  But, i just stuff 'em with the doublers that came with my grovia aio's and, voila...a perfect diaper!	
- 1	there is no drain!!! the dirty water just piles up. the pockets are cool though. wasn't enough for me to keep it. I purchaed one with a drain and no pockets. Worth the trade!!	
- 1	I like this product because it expands the use of my single stroller and makes it double which is a huge help and convenience when pushing around two babies.Likes: Can push two babies in one stroller, that is loads front and back and not side to side which makes it easier to maneuver in store aisles, easy to put on and take offDislikes: The babies end up being very close together, I am not sure how this would work with bigger kids as of right now I am putting to infants in the stroller, only fits on one way so the baby in the rumble seat has to face backwards which means they either look at the other baby or the back of the other seat.I have seen and used other friend's double strollers and think that this is still the better option. It is very similar to the City Select stroller that can also be converted into a double stroller I just liked the feel of the whole stroller better when I made my original selection on strollers.	
- 1	The product is of good quality and design, it just did not work for our child. She hated it every time we tried it. We eventually sent it back. Again, this is a good product, my child just hated it.	
1. 	So my daughter has severe reflux and after trying many brands of bibs these has been the best ones. They are absorbent and my daughter throws up huge amount and I have found these bibs hold up the best.  Now on top of reflux she is drooling and it holds up. I own 80 of these bibs (read severe reflux) and I go through them in a week before having to do laundry. Speaking of laundry, I have washed them so many times and the Velcro holds up. Make sure you snap the Velcro close before putting them for a wash or dry because the Velcro is strong enough to snag other clothes and I read if you don't snap bib Velcro close before washing and drying they get ruined. So far with as much washing they have gone through (with the Velcro being closed) the absorbency and Velcro still works just as the 1st time.	
- 1	my lo didnt care for it and it has an annoying sound. not realy a teether in my opinion. if you want a squeeky toy, that is what it is.	
1. 	Great teething ring and toy.My 6 mth loves it, its so much fun.he loves the vibration, the little color wheel to the other end he loves to spin.something fun to bite on for his aching gum.I recommend it!	
- 1	These are really thick, so they looked horrible under my clothes. I used them a few times at night, but I wouldn't recommend these to a friend.	
- 1	Despite the other reviews, I think this organizer is flimsy.  I was very disappointed.  This only think I liked was the umbrella holder at the bottom, except I'd have to get out of the car and get wet just to retrieve the umbrella.	
- 1	Unfortunately this didn't last very long in our house.  I noticed it was leaking a few months after we bought it.  But I wasn't too disappointed because my baby didn't really love it.  Definitely not something I would purchase again.	
- 1	When I bought this I LOVED IT! Smooth plastic, easy to read display and it is very nice to look at. After 4 months it started giving  me the wrong readings. So I call customer service and they DO NOTHING! Even though I filled out the warranty! UNREAL! So now I have a busted scale! FAO Schwarz is a HORRIBLE COMPANY to deal with!BUY A DIFFERENT BRAND!	
1. 	Although this does take a little getting use to, this is a great sling.  I have used it with 2 babies from birth up to toddlerhood.  I love how it holds your newborn closer than regular front carriers.  Both of my daughters would instantly fall asleep.  I also like that it can be used to nurse discreetly. Some have complained about too much material and it being too long, but with a little adjusting and patience, it should fit any caregiver.  I used it on my toddler right up until my new daughter was born.  A great and affordable sling.  And Dr Sears is the expert!!!	
- 1	Now that my son moves a lot, the insert moves too and the adhesives end up sticking to his skin and irritating it. He's also had diaper rash which he doesn't get with Seventh Generation disposables.	
1. 	This has saved more messes than I realized would be coming!  I just take it out and spray it off.  Perfect!	
1. 	amazing product! originally bought a body pillow and found it too difficult to turn in bed and deal with bringing the pillow in and out from under the sheets to switch sides with me. Got this pillow and every night has been a wonderful nights sleep. I turn from side to side and have even been able to maneuver the pillow a little so I can lay on my stomach for a little while. it is quite big though, so i feel like my spouse is being pushed off the bed and it can be difficult putting the pillow case back on after washing but... I say IT'S A MUST BUY! If you are not sleeping comfortable, this pillow could be your sleep saver!	
1. 	This is a perfect tub for any baby....newborn and up.  I have never used the hammock feature since the tub has a padded bottom.  When our daughter was a newborn we placed her in and there she stayed, never slipping, while we washed her.  She is now 7 months old and can sit up which makes bath time fun.  The color changing plug has also been helpful.  My girlfriend had her baby 11 days before me and she had purchased a different kind of tub.  She then had to purchase another tub once her baby could sit up.  I'd rather invest the extra money of a 2nd tub in my daughter's college fund.	
1. 	I would not recommend for dirty diapers. It is not air-tight, so it does not hold in odors well. The benefit of this diaper pail is that it is cheap, and uses regular tall kitchen trash bags, rather than the expensive proprietary ones. We bought a Diaper Genie specifically for dirty diapers. It keeps in odors very well, but is much more expensive to refill. However, since we use it for dirty diapers only, we only need to buy refills about 4 times a year. All the rest of the diapers go in the Safety First pail, which saves us a lot of money on bags.	
- 1	We wanted to get a second camera for our existing monitor, but turned out that the model has been discontinued, so we had to look for a new monitor with two cameras. I was looking at Motorola, but didn't want to overpay for the functions I thought I won't use (tilt/pan, room temp), so I decided to go with this simpler and cheaper monitor.Here is the quick summary:pros: the video quality is goodcons: sound quality is HORRIBLE. Even with the sound turned on to the max you can barely hear that your child is crying if you have TV or music turned on, or if you're in the kitchen and have running water. It also has a lot of static noise in the background which makes it really hard to hear what's going on in the nursery.. If you're monitoring a younger baby, it's OK, but my older one likes to talk a lot before falling asleep and after waking up, and I can't understand what she is saying, even when I listen very careful.If you have a few cameras, the monitor won't automatically switch between them when the noise is detected. Right now I have my kids sleeping in separate rooms and I need to constantly manually switch between cameras to check on them.The monitor is very light, in fact it's so ridiculously light that it's own cord drags it down from my nightstand!Camera's cord is very short.I kinda regret now that I decided to save money and went with this option. I wish I could tilt the camera, since we took off the crib rail and my baby gets out of the bed and starts wondering around the room.	
1. 	We were nervous about moving our 23 month old to a twin bed, but this rail has made the transition so much easier.  It covers practically the entire length of the bed, so we do not worry about him rolling out.  (The other side of the bed is up against a wall.)  We have not tried the hide away feature, and I imagine we will not use that very often - probably only when we have company.  Also, the rail does not seem to affect the comfort of the mattress at all.	
- 1	Before I had my baby I was nervous about pretty much everything and imagined the worst. I never had any issues with very sore boobs from nursing and I nursed for a year. No problems showering or otherwise. Didn't need this. If you are considering purchasing this before your baby is born, wait and see if you are going to need it first. This as well as other similar products were a complete waste of money for me.	
1. 	My son liked this during the entire spring/summer when he was around 7 months old. It was used mostly outside and is pretty tolenerany of slight sloped ground. We got the green/ jungle version and he really enjoyed the lights & sounds. He took to boucing instanlty as well as the removable toy bar. I really like that there was an assortment of activities for him to choose from that were age-related. The adjustments for height were easy to adjust. (It is a sliding metal bar that holds the fabric). The toy didn't last long with my son since he did not like to be constraned to a seat after he was 9 1/2 months.We did get our money's worth since it seemed that this toy was the only thing I could set him down in that he enjoyed and I was able to enjoy a break for a change. I think all beginner stages can enjoy this to some degree, but the pre-sitting thru sitting age is more of an ideal age range for this toy.	
1. 	I love these cups!!! I highly recommend them.I remember having the similar Tupperware cups when I was little. These seem to work just as good and are so inexpensive. Each cup has a lid (no valve, so it will leak a little). The lids stay on tight. I got them for my 18 mo old who was really good at drinking from open cups but also knocked them over fairly often. These are nice because he gets more liquid quickly but if he knocks it over, it's just a small drip and not the whole cup poured out. I had to train him to set his cup on a table and not just drop it around the room like he was used to doing with a sippy cup. But he picked that concept up pretty quickly. I still keep sippy cups around for the car and diaper bag, but these are great for around the house. They have held up really well to dishwasher use over several months. And I really like that the cup doesn't have ridges at the top, so it is just a cup and easier to drink from if we aren't using the lid.	
1. 	I want to give it a higher rating, but my kiddo wasn't impressed. It didn't have the desired effect to help her get to sleep.The sounds are high quality (whales, heart beat, rain, water). Having volume control and timer settings are great.It can be strapped easily to a crib with the velcro behind it's head.Soft, fluffy fur.	
1. 	My six month old loves Max. It's a very well made toy, easy for her to hold on to. I also like that its a small toy and easily transportable in the diaper bag.	
1. 	This sheet fits just as snuggly as does the original sheet that came with the sleeper.  The cotton is not as soft as it could be but seems to be fine.  My baby (now a month old) is very content to sleep on it, and I'm glad I bought it.  When he wets the bed in the middle of the night you need extra sheets.	
- 1	I bought this head support hoping that it would help keep my newborn's head from falling forward until she could support her head on her own. It didn't, I was very disappointed. It was actually more of a hassle to put in the carseat as well because it was bulky and didn't stay in place.	
- 1	After having for obly 6-9 months the monitor stopped picking up sounds. Over the course of two weeks it got worse and worse until it was completely useless. We could hear the baby crying in pain in her room but not through the monitor.Customer service waa okay. They were a little slow to respond though. They said having a new nursery unit should fix it and sent us the replacement. However,  even with the nursery unit replaced it srarted cutting in and out within a week.For an audio monitor this is not cheap. I wish I had gone with a cheaper brand. I could have replaced it almost three-fold and have it be worth it.	
1. 	I have used this diaper pail for 2.5 months with twin babies.  We go through a LOT of diapers ;)  This pail has done a nice job.  The only time I have smelled an odor is if the pail is full to the top and the pop-lid is left open.  I really like the capacity to deal with double diapers of twins.  I also have a Diaper Champ and I prefer this diaper pail over the Champ.  They perform about the same, but the capacity of the Safety 1st Pail makes it a winner for me.	
1. 	This is a wonderful must-have.  I was given this as a shower gift and it has been a lifesaver.  We use it anytime we need to heat up a bottle, day or night.  We prefer to use it instead of heating the bottle in the microwave, but sometimes the bottles get too hot, and that is probably because we may have put a little too much water in the measuring tube.  But most of the time, they are just right.  We simply pour the water into the warmer unit, put in a bottle, and while we are changing her diaper, the bottle is heating.  By the time we are done changing her diaper, the bottle is ready.  We just keep the warmer in her room for convenience.  In the beginning we used, the cooler, but we kept forgetting to put the ice pack back in the freezer after she'd taken the 2nd bottle, so now we just use it for the warmer and it has truly worked out really good for us.	
1. 	I've bought several potty training seats, and this is by far the very best out there as far as fit and stability.If I were going to change one thing about it, it would be to make a boy's version and a girl's; the guard in front is pretty unnecessary for our daughter, and it gets in the way of her wiping herself.With that said, I'm really happy with the way it adjusts to fit the seat and doesn't wobble or slide to one side, like other seats I've tried. It's also very easy to take on and off the toilet seat so others can use the bathroom with no trouble, thanks to the handle.Don't bother with those other seats. This is the one you need.	
1. 	I'd give this five stars, except that my son is not really into the teething corners (but perhaps not YET--he is 4.5 months old).  What I love about it is that its machine washable (I put it in the dryer, too, though I don't know if the manufacturer recommends this).  He's has this for a month, and it's easy for him to get into his mouth, even without a great deal of control!  Highly recommend--we have two, because one is always in the wash.	
1. 	This &#34;toddler tub&#34; accomplishes with ease what it was designed to do:  bathe your baby.  The insertable fabric sling accommodates new ones while the base tub handles toddlers as they (quickly) grow bigger.  Softer skid resistant surfaces inside the tub keep the baby from slipping and where you want him.  Slots in the base keep the tub safely in place across a sink or you can sit it in the bottom of an adult bathtub (folded towel for old knees recommended).  Conveniently emptied from a drain hole, when finished it's easily dried and stored in a closet.  A great solution to an age old &#34;chore&#34;.	
- 1	I wish these worked, but they don't seem to hide the smell any better than other products I've tried.  I'm still looking for a miracle!	
1. 	Easy to clean, secure when the lid is on. Great for travel. Flow is also great - my son loves to drink his milk from this sippy cup. Only complaint - not super easy to clean the holes unless you have a special cleaner, but I dont think too much - just put it in the dishwasher :)	
- 1	I bought this thermometer to have on hand for our newborn because I thought this was as quick as they come.  I wish I would have found the much quicker (less than 10 seconds) thermometers first and not wasted time and money on this one.  It takes too long for us and doesn't seem to be accurate (seems like it reads cooler than the actual temp).	
- 1	I purchased this at a local store and I thought my daughter would love it. The design is cute and I really wanted a dual potty that worked as a potty and stepstool. Unforuntely this didn't work for us. The potty opening is tiny! Unless you're training a skinny, small child this gives little room for error or aim! It's definitely appealing in the looks department but other than that I would suggest passing this guy up!	
1. 	Does the job perfectly.  It took me 5 months to finally buy this, wish I had done so earlier and saved myself all the boiling.	
1. 	I had a hard time finding solid crib sheets.  We like the color and feel, but the seams do not line up with the edge of our mattress.  Other than that, great product.  Washed well.	
- 1	These liners are a great size, but the microfleece washable liners I cut myself do a much better job and keep my baby dry.	
1. 	I worked in a preschool/nursery room and we used the first generation diaper champ. I LOVED it and always knew when I had a baby of my own I would want a diaper champ as well. I love that you can use any garbage bag and not have to spend a lot of money on the refill bags other dirty diapers storage units use.I still love everything about the new version of the diaper champ but the size. I wish it was taller!! I am 5'5 and have to bend down too low to throw away a diaper and my husband is 6'2 HATES he has to bend down so low to throw away the diaper. Also because it is so short it holds less diapers and I have to change the bag every few days.I can't say too much about keeping the smell out since my daughter is only a month old and her BM's are not smelly yet but I do not smell urine at all. I like the design of the champ and the handle. I HATE the diaper genie and knew that was not an option for me at all. The diaper champ though short is still my favorite of all of them and am glad I purchased it. If it was only taller I would give it 5 stars!	
1. 	These truly are leak-proof cups, and are a great supplement to our current larger Gerber Graduate cups.  I like that they have a more narrow base and easily fit into cup holders, unlike their larger counterparts.  Great sippy cups, and a favorite in this family!	
1. 	kind of a pain to install but do prevent our toddler from getting into cabinets. stiff at first but with use become easier to push down to open a cabinet.	
1. 	I love this product, my little one HATES the carseat but this keeps him occupied.  He loves looking at the red and black characters on the mobile.	
1. 	I'm all about getting my money.s worth and this definitely is.  It's easy to assemble, took my husband about an hour. I love how I can use it for several more years. It comes with the half side rail and some extra screws, so I'm assuming you'll need to purchase more pieces for the full size bed.	
1. 	This is an excellent mattress pad to use during potty training.  It's also good for the time before that just in case there are leaks.  It's very absorptive and easy to put on and take off.	
1. 	My daughter has been playing in this since she was 4 months. Most toys don't hold her attention very long, but she will play in this for 30 min's at the time! It has been a real life saver! My husband is away with the military and I have practicaly been a single mom since she was born. This toy allows me to get household things done. Thank you Evenflo!***do watch the jester though... she has scratched her forehead with it more than once by putting it in her mouth, then letting go... it even got stuck in her mouth one time, lucky i was there to get it out... BUT, if you find a toy dangerous on this... you can always just take it off!!!  I only wish that there were spare toys to order, so I could change them out every once in a while, when she gets bored with one!	
1. 	Our two year old has been using this to reach the potty and it is working very well for him. Its a good height to reach the toilet, but not really tall enough for a 3 foot tall kid to reach the sink and wash his hands.	
- 1	My son just does't like this.  He is able to get the food out, there wasn't much of a learning curve for him.  But he would rather drink out of a cup with a straw when I make smoothies.  Waste of money for me.  Make sure you clean this write away, the nipple will stain, especially with carrot.  Food easily gets stuck under the nipple.	
1. 	We just used the Tiny Diner placemat for the first time last night. It worked great. It gave me a place to put down my 10 month old son's food since he doesn't use plates or bowls. Despite his best efforts, he could not pull it off of the restaurant table once I had attached it with the suction cups. When fully rolled out, this gave us plenty of room -- even with his typical goofing off, all of his food remained within the confines of the mat. Yet when rolled up, it's only about the size of a paper towel tube, so it fit easily into the diaper bag. I felt a little frivolous about this purchase when I picked it up sort of on a whim, but I am so glad I did! We will not dine out without it!	
- 1	I purchased one bottle sampler pack from my local grocery store and went ahead and ordered this two pack and some liners from Amazon. I was going on vacation and didn't want to have to wash all the parts from my daughter's regular bottles.There is a warning printed on the bottle that says WARNING: Do not microwave or boil, liner could burst and result in injury. Seems simple enough, don't heat up the contents or the liner could burst.I wanted to sterilize and try out the bottle with my daughter, so I disassembled the one bottle and boiled the parts for 5 minutes on the stove. Well, I took all the parts out of the water and the bottle shrank to about 2/3 the original size! I was a little annoyed. No where on the packaging does it say not to boil because the plastic will deform! All the warnings were about the liner, nothing about the outer bottle itself.Annoyed, but not deterred, I still tried using the (deformed) bottle with my daughter to see if she would take to the drop-ins and we could use it for vacation. I could no longer use the measurement on the bottle, but the nipple, ring, and top of bottle were perfectly fine, so we tried it.Epic fail! She hated the nipple and had terrible gas after eating. (Normally we use the NUK bottles, but she had no problem with different shaped pacifiers or the nipple on the formula nursettes). We tried two more feedings with this setup, and tried pushing all the air out as well as leaving it as is.This did not work for us so I wound up returning the unused nurser pack and liners. It seems like a good idea and I liked the fact that there would be less stuff to hand wash, but it didn't work out.If you choose to use these, just remember, DO NOT attempt to sterilize the outer plastic bottle!	
- 1	Didn't work at all for me. I have super smooth glazed tile in my shower, and thought the suction would be ideal. Wrong. Just think about how dangerous this thing is if it doesn't work! Ouch!	
- 1	This pillow is HUGE. I am married and in our queen there was hardly room for my husband. It kept sliding off the bed which made it impossible to lay in it properly. It irritated my tremendously so I returned it. Too expensive not to be awesome. I was 5 months pregnant when I bought it thinking it would help me from sleeping on my back (because you are not supposed to) and it made my sleep more uncomfortable then sticking one of my regular pillows in between my legs, which I'm back to doing now. Try a boppy if you're pregnant instead?	
1. 	Ive tried so many bottle brushes i just thought i had to live with being unhappy with them. The aponge ones get gross and fall apart very fast and the round brushes are too stiff and i feel like im just scratching my bottles! Till i got these. It had such great reveiws i had to give it a try! It first starts alittle stiff but after only couple uses the bristles became the perfect amount of stiffness and softness!! And i love the plastic nipple cleaners, they work super well. Also since its mostly plastic, i dont have to really worry about yucky mold and mildew!! Highly recommend!!!	
1. 	My daughter really liked to use this product. She sucked the fruit right out and screamed for more. I wasn't something we needed to use for too long but for the time we did she really enjoyed it.	
1. 	We love this product and have been using it since my toddler son was a newborn.  The bags are perfectly sized and have handles which can be tied to contain the contents (and smell!) of the bag.  They have a soft, pleasant scent and the price is very reasonable.  Instead of using a special diaper disposal can in the nursery, we have an attractive stainless steel step trash can and throw away diapers in there using the Sassy bags.  As long as the can is emptied once a week or so, there are no issues with odor.  In addition, we keep a few in each diaper bag for use outside the home.The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that I wish they came with or there was an option to purchase a more convenient dispenser.	
1. 	These are great baby bottles. My child has not had much gas since using this product. It is easy to clean as the parts come apart simply.  The angled neck is easy for me to hold while my baby is sitting up and prevents excessive gas in her stomach. 9oz is a good size bottle for growing babies and their tremendous appetites. Also, it's a great price compared to other well-known BPA free bottles (some of which were $10 per bottle).	
1. 	I thought this pump was great, but I still prefer my electric. This is good for on the run, but it's definitely not good for everyday use.	
1. 	Best sippy cups.  We have tried countless others and all others leak.  These dont leak and are super durable.  Our daughter loves to throw these around and they still look like they are brand new after 6 months	
- 1	I didn't realize that those bibs are made of some plastic-like material when I purchased them; they look really cute, but I don't know if I can trust the material! It smells very strong.	
1. 	Set up takes less than a minute and great as a portable playard. The toys on the sides are a lot of fun for baby. The colors are bright and cheerful. My 6 month old loves it. A little heavy to carry (I'm 5'2) but still highly, highly recommended!	
- 1	These would work ok for tinier babies but my little boy has thunder thighs and at four months he's already wearing it incredibly loosely. Not going to fit him much longer. Also for some reason the soaker repels despite careful washing and having stripped it when I couldn't figure out what was going on. I use a different soaker in it from one of my other pocket diapers. Glad I only bought one. About the only good thing is it's cute and the cover seems to be pretty repellant.	
- 1	Our Summer Infant Best View (no longer in production) finally stopped working.  We had a tough time finding a replacement product that had all of the same features we loved: good range, quality picture in both light and dark, remote pan, portable handheld monitor, and good parent reviews were a few of our top priorities.  The description of the Graco True Focus, along with the price and reviews seemed to fit the bill with the one exception of remote pan, which we could live without to save the extra $70 it would cost to get that feature on another model.Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and we ended up returning it.  The biggest drawbacks for us were the night vision picture, and the limited range, which came in nowhere close to the claims on the box and the website.  After having other video monitors work well in our house - both our Summer monitor as well as visiting friends' other brands, we were very disappointed at the constant Linking error that would come up regularly when we were a mere 50 feet away (again, nowhere close to the 1000 ft claim on the box).Pros:- Price for the features claimed- Daytime picture clearer than other video monitors I've seenCons:- Effective range of less than 50 ft. compared with well over 200-300 feet with other monitors (we were able to walk a few houses away with the old monitor, and still have a reliable signal)- Night vision picture required constant fiddling with brightness settings - sometimes appeared to just be a big white screen, with little definition of what was on camera.  I could have lived with this if the range had lived up to claims.Luckily Amazon took the return after we tried it out for a little over a week - desperately hoping that it would somehow begin to link more consistently.  We definitely wanted it to live up to expectations, but unfortunately it did not.	
1. 	Me and baby love this wearable blanket. It's really soft and warm, perfect for the winter. Baby has been using it since he was 2 months old, after I stopped swaddling him. He is now 7 months and can roll and even crawl in the crib freely wearing this blanket. It was a great purchase!!!!	
- 1	The item was packaged very poorly. They fold the hat in four and stuffed in an envelop. Since it's a fome-board like material, it never bent back like it shown in the picture. You get what you paid for.	
1. 	Santa bring this turtle on Christmas to my son, he is 5 years old and he love it. Now he has his own sky with stars in the room.	
1. 	This is my travel bottle brush. As far as bottle brushes go, the brush part is fairly compact and the nipple brush is just a hard part of plastic--part of the end of the handle. This brush is simple and does the trick.	
1. 	This toy is so pretty!  Even I like to sit and listen to the music with my baby :) My only complaint is that it is too loud.  I got it when my baby was about 3 months old and he was scared of it's lound music at first.  But now at almost seven months he really enjoys it.  I have to put it against the couch though becauce it slide on the carpet and he falls when he holds on to it for support.	
1. 	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a stay open feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.	
1. 	Can't recommend this enough.I had a horrible case of thrush. This was the only thing that helped me honestly.	
1. 	I LOVE bumbkins bibs.  They are super easy to clean.  They stay nice.  I can even throw them in the washing machine for a good washing.  I loved having 3 so I really wash down the one she was using and worry about her bib being wet for her next meal.  The elastic did come loose on one but I just stitched it back on.  The other 2 were fine.	
1. 	This item was probably the best money my husband and I spent on our daughter. Before this, she would fall asleep but flail her arms and wake herself up. Soon after my husband had learned how to do an extremely effective swaddle with just a normal blanket, not knowing these existed. Come to find out this just made life so much easier in order to avoid suffocation hazard. Our daughter was also able to get her arms out, particularly once she got older, but they always went over the wings, not under, so it wasn't a suffocation hazard. Basically, if you Velcro it extremely, and do it such that it is low, you should be fine. It's important to remember that you're trying to pin their arms to their sides, which means you can put the wing part pretty low, and it will make it harder for them to escape, and more likely that went they do, they escape with their arms above the wings.This had such a huge impact on my daughter's sleep. Now that she's 4 months she doesn't seem to need it anymore because she gotten too strong for it regardless of the size we puts her in. Most importantly this product allowed us to ensure that she continued sleeping for 8 hours/night while we got our rest. Highly recommended.	
1. 	I have had other baby carriers with my two older children and this one is definitely my favorite. It was easy to use and felt very sturdy. Unfortunately, my son didn't like being in it, but he's not much of a snuggler so I'm guessing it is his personality and not the carrier that is the issue. :) I'd recommend this item to other parents.	
- 1	it's good for traveling.  we took it on a trip and it got a hole somehow so we had to inflate it every night. It does not offer good support for baby, you have to watch them super closely.  It is also very slippery and baby kept going under water.  Would not recommend.	
- 1	These make AWFUL diapers. They are too thin and hold nothing whatsoever. Maybe layered with other diapers they would be okay, but they are not soft and I wouldn't want these against my baby's sensitive skin. They aren't bad as burp cloths but they still don't work as good as flannel ones. If washed correctly, they are good for cleaning and don't leave lint behind.	
1. 	This is a great set. The Playtex breast milk storage system is a VERY easy way to store breastmilk in the freezer, and works well with Medela pumps. I've pumped at work for about 2 months and it's gone pretty smoothly. I use a mix of these and Medela storage bottles.I especially like that the liners are BPA free.	
1. 	I hadn't planned on getting a stroller.  I think they are too heavy and bulky.  My friend recommended this one to me.  I love it!  It's so lightweight.  It's also very sturdy and high quality.  I love the snap-and-go functionality.  Highly recommended.	
1. 	This bath is a great price and works well with small and large babies. I have one for myself and even bought one for a friend.	
- 1	I purchased these after my daughter had diaper rash and I read a bunch of reviews suggesting them.  Perhaps I wasn't using them right, but they weren't particularly helpful for me.  They didn't clean well enough that I was comfortable using them alone, and they didn't stay soft after multiple washes.  I ended up just going directly to bath time after a poo and otherwise rinsing her under the sink upon changing.	
1. 	We got this for our 3 month old at Christmas & he loves it! We have no complaints other than the sounds aren't exactly as they sound in the description. To us they sound more like someone breathing, a water feature, crickets on a summer's night, & a jungle groove over a campfire...LOL! But the freaky one of someone breathing holds him over until he is deeply asleep. I love the option of going longer than 20 minutes, at the 23 min timer he wakes up, but the 45 minute timer is perfect! And I don't know why we would ever get the smaller travel version. I like that his giraffe is big & cuddly...so does he! This normal size one has a velcro loop so you can take it anywhere!	
- 1	We got this cover for our new Sony Ericsson Xperia cell phone. For the 3 months, I had it on, I had to use my cell phone strictly indoors! I did not want to remove it since I was afraid my screen will be scratched without a cover, but otherwise it doesnt serve the purpose at all. I am now breathing at ease after changing this to a different usable cover.	
- 1	My daughter had a hard time with this cup... the opening is very large and she would choke on the water because it came out too fast. I would go with the NUK beginner sippy cups.	
1. 	This tub fits in my standard-sized sink. It's easy to dry, small enough to store in lots of places, and my newborn fits nicely into it with room to grow.	
1. 	I loved this sheet it was exactly as pictured and fit great on my crib mattress.  I would definitely buy again!	
- 1	This is a good looking product and easily installed but imagine my dismay when I installed one lock only to find out that the key to open it was not included.  You have to order the keys separately.  Thankfully I did not put one on the other cabinet or I would have been locked out!!  Not sure why the keys are not included but be sure to order the keys if you order these locks.	
1. 	Only bib I need, catches most of the mess for my toddler and easy to clean. Didn't need 2 so I gave one to my friend and she loves it too.	
1. 	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills. The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.	
1. 	My now 3 month old new grandson is just learning to grab and hold onto things and loves all 5 of these toys when he comes to visit his Nana, which is practically daily.  Thank You they're everything I expected and more.	
1. 	I think this is the best invention ever! The wipes are warm regardless of the weather or tem in the room. My son doesn't even know we're changing him at night sometimes. I love that it fits into the &quot;Diaper Depot&quot;. I have the most organized changing station. It's true that you ruin a few of the very last wipes on the bottom due to drying up & browning, but who cares, it's pennies! Plus my baby's comfort is the most important thing!!P.S. if you wet the pad on the bottom thoroughly enough & often enough, it doesn't dry up anything!I love it!	
1. 	Got this swaddle for my 2 month old who breaks out of swaddles easily. This is the best swaddle and would recommend to any mom! Got our baby sleeping through the night!	
1. 	I worked in a preschool/nursery room and we used the first generation diaper champ. I LOVED it and always knew when I had a baby of my own I would want a diaper champ as well. I love that you can use any garbage bag and not have to spend a lot of money on the refill bags other dirty diapers storage units use.I still love everything about the new version of the diaper champ but the size.

I like the design of the champ and the handle. I HATE the diaper genie and knew that was not an option for me at all. The diaper champ though short is still my favorite of all of them and am glad I purchased it. If it was only taller I would give it 5 stars!	
- 1	This is a horrible waste of money. The top part of the big, that was stuffed with foam to make it comfortable ripped on each bib within two washes. Stick wtih the mum to mum big instead--they are more expensive but work better and last through many, many washes.	
1. 	I like this booster seat but I didn't take into consideration when purchasing it that my son would need a tilted seat as he can not support himself sitting up yet.  If you have a special needs child or a premie with low muscle tone go with a seat that reclines to help support the head and neck.  Otherwise this is a good choice and very nice.	
1. 	If you want to avoid having your little one sit on a dirty toilet, this product is great. I haven't had any issues with it so far. My son just starting using the toilet, and this has been great for us. I do worry about his skin getting pinched as I am putting him on the toilet, though. I just try to be careful when placing him on it. He doesn't use the handles either, so they haven't been good or bad for us.	
1. 	I don't know what the old magic cube is that some reviews have mentioned, and yes it's true that the instrument sounds are electronic-sounding reproductions not actual instrument sounds.  I hesitated to purchase this after watching a video review on here showing the violin sound.  I have played piano for 26 years and violin for 23 so I might be pickier than some as  far as the sound.  I'm so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn't bother me that the sounds aren't completely authentic.  (I'd also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument's part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he's doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the 'harp' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.	
1. 	This chair is so great, as I said, we got rid of the regular high chair we got. We have yet to go out to dinner somewhere is doesn't work, and haven't had any issues at BBQ's and other peoples houses. We tried another brand before this one and it just wasn't as sturdy and didn't break down for travel easy. We hve one at home and now keep one at grandma's house too!	
- 1	the blanket is very soft but every time I use it i have to get thefuzz off the baby. It sheds on everything!	
- 1	I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower. I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $$$ back. But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time. Baby Bjorn worked better.	
1. 	My son and I love this tub. I used the sling to give him sponge baths until his cord fell off. He is now 6 weeks old and no need for the sling anymore: he sits perfectly in the &quot;newborn&quot; side of the tub, without slipping. I also enjoy the fact that this tub has a separate water compartment than we put clean water to rinse the baby afterwards. The changing color plug is a plus, because it indicates if the water is too warm for baby.It fits perfectly in our sink too!I recommend this tub, it's great!	
- 1	This is the first time I've reviewed a product on Amazon, which should emphasize how strongly I feel about this product. It was a gift from my mother in law before we were even registered (therefore, I did not pick it out myself). I will start by saying that it serves it's basic function. If my baby is crying, I can tell. But I would not trust it if I were sleeping in one room and she were down the hall in her bedroom (she is still in a bassinet). Unfortunately, I have found this monitor to be VERY noisy with a lot of static/feedback. Not only is this really annoying, but I can't hear small sounds my baby  makes. As a first-time mom, I want to hear EVERYTHING. It does have the light function to indicate sound, but there are always 2-3 of those lights lit at all times due to the static in the monitor itself, so again I can't tell when my baby is making noise. As a result of all this, I do not trust the monitor and am constantly running to check on my baby myself which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I currently have the Summer Infant Day & Night handheld video monitor (best selling video monitor on Amazon) on my wish list. Can't wait to get rid of this one!	
- 1	I registered for this item and received it as a gift, why, I don't know.  I never really even travel by car too often.  I decided to try it out the one time I did travel, my son was 4 months old.. I plugged it in and waited and waited and waited and the item never ever heated up.  It just remained cold.  I tried to take it back to Babies R Us but the return time had already passed so they wouldn't take it back.  My advice on this item is, don't buy it, even if it does work, you will probably never use it.	
1. 	My cousin recommended the Baby Bjorn carrier to me, which she used for both of her boys.  She warned me that they aren't cheap but well worth it.  I followed her advice and WE LOVE IT!  I especially love to wear it while shopping and walking around the neighborhood.  When my daughter was 0-4 months, she faced toward me (as required) and always slept comfortably in the carrier.  Now (at 6 months) if she is tired I face her towards me, and when she's awake, she loves facing out and looking at everything.  I don't have a single complaint about this item.  My husband is 6'3, 220 lbs and he can and does wear it comfortably.  I purchased the fleece cover (through RightStart) and that's wonderful too.  You know the saying, you get what you pay for, so pay the extra money and get an excellent carrier.  It's absolutely worth it!	
1. 	PROS:This tub is PERFECT for my 6 month old. It's nice and big, the water covers her whole body and she has room to splash and play with good support. She still uses the lying down position. We don't usually use the drain plug, it's light enough to just dump the water out.CON:For 0-3 months this tub had issues because it does not have the newborn sling.  (It looks like there are holes for one but there's nothing to buy from Primo).Our solution was to place a folded towel beneath her in the bath which did work great and provided her comfort and support while bathing.  You just have a soggy towel to wash after every bath which is taxing.	
- 1	I had to return these after one day of usage. Maybe my daughters legs are just too chubby (what toddler doesn't have chubby legs) but they kept slipping down her legs and were so tight they were leaving marks.  I returned them and Amazon was kind enough to let me keep them and not make me go through the hassle of the return.	
1. 	I use it with a set of Avent storage bottles (many nipple fit on them) and my rented Medela Symphony pump.  There are 2 plastic convertors in the kit but I only use 2.  No leaks, easy to clean, works just like the description claimed.	
1. 	My son is getting around pretty good now and I wanted to be able to contain him a little.  I put this with the extension kit around his Laugh and Learning Home by Fisher Price and he is able to play while I get a few chores done.  It is open enough that he does not feel too confined and seems quite content to play in it for a while.  A good purchase that can be used in multiple ways.	
1. 	Great gift! It was easy to follow the direction. The molding material is easy to work at. It doesn't dry too quickly so there're plenty of time to try over and over	
- 1	We purchased these, and have found that they pop and crackle very loudly in the evening, to the point I have to just turn them off.  They worked well enough in the first year, but after 12 months, their speakers must have blown out.  We can't use these anymore.	
1. 	The first sheets I bought elsewhere shrunk, so when I launder this sheet, I make sure to dry it on low.  So far, it fits great, is nice and soft, and in a great color (Go Texas Longhorns!).	
- 1	This product was a lifesaver for the first few days I had it.  Unfortunately it was no match for my toddler triplets who just transitioned to beds and want out of their room at bedtime.  It isn't that strong and if someone pulls or shakes the door, eventually it will pop open.  If I had rated this product the first day, I would have given it 5 stars.  By day 5, it was a disappointment.  On the plus side, it is very easy to use and doesn't take any tools to install.	
1. 	I'm so grateful for this product. It keeps my mind at ease knowing my baby is safe and comfortable. Definitely will be buying more.	
1. 	We have been using HALO SleepSacks for the last 7 1/2 months.  I love that I can give my baby a &#34;blanket&#34; without worrying that he will put it over his head and suffocate - I AM A WORRIER.  We started with the Newborn size with the optional swaddle.  My baby hated to be swaddled so we never used that function and rather just wrapped it around his belly (see directions).  We then went to the Small size and that also had the swaddle flaps.  So now that we are in the Medium size it is a little different to get used to it being free to move around (as opposed to having almost a thick belt that held the bulk down).  My baby is much more wiggly now so this gets wrapped around him in awkward ways (around a foot, or somehow twisted one way at the top and another at the bottom).  I do however love this product because I know my baby will be warm and not in danger from a blanket.  Additionally, the cotton material is light weight and has become useful when it is chilly but not cold.  I have also found that the sizing is fairly accurate.I would recommend this product to any new parent!	
- 1	The previous reviewer is correct. For $15 you get ONE box of bags. They also don't fit right. I made them work because I had too, but I won't buy these again.	
1. 	great space saver, easy to clean, my son enjoys sitting in it (7 mos old).  Haven't used it out to eat yet.  Great product for the price!	
- 1	unless you wear skinny jeans and people say they look good on you without laughing the opening on this product is WAY to narrow.I would not recommend this to anyone but underfeed models	
1. 	We have 2 twin boys who are 20 months old. They used to use an old wooden highchair at grandmas, but there was only one and it was falling apart. She bought these because they could work for my niece (3 years old) without the back and it could work with my 20 month olds as a highcahir. This chair is so convinent. The snap in tray is great, just like my Aquarium chair at home! It is also nice that it adjusts to the tray can rest on the table. I love that its VERY easy to fold and carry. My boys love sitting in it, and its SUPER easy to clean. We would buy one for restaurants, but we just use a floppy seat, less room and we need ALL the room with twins. I love this booster and its perfect for grandmas, houses with limited space, for going out to eat, or just instead of a highchair if you have multiple children! We love this chair, and would never use another one for grandmas.	
1. 	Actually, thank goodness for my mom, who bought this for us. She thought it had better features than the Baby Papasan, which we registered for (and someone else gave us). She was right. My 3 month old son does not like the papasan at all, but LOVES the massage bouncer. I think it's the massage feature that he likes so much. It's one of the few places he would sleep during the first several weeks. It's nice that the music, vibrator, and massage feature all have separate controls - so you can have one or all on at the same time. It also has a reset button to start the massage and music back up after the auto shutoff. The handle is great for carrying baby from room to room.A definite MUST-HAVE product!!	
1. 	I'm going to start out by saying I have three kids. A 4 year old, 2.5 year old and 9 month old. They have 9 cousins and between the 12 of them we have purchased just about every baby/child toy product. I have a boon highchair that I love, but I needed something to use for my baby when she is being watched for me at someone elses home. She was just sitting on the floor making a giant mess with her food. I looked at all of the reviewes and decided this would be the best for the price. It came very fast (like always with Amazon) and was very easy to attach to the table. I seriously think a monkey could have done it. I was worried I didn't do it right because it was too simple. After I was satisfied it was on tight I put my niece in it to test it out (my kid wasn't going in it!). She survived the experement and loved it. She was just haning out in air eating her food, all containted not taking up much space. If you live in a small appartment or dont like to collect baby 'junk' this is the chair for you. I haven't had to clean it yet but its a baby chair, its going to get dirty, the fabric seems easy to clean. Also someome in another review mentioned that it wasn't supportive and there was a bar at the back. I'm not one to bubble wrap my kids in miles of foam covered cloth (hence the boon highchair) but I think if your kid cant sit up properly it probably shouldn't be in this chair. I'm happy with the purchase and I know this is going to be shared with all the kids and used regurly. I'm very happy with my purchase!	
1. 	These worked great for my daughter, she did  have accidents at night time but these were fine for daytime use.	
- 1	Looks just like described. But my baby don't like it. It's too big for his mouth. He is 5 month old.	
1. 	THE BEST! Not only did he get  less gas, I hand wash and these bottles are easy to clean. Yes it requires taking them apart and putting them back together again, but I know every speck of the bottle gets very clean. I have never had a single leak. I love that you can use eth same bottles with different flow rates. Easy for my son to hold on his own. I recommend these and will use these next time as well.	
- 1	Let me start by saying that I don't leak a ton and I got a free box of these. That being said, even for free I don't want to use these. They sound (yes sound) horrible as they're crinkly. If I leaked more I'd be really concerned because I just don't see how these would hold up. When I push them aside to nurse they ball up and I can't really reuse them. I like the avent so much better (softer, not crinkly, absorbent and actually hold up). I wouldn't spend the $ on these ever even if they were the only option.	
- 1	Not magical for us. Helped the first couple of nights we used it, but after that our son started sleeping WORSE, waking up 9-10 a night. We kept at it for a week and then stopped using it when we were travelling--when we didn't use it our son just rolled to his side and went to sleep. Turns out that's all he wanted!  i give it two stars b/c i'm sure the product does what it is supposed to, but it didn't help us at all.	
- 1	These aren't round. they have a straight sewn edge at the top so they don't fit as nicely inside the cover and they bend inward instead of stay rounded. stuck with it now.	
1. 	We have been using our turtle for a little over a year now. Our turtle has been part of our nightly routine (and sometimes naptime), every night since purchase, and I have only changed the batteries once. Our son is almost two years old and he loves seeing the stars on his ceiling at night. He began noticing, and becoming super interested in, the real stars in the night sky around a year ago. So bedtime is just a little more exciting when we can tell our child to &#34;go turn on your stars.&#34; Clearly, the shell is hard plastic so this is more of a stationary 'toy'. Don't expect much cuddling with your turtle. The nightlight does turn off after a certain amount of time, but that does save battery life. There is no option to keep it on all night. However, if your child is a little older, it is very easy to operate if they want to turn it back on. We have had no problem with visibility of the stars and they project onto our standard-height ceiling just fine. I'm very happy with this purchase and foresee our turtle being part of the family for a very long time.	
1. 	If there were 10 stars for the rating system instead of 5, I would probably give it 9 out of 10. It's a great product but it's not exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it's big enough for 2 adults and a picnic basket (not really much more). Yes, the handle is nice so it folds into a purse-like contraption for carrying. And yes, the backing seems to keep out the moisture since we last tested it on a moist lawn. But the top material is sort of plasticy. It's not crinkly cheap plastic, but it's not comfortable like a soft blanket. I guess there are give-and-takes when it comes to trying to stay dry or using a traditional blanket.I got several other picnic items at the same time on Amazon so check out those reviews as well. And let me know if you find them helpful!	
- 1	This carseat is easy to install and the fabric is great in the Laguna.  The only thing that really bugs me is the bottom part of the harness.The bottom straps ran across the top of my baby's thighs when I strapped him in.My LO is 9 months 18.5, 19lbs. I drive a Lexus RX350. He really disliked the 'hugs' straps too but I know you can remove them.The velcro on the seat to keep the harness out of the way is terrible. You will snag your clothes and your babies!You also have to be careful when rear facing to make sure it is not too upright. My LO's head was falling forward when asleep.  Every time I made a turn his head rocked side to side. I noticed that I would need to install it again with maybe a rolled towel or pool noodle underneath.  That would solve the head slump.We ended up returning the Britax and buying the 2nd generation Chicco Nextfit. We love it!! It takes one minute to install and we love the fabric and the head wings. The fabric is similar to the Maxi Cosi Pria.  No need for a pool noodle, rolled towel or angle adjuster (diono radian rxt) when installing rear facing. The shoulder straps are now REMOVABLE with velcro. The seat is really deep which allows for extended rear facing with a long legged LO. I recently washed the cover and it turned out great. Wash in cold and hang dry. Watch a Chicco video online for directions on how to remove the cover. Baby loves the seat and sleeps great in it!I decided on the Chicco Nextfit after installing and trying:Recaro Preformance,  which was way too short in seat depth for a baby over the length of 29. My LO's feet were touching the back seat at 9months.Maxi Cosi Pria,  has great seat depth and nice head wings. It is super stylish, but I was worried about safety. I wanted a steel frame. It was nearly impossible to get a tight install when rear facing.Diono Radian RXT, was hard to get a tight install in center of my car. It also takes up a lot of room without an angle adjuster. I don't want to worry about dragging an angle adjuster with me when traveling. I wanted to love it but I was underwhelmed. I cannot imagine putting a newborn in the seat.The ease of installing the Chicco Nextfit makes it a perfect seat to bring when traveling. No more sweating in the back seat trying to get a tight install!(We used the Orbit G2 infant seat before the Chicco Nextfit. I loved it!  It's heavy but the travel system is amazing. I could easily run errands without waking up the baby. It made getting out of the house so much easier!!! Super easy to clip the baby in the seat too!)	
- 1	A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	
- 1	I bought this Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD seat seat for my 26 month-old daughter, who now wants to eat right up at the table like mom and dad instead of from her high chair tray.  Her Boon Flair high chair has a removable tray, but the seat is incompatible with tables (like ours) that have a lip or skirt around the edge.  The BoosterPOD has pretty low sides and a deep seat, so my daughter's legs could easily fit between the seat and the bottom of my table lip without squeezing.But honestly, that's the only reason I didn't give this booster seat 1 star.  One of the main reasons I purchased the BoosterPOD is that Prince Lionheart claims that it's non-toxic.  Our family tries to avoid synthetic materials and suspicious chemicals whenever possible, especially in items that our daughter eats or sleeps on, so obviously, the manufacturer's description of this item as non-toxic, BPA-free and phthalate-free was a big draw.  However, when I first opened the box and took the BoosterPOD out, I immediately noticed a strong chemical smell, especially coming from the underside of the chair.  My daughter was so excited to try out her new booster seat that I let her eat breakfast on it despite my misgivings, but I noticed that she didn't eat nearly as much as she usually does.  I can't help but wonder if she was as bothered by the chemical smell of the BoosterPOD as I was.  In any event, for quite awhile after she got up from her meal, her clothes still had a chemical smell from the BoosterPOD seat.  Needless to say, this chair is being returned.Grade: D	
- 1	I bought these for a trip but returned. These hold too little for my hungry 8 month baby. They might be good for babies who aren't really &#34;eating&#34; yet.	
- 1	I'm an exclusive pumper, so in addition to bottles and nipples, I also have lots of pump parts to deal with. This spacious bottle rack looked like it would be the answer to all my problems!Sadly, my dreams of an organized countertop, with bottles drying neatly on a rack rather than an assortment of paper towels, were not to be. I brought this home, popped it in the dishwasher to sterilize it before using, and took it out, eager to assemble it. Unfortunately, not one but TWO of the pieces that snap together to keep the whole unit in one piece had broken.I immediately took the item back to the store. Very disappointing (and my kitchen is still a mess, too).	
- 1	These bottles leak.  It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave.  They leak.  Terribly.  And Avent knows it.  They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent.  Of course the ones they replace it with also leak.  Buy Dr. Browns instead.	
1. 	I didn't think I needed a nursing cover. I mostly nurse at home or use a blanket when out. We were planning a trip to visit friends and all of their extended family were also going to be there. I thought I might want a nursing cover so I wouldn't have to excuse myself and constantly go to another room to nurse and it would stay in place around strangers. I LOVE IT. It is generous in size and covers everything. The pockets weigh it down a little bit so it doesn't blow up. How do I know that? Well, I went hiking and had to nurse at the summit. This worked well. All the people hiking with us were comfortable and I got to comfortably nurse in my regular hiking gear (no nursing top) while sitting on a giant rock. I highly suggest this as a must have item tucked into your diaper bag or hiking backpack. I think I will order another.	
1. 	Love  this lady bug!!!! Got it for my soon to be grand-baby . The stars, especially the white setting are so bright and vivid !I can't wait until my daughter unwraps it for Christmas and the lady bug will definitely light up a room. Not to bright but just right. Five stars all THE WAY !!!!!!!!!!!!	
1. 	UPDATE:  I have been using this gate with the New Baby.  He is now 20 months old and there are absolutely no complaints...just praise.  The pedal seems to be improved as I have yet to have it break.  I still recommend this gate above and beyond all the rest.  Matter of fact I am about to buy another one this weekend to put upstairs.I used this gate for both of my girls and eventually a little girl that my MIL babysat.  It's very durable and the ease of use and set up is great. It's also a plus that the fram stays in place and you dont' have to remove it all the time like other gates. The one part that might give out will be the pedal.  My husband broke it once when we first got this because the animal that he is put too much weight on it (the gate stands up nicely to regular pressure).  I do have to say that the company was great when I called them for a replacement part and sent it out the very same day. I am now 4 1/2 months pregnant and will buy a new one.  I have no doubts or bad things to say about this gate.  It was well worth the money. I had tried several other gates and was not happy at all with any of them.	
1. 	What would we have done without this??  We have a corner crib, so mattress lifters didn't fit.  This was PERFECT!  It kept our little one in an inclined position all night so that we did not have any sleeping difficulties.  We went from awake every two hours cleaning up spit up, to sleeping for 4 to 5 hours at a time.  What a blessing!	
1. 	While I sort of wish I could change the batteries in these things instead of buying a new one when it dies (my little guy HAS to have it vibrate), this was a life saver for me when both my kids (one 4 years and one 6 months) were/are teething. And for my youngest, it's just about the only thing that works.	
- 1	I hate to give this such a low rating, but we were unable to use it and had to return it. My son has a basic twin bed that sits on a twin bed box spring in a twin bed frame from Rooms to Go. I say all that to say it's a basic, twin bed. My son is 3, and we transitioned him from a converted crib into his big-boy bed and thought he needed a railing. This one seemed to fit the bill except there did not appear to be any way to get it to properly fit his twin bed. The options with the bed rail clasps and straps either squeezed the bed way too tight and would barely stay on or were too big to fit the twin size. I don't know if we got a defective one, but it was very frustrating especially since the bedrail itself took about 20-30 minutes to put together and came in lots of different pieces. We ultimately had to take it all apart and resend it back. I know other reviewers mentioned how it did not fit their children's beds that may have been a little different, but I expected it to do the basic thing it was advertised to do - fit a twin size bed.	
1. 	I received these from a family member before my baby was born. Her daughter didn't take to them. Keeping that in mind, I didn't really consider using them the first time around. Then they ended up being my favorite!I didn't experience any problems with leaking or blocking, as some reviewers had mentioned. I'm using hand-me-down vent caps (the silicone part that goes at the bottom of the bottle) and bottoms! For maintenance, I stick these in the dishwasher. I have an OXO dishwasher bin. I put the nipples in one side and the vent caps on the other. The bottle goes with the cups. The ring and bottoms go in the basket. I end up washing these once or twice a day.I ended up purchasing an additional set on Amazon because we needed 10 bottles. Once we get five or six into the dishwasher, that means we only have four or five remaining in the fridge. When my son gets hungry, he screams bloody murder with very little time after his first hunger grunt. We like to have these ready to go in times of need (between midnight and 5a when his screams are most unpleasant). I'm breastfeeding as well, but my son eats a lot. When I use these, I usually breastfeed for 10-15 minutes before giving him the bottle. Sometimes he continues going for my chest, but I've learned to use the bottle for nipple preservation.I have not used these bottles to store my breastmilk. When I return to work, I plan to use smaller containers from Medella. I don't pump enough to fill one of these bottles. We use RTF formula with these bottles. I'm sure it would work fine with powder as well.	
- 1	The idea behhind this mat is great - give your baby a different texture and visually interesting things to explore during tummy time.  However, the actual product was a bit underwhelming. First, without the assistance of the reviewer who explained how to fill the water portion, I'd likely have assumed it was just broken, as there's no instructions and no clear way to fill the inner portion of the mat. Once explained, filling the water pocket was very easy. The mat is pretty small - my 9 week old could not fully fit on it, but he did seem to enjoy the different sensation. After 48 hours the air had leaked out of the outside ring and the fish in the inner ring were being hunted by the cat. We move it to higher ground but an additional 48 hours later and it had spring a leak.	
- 1	Very thin material- fit the 3 inch mattress pad right now - but may shrink after wash. May not be very durable after wash.	
1. 	We bought 2 of these, and used them to block off the computer desk from the rest of the family room, and to block off the 7' wide archway between the kitchen and the rest of the house. We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier.	
1. 	This is a great little pump. I have the pump in style as well, but sometimes if I just needed to pump off excess breastmilk I didn't feel like hauling out the whole thing and plugging it in so I would grab this and it worked great! I love being able to just throw it in a diaper bag or, if I'm out with some friends without the baby, into a large purse so I can stay out longer than I would if I had to go home when my breasts got too full.I don't think I would want to use it as my only pump since I do pump often even though I am a SAHM, and if I were a working mother pumping while at work this CERTAINLY would not suffice, but it does the trick as a handy little stand in!	
1. 	I hesitated to register for this blanket because it's so expensive, but I am so glad I did.  It's worth the money because we get so much more use out of it than the smaller, cheaper receiving blankets.  This is our favorite blanket for cold weather or air conditioned rooms, while we usually use the Aden + Anais muslin blankets (also expensive but worth it) in warmer weather.  I also thought about getting this blanket in a different color or pattern, but I am glad I went with the off-white flannel with chocolate trim stitching.  It matches everything, and when it's in photos (which is often), it's neutral, keeping the focus on my son.  The blanket is a great size (big enough for swaddling), super soft, just the right thickness (warm but not too heavy), and washes/wears well.  The only things I would change are the tags.  There are two, and while they are silky and soft, they are still annoying.  One is kind of large and has swaddling instructions, which I think is unnecessary to permanently attach to the blanket.  The tags are sewn in with the decorative edge stitching, so cutting them off might mess up the blanket.  They are centered on one side, which makes folding the blanket in halves awkward, and we're frequently adjusting the blanket so that the tags aren't near our baby's face.  Even with that minor complaint, though, I still give this blanket five stars.	
1. 	This &#34;starter set&#34; is perfect for a new Mom, even if she's breast feeding! I have breast fed all our kids but this kit is new to me. I use it to stock up a little supply for times I'm away, and it's worked out great. I was concerned about our little guy accepting the nipple, etc, but it's been no problem. Recommended!	
1. 	My baby is 7 months old.  We've been using these for a couple months now and they are great at pacifying him!  All of the teething rings that we keep in the freezer make his little hands so cold, so these are a great alternative for a baby who is teething.  We bought a big bag of frozen fruit to use in these and have found that he likes the peaches the best.  We tried fresh fruit (strawberries & bananas), but those not only created a huge mess on him, but it was extremely difficult to clean the bananas out of the feeder.  I literally had to scrape the little pieces off with my fingernail AFTER running it through the dishwasher and then trying to wash it by hand with a bottle brush.  So we're sticking with the frozen peaches.  I'm actually on here to buy a second pack of 2 today so that we always have a clean one available.	
- 1	The bumpers don't stay in place on the slats and slide down.  The package was inconsistent with some fitting more snug then others and 1 of the bumpers was actually dirty as if they sent me one that was used.	
- 1	While the seller was great on this item- great service, and fast shipping, I ended up throwing these spoons away.  I know the label says BPA free, but there was DEFINITELY some nasty chemicals in this spoon or the packaging.  I washed them multiple times and the chemical smell never went away.  I couldn't help but think my baby was eating poison if I let her use these spoons, so I just threw them away.  A waste I know, but they were so yucky I saw no other option.  I don't recommend purchasing these.  I found some other white spoons, BPA free and made in the USA and those have been SO much better than these nasty things.	
1. 	I haven't had any problems with any of the colors not showing up on our light tan walls. The amber, blue and gree all show up great. I personally find the green to be the most relaxing. I love to turn this on while I rock my kids, it is so neat to look at. The timer is the best feature so I can just leave it on for my 3 year old while she falls asleep. LOVE it! I'm going to start giving these as gifts.	
- 1	I bought this mirror to suction onto the back window of my sedan since my infant is rear facing in his car seat. It would be perfect if it would only stay suctioned onto the window. I have tried cleaning the window and wetting the suction mount, but to no avail. The mirror sticks for about 20 minutes or until you hit a speed bump.	
- 1	I ordered this because of the good reviews, but it doesn't work for us. First it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, which has nothing to do with the product but was especially frustrating since I'm now returning it. It doesn't fit our island or dining room table. The arms are really long, requiring a pretty deep space. It's also much more cumbersome than expected. I thought we'd just fold it up and take it out to dinner with us, but it doesn't collapse very small. We didn't use it to actually feed the baby since it didn't work in our kitchen, but I could tell the space between the counter and the baby was too wide and we would end up with more food on the floor than anywhere else.It does seem like a solid design, so if it works in your kitchen then it's probably a good purchase.	
- 1	I purchased this toy for my 6 month old granddaughter to encourage her to continue crawling, however, the toy does not serve that purpose.  It does not catch a young child's attention and the &#34;noises&#34; it's supposed to make to draw attention are barely audible.Would not recommend it.	
1. 	What's great about this product is that you can adjust it to anyone's needs. My husband is 6'4 and big and he can make this work for him to take piggy out for a walk. With just a simple adustment to the strap I can change it to wrap her around me. The best is that as a new born (before one can master the art of concealing breast feeding), you can use this to hold and feed your little one.	
- 1	I'm making my own baby food and was looking for a bpa free freezer tray, which seems difficult to find until I saw this one. I made a batch of pur&eacute;ed food and froze it in this tray and I cannot get ANY cubes out, not one! I am now defrosting the entire tray :( Not happy with this. Returning it!	
- 1	Please don't waste your money on such expensive bottle washing bottle brush. This was way to expensive and it didn't even clean the bottles as good as the Munchkins bottle brush did.	
- 1	As another customer posted we got a stinky stroller too. My wife does not want to use it and wants me to send it back. If I had the energy, I would but so tired, this is the 3rd time in a row I have been burned by Amazon.	
1. 	We have this cover in sage and blue, and have no complaints. The cover is soft, cleans very easily, and retains color very well (i.e. Not washed out after laundering). The colors are pretty and look great in my son's room.	
1. 	This is one very serious cup holder that will never fail if installed right but that is hard to do. It seems like you install it one way, but you actually have to do something else. I'm pretty handy but this one was tricky to me. Instructions are atrocious.First, this cup holder will fit all thickness handles. I have a First Years Wave stroller which is very thick. It could've handled thicker and thinner just the same.Second, it does swivel to level your drink if installed on a diagonal bar. You have to press a button to make it swivel.Here is the trick--when you get it, the tab piece that goes around the bar comes bent in the middle and it feels like you put your bar in that part, tighten, and you are done. This is wrong.***HOW TO INSTALL***You should unbend the tab piece where you think the bar should go. Then, bend the piece again around your stroller to make a custom sized loop. This plastic is pretty thick that is probably why a lot of people don't think to do this. When you put the tab into the fastener, look at the treads and line them up before it goes in all the way in to make a tight fit. Then when you get it in, you use the screw thingy to make it even tighter. I also think that this is how you are supposed to install it and the instructions just aren't clear or people are not taking the time to read it.If you don't do this, installation will be loose and the drink will fall and you will complain.Someone had a tip on here to use kitchen grip pads around your bar. This is a good idea. I installed mine over the foam part of the stroller handle so I didn't need it but I would've liked some if I was installing over the metal part. Not necessary but would be a nice to have.	
- 1	These are definitely not the authentic Aden and Anais brand we know and love.  These are definitely of lesser quality and do not hold up as well as the more expensive ones.  I wish they would specify that, instead of selling it like they are the good quality ones.  They should also sell it for way less.  These were washed once, and they shrank and the edges became wavy.  It could not be stretched back to its original shape.	
1. 	My son liked this during the entire spring/summer when he was around 7 months old. It was used mostly outside and is pretty tolenerany of slight sloped ground. We got the green/ jungle version and he really enjoyed the lights & sounds. He took to boucing instanlty as well as the removable toy bar. I really like that there was an assortment of activities for him to choose from that were age-related. The adjustments for height were easy to adjust. (It is a sliding metal bar that holds the fabric). The toy didn't last long with my son since he did not like to be constraned to a seat after he was 9 1/2 months.We did get our money's worth since it seemed that this toy was the only thing I could set him down in that he enjoyed and I was able to enjoy a break for a change. I think all beginner stages can enjoy this to some degree, but the pre-sitting thru sitting age is more of an ideal age range for this toy.	
1. 	I've tried one other brand of liners, and I like these better. They hold up, and can even go through one wash cycle and be reused. They catch poop spectacularly.	
- 1	Works well to keep my little one out of drawers and cabinets now that they are installed.Cons -- screws are cheap and strip out easily while trying to install.  They should include extras as we ran short on screws during installation due to stripping out a few of the threads.- they do not swivel to the off position without unscrewing partially.  I assumed they could just be turned to the side when you don't want the cabinet to lock.  Since the screws are cheap, you don't want to have to unscrew to swivel as that will further strip out the screw.	
- 1	I tried these to save money and the environment, but as other reviewers mentioned, they lump up after washing and show pretty clearly through your bra and clothes. They were absorbent, but that wasn't enough of a quality to continue using them. I also agree that they stick to skin, and when you're learning to BF and have sore nipples, that is not a fun thing.	
- 1	My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it.	
- 1	need a plug in version.  other than that it was ok.  we get along ok with out it. good idea	
- 1	It's true, this pail will stink, it won't matter what you use to absorb odor it won't work and every time you open the pail a horrible stench will permeate the nursery.The inside ring also always comes off and if you over stuff it will snag the garbage bag.  We are having baby #2 soon and the only thing I need to replace is this pail. I also advise all my friends to avoid this pail, as it was the worst purchase we made for our daughter.	
- 1	I brought this item for my newborn to experience some Tummy Time and I was very disappointed with this quality of this product. It is very cheap and surface area is very small ... and this side mirror that it came with does not fold correctly ( I almost don't know what to do with this item ). Anyhow, I would not recommend to purchase this product for tummy time. It is better to spend more money and purchase a Playmat instead. I want to return this item but my husband already threw away the box. This item is already in the storage.	
- 1	A friend of mine swears by this cup so I bought it but my son never took to aspirate from it, I think the spout is just too thin and small for him. So it's sitting here taking dust.	
- 1	Though pink and cute, this thing never seemed to work quite right. The baby wasn't stable in it -- she would flop over forward. Observers wondered if she would fall out. While that never happened, she'd get burn marks on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.  Ouch...An annoyance: I had to get help to clamp it into doorways; couldn't attach & detach it myself.It just didn't work for us.By way of comparison: our favorite jumper was the Graco Bumper Jumper. Still working very well for us. She bounces much more often and more happily in the Graco than she did in the Evenflo.	
1. 	This is the perfect pad for many uses and not just babies. Although I wish I had it when my kids were little since it is so multi-purpose.It is a great size, not too big, not too small. You can use it as a changing pad, a play pad or for those times that you want to take your baby's diaper off and let things air out but you don't want an accident to mark your bed or floor.There are many other uses beyond babies. If you've ever had surgery and you've had to sit on or lay a body part on one of those plastic, absorbent blue pads, you know how horrible they are at sticking to you. This is a great alternative. For those times that you may have 'leakage' during your period or seepage from anything, this is just right (although if you roll around a lot it may bunch up) but it is certainly good for a chair seat. It is great for an older person who is having trouble with leakage, especially for their furniture or vehicle seat.It washes up nicely and seems to be thick enough to hold a lot of moisture. But it is really soft as well.I was provided a sample for testing and review.	
- 1	These are great quality but fleece fabric doesn't breath and overheats baby. Also fleece is really bad for babies with eczema-- our baby was fine until a night in this! Op for HALO's cotton sleep sack-- much better.	
- 1	I tried using this several times on my newborn for little boogies,  and it never worked.  The one it did get snot out was when I pulled one to the edge with a Q-tip and just sucked it out from there.  $14 for this dinky thing?  Better spent on anything else.	
- 1	This thing did not stick for me at all, anywhere.....which was why i needed it, distraction during changing, so ...didn't do us any good.	
1. 	This is a fantastic space saving product. I love that you can adjust the shelves to accommodate different height jars and I love that you can tuck it in the cabinet and have all your baby food organized and ready to pluck off the shelf! The only thing potential purchasers should know is that it does not rotate, despite the fact that it is circular. I highly recommend!!	
- 1	I ordered these by accident! Wanted the Drop-Ins and didn't pay close attention.This is the worst liner I can imagine. They leak and leak and leak and just don't compare at all to the convenience of the drop-ins!Pay CLOSE attention, when you order your liners... these ones are a WASTE of money!!!!	
- 1	I wanted to love this cover so badly, I really did. I bought it because I liked the pattern and colors and the price was good. When I got it I also liked that it was more padded and soft than most others out there and it had the zipper pockets as another bonus. I also like the idea of the shoulder straps. Sounds great right? Right. The problem is that it doesn't fit over most carts... It doesn't have the stretch elastic that other covers have that make it big and easy to put over the back of the seat in the cart. I tried sooo hard to stretch it over the back and it wouldn't go. And this isn't just one one type of cart, this is at the grocery, target, and other shops we went to so it was the cover, not the cart. My husband and I kept finding ourselves struggling in parking lots just to try and make it work and it  never did. Also although the shoulder straps were nice they were SUCH a pain to get on right. I thought maybe it was just me but one day while in target we were so tired of it we purchased an Eddie Bauer one in the store and breathed a huge sigh of relief when it went on quickly and easily.  It also has cute little toys that are strapped to the front for LO to play with and you can attach your own toys as well. It doesn't have a plush soft seat like this jeep one but overall it's much better, easier and useful.	
1. 	Very sturdy hardware, easy to use, everyone should have these. Thanks for the great reviews for helping me see these straps were the ones to buy.	
- 1	Food gets stuck in the masher part, and in the grooves on the bottom.  Also, the product details say it is 'imported' but doesn't list the country of origin.  I should have known that it was made in China.  :(	
1. 	I am quite pleased with this seat. I had a fold up one, but it would pinch my granddaughter's legs and she would always exclaim, &#34;It's cold!&#34; This seat does the trick!	
- 1	My eight-month-old has been sitting up and eating solids for several months now and, of course, he makes a mess every time, since he's, well, eight months old. I got this bib, thinking it would be nice to have one I could just rinse off after feeding him, rather than having to wash a bib every meal.Unfortunately, the Bibbity is *ridiculously* wide, to the point that he has a lot of trouble reaching around it to get at his food. Since we feed him a lot of finger foods, this is a major deal-breaker. He gets frustrated, and eventually just moves the bib around so that he can use one arm properly, and then the pocket at the bottom is nearly perpendicular to the floor and most of his shirt is going to get food all over it. The little indents on the sides for the arms are positioned approximately at the tops of his shoulders, even when the neck of the bib isn't touching his neck, which is not exactly what I'd call useful.I'm kind of astonished that it's so poor a fit; he's eight months old, and wearing 12M clothing (at 29 tall and 20lbs)! There's no way this would be a workable bib for a newborn; I think it MIGHT work for him when he's 18 months, but certainly not now.	
1. 	My 24 month old daughter has only wet the bed a handful of times while this has been in use, and it has not leaked so I am pleased.It does not fit perfectly well onto her bed, despite the flaps, and needs to be tucked in again every so often. This, however, is a small inconvenience and my daughter likes it well. Its softness is a plus from her point of view, as she tends to put her whole body on it, including her face!	
1. 	I put the baby bath in our actual tub and run the faucet the whole time she in - she loves the sound of the water. The sling allows for me to have the baby bath overflow and still be safe.	
1. 	I was looking for a stroller that would work for the first year.  I knew that as he grew older, that we would need a different system.Lightweight, easy to use, easy to collapse, fits well in car.I notice as my child is getting heavier - he is 22 pounds, that it is getting harder to push.Very large basket - easy to use.Would definitely recommend this.	
- 1	I have Avent bottles that I am very happy with so naturally I purchased Avent sippy cups.  I was not impressed with these cups at all.  They do leak.  I specifically wanted a cup that had a lid so it could be put in a purse or bag.  This cup does have a lid, but the lid is hinged and stays on while the child is drinking.  My daughter was distracted by this and just wanted to play with the lid.  I wanted a lid that is removable.	
- 1	It'd be great if it wasn't so easy to tear off. The Velcro straps that hold toys doesn't do a great job of holding toys either. My ten month old rips this off the rail and rips the toys off the Velcro. Snap buttons might work better.	
1. 	This is a fantastic product. It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.	
- 1	Cotton bundled up on it, just not as high quality as the pillow itself. My wife was said it was disappointing.	
- 1	So, as other reviewers said this paci holder is like a stuffed animal ... without the stuffing. It's very flimsy and it definitely not meant to keep the pacifies in the baby's mouth (for that purpose I would suggest the Wubbanubhttp://www.amazon.com/Wubbanub-Infant-Plush-Toy-Pacifier/dp/B0028IDXDS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358790060&sr=8-2&keywords=wannanub) if that was meant to hold te paci in place, it totally fails - anyway, my LO may like to hold this buddy but the pacifier always falls off ... Unfortunately it did not work for me.	
1. 	I'm surprised to see that people do not like this product. I love mine. The only downside is that I wish it would hold more bags. Each drawer/tray holds 6 bags (6 oz ea). That means you can store a total of 12 bags. I don't know how people bought this and didn't know that ahead of time though! Not only is it clearly labled, but you can easily count on your own by looking at the photo!When I purchased this I bought two. That way I could store 24 bags (Thats' a lot!) They are stackable so I put two side by side and stack two on top of those. They will fit almost any type of freezer storage bag so I'm not sure why people are complaining that they don't. Make sure you put the bag in the tray BEFORE its frozen. Liquids will mold to any shape, so you won't have a problem. If you try shoving a bag in after its frozen, sure you'll have issues!There are 2 things I love about this product.1) It keeps my breastmilk away from all the other foods in my freezer. Its nice that its in a bag and also in this nice sturdy plastic tray. It keeps it from absorbing any smells from the other frozen foods2) I can organize my milk by date and I never have to go searching through a pile of milk bags. I open the tray and pull out the oldest milk in line. I rotate when a tray empties. I NEVER have to wonder if I'm missing a bag. For any extra milk I have around (beyond the 24 bags I store using 2 units) I keep it that in a plastic grocery bag and when I empty a tray I go through and put in the next 6 oldest bags. I'm always organized! I love that.Personally I LOVE the medela Pump and Save breastmilk freezer bags. They hold 6 oz, have a zip-lock top, and a place to write down the name, date, and amount of oz in the bag. ALL freezer bags are inacurate with their markings because they are BAGS. Squeeze the bag, alter its shape, and the milk shifts, there's no way to know the exact ounces! It doesn't matter the brand! Plus, liquid expands when frozen. The best bet is to collect your milk in a marked BOTTLE first. Note the ounces then write them down in the provided spot on the Medela pump and save freezer bags. That way you and your caregiver knows EXACTLY what is in the bag. Don't try and guess!I recommend this product if you want a nice way to organize your milk and keep it fresh and protected. I wish they could hold a few more bags, but 2 units (4 total trays) has been working out for me and I've been breastfeeding my little one for almost 6 months.	
- 1	I wanted to get my child familiar with this thing before I try getting her to sit on it when we are out. I placed this folding potty against the front of my toilet at home, and it seemed stable. My two-year-old said it was comfortable. Then I noticed a puddle growing in front of the toilet and realized that all the pee was coming out! She was just sitting on it normally. I thought I would just let her finish and then clean her up. Well, she started to move or try to get up or something and fell face first onto the ground!The best way I've found to avoid the dirtiest part of the toilet is to sit my kid on the side of the toilet, facing the toilet paper or (even better) the handicapped bar. I usually just hold her as she sits (for stability), and she's never fallen in. This folding potty thing was more trouble than anything. I would not recommend it.	
1. 	I spent the $350 on the fancy double Medela pump-in-style, but could never get it to work.  I gave up and sold it used at a fraction of the cost.I saw this Avent for sale for for $19 at some outlet and bought it with skepticism.  It works perfectly though - I used it every day for months; it has really helped me continue nursing without always being home or taking the baby everywhere I go.You can control pressure, speed, and it doesn't need batteries or make loud noises.  Excellent!	
1. 	I bought this when we had our first child instead of buying a bath bathtub.  This is much cheaper, and much more efficient.  Also, this stores much more easily.	
1. 	I have two faves and I alternate between the two for various reasons.  I am pumping 100% because my daughter will not latch on (another story - issues with losing >10% and having to supliment with a bottle with expressed milk - nipple confusion) so finding the right pad to put on always sensitive nipples is critical.  Writing the same review for both.FavesPhilips AVENT Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Softer than Lansinoh- works really well when nipples are very tender and drying out makes it worse- regardless of what cream/balm I used, sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds do not stick (only occasionally)CONS:- they are a little bulkier than Lansinoh so they may show through some bras- when I was in the leaking stage (or when I go a little too long between my night and morning pumping session) I have occasionally leaked through the padLansinoh Disposable Nursing PadsPROS:- Thinner and larger in diameter than Avent- keeps nipples drier- I don't think that I have ever leaked throughCONS:- not as soft as Advent- sore nipples / cracks / splits / healing wounds stick to pad and sometimes tear off scabs (sorry this sounds so gross, but it happens)I usually use Avent when my nipples are in bad shape (seems to go in cycles) because they are softer and my wounds don't stick and then switch to Lansinoh when they are healing and need to dry out.	
1. 	I use it as a straw ans sippy cup spout cleaner, works well since it can bend in any which way. happy with the buy	
1. 	These are great and every single time we have used these we haven't had anything leak outside of the underwear. I bought two & Im very satisfied with them	
1. 	Was a gift and they love it.  Easy to use. All wipe brands fit nicely inside.  Temperature remains constant. Good value and makes a welcome gift.	
1. 	We had initially purchased 2 3 in1 alpha omega elite. We were happy with them. However, after 2 years i stumbled upon some info that stated you HAD to use it as a bel positioning booster at 40lbs. While this is considered legal, i just cannot imagine that a child wouldn't be thrown out with just a seat belt i ncase of a major crash. The regent is the one car seat (if you did not start with a roundabout) that can be used as a 5 point harness until 80lb. yes it's more expensive but isn't your child worth it?	
1. 	With the holidays coming up and traveling to so many diffrent ppls homes we wanted to get something safe and easy to travel with. As much as i love my EB highchairs i didnt want to be loading them up to travel to visit family. We didnt want to have to feed the twins in their infant seats either. They are used to sitting in a highchair and wanted them to be comfortable. We went to store and checked out many of the booster seats and NOTHING compared to this one. Its easy to get on the chair, its easy to get the babies in and out, easy to clean and most of all it stays very secure on the chair. If you do run into a problem with it sitting right on your chair fold up a towel put that on the chair and then the seat on top of that. It should work like a charm.With other models i have read how hard it was to get the booster on the chair and to stay safely. Also getting it clean was almost impossible. THe other chairs in the store were just hard to work with. We've used this now about 5 times and almost wished we didnt buy big highchairs for the twins (so does grandma). These are so portable and dont take up as much space as the other chairs and they do the same job as the big highchairs. When you go anywhere with young children you always seem to be carrying so many other things for them. This makes things a little easier. At 7 months old my babies love these chairs and we will be using them for a long time!	
1. 	It does everything it advertises PLUS you can wash it in the washing machine for after use to ensure that it stays clean for your next trip!	
- 1	To get to the letters after you place them in the barn you must remove all the animals to open the barn door. My son gets frustrated with having to remove them. The letters seam really cheap on the toy. They are super light weight but also had bits of plastic sticking up. The toy just doesn't hold his interest. He has several other shape sorters that he loves. This one just isn't a hit. He likes animals and barns but this toy just doesn't hold the 'it' factor for him.	
1. 	Jersey knit hits the spot with babies, and this goes above and beyond! Not only is it cute and a good quality sheet, it is SO SOFT!I want sheets like this! Even after multiple washings it fits great and is soft to the touch!	
1. 	Base is fairly anti-slip, so it doesn't move around much unless you try. Comfortable, easy to clean, no complaints. Recommended!	
1. 	Very easy to use, combined with almost nothing to clean. The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience.	
1. 	Easy to install, looks great and no one can tell it's a child proofing device.Note: This product works like a deadbolt. You can only lock/unlock it from the inside. So it will not automatically latch when you close the door, or if you go out someone has to lock it again from the inside.	
- 1	I purchased this wearable blanket to avoid sids. Even though where I live isn't extremely cold it's cold enough that one wearable blanket was not warm enough. Also because of his size, it kept riding up on him which was really annoying.	
1. 	Great cups. The only ones I've found that truly don't leak. Easy to clean and assemble.	
1. 	This is a nice little stool. It's not very high, so I think it would be difficult for a child to really hurt themselves fooling around on this. At the same time, it's high enough to help a toddler get up on the couch or to the toilet.It has a nice rubberized top to prevent slipping, which is great when you have a little billy goat climbing up and down repeatedly or exploring its uses in unorthodox ways. The green color is also very bright and fun, and the plastic shell seems easy to clean.	
1. 	My daughter started noticing it around 1 week of age and has loved it ever since!  (She's 8 weeks now.)  It's like her own little friend that she can't wait to see during diaper changes.  She doesn't make a peep during a diaper change if I wind him up.  She waits and gets so excited as soon as I put her on the changing table.The song is not annoying at all.  It can be a little loud in the middle of the night and sometimes the initial first note can startle her, but it has never scared her.  She just loves him so much!It's very sturdy and stays in place even while winding with one hand.  Easy to put together.  Easy to move to a different place if you wanted to.Some reviews said it didn't play long enough for diaper changes, but I guess I'm a speedy diaper changer since it still plays for a while after I'm done.  Besides, it's so easy to reach up with one hand and wind it up again if need be (sometimes I'll do that just so she can watch him some more!).I even brought it with for a trip and it fit on to my Combi Play Yard just fine, not perfect, but it worked very well and I was still able to wind it up with just one hand and it didn't move too much.  I knew I had to bring him with!!!As soon as she can reach him (manufacturer says to take it away at this point since the wings could be a choking hazard if they came off), I am going to keep it on her play yard so she can still see her little friend without being able to reach him.  It will be a very sad day when we can't use her Flutterbug mobile anymore!  We will be heartbroken for our daughter!!!!!It's so cute, so colorful, very inexpensive, and my daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES it!!  I can't say enough wonderful things about it!If I could give it 10 stars, I would!!!!BUY IT, you (or at least your little sweetie pie) will LOVE it!!****** UPDATE July 2013 *******We used this awesome little guy for sure as long as our daughter was in diapers, which was 2 years, and I'm fairly certain we left him on the changing table for quite some time after that as well.  She would reach up every now and then and managed to grab his wings, but for the most part, she just enjoyed watching him, cooing/talking to him, and smiling/laughing with him.We put it back on the changing table for our newest daughter who has REALLY been enjoying watching him and listening - she's 9wks old.  She smiles at him, is attempting to laugh, kicks, and gets so excited.  She used to scream during diaper changes and now she's happy the entire time with this little friend right there.  It's been so sweet to see another child enjoy him so much.  For being almost 6 years old, this colorful guy has really held up well after a couple years of constant (and far from gentle) use and several more years of harsh storage.  I'm so sad to see that it's not really available anywhere anymore as it was my number 2 recommendation for new parents and I've given it as a gift to several friends!  (My number 1 recommendation for new parents is the AngelCare Monitor!)Find it somewhere, buy it, and you'll love it too!  My husband and I both have a soft spot for this mobile and I see us hanging on to him so our future grandchildren can enjoy him too.	
1. 	We still use this tub for my daughter at 2 1/2, 30 lbs and 37 tall, and have used it since birth.It is so RARE for a convertible baby-to-toddler product to actually pan out in real life that I just had to review this.The molded shape of this tub is just perfect, and thinks of everything!  The slanted part is such that we still use it to wash my daughter's hair even as a large toddler.  It seems to be very comfortable between the crotch as she's never complained, and sits relaxed reclined or upright. As a baby, she was cradled, secure and very happy.I love everything about this tub, especially its' large size.  Some reviewers complain about this, but I look at it this way:  we have a tub/shower, and put this bath tub into our bathtub to bathe our daughter.  If I had to scrub out our tub every night to get it clean enough for her, that would be a huge pain!  Given this tub's large size, I can (now that she's too big to ever slip under) fill it up to the top, and she's got warm water and suds up to her mid-chest, without any risk of her falling under as with an adult tub.  To me, this is a much more pleasant bath than sitting in the adult tub as a toddler in only a few inches of water.  If you put more water into an adult tub, we've found our toddler slips around too much and feels insecure, even with a mat.Cleaning this tub is a snap.  No nooks and crannies for gunk to accumulate.  The rubber drain is the only place where we get some mildew, but it pops right out for easy cleaning and reinserts just as easily.  I use a Seventh Generation cleaner with a hydrogen peroxide active ingredient.Durability is fabulous:  We actually never drain the tub with the drain, but lift it and spill the water out.  Even with a full tub, in 2.5 years we've never had a crack.I love this tub so much, we bought two more - one for Grandma and Grandad's in each state!  For $25, this is a slam dunk in all respects.	
- 1	Perhaps I had too high expectations, but this product was a real disappointment.One major pro, it doesn't tip over.	
- 1	After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!	
- 1	I purchased the box with the turtle. It's cute, but very cheaply made and not worth the price. The box does not open smoothly either. One of the sides would always get stuck. There's better quality boxes out there. I would not recommend this.	
1. 	I purchased this for use while my grand daughter was visiting.  The bed rail was easy to assemble and fairly easy to install, I was putting it on a double bed so I needed help moving the mattress.  As an adult I found it uncomfortable to sleep with because the feet are a higher profile so that the rail itself can slide into them and 'hide away'.  I did not have a comfy nights sleep with it installed.  However, this would be fine on a child's bed but should I ever need to purchase another bed rail, I would not select a 'hide away'.	
- 1	I guess other people found this helpful, which is why I registered for it.  But when I tried filing my newborn's nails, nothing happened. I think it would've taken ages to file her nails down with this.  On the flip side, it is very safe since accidentally filing my baby's finger won't hurt her.  This is one of those baby items I have never and will never use.	
- 1	Before you eye-roll, hear me out.The jumper, for the most part is made well.  However, as a previous customer mentioned, the adjustable strap is much too long - even for my petite infant.  Please read below for my issue with the factory quality:Also, (DID NOT REALIZE AT FIRST) the metal piece (picture a miniature dumbell)that holds the adjustable strap & seat the the upper spring & clamp, was not properly in place (from the factory).  For a while I couldn't figure out why the seat would always tilt to one side.  Then, after a month's use, I notice the plastic casing for the metal screw-like piece was dislodging from the upper section.  So I would wiggle it back in place, thinking my baby just had really strong legs.  Eventually, it became more difficult to finagle, so I took it down and throroughly inspected the thing.  Turns out the metal piece had complete dislodged from its section and somehow (from the vigorous jumpin I suppose) slid to one side.  I tried so hard to maneuver it back in place, but it was useless.  I stopped using the jumper, since it did not seam safe anymore.  I feel silly, not looking at things with a closer eye...because it could have been dangerous and if I cought the deffect early on, it would have been possible to replace.THE END	
1. 	As all us parents know, sippy cups are a very personal purchase.  Each kid seems to have his or her favorite brand / style.  My guy always liked Nuby, but he does fine with these as well, for the most part.Pros:-Easy to clean (machine washable)-Spills kept to a minimum-Lightweight-$5 for 4 - nice price!-My just-turned-3 year old likes these cups a lot-Withstands gnawing pretty well (much better than soft spout sippies)-Fits well in standard cup holders-Cute designsCons:-Top does not screw on, just presses on - so my guy can get the top off and then the liquid spills everywhere-Top can also pop off if thrown in a bag, so just be careful	
- 1	This is not an item that I would purchase or give as a gift, simply because it is a little bit pricey for what you get. It is small, yet still takes up a fair amount of space. The most expensive part is purchasing the batteries. Batteries don't last long and with a fussy baby you don't want to run out of them! This might be a good gift for a relative who only has the baby for a small amount of time, but not for every day use. If this were less expensive, then maybe it would be more of a consideration for me, but for the cost you can purchase something with an ac adapter that is more useful.	
- 1	I ordered this for our early teether thinking that maybe he could put it his mouth and would help his teeth and gums.  However upon recieving ..this thing is massive what baby could get this in their mouth?  I did not open and will be returning ASAP wast of money.	
1. 	We were using a high chair for some time, but when our toddler graduated to a booster seat we put our high chair in storage.  We do not use the tray attachment, but rather pull him up to the dining table with us.  Perfect for meal time or activity time, he loves it so much he even points to it to let us know its time to climb on in. Attaches to the chair in seconds with two simple snaps for the chair seat and chair back, makes removal for cleaning a snap.  The only draw back is that it has a non-slip butt portion which can be hard to clean.	
- 1	We had the Citi Mini jogger single stroller for my son, so when we had our daughter close in age and needed a double stroller we looked into upgrading with the same brand.  Unfortunately due to price, we decided to go with with the Baby Trend Sit & Stand since it fit our infant carseat and was 1/2 the price of the other stroller we wanted.  Big mistake - we should have just spent the money and got a decent stroller - the Sit & Stand is hard to maneuvre and is like driving a bus.  It also doesn't fold very compact, so even fitting it in the back of our SUV was tight.  Now we're having a 3rd baby and will be getting rid of this Baby Trend stroller to buy a quality jogger.	
1. 	First let me say that I love the online reviews on this site.  I use them all the time before making any major purchases and they have saved me a lot of money, time, and hassle.  I have written several of my own reviews on other products as well.  That being said, I have to say that I'm really very baffled by the reviews on this stroller.  We bought it after much consideration and test driving at our local BRU store the other night. I have to wonder if the stoller we bought is the same one that so many others have complained about!  The main issue seems to be the flimsy cardboard back.  Well, on the one we bought, the back is made up of what feels like 3 sturdy plastic panels that I tried to purposely bend and couldn't.  Perhaps the design was very recently changed, but in any event, ours is definately not cardbord or flimsy.  We have used it for 3 different outings and my 13 month old is happy as a clam in it.  He's fallen right to sleep in it 2 out of those 3 times.  As for storage, yes, storage space is limited, but we're not dealing with a travel system here.  This is an umbrella stroller, folks, and I've yet to come across any umbrella stroller regardless of brand or price that has a large storage space.  Same with the cupholder issue.  We simply bought one at BRU for 5.99 and it fits great.  Problem solved.  Bottom line, I went with my gut on this one and I'm so glad that I did.  This is a great umbrella stroller for those of you who are tired of lugging that bulky travel system everywhere and want something samller and easier to deal with.  Plus, this one comes with a raincover so you don't have to spend onother $20 to get one.  Don't be mislead by reviews saying that this is a bad sroller because it's not.  It's sturdy, easy to use, and does everything a high-end umbrella stroller should.  We love it.UPDATE 03/31/2006Ok, we've been using this stroller frequently for nearly 2 months now and I thought I would go ahead and update my review. It disheartens me to see that so many have had a problem with this stroller. I think what's happening is that there are still a few of the older ones floating around out there that have the flimsy backs on them. Chicco fixed that problem and the newer ones are great. The back on ours is very sturdy and we haven't had any problems with it at all. My son is almost 15 months and weighs just over 20 lbs and is still very comfortable in the stroller. He'll sit in it for long periods of time and never fusses. In fact, he usually falls asleep in it. My point is, many of these reviews are not based on the stroller as it is now. Check it out for yourself and you'll see. It's a great buy for $90.00! We've thrown away the box and receipt, since I have no reason or intention to return it!	
1. 	I have 2 of these hanging in my sons room. It's easy to put and holds a lot of stuff animals if you stack them right. Mine is used as storage. It's up high so my son has to ask for a particular animal and I get it downIt comes with 3 hooks and wall anchors if you want them. I personally didn't use them. Just the hooks by themselves work great. It's a little tiresome putting them into the wall because you have to twist them by hand, but it's great once it's done. I'd def recommend to friends..	
1. 	I haven't had a particularly hard time breast feeding, but it would have been impossible without these nipple shields!  When my nipples are tender or the baby gets to lazy to latch without it, they are so nice to have handy.  I took my own with me to the hospital when I first gave birth and I was SOOO glad because they said that they couldn't give me any there since they weren't properly trained in teaching me how to use them.  Ummm... you put it on your nipple and go for it.  Easy stuff.  Would die without it.	
- 1	I wanted to like this monitor- but this one most definitely stinks.  It is so quiet that even on the highest setting the baby is barely audible.  I would constantly have to check on him to make sure I wasn't missing his cries- which at that point defeats the purpose of the monitor.  If I happen to hear a faint something on the monitor I would have to tell everyone in the house to be quiet and stop everything everyone is doing just to hear if the baby is crying on the monitor.  I checked the manual- I was doing everything right.  Volume was turned on high - but the high setting on this monitor sounds like the low with any other monitor.  Don't get me wrong/ I'm not looking for rock concert loud- just high enough volume so I can hear the monitor next to me while quietly washing dishes.  I don't feel that is setting the bar that high....  Sent this one back and bought a Motorola one from babies r us and am MUCH happier.  No static and crystal clear- LOUD sound.  Now there is no doubt- I know if he is crying.	
1. 	Excellent product.  Simple to install and effectively ends all worries about my son accidentally choking on the rubber end of a typical door stop.	
1. 	We love this for background noise for our toddler to sleep with. He has had a ocean waves machine since the hospital where he was born, and I swear he sleeps better with it.  It has really helped us establish a great sleeping pattern with him, which means mom and dad sleep better.  I love that this one plugs in, our previous one worked on batteries which drove me nuts when they died in the wee morning hours and I would have to stumble in to replace them.  I only wish this had a better way to mount it on the wall out of playful fingers reach.	
- 1	This was something we bought to take our baby on vacation. It was okay depending on the type of chair you are using it with. We found it was just easier for one of us to hold him in our laps and that this was an unnecessary expense.	
- 1	If you plan on breastfeeding your baby I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend purchasing a My Brest Friend nursing pillow.  There is no support with a boppy pillow and if you are new to breastfeeding it can be quite a challenge. My baby often times would slip through and i'd have to hunch over to hold him up.  Its extremely uncomfortable and hard on your back and shoulders etc  etc.  Get the My brest friend..you won't regret it!	
1. 	We purchased this for our three year old.  We plan to keep it as a travel bed for her when we spend the night away from home.  To get her used to it, we set it up in the living room and she loved it instantly.  It's low enough to the ground that we don't worry about her falling out and is long enough for her to stretch out with plenty of room to spare.  It breaks down in seconds and it incredibly easy to put into the travel bag.  So glad we purchased this item.	
- 1	GREAT COLORS. THE BASSINET IS WEAK AND SWAYS IN THE MIDDLE. I ENDED UP PUTTING ABOUT A 4 PIECE OF FOAM UNDER THE BASSINET TO MAKE IT FLAT AND STABLE. THE ACTUAL PACK AND PLAY IS STURDY BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS VERSION.	
- 1	i got this for socks but it didn't hold much. it was a waste of money for me. also shriveled up in the wash and was a pain to not lose.	
1. 	Everywhere you turn, there is some sort of stimulation on this gym. My daughter (2 1/2 months) loves it! I especially like that one of the settings requires touch to start the music. She loves the mirror and the lights above.	
- 1	I am not sure if I received defective disks or not, but they had no smell at all.  I have used them for the past two months hoping they would at least remove odors, but so far I see no difference in the spaces I placed them in as before.  I put them in closets, a soccer bag, bottom of the dirty clothes basket and the changing table, and I really think they were a waist of time and money.	
1. 	These little bottles are surprisingly strong and light weight for what they are, which is a glass bottle.  While they can shatter, it takes a lot to get them there thanks to their compact build.  On top of that, you don't need to worry about BPA.The only problem with these bottles is that they have to be screwed down just right to allow airflow into the bottle and prevent baby from gulping air.  This can be solved with a nipple that Gerber puts out made of brown silicone that has a cross cut in the side of the nipple.  It's absolutely perfect for these little bottles.	
- 1	All in all it was my fault. When I read water resistant I assume they'd be the plastic ones that were easy to wipe off. They are not.	
1. 	My daughter (5 months old) has been exclusively breastfed since she was born because we've been unable to find a bottle that she likes-we tried Dr. Brown, evenflo, Gerber NUK, pretty much every kind we could find, and still no luck.  I thought we'd give these a try since the nipple is wide and short (more similar to the real thing) and she will now take a bottle! In addition to the nipple being good, they have the air reducer (attached to the bottom) that keeps her from getting gassy and helps keep the liquid in the bottle flowing smoothly without bubbling.  They come apart easily (into 4 pieces: nipple, bottle, bottom air vent, bottom ring to hold the air vent on) and are a lot easier to clean than some of the other types of bottles we've had that have a lot of smaller pieces.  This set comes with 3 bottles and 3 nipples. Overall, I'm VERY satisfied with these and would DEFINITELY recommend these bottles to any nipple picky baby!	
- 1	the bibs are too long for a 7 month old in a high chair !	
1. 	Before I became a mom, I thought I needed a huge bag but it turns out, I don't (not sure why).  This bag has lots of pockets, is well-made and is stylish so I know many moms would love this.  For me it's a hassle and barely fits in the basket in my stroller.	
1. 	Seriously... worth it! I purchased this after thinking about doing so for almost 2 weeks. I wish I wouldn't have waited. I hate spending so much on a piece of fabric but the first night I wrapped my daughter up she slept 5 hours straight. Seriously, for a breastfed baby at 4 weeks that was a lot of time! My daughter fusses for a good bit when I wrap her up (she really does hate having her arms trapped, especially if she isn't tired enough. But once I rock her or nurse her to sleep...she sleeps so much better swaddled up. I am hoping that after a bit of time she won't fight it so much. But, for now, watching her fight the swaddle for a bit is worth it when I know she will get some good sleep!	
1. 	This is an awesome hammock. My wife and I are so happy we purchased it. My daughter has tons of stuffed animals and we figured a hammock would work perfectly.  We are so happy we bought it. Highly recommend!	
- 1	I bought this because my baby was kicking up a storm and of course it looks adorable... the issues I have with it are 1) the mat is paper thin - no padding so you'd have to put it on carpet or a blanket, 2) the pieces don't connect well- the yellow arch never stays up and connected to the mat, and the forget the piano 3) inherently, your kiddo is laying down so if they actually kick the thing, they can't see it, 4) if you're thinking you'll just use it as an activity mat - again it's really thin and the toys are kinda boring...I just think if your babies like to kick, let them kick on their own and save your money for either a good activity mat or a fun little piano when they can sit up - the mixing of the two on this is really not well designed/well worth it.	
- 1	My husband is incredibly adept at putting the hardest stuff together, and while it only took him 2 hours to build this dresser, there are a million teeny, tiny parts to use. I would not suggest this item to anyone who sucks at putting together things, like I am.It's a really pretty dresser/change station, and matches our crib but the drawers are not solid wood, they are made of flimsy particle board. Boo on that. The wood itself is also pretty chip as there are dings and scratches in it just from shipping.I wouldn't have been disappointed looking at and maybe buying something else. There was one piece that was broken so we have to call and get that replaced. The changing table part doesn't fit a standard changing pad so that kind of sucks too.PROS- It looks prettyCONS- Cheap material, broken parts, hard to put together, changing table top is small.I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	Although this does take a little getting use to, this is a great sling.  I have used it with 2 babies from birth up to toddlerhood.  I love how it holds your newborn closer than regular front carriers.  Both of my daughters would instantly fall asleep.  I also like that it can be used to nurse discreetly. Some have complained about too much material and it being too long, but with a little adjusting and patience, it should fit any caregiver.  I used it on my toddler right up until my new daughter was born.  A great and affordable sling.  And Dr Sears is the expert!!!	
- 1	Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush.  I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in Thrush infested mouth.  This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink!  It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size.  Strangest thing I have ever seen.  Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.	
1. 	Bought these as a snack cup for my daughter. They work great for most snacks. We've had goldfish crackers, Gerber Graduates Puffs, cheez-its, and even animal crackers in these. They just don't work so well for cheerios.The silicone lids stay on reasonably well and are easy for children to reach their hands through and soft for sensitive baby skin. They won't stay on if you kids waves them about really wildly, but stay on better than I had expectedThe one draw back is that the fins of the lids don't completely touch leaving a very small opening. This is fine for most snacks, but cheerios are small enough to slip through with just a little shaking. Otherwise they work as intended and are great for snacking when the kid is on the move; especially in the stroller.	
- 1	I was sick of the suction cup holder type toy holders always falling off the wall, so I was excited to find this cute pelican! Excited until we used it. The mesh does not stay in place (falls out when we try to get the toys out) and it is way to big for our normal size tub (The picture lis very misleading in showing the mesh not touching the ground)So bummed this didn't work, I would return it had I not already thrown out the box!	
1. 	I'm using this pillow for about a week now and here's what I noticed.I'm at 27 weeks and my belly is not too big, but it still caused me a lot of trouble while sleeping. I had to spend about 10 minutes every night getting comfortable enough with all the pillows, and of course by the time I do (pretty much) I'd have to get up and go to the bathroom :)I now use the Snoogle pillow along with only 2(!) extra pillows and it does help.I'll skip the pros part as the other reviewers did a good job describing them. But here are the cons that could definetely be improved by the manufacturer:1. The seam that goes all the way on the inside curve of the pillow is very stiff when the pillow is stretched around your body. This is very uncomfortable as I usually feel it either on my shoulder, neck or the chest depending on the position I take.It is touching all those soft areas and feels almost like a cardboard across the skin.2. The fabric of the pillow is kind of rough and it is not too pleasant for the skin of the face. I am thinking about sewing the case out of the softer fabric, but it could be a little complicated because of the odd shape and the length of the pillow.3. The price. It has been mentioned before, that the pillow itself is very simple made, so I guess it's the idea that costs that much.All these items could probably be improved by the manufacturer so the product really does make a perfect pregnancy product.	
1. 	My daughter is almost 10 months and we've been using this since around 4 1/2 months.  It has definitely gotten some very good use and I don't see myself buying a different (better) booster anytime soon, but there are certainly some features about it that I hate.  Overall, for the price, you can't complain too much about it.Pros:- Three height adjustments to accommodate to baby's size/seating arrangement.  Easy to adjust.- Safety straps to secure baby in seat as well as secure seat to chair are easy to use.- Removable tray makes for easier clean up.- Small and great for travel.  We take this with us when visiting relatives' houses and it's perfect for that.Cons:- I hate the way the washable tray secures onto the base tray.  It's only secure in the back (closest to where baby sits), so my daughter can slip her fingers underneath the front part and pull at it (it doesn't lock or snap in the front, so it just sits loosely).  She hasn't figured out how to pull hard enough to remove it yet, but I foresee that being an issue later.- When you are removing the tray, it kind of just pops off violently no matter how careful you're being.  That means if your tray is full of liquid or food, prepare for it fly off all over the place.  Yes, I realize that wiping it up first helps, but that sort of defeats the purpose of a removable/dishwasher safe tray, no?- I don't like the securing locks for securing the tray to the chair.  As others have stated, you need to very VERY careful about baby fingers/hands getting in the way so as to not get pinched.  Easier said than done with a squirmy, cranky baby.  I avoid this by leaving the tray on the widest setting and slipping my daughter in/out behind it.  But she's small and this arrangement won't last forever.- I wish the straps were removable.  I'd love to throw them in the washing machine.  With all the food and liquid that spills all over, the straps are DISGUSTING.  Yes, I can hand-wash them and wipe them, but really, they could just use a good soaking and wash.  My daughter tries to grab the tails of the straps and put them in her mouth all the time.  So.  Gross.Like I said, for the price you can't really go wrong.  This is our only high chair in our home and we've been mostly happy for it and I don't see us needing anything else before our daughter is big enough to sit in a chair by herself.	
1. 	I got a Halo fleece sleepsack as a gift from my hospital when my son was born and as soon as I started using it, I immediately bought a second (because I don't like to do laundry everday!).  He sleeps so well in these, and I love that you can swaddle with both arms, 1 arm or have the child be hands free.  Plus, the designs are adorable!  Would highly recommend this product!	
- 1	My wife and I bought several of these onesies for our daughter, because they were amazing.  We ordered a new one and it arrived with very cheap and bulky plastic snaps.  The old ones had great metal snaps and were virtually perfect.  The change to the plastic snaps is a real deal breaker on this item, because they are so bulky that they will press into the baby's skin when she is on her tummy.  This item is expensive enough to warrant the good metal snaps.  But I imagine the manufacturer is trying to pinch pennies...but they've ruined their product by doing so.	
1. 	I was put on strict bedrest in the hospital when I was 18 weeks pregnant due to complications.  A twin-sized hospital bed is not very comfortable, especially when you're stuck in bed 24/7.  I had to lay on my left side the majority of the time, and I thought this pillow might help keep me positioned that way.  So, I ordered this pillow and my husband brought it to the hospital for me, and it was truly a lifesaver!  I spent just over 4 months literally living in the middle of this pillow.  It helped ease my lower back pain that I got from lying down all the time, and it did a great job keeping my on my left side, even when I was sleeping.  The pillow was also just so comfy to snuggle up against, especially since I couldn't be home to snuggle up next to my husband.  We found replacement covers for the pillow at [...]  The pillow itself did wear out in some areas, but considering I was laying in/on it all the time, that was to be expected, considering the frequency and length of time I used it.  Overall, I think this is a great pillow for any mom-to-be!	
1. 	This blanket is so soft and keeps my baby feeling secure. Only one is necessary because it adjusts with your baby's growth. My baby is 6 months old and we are still using it just to swaddle her bottom part. (Her arms stay out because she is so long) My baby has always been in the 90th percentile for her weight and off the charts on her heighth and the blanket still worked great for her. I will mention that I've recently noticed a little hole where the wraps are, but it's nothing we can't fix by sewing.	
1. 	This has been an absolute essential for my children. I initially tried a different swaddler and instantly gave up on the idea of these fancy swaddlers (it was totally useless). I'm glad I decided, on a whim, to give this one a try. It is perfect in every way! Easy enough to do in the middle of the night (night after night, sleep deprived) in the dark. I love how you can undo the bottom (for diaper changes) without totally unswaddling your little one.As my kids start to outgrow swaddling, I'd use this and attach the flaps under their arms (instead of over). Still provided that same comforting feel, but with the arms out. Helped ease them out of swaddling (which isn't easy). From that point on, we used Halo SleepSacks (also awesome).We live in a cold climate, and the Microfleece was nice. It would probably be too warm in a warmer climate, especially since we're told now that keeping babies cold decreases SIDS risk.Not every baby loves swaddling. But if your little one appreciates a good swaddle, this product is for you!	
1. 	These Medela Quick clean wipes are so wonderful for pumping on the road! I can use them to clean up all my parts if no water is available, and I can use them to wash my hands before pumping if I need to, also. They have come in really handy!	
1. 	The Diaper Dekor is the best. The refills last forever, it is totally simple to use and it really does not smell. We dump the diapers about once a week, and there is literally no smell within that time. After using other diaper pails with my older kids, I highly recommend this one.	
- 1	Whatever you do, do not buy a replacement cover for a body pillow unless it has a zipper.  Trying to get this pillowcase on is a nightmare.  I won't even do it.  If it weren't for the fact that my husband is willing to change it for me (reluctantly and always with a groan), I would either never change the case or I would just buy a new pillow.  Even if you overlook the major design flaw, the cover itself is poor quality.  It started fading and pilling after one wash.  For the cost of this cover, I expected much more.	
1. 	This is easy to use and easy to clean, I broke the plastic in the jar but that was my fault, it still works great!	
1. 	I had purchased the soothing dreams monitor ... and the sound quality was so bad I took it back.  This monitor doesn't have all the neat features that the soothing dreams did, but it does something the other didn't - it WORKS!  The sound quality is wonderful.  You can hear the faintest noise in the baby's room, or keep the volume down and just see the lights.  This monitor is really the best as far as sound quality goes, and the low price is definitely a bonus!  Don't waste your money on a monitor with more frills that doesn't work as well - this is all you need!!!	
- 1	looking for a slim car seat for our small car. The car seat is moving around after several installation. I do not feel comfortable letting me kid sit in it. had to return this product.	
- 1	Well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem, cause I mean when you buy it, you already know that! LOLMy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not. Every time I would put it on her, she would scream and beg me not to put it on. It was really heartbreaking. On the plus side, this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me LOLWe used it a couple of time and put it aside. She really hated it and I felt that it caused more tention than it is worth.	
1. 	These were a must have for about 4-5 months during teething.  They are absorbent, although sometimes did &#34;leak&#34; through, but that is user error for not changing out frequently enough.  The colors held strong after many washes and the velcro has held up well.  I tried to fasten the neck prior to washing to prolong velcro like and it seems to have worked.  I love the pretty colors and the great price.	
1. 	These trays are wonderful!  I began making my own baby food when my daughter was six months old.  You cook and puree the food, then fill the tray and freeze it.  The thick, rubber lid stays on the tray and does not pop off in the freezer like some other product lids (Baby Cubes in particular).  The food can then be popped out of the tray (like regular ice cubes) and placed into a zip-lock freezer bag for long-term frozen storage.  The product is durable and of high-quality.  I love using these trays as they hold a whole batch of food at one time.  Once I freeze the food and transfer it into a zip-lock bag, then I just pull out what I need (usually 1-2 cubes of food) for each feeding.  I then wash the trays and they are ready for the next batch of homemade food.  I have put everything from pureed and cooked pumpkin to spinach to fresh plums in these trays, and the food comes out tasting great every time!  I highly recommend these trays...you won't be disappointed!	
1. 	It's basically just a large, oddly shaped duffel bag. For the price it's still not bad, but don't expect anything special. There is no way to open it from the bottom as stated on the product page, but I don't understand how that would make packing easier anyways. There is a clip for the zipper which is nice in idea, but the loop from the zipper to the clip is a cheap, flimsy material that I can easily imagine tearing if caught on something. I'd be more comfortable with two zippers that I can lock together.I haven't used it yet, but will update after I fly in September.EDIT: trying to put the car seat in the bag in the airport while having to hold an 11-month-old in a carrier was a challenge. I was flying alone and in a hurry that I accidentally put the seat in the bag sideways. Oops. After the international flight and layover, the bag held up well except for one small tear that was actually caused from the car seat on the inside. I have a feeling it was caused by stress of the awkward placement. Otherwise it held up really well. I just wish the top was labeled and that the strap wouldn't get so much in the way.EDIT 2:I've currently gone through 4 flights with this bag and 4 more planned for this year. It's still awkward to put in, but I'm getting better at it the more I use it. Also, I haven't had any more damage aside from that small tear. It's surprisingly durable so far. Considering the other reviews about it tearing easily, I kinda expected it to be in shreds by now. Also, I have an Evenflo Tribute 5, if that makes any difference.Edit 3: I've gone through a grand total of 2 international transatlantic flights and 6 domestic flights (within the US) using this bag. It's great!!! Yeah, the design of the bag is a little difficult to work with, but it gets the job done. I haven't had any problems with any rips or tears since that first flight when I put the carseat in sideways. That tear (about the size of a quarter) hasn't caught on anything or gotten any larger. It's completely protected the carseat.  Also, the clip on the zipper has surprisingly held up really well.  The reviewers that had problems with it tearing easily probably should re-evaluate how they were using the bag and the type of car seat they were using. My son's carseat is a fairly standard convertible car seat with no accessories (like a cup holder). Also make sure the bottom of the carseat is in the wider end and either facing straight down or up, but definitely do not lay the carseat on its side inside of the bag. Because of how the bag is tapered, putting it in sideways will cause unnecessary stress and inevitably cause a tear. I have another international transatlantic flight coming up this fall and plan on continuing to use it for as long as possible.  I still wish the straps were placed farther down the side for better stability and to keep it out of the way when putting the carseat in, but I've gotten used to handling it.	
- 1	I ordered the beige with white spiral style, a nice neutral for my newborn girl and the decor of our home. What I received instead was a beige/khaki version with blue and brown squares, a completely different style--and obviously meant for a boy. Also--the entire product and especially the synthetic foam mattress and bolster inserts smelled intensely of chemicals. The inner base/frame (plastic) smells as well. Doesn't feel safe for newborns. If you purchase this, make sure you are able to leave it outside to off-gass for a couple weeks, and/or replace the cheap synthetic foam inner mattress with a Naturepedic small bassinet organic one. Someone should manufacture an organic, safe version of this item. I am returning it. No off-gassing toxins, which have been recently linked to SIDS, for my newborn.Update:Amazon sent a replacement for this item which did not have an odor anywhere near as strong as the first one we received. It still had some odor, and after airing it out for a week, we felt safe to use it, with a replacement Naturepedic natural mattress. Ironically, we ended up using it more as a travel changing table, instead of a sleeping nest, as once we got over our co-sleeping fears, we preferred to have her close to us and not in this bulky object. This item has a limited lifespan, as she had outgrown it by the time she was 12 weeks old.	
1. 	This is one of the essential products for every mom. I used it only for 1 month though, during the time my nipples were sore.It was a sanity saver.	
1. 	It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched.	
1. 	This is a great pail except for the heavy lid. Be careful when changing the bag so it doesn't come down on your hand. The seal did come out, but it does not affect the odor. This really does keep the smell in.With having twins, we change the bag every couple of days. I wish it was a little bigger.I do recommend this pail!!!	
- 1	I was an exclusive pumper as my baby wouldn't latch. Over time my supply started diminishing and I found the flangs for my medela pump uncomfortable. After hearing About these I thought they were my answer. They weren't. They were just as uncomfortable, even more so really.  Why not make these in silicone rather than hard plastic? I hope someone out there designs a flang for breast pumping that is comfortable.	
1. 	I definitely would recommend getting the table with this. By itself it is a good seat and it wasn't easy to for my daughter get out on her own. I still wouldn't recommend using it unsupervised.	
- 1	I wanted to like this monitor- but this one most definitely stinks.  It is so quiet that even on the highest setting the baby is barely audible.  I would constantly have to check on him to make sure I wasn't missing his cries- which at that point defeats the purpose of the monitor.  If I happen to hear a faint something on the monitor I would have to tell everyone in the house to be quiet and stop everything everyone is doing just to hear if the baby is crying on the monitor.  I checked the manual- I was doing everything right.  Volume was turned on high - but the high setting on this monitor sounds like the low with any other monitor.  Don't get me wrong/ I'm not looking for rock concert loud- just high enough volume so I can hear the monitor next to me while quietly washing dishes.  I don't feel that is setting the bar that high....  Sent this one back and bought a Motorola one from babies r us and am MUCH happier.  No static and crystal clear- LOUD sound.  Now there is no doubt- I know if he is crying.	
1. 	I first used this 8 years ago with my first child.  It was the recommended cheap pump.  I LOVED It and it was all I ever used.  So when I FINALLY got pregnant again, 7 years later, I purchased another one!  It's portable, durable, easy to use, quiet...the list goes on and on.  My hand does not get tired from pumping...it's a very easy and smooth action.  The extra bottle comes in handy.  This time around I was giving a Medela Pump in Style.  I love that and it is very fast, since you can do two sides at one time, but this is still in my arsenal.  It's way more compact, doesn't have all the tubing, and doesn't require a battery pack or power plug.  It's a great option if you don't need to pump every day or if you need a more portable option.  It's a great tool whether it's used as your only pump, or to add convenience and portability if you're using the larger electric pumps.	
1. 	Utilizing this showing the different ways to stack these - starting with big upside down and going upwards to the smallest then starting with the smallest and making each smaller one disappear with the next larger one!  FUN! THEN we put them inside each other starting with the largest - lots of ways to make his brain work.  One of the best toys that's educational/mind bending (at least for a 7 mos old), inexpensive and pvc free.  LOVE IT!	
1. 	I  am very pleased with this 4moms bath tub. The tub fits nicely into my double sink (you can use this in a single sink as well). It also comes with an adaptor if there are different sink heights. There are multiple drain's which so far have worked perfectly. Some reviews stated they leaked.. mine have not (yet) but even if they did, I'd still love this tub to use in the sink. My daughter is 3 months; and the tub is recommended 0-6 months. She doesn't play to much yet, but I felt the water level was just right. I absolutely love the thermometer and the clean water system in this tub. Sure, anyone can bath a baby in any type of bucket, tub or container. A bath is a bath... but this is a comfy one for mom and baby. My daughter slants a bit in the tub, but still quite safe and nothing one of those space mats can't fix (for a newborn I'd definately recommend one of those mats as they can really slip in) This tub is a step up because of the extra features that make it easier on mom or dad. A thermomer makes it easy to keep that comfy bath and not constantly check the water... its definately an extra visual aid and it changes color.. water is cold (blue), warm (green) or hot (red). The clean flow system definately helps keep babies water clean but constantly creating that flow of fresh water in one area, dumping to baby area, and then out.. and it does make a difference. I've tried 4 other tubs.. and this one tops them all. The first 3 I returned immediately after trying and retrying. The last I used for her first 2 months but wasn't fully pleased with it, but it did its job. All in all, this ones a keeper for me and I am pleased.	
1. 	Buying these lets me extend the life of all my son's sippys.  These valves make or break the sippy, so glad they were a resonable price.	
1. 	These fit both my Medela & Spectra Dew pumps.  My Medela is ancient - at least a decade old but the newer pump parts still fit it, so these go from the standard bottle size to fit the Avent bottles.I have both the super wide nipple Avent bottles as well as the classic size and these adapters fit fine.I also have the Avent Via storage system and the wider converter fits those just fine as well.I don't know what the other reviews mean about leaking.... I put the bottle caps on that come with the bottles & tops that fit the storage containers on as soon as I'm done pumping.  If my milk is nearing the top of the bottle/container while pumping, I switch out bottles.  But while pumping, I've experienced no leakage.	
- 1	The concept is great.  I was excited to start using this cup.  But it leaks like crazy when they try to drink from it.  So it defeats the purpose.  I wouldn't buy another one.	
- 1	I have three of the Munchkin Fresh Food FeedersMunchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Varythat I purchased to use when our first baby started asking to eat solids (there were no silicone versions at the time). They worked beautifully, but were a bear to get clean. The fabric mesh holds food particulate in the seams that was nigh impossible to remove completely.Enter the Clevafeed.Clevamama ClevafeedI love the silicone bag of the Clevafeed! This eliminates the food-buildup issue of the older style and is so easy to clean and sanitize. The silicone bag is also completely removable so that every little nook can be completely cleaned. Awesome! The original concept that allows and encourages babies to start trying solid foods in an improved and easy to clean design. I will buy more of these!Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!	
1. 	I own 3 of these and so glad I do.  They definitely do the job and then some.  I wouldn't put a car seat in my car without one of these.  Grey blends in well with our honda grey leather seats.	
- 1	My 5 month old son enjoys playing with this, but unfortunately, it doesn't stick well to the tray on his high chair. Whenever he pushes on it, it comes unstuck and is a lot less useful/fun. It sticks well to glass, but the main reason I purchased it was so that he could play with it when in his high chair. So, that's disappointing.	
1. 	My wife and I purchased this in preparation for the arrival of our son.  We knew that we needed something to protect the seat when we install his car seat so this set was the solution.  Thus far, it's done the job.	
- 1	You can certainly scoop an adequate amount of food with this spoon. However the handles, while useful for scooping from the Stage 3 babyfood jars, are long and narrow enough for baby/toddler to gag on when trying to feed self (minus 2 stars).  Another flaw is that they are only top-rack dishwasher safe; so unless you have the special plastic basket to put on your top rack, the spoons will fly around from the water pressure (and end up down on the heating coils, where it will melt, making the washer smelly, adding difficulty to clean the coils) or you will have to handwash them. Also, spoon's handle is top-heavy so you cannot let it sit in a regulary baby bowl, bc they will flop out and splatter food.Cute idea and durably made, just not practical enough for me.	
1. 	This seat fits in my kitchen sink, but just barely. Fortunately, it also fits perfectly in the Ikea Lattsam baby bathtub, if you don't have a sink that it will work with. The seat makes bath time much easier because you don't have to hold the baby up in the water. I put a washcloth down so that the baby's back isn't directly against the cold plastic, then put another washcloth over the baby's stomach to keep him warm. He will outgrow it pretty quickly, but it is inexpensive and works really well.	
- 1	We have used two Summer Infant monitors and this Motorola. We feel strongly that Summer Infant is far better. This one looks more high tech and it does have the option of a camera that moves and intercom feature. However, what it lacks in other features and overall quality makes those features seem like small potatoes. First of all, the video feed is choppy at best. If you wave your hand in front of the monitor you will see it freeze about every two seconds. That's how the video feed is ALWAYS. I don't like that. With the Summer Infant I could literally watch my daughter's chest rise and fall because it was a smooth, real time, continuous video. This is not true of Motorola. Beyond this, the monitor buttons are awful and not designed for use in the dark. On the Summer Infant one, when the screen goes black there is a large button on top of the monitor that you just push and the picture returns. Think snooze button on the alarm clock big -- easy to find and hit in the dark. The Motoroloa button is a tiny button second from the bottom on the right. Yeah -- not helpful at all. Beyond this, the darn thing beeps when the battery is getting low. Obviously Motorola engineers did not consider the fact that for several months or longer many babies sleep in their parents' room and when baby is fussing or making noise it's nice to look at the monitor instead of getting up and going over to stand by the crib, possibly waking the baby with a creaky floor board or rustling around. The beeping wakes the baby! It also beeps randomly for some other reason which I will have to refer to the manual to figure out. It has a green light that flashes next to the on light when this beeping is going on. The screen is super bright too which is bad for having a baby in the room since the light illuminats the room and also shocks your eyes when you first turn it on. Last but not least, it interferes with both our Wifi and our other baby monitor that sits next to it. It's just not a smart design overall. I shoud have heeded other reviews about the lack of thought the engineers put into the design.I wish we had opened this monitor and used it for a few nights before our second daughter arrived. We would have returned it within the allowable time and bought another Summer Infant one. We were drawn in by the moving camera and two way talk features but I'd gladly give those up for a monitor that is intuitive and just works better.	
- 1	Cumbersome, too light to stick in one place even with anchor, no instructions. Don't know if there are better ones out there.	
1. 	I love the stroller frame. We have a great Jeep 3-wheel stroller that the carseat will attach to but it is a bit big and bulky for everyday use. Plus it doesn't fit in the trunk of my car. This stroller frame pops right in the trunk and is super lightweight. The carseat snaps securely onto it and the basket underneath can even be used for shopping if you're just picking up a couple things. It is also very easy to turn and maneuver even in tight spaces. It's a must-have.	
1. 	This pad is fairly large at about 27 in. x 36 in.  The natural-colored plain-weave muslin organic cotton top is quilted in a Moroccan tile pattern.  The padding is polyester and the soft water-resistant backing is polyurethane-coated polyester.  The edges are serged.The pad can be washed and dried at cool temperatures with non-chlorine bleach only although I have washed it in hot water and didn&#8217;t notice any shrinkage or damage.It is very absorbent and will soak up a cup of water without any leak-through.  It is comfortable and large enough to be used not just for changing diapers or for a waterproof barrier in a bed, but also as a bed or carrier liner for pets or as a clean and soft surface for play- or nap-time for infants.  It can even provide protection for an upholstered chair when needed.A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.	
1. 	I've been making my own baby food for a couple of months now and recently purchased these BabySteps freezer trays and love them! I started using a regular ice cube tray (and still do, although I'd like to get another set of these) and find that the BabyStep trays are easier to fill, stack beautifully, and since they have a (nicely fitting) cover, there's no messing with plastic bags and rubber bands to cover for freezing.Several reviews here mention that they are very stiff and it's hard to get the cubes out. The plastic is sturdy (and I like that) but I notice no difference between the ease of popping food cubes out of these vs. regular ice cube trays - frozen food is hard to pop out, that's just a fact. All you have to do is run a little water over the back side for a few seconds, then turn them out with a little tap/twist/shake - I do the same thing with my regular ice cube trays. They also clean up beautifully and quickly (and are dishwasher safe).Another great thing about these trays is that they are BPA/Phthalate free. This is important to me.Note that on the KidCo website (makers of these trays) they state that each section is approximately 1 ounce - not 2 ounces as mentioned in some reviews here and in one of the product descriptions here on amazon.	
1. 	This pad is wonderful!  The pad fits perfectly in the crib and stays nice and flat on the sheet.  So far, nothing has gotten through this pad.  It is much easier to take off and wash than the crib sheet is, making it a real time-saver and back-saver.  I actually bought an extra one and cut it up into 1.5 by 2 ft pieces and use them on my changing table.  They do sell changing table sized, but I found I got more for my money by using this larger one and cutting it to size.  The pad is reversible, and the back side of this pad is white.  If the polka-dots don't fit into your nursery decor, the white will probably go just fine.	
- 1	This was my favorite bag until the zipper broke off!! We had it about 6 months before it happened and I really don't want to pay another 20bucks for it to happen again. It was the perfect size and masked all odor. I am very disappointed to say goodbye to this one!	
1. 	This pillow was incredible during the later stages of pregnancy.  There are so many different positions you can use it to get comfortable in.  It provided the belly support I was looking for and gave me relief for my hips (which had begun to ache badly from only being able to sleep on my sides).In regards to the seam: I don't know if there was a slight re-design or not.  The seam is still in the same place but I have never had any issues with it...I have never felt it while choosing a position and it has never caused me to wake up out of sleep.The best part is my husband snuggles the opposite side so we can still be close while sleeping.  He says its super comfortable too!  I'm very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	Highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding.  It's clears the nipple confusion instantly.	
1. 	Both of my kids adored this play gym. Out of all of them I've seen this is by far the best well made one. The colors, music, and toys kept my kids entertained for a very long time.	
- 1	It works just like it should but I never loved it. Maybe it is just me but I felt like I needed both hands to open and push the diaper down through the narrow opening.  Squeezing poop filled diapers through there is scary by the way.  It was odor free for the first few months and then it got rotten!  I replaced the powder but that didn't help and the room started to stink.  I added an air freshener and that didn't help much.  I felt like I was changing the bag every two days.  I decided to try a small lid trash can with a foot petal.  Loving it!  I know I will probably need to change it every few days too but so far....it is hands free to open, there is only smell when I need to drop in a diaper, baby hasn't found it yet, takes up less room, uses grocery bags instead of special bags and was cheaper than the pail.  Wish I had saved the money and went with a trash can to start.  It might work great for some but only lasted us about a year.	
1. 	As they should be. They work and have all the necessary features. Really not that much to say about them.	
1. 	I bought these for use on a camping trip and ended up reusing most of them despite my intent to use them as disposables. Now I keep a few extras in the car, diaper bag, etc. for when I inevitably forget a regular spoon.They're the perfect size for little mouths and great to swap in when someone wants to just teethe on the spoon instead of eating. (My other spoons have metal handles.)Also, the handles are easier for ME to hold than the flat metal ones - the contours give me a better grip.We're starting to try to get her to feed herself and I'm offering her these and the toddler-sized take-and-toss spoons to use. So far? Messy but fun. ;)	
1. 	We bought this to use in our room to make night time nursing easier but this could easily be a full time crib until I'd say about 18 months then it might be a little small.  It's very sturdy, the finish is nice, and it arrived in excellent condition.  I did buy another mattress for it but am using the foam mattress that came with it in the bottom of the pack n play.  This is the same size as a pack n play and you can use your pack n play sheets.	
1. 	These nipples are wonderful and fit any standard size bottle.  They were perfect for my baby girl when she got about 5-6 months when she needed a faster flow and also work well for thicker drinks (for example, if you're adding a little rice cereal to the milk).  They're well made, and a good price.  Dont waste your money on generic standard nipples, you'll get your moneys worth for these.  I also like that if you look closely at the bottom of the nipple, each one has the flow level marked, so you know which one you're using... like I said you'd def. want this for thicker liquids, However, you'll want Dr.Brown's Y cut for older babies that are drinking very thick liquids, like smoothies.	
1. 	I love this seat! I started using it for my baby when she was around 8 weeks old. She loved being able to sit up and see the world from a different angle.The material wipes clean easily and the seat is well made. I have taken it with me on several trips because it is lightweight and compact enough to not take up too much space.My daughter is 15 months now, about 22 pounds and has just recently started to outgrow it.	
- 1	I wanted to upgrade from my old baby monitor and was optimistic that D-Link's use of &#34;the cloud&#34; would provide a truly mobile system. Unfortunately, attempting to use D-Link Wifi Day/Night Baby Camera with Remote has proven to be a painfully frustrating experience.The build quality seems good, with a cute and friendly design. Unfortunately, none of its attractive features make a difference when the camera has a tendency to shut off/reset itself within the first few minutes of use.The D-Link Wifi Baby Camera's greatest downfall is its software. The app needed to operate this device is very slow and definitely not user-friendly. Even after a multi-hour setup process (including a number of false-starts and resets), many features don't work well through &#34;the cloud&#34; or at all. This includes talking to your baby, activating lullabies, etc. The feed also tends to lag dramatically.At the times I was able to get the camera briefly working, the range was only about 15-20 feet (common with standard, much cheaper baby monitors). It is upsetting to think of all the wasted time spent trying to get the app to work right. I now regret having to set-up a D-Link account (which is mandatory) that gives an outside entity access to my phone as well as a camera that is currently still connected to our router.I can only hope that iPhone/iPad users are not experiencing similar difficulties. As an Android user, I cannot recommend this item in its current state to others intending to use the Android version of the software.	
1. 	When I was pregnant with my first set of twins I felt that I could handle EVERYTHING. (i.e no exersaucer to babysit, not bouncers, no ridiculous toys, no uneeded baby products, and yeah, no sterelizer). Well my husband said we needed most of the stuff I said we didnt. But he let me be stuborn and didnt purchase the sterelizer. Well after 2 1/2 years of boiling bottles, pacifiers, teethers and all that other stuff, I was going crazy. Yet I still wouldnt admit it to my husband :). When the second set of twins were on the way, I was ready. I was going to buy baby wipes warmers, exersaucers, bouncers, swings, the aquarium crib soother and this sterelizer. Well this sterelizer is my hero (as well as my husband who forced me to get one!). It cleans about 6 bottles and all of the things that come with them. (actually it cleans 5 of the playtex airvent ones, but I use avent too). I did breast feed so it also cleans avent pumps (and my friend managed to get another kind in one!). My kids love pacifires so those are constantly in there, and so are all those teething rings. Let me just tell you that you can NOT put a dirty item in here, you still have to wash it a bit. This just makes sure its really clean, (my kids have maybe been sick 5-6 times, all four of them put together!) This sterelizer is great, and it uses very little water (I have a purifier so I use pure water). like another reviewer I HIGHLY RECOMEND TO UNPLUG IT WHEN NOT IN USE! I will say it again, after boiling bottles and sippy cups and pacifires and teethers all night, REGISTER FOR THIS! ITs a bit pricey but I can gaurentee that replacements for the bottles that you disintigrated while boiling and sleeping at the same time, and doctor visits and medicine for those odd illnesses due to unsanitary things that your child(ren) place in their mouth, will cost you more!*** P.S... IT MAKES A GREAT DRYING RACK TOO!	
1. 	I just had twins...so I've been trying to find ways to find time.  I got two of these pillows.  I can put a baby in each to bottle feed, and pump at the same time.  These pillows are great!  And it's great that they are made in the USA!	
1. 	I like this but my baby is not to fond of the vibration. Cute chair, lets him lay or sit and it rocks.	
1. 	I would recommend this product. This elephant has provided many hours of enjoyment for my grand daughter. It is sturdy and she loves the musical sounds that go off when she puts the balls into the elephant's head. I love it because it is not too loud. She is creative with the rings--putting them on her arms like bracelets.	
- 1	These companies should really stop marketing these cups as &#34;leak-proof&#34;. I have yet to find one that doesn't leak. My son flips this cup over and it has a pretty steady drip to it.	
1. 	These soft breast shields are good and fit nicely on your breasts.  If you use the pump alot, however, the parts tend to wear out a bit.  (Just like anything else) They may get deformed if you place in the steam bags Medela provides, so I would recommend handwashing in hot water.  I bought two, so that I wasn't washing the parts all the time.	
1. 	Love that I found this.  They don't make these any more, but I needed this base for the grandparents cars.	
1. 	I love it, and a lot of people keeps asking me where did i get it. My 2 year old and i've had used these untill a couple of months ago, she's getting heavier for my back, but i still have it on hand in the closet in case i need to go some place where the stroller would be a hassle and i'd need to have my hands free.	
1. 	This is a great thing to have.  I've used it right from the beginning.  She is a squirmy baby and it helps keep her in one spot and gives me a piece of mind during the night.  Also, because the sides are velcro, I can reposition them to make them wider as she grows and put her on her side for daytime naps.  Easy to clean as well, goes right into the washing machine.	
1. 	My 9 month old loves this toy.  It feels good on his gums when he is teething and it keeps his attention as he bends and moves it.  I like that I can wash it in the sink too to disinfect it.	
1. 	I love this tub. We have used it for 8 months now. (we have a very small water tank that wouldn't fill the tub with enough warm water, which is being replaced as we speak...)The net hammock used as a newborn is great. Cradles baby very securely, but still allows baby to remain in water so she's not cold.The two sided option is great! My daughter used the reclined side with plenty of room for her little feet to kick until she could sit on her own. She is able to soak in enough water to keep her warm and enjoy with no worries of her slipping too far down into the water.We still use that side durring wash time, although she sits straight up and plays with her ducky now. I find it easier to wash all around her with her sitting up on the reclined side (she's more centered in the tub that way). I then turn her around to the toddler side for play time after. She then has lots of play area in front of her to splash and play with her ducky (which I can't pry from her little hand when she's in there!)The ducky has a hot indicator on the underside of it, but really, no matter how luke-warm the water is, it always says hot so we just gage with touch (as you always should) and ducky is just her favorite tub toy!I use my tub inside the bathroom tub so that she can splash and play without any worries of a mess or of falling over or out.The padding on the inside is just enough to keep her comfortable and safe from slipping. It is very light and inexpensive.I was initially dissapointed I did not buy one of the new tubs with a shower. And, although it's a great idea, when I tried out a girlfriend's tub with the shower I didn't find it to be as designed to hold the baby as well. My daughter was 4 months at the time, and was too big for the net (her legs had no where to fit) but this other tub had no recline option, just plain basin tub, which was difficult because she could not yet sit, which ended up being very difficult to hold her upright at all times while trying to wash. I was also dissapointed with the shower as it was diffucult to keep running and was not more then a few trickles.Perhaps if they improve upon the shower tub design, or make a better shower we could have the best of both worlds. Until then, hands down, Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub has my vote!	
- 1	The underside of the tray has ridges. My son would get excited and kick his feet against them, causing redness and bruising. The underside of the tray is all mechanism and nothing kid safe. I have to buy something else.I think this issue may have been addressed in the new model. Theyve redesigned the underside I think...	
- 1	When i discovered this product last year before my son  was born i thought that i would have all bases covered but he just does not like this at all. It could be that he never used a pacifier and this is in that shape but he wont stand for it at all.He is using the Zo-li for his molars and he can freely manipulate it and he loves it.See my review for that product	
1. 	The Halo swaddles were my favorite. We used the fleece and cotton versions until my daughter could roll over.  I wish we could still use them!  :)  Love the fleece for those cooler nights.	
- 1	Given all the high reviews, I bought these spoons along with the Munchkin ones, thinking these would be so much better. Our little one doesn't like these at all. The rubber part over the spoon isn't smooth, it's a little bumpy, and she hates the texture. From my perspective, the spoon is way too shallow to get any reasonable amount of foot into/onto it. I'm really bummed we bought these. My advice is to try the Munchkin ones first (they're great!).	
1. 	These are great little sippy cups.  These were the only ones my toddler would use for a while when we were weaning him off of his bottle.  I think he likes the handles on them.  These also seem to be pretty strong - my son loves to throw them on the floor from his high chair, and they have held up nicely.  Other sippy cups have cracked and broken under the same treatment.	
1. 	I have long been a fan of the (more expensive) Snap Traps, so I was glad to come across this version.  These aren't only great for keeping spills off the floor at home, but I would also attach them to the stroller, car seat, shopping seat cover, etc for snacks when we're out and about.	
1. 	I have used these trays to freeze pureed baby food for my daughter.  I love that this product has a lid.  I haven't had any problems with freezer burn, but I take the food out once it's thawed and put it in a freezer bag so I can reuse the trays.  My only complaint is that the trays are a little bit small for the amount my daughter eats now.  They would have been great for when she was smaller, but she eats more now.  I thaw the cubes overnight in another container, and two cubes won't fit in the other containers that I use.  That's not the fault of this product, just of my system, but it would be nice if the cubes were a little larger.  Overall, though, great product!	
1. 	These scissors are well designed for an infant. The blades are very short which makes it very safe to use. It gives new mothers the confidence to trim babies' nails even if they fuss! This is my third gift purchase.	
1. 	Used this swaddler until my son was about 3 months old. I wish they made them larger, because I would still swaddle him if I could. Loved this swaddler. He could eventually wiggle out of it, but I learned to do it really tight, so it took a while. But he loved it, and after a while, calmed down as soon as I put him in it.Really sad he outgrew it.	
1. 	My Anna Banana loves to shop with Anna Banana.  I can stick her on the cart and it's a great distraction as I get the things on my list.  She also likes playing peek-a-boo with the peels.	
- 1	This doesn't work with outlets that have one screw on top and one on bottom-- it only works for outlets that use one single screw, in the middle between where the two plugs go. The description really should have stated this, because I ordered one for every outlet in my house that my twins can access, and now I can't use them. I also can't return them because I ordered them before we needed them, and didn't think to check on something like this, and it was months before my twins started to crawl and we needed them, and so the return window has passed. Also, the cord shortener is a joke. I had one single outlet in my house that used one screw in the middle, and on it, the cord shortener only shortened a standard lamp cord a few inches. There wasn't room for more cord, and there would certainly never be room for two cords.	
- 1	I'd say don't waste your time.  Just buy the adjustable covers from Thirsties or Blueberry.  They are more worth the money.	
- 1	Looks cute and colorful.  Brush is not bad. Comb bristles are way thin/sharp/hard for adults, let alone a baby.  Will be returning the set.	
- 1	WHAT HAPPENED TO ORBIT BABY?I have owned an Orbit Baby G2 Travel System and have enjoyed it's thoughtful design, smooth operation, and fancy fabric materials used. The price they commanded then fully warrants it.Now on it's third revision, this is technically the first product release since they have been acquired by ErgoBaby - a company I also patronize with their organic baby carriers.WHAT CHANGED?For one, the fabric. It's now thicker and rougher. The tactile feel makes is not elegant to the touch. The previous G2 is sleek and smooth.Second, the retractable plastic mechanism has an operation that isn't smooth. It's obviously just a simple plastic teeth with a spring underneath that operation and you have to pull harder to extend the sunshade. This is nitpicking, of course, but for this price I expect the smoothest operation possible even if they have to make use of ball bearings and magnets. Again, at this price.Third, although I've accepted the fact that colors on websites are not as accurate in person but when my Blueberry sunshade arrived it was lighter in hue than a dark blueberry/purplish expectation.Fourth and the most important is washability. It used to be I can unhook the whole sunshade fabric away from it's plastic support for easy washing via zippers. Now the sunshade is sewn into the plastic support so if you have to wash it (and the manual for the G3 doesn't state how to wash it versus the manual for the G2 model that readily discloses it) you have to wash the whole fabric and it's support system and hope there is nothing in there that rusts in time. Okay, you can disassemble the plastic support, but you'll need to force the tabs with a screwdriver and hope the plastic doesn't break or wear over time. Again, the manual doesn't disclose this so I don't know how much support they will provide going this route. t wish they made it easy to remove just like in the G2 model.SO WHAT ARE THE FEATURES DEBBIE DOWNER?Okay, same as before this latest sunshade is rated to UPF50+.The fabric, like all Orbit Baby fabrics, is certified by Oeko-Tex standard to be healthy and clean for your baby.Another plus is that you customize your stroller sunshade from the get go without Orbit Baby having to force a basic color. When you purchase the G3 Stroller Seat, it now doesn't come with a sunshade. The price is less than the G2 Stroller Seat exactly the same amount as the cost of the sunshade. So make sure to buy a sunshade to go along with your Orbit Baby G3 stroller purchase. You don't have to stick with black. I have the Black, Blueberry and Teal colors. At the rate we stroll around the Downtown city, it's easier to wash the sunshade and switch colors while the other dry up.OVERALLI can only wish ErgoBaby with their purchase of Orbit Baby would go back to the roots of why Orbit Baby became known. Yes, they stuck with the killer design that will make modern parents and especially Dads proud to push a stroller around.But they also made the construction too basic and retained the high price that it seems unbelievable for previous Orbit Baby owners like myself to see the changes that is making it look and feel cheap.I would have expected for this G3 version, they made a peek-a-boo window so you can still see your baby when he/she is forward facing. My umbrella stroller has this feature. A full size stroller should have this as well as a no-brainer option especially at this price.For first time Orbit Baby owners, of course they wouldn't know the difference of what changed and how the change in ownership affected this third revision.By the way this fabric fits the G2 strollers, but with the close out pricing of the G2 accessories and the better material of the G2 I would not recommend getting this G3 sunshade for your G2 stroller at all.Hoping that the G4 revision will bring Orbit Baby back to it's roots.	
- 1	I got this pump while my baby was on a nursing strike, and it helped me when I was engorged but even then it wasn't a whiz and now that I'm back to normal, it hardly works at all. The last time I used it (so I could have a night out) it took me 3 attempts and over an hour of combined efforts to get 4 oz of milk (wouldn't you know, she only drank 1/2 ounce.) Even when I would finally get a let down, the action/suction wasn't enough to keep it going. Also, I couldn't get the message cushion to work for me at all. The instructions say to assemble the pump while wet to improve the seal on the cushion and &quot;diaphram&quot;, but that still didn't help. It would stay sealed for a couple pumps, then unseal and seal again--off and on. Very frustrating to deal with--makes it hard to relax like you need to. Plus, when you realize how many cycles the hospital pumps go through to get however much milk, that's a lot of squeezing, which is also not relaxing. I was very pleased w/ the pump I used while in the hospital and am looking very seriously at buying the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump (as low as $140 in online searches.)	
1. 	My 7 month old loves this thing and loves chewing on it.  Also it washes really well in the washing machine.  Not every baby loves every toy, but if you get it cheap enough it is nice to try.  It is an eco friendly product that I do not have to worry about my son chewing on it.  We have now moved on and have Mr Banana and Mr Carrot as well.  He loves them all.	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these and washed them numerous times  in a 3 week period and they are like new.	
1. 	I purchased one for my twins.... I plan to purchase another. The size is great, it can hold a lot of toys. The pockets on the side actually can hold books well. The bag with handles inside is prefect. I actually have it out with all my kids blocks and it adds more space in the toy bin. I don't close the top, I have it bent back and so far if I try to close it it works fine (hasn't reshaped to being bent back). The little toy mat that folds down in the front is a nice feature. My twins don't actually us it to play but I have hardwood floors so it adds a little extra padding. The best part for me is safety. My twins know how to get in and out of this but never get hurt because it's not wood or hard plastic. They also run around a lot and I don't have to worry about them bumping into this and getting hurt. And last it is extremely easy to set up and down. Takes seconds. In my opinion if you were going on vacation it's prefect to bring since it folds flat.	
1. 	I love having extra parts it making using the pump that much easier. They fit great and arrived in record time.	
1. 	This is a great book for people who want a nice, normal baby book, without tons of cutesy things.  You can add stamps/crafts/stickers/etc to get a similar look, as I did on a few pages.  I also like that each page is removable, so you can reorder things, remove pages you don't need, etc.  We decided to use the many picture pages with lines on the side for a monthly picture and things that happened that month.  Much easier to rearrange as we'd like to do this and not need the firsts pages.  For pages I didn't use, I put craft paper over them to cover the headings and made it something else.I also like how they have a variety of other books, so I bought a similar book but different cover for my 2nd one.	
1. 	This high chair is great.  My son is a little over 6 months old and we've been using it for about a month now.  It attaches easily to your standard kitchen chair - but the straps are long enough to even attach to a bulkier dinning room chair if needed.  It is very stable.  My son is quite tall/big for his age and we've had no problems with stability at all.  It comes with a 5 point harness - but we only use the three.  I love how it can be adjusted to tilt to multiple levels.  It's also very easy to clean.  My son is a spitter as they call them and has a very slight gag reflex.  So if a little bit of cereal goes down the wrong pipe or he catches some extra air with a bite of squash then all it takes is a couple good coughs and all of dinner is up and all over the place!  Granted I can't wait until he's over this stage, but until then I need a chair that is easy to clean and this one is!  The cover and the straps come off very easily.  I just take it all over to the sink, hose it off and hang dry it on a drying rack.  I've never tried washing it in the machine.  This routine occurs a couple times a week and I can have it all apart and back on in under a minute.  I would definitely buy this again, especially since your child can use it through the toddler years.	
1. 	You don't see that too often!  These are great stackers. We have a few varieties of them but these are our favorite. They are pretty sturdy.	
1. 	A set came with my original pump but they melted a bit during sterilization so I ordered new when I had my second baby.  I pumped A LOT (make or buy yourself a hands free pumping bra, Mums!) FT working Mom and second baby had reflux and didn't nurse well.  One lesson I learned is that you buy the shields for your nipple size, not your breast size.  I bought larger shields thinking I would need them being well endowed, but they were painful.  Turns out big boobs don't mean big nipples and the standard shields were prefect for me.  The soft plastic in this set provides extra comfort that the solid shields do not.  I used both, but these were better.	
- 1	My son used this once and its already broken.  Doesn't work as well as other reviews.  Too bad.	
- 1	The case material is soft, but it doesn't look very nice once on the pillow. the opening is very loose looking - would be nice if it overlapped - looks sloppy and cheap	
1. 	I purchased 2 of these, one for my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law's home as they are beginning the potty-training task with our grandson.  Although he is still too young to be able to handle climbing on this by himself, having it around the home now will get him familiar with the item and what its use is for.  I purchased all of the potty training items now for both homes so our grandson will become comfortable with them at both homes and learn what he needs to do at both homes too.  This step is very well made, sturdy, and doesn't have any sharp edges to hurt the little ones.  The top is slip-proof and has a rubber strip on the bottom to keep it from slipping on tile and wood floors as well.  Highly recommend.	
1. 	This is an awesome item!  It helped my colicky baby sleep much better!  Now that she is over the colic, she still loves the swaddle me blankets.  It works so much better than swaddling in a regular receiving blanket, because she can't squirm out of it.  She is very fidgety and therefore wakes herself up a lot if she is not in her swaddle me blankie.  She wakes up several times during the night without this, but when she is swaddled in her swaddle me, she sleeps 8 to 10 hours, and she is five months old!  It's a wonderful product and I don't know what we would do without it.	
1. 	Ok, I own a diaper genie and this pail as well. I used to use a regular can for wet diapers, and the genie for the poopy diapers, and it worked fine -until my baby was old enough to start messing with the trash can. At that point, I needed a locked pail, and bought this for wet diapers only. It worked great for that purpose. Then my second baby was born and I started using it for all of the young babies diapers. Again, not too bad, but no it does NOT work as well as the genie. However, the big pro to this pail is that you do not HAVE to buy the refills. I actually did buy the refills a couple of times, but came to hate them because when they run out they wouldn't always obviously stop like the genie and on more than one occasion I went to empty the pail to find a collapsed bag with a bunch of loose dirty diapers inside. Boy did that make me mad. Now, I simply use cheap 13 gallon kitchen size trash bags (or medium size would work also I believe) and it's very easy to fit them in this pail...tuck it around the top ridge and it won't collapse and it's cheaper than using genie replacements (it holds more than a genie too).In summary, if you buy one pail only, the genie is still the best, you just have to suck up the cost of refills. This makes a great secondary pail for wet diapers. I might also buy a second of THIS pail to keep downstairs for the few diapers we change down there, and to ensure the dogs don't get in the trash which happened a time or two. This is a good light use pail with flexible bag options, so for that I give 4 stars.	
- 1	I read this in a lot of places, this seat is VERY hard to install even when it works.  Originally installed in a 2003 Jetta, and after a struggle got it in.  We just got a Mini Cooper CountryMan, and it was pretty much impossible to install, unsafe even driving the car.  Fought with it for hours and could never even get it slightly stable standing still.  Swapped with my Britax Boulevard that went in really really easy.  Put it in my 2000 BMW 540ia (no latch) and its in, but wabblier than heck, boulevard was easy to install there too.Nice seat, easier to get child in and out of, but if you have bucket seats, forget it, unusable, and even with normal seats, you will have an extremely hard time putting this seat in.	
- 1	Nice product and concept, although we only used it for 2 weeks before it quit working.  Started to leak and just wouldn't heat up our bottles.  The bottle itself would be hot but the contents would still be cold.  Never tried to use the cooler.  Was using Dr. Brown bottles in it.	
- 1	I ordered these for my diaper hamper (we use cloth diapers) hoping they would absorb or at least mask the smell. It does neither. Disappointed. Don't waste your money on these.	
1. 	The bottles come with the fast flow nipples but using the slowest flow your baby will tolerate is best so your baby can more easily gauge when the are full instead of just guzzling it down. This is a skill that's very useful later in life to help prevent obesity (eating slowly so your body can tell you it's full before you over eat). Additionally, breastfeed babies do better with slow flow as they're used to on trolling the flow of milk and this is an easier transition for them.	
- 1	UPDATE 9/24/11: I have had to exchange this item twice since starting to use it in early July. The bouncer seems to work for about a month, but then, suddenly,  the vibration stops working after approximately 30 seconds of turning it on. I loved this bouncer, but have given up on exchanging the item. I just returned it for the last time and will be purchasing a different bouner.5/16/11: They have 2 other bouncenetts that look similar, but neither one has the bounce in the seat (only the virbation). Make sure to pay close attention to what the seat does before purchasing in order to make ensure you get the seat you want. This was exactly what we wanted because it can vibrate when the baby is too young to bounce and it can bounce as the baby acquires that ability. Additionally, the mobile is detachable, so it can be on or off depending on the situation or age of baby. Very soft material, detachable seat cover for washing, not too large overall.Complaint: the assembly directions aren't great in respect to step #6. There are these small latch-like items that attach to the metal frame (I assume to keep the bouncer in tact), but the directions for attaching them and the picture to follow is horrible. I am really good with assembly and this step was horribly explained. Since every step in most baby items is crucial, making sure the customer understands the assembly should be top priority.	
- 1	My baby's skin reacts to the fabric in the hook and loop part of this diaper. I have a bunch of diapers that I need to sell or give away now because I prepped them first. :-/Soooo don't prep more than 1 before you know if your baby reacts!	
- 1	I put hot porridge in here and within an hour the porridge turned cold, not cool, but cold. 2 stars for not leaking.	
- 1	It stopped working the second time I used it. I work from home, so I don't have to pump often, so I decided to stick with the free manual pump I received at the birthing center rather than try a replacement. Fewer things go wrong with fewer parts.I was given a refund quickly without any problems.	
- 1	Where do I start, let me see, maybe where my husband pulled the gate out of the box. The gate is suppose to come pre-latched, and it did not. I had to actually sit on the gate to close the gap between the latch and the inside door. After two days, it already is starting to bend. The only reason I STILL deal with this gate, is because I am still looking for a better one. I would recommend another brand, not this product. When will corporations ever learn.	
1. 	I didn't want to buy a big high chair for my grand-daughter since I only watch her once or twice a week and this fits the bill. It folds down pretty small to store in guest bedroom closet and we have taken it with us when we went out to eat because it's nice to have the tray to put small food items on for her to eat and/or toys for her to play with. I also like that it will grow with her by not using the tray. Love that is adjustable in height also. :)	
- 1	I used these trainers with my older children and decided to go with them again for #3. Amazon has them for a great price so I ordered three. Very disappointed this morning to open the box and see they are not the same cups featured. The ones I received have a clear spout like the bottles. In the picture, they have a white spout like our old trainer cups. My little guy will chew thru these very quickly once teeth arrive. Surprised at this error, as this item came directly from Amazon.	
1. 	I am happy with this product, although it is smaller than expected, it is a good quality and small enough for little hands to hold.	
1. 	Bought this to match the Babybjorn potty seat. It is sturdy for my 19 month old, and is a good size for our small bathroom. Perfect, just like the potty!	
- 1	I use an electric double pump and returned to work a few weeks ago. I bought this manual hand pump in case i was traveling or somewhere and couldn't use my electric pump. The first time I used it was after a wedding and it seemed to work fine. It was very efficient and I was impressed with how much milk I got considering it was manual. The pump was a bit loud but it worked. However, I used it again the other day and my experience was not so great. I forgot a part to my electric pump at home and remembered i had this one in my car. I decided to use it instead of driving home to get my parts. I figured it would take longer to pump but would still be effective. Unfortunately it was very painful and i had to stop pumping. I usually pump 3 times at work and could only do one regular length and one really short time. I'm still sore and raw the next day and its painful when my son nurses. I'm disappointed. It was the first time it actually hurt to pump. The pain I'm feeling is not worth using this pump again. Next time I'll drive home to get my parts!	
1. 	My super tall 2 year old fits on this with a little hangover for his feet. Works like expected and is soft.	
- 1	The underside of the tray has ridges. My son would get excited and kick his feet against them, causing redness and bruising. The underside of the tray is all mechanism and nothing kid safe. I have to buy something else.I think this issue may have been addressed in the new model. Theyve redesigned the underside I think...	
1. 	It took our baby awhile to warm up to her swing.  She wasn't wild about it for her first month, but ever since then she has loved it.  The cradle shaped seat is wonderful for young infants....much better than your standard swings without head support.  At four months she uses it often.  It's great for rocking her to sleep for a nap.  In fact, it's so useful that I have to remind myself to get her out of there for hands-on play more often!  My only criticism...I wish there was an option to extend the time that the music plays.  The automatic shut-off happens too soon.	
- 1	I tried to wear this as much as possible but it rides up and interfered with breastfeeding. I'm disappointed to have wasted the cash on this. It might work for some women but I'm 5'8 but a bit short waisted. Nothing extreme of course but maybe that's why it rode up on me and I had to take it off to nurse each time...which can be annoying when you've got a newborn who is constantly eating. You definitely couldn't wear it out unless under a bulky sweatshirt. Not comfortable but I wouldn't have minded that if I could have nursed with it. So I don't know if it really works since I couldn't wear it consistently enough to say.	
- 1	I bought 2 packs of these, since the traditional cabinet locks don't work on our cupboards or drawers. First of all, getting them to fit right was a pain and once stuck on they either wouldn't budge ever ( of course int he places that we would have liked to move them), or they fall right off. Second, the plastic strap has broken on all but 2 of them. These are not worth the money, hassle or false sense of security.	
1. 	Added a picture to the product gallery. It took me a while to figure out how to attach it, but it's very simple. Seems quite sturdy as well!	
1. 	I am embarrassed to admit how happy I am about this potty seat. We were using (without any luck) the Prince Lionheart weePod. The BB toilet trainer by comparison #1 has the dial adjustment to fit any toilet, long or round. I put a small black dot on the dial where it has the perfect fit, because with time, it does adjust ever so slightly, so I know exactly where it needs to be snug. #2 The entire base that sits on your toilet seat is lined with rubber so there's a no slip grip. No need to try & get suction cups to try & keep the seat stable. #3 the splash guard is not so huge & in the way. My daughter was having such a hard time getting herself up, on & over the hump on the weePod. This may be a downside for boys, but is a bonus for girls. #4 You can hang it. I put a command hook a few inches below the tp roll & that's where we hang it between uses. My daughter is able to get it herself and place it on herself. All key things in her independence. And there's no putting it on wrong because the positioning is always right. #5 This is completely personal reasoning, but for some reason the fact that it is hard plastic rather than squishy soft material (in my head) makes it seem more sanitary. Or maybe because its clean & white, idk. That being said, when I say hard plastic, it is not by all means uncomfortable. The way it is shape gives the right alignment to be sitting on it. The weePod, for whatever reason, would cause her to lean back in the seat. My daughter loves this seat.  A+++ in everyway. Worth every penny!	
- 1	Ruined a whole load of baby clothes because the brown trim bled everywhere. Great to have a cover but be careful of the colors.	
- 1	There is only a small timeframe that this tub is super useful during. When my son was first born, he was too light to push the sling down into the water, so as I was pouring water over him, he was getting goosebumps since he couldnt be semi-submerged. He was born at 8.5 pounds. Now, he is 4 months and about 15 pounds, and is pushing the sling down a little better, so it is working out fine for now. I foresee as he starts getting more and more mobile, that I am going to have trouble keeping him on the sling, because he is already wiggling quite a bit and isn't even sitting up yet. The sling is not adjusteable, but does come off and is washable. It is easy to rinse and get all of the soap off of him with the sling tho, and he seems pretty comfy for now... but as I am looking at the design a little closer, for later use that is, there is a huge plastic BUMP in the middle of the tub, I'm assuming to assist your little one when they start sitting up, but it looks so uncomfortable, and I'm reading everyone elses reviews about how their babies aren't able to stay supported by the bump. What I am thinking that I will try when my son gets to this point is a folded up bath towel completely underneath his butt, for comfort, and grip so he doesn't slide under the water or something. The little plug at the bottom changes from blue to white when the water is too hot, so that's a pretty nifty feature, and I like the side pockets for his baby wash and rinsing cup. Now behind where your baby's head would go, there are two other pockets that I am assuming are to prevent overfilling the tub. Well they defeat the purpose because they don't drain... They hold water, which collects soap residue, so that next time you fill the tub, that old dirty bath water that has been sitting there is now in the tub with your baby. You would have to turn the whole thing upside down after every bath, and who has time for that while you are trying to deal with drying off and watching your baby? I drilled holes in the bottom of these two pockets so that they now work properly. I really wish I would have purchased a different baby tub, but there are good features, and things can be done to make this tub more functionable.UPDATE: Just as predicted, my son is now 5 months old and was too heavy for the sling. He still isn't sitting unassisted yet, and this tub is a NIGHTMARE at this stage. He freaks out a little when the water begins to pool in the tub, and holds his breath while wiggling, and floats right up out of the little contoured spot for their bottoms. So then, the hump in the middle of the tub is jabbing him in the middle of his back and he is just floating in this awkward little bath tub! I refuse to fill it at all now, even though I never leave my son's side through the bath, but it just isn't safe at all! I'm lowering this one star. And the towel idea I had before DID NOT work at all. It just clogged the tub to where it didnt drain, and when my son floats up, the towel does too. Hectic bath time!	
1. 	My youngest (6 months) and I bedshare and this product worked really well on my queen size bed.  I felt really safe a night knowing he wasn't going to roll out of bed.  Highly recommended!	
- 1	I purchased the box with the turtle. It's cute, but very cheaply made and not worth the price. The box does not open smoothly either. One of the sides would always get stuck. There's better quality boxes out there. I would not recommend this.	
1. 	We ordered this for our 2 1/2 year old since he has outgrown the pack and play and we needed somewhere for him to sleep when traveling.  This works great!  Setting it up is a breeze, and it seems very sturdy.  It takes up much less room in the trunk than the pack and play.  He had no problem sleeping on this during a recent trip.  The only reason I gave it four stars is that the sheet that comes with it is not very good.  It's rough and doesn't seem comfortable.  You could easily throw a crib sheet on it though.	
1. 	Nice design. Big draws. Love the cubby holes for organizing and extra storage! Very pretty to look at. The negatives: super complicated to put together. Took about 5-6 hours. Also the drawers don't slide as easy as I'd like.	
- 1	They work, but are TINY! The plain white side is absorbent and the other side really isnt... They are cute, but made for small babies.	
1. 	my husband and i just put this changing table together today.  we've assembled several pieces of furniture from ikea so we felt fairly comfortable with our abilities.  the south shore instructions aren't as good as ikea's; we had to undo and then redo a couple of steps but it wasn't too hard to correct our mistakes.  for $170, the quality was what we expected - thin cardboard backing, particle board, and a few dents here and there.  however when we were finished, it did look quite nice and it matched myStork Craft Tuscany Crib.  i bought three storage containers from target and they fit perfectly in the little cubby areas (see my photo under customer images).	
- 1	These where nice for the newborn stage but as baby got older I found it to be a waste of money. Just use baking soda and essential oils.	
1. 	Love these bibs!  They hold up really well, can be put on the top rack of your dishwasher for cleaning and aren't super stiff like a lot of the other bibs out there.  Best bib out there!	
1. 	I love using the Playtex Nurser and all of the supplies for the nursers.  I used these bottles when I had my sons forty years ago. My boys had less gas and now I am using these for my grandchild.  I was upset  when I could not find these in stores anywhere. I was greatful when a friend of mind suggested I look on line.That's where I found them.Why are these not sold in stores anymore?  You need to get these back on selves in the stores. It's easier to go to a store to buy them, then wait for the bottles or supplies to be delivered.  I bought $125.00 worth of these bottles with nipples, inserts, tops and bottles, plus the starter kits.Please bring back to stores.Thank you for a great bottle which may I add is the closest thing to a mothers breast.Please again, bring them back to stores.I am a true beliver that this is the greatest bottle ever made.	
- 1	The lamp is cute and works well for my grandson's room, however the paint has some flaws. Not enough to return it, but a new item should look better than the one we received did. We decided we could touch the paint up ourselves easily enough, so for us it wasn't a big deal, but it might be for you.	
1. 	they are easy to use and operate.  Baby can't take off or manipulate, and they kinda look stylish lol...i constantly get compliments. maybe they are joking when complimenting, but i really do love these things.	
- 1	This is the weakest stem out of the three brands I've tried so far. The sponge also disappears and little parts of it fall off into the sink. The nipple cleaner is very handy because you don't have to remove it to use it. That is the reason I got this one. Too bad it's useless now.	
1. 	My son is 27 months and won't sit bare but on potty.  I have a bjorn potty as the other one.  He seems to like this one more.  I think for kids that like softer/warmer seats this works better than the bjorn.	
1. 	Washed, never bled, shrunk a little but no more than expected, color stayed after wash.  Smelled like chemicals before wash.	
- 1	I have the yellow soccer ball pack for my son. I got it as a gift from his wish list in November, by end of the month the seams on the strap were breaking.  I called amazon and got a replacement. and by early January it's breaking again! and now the seam in the cooler pack is ripping too! and he only went to school for a week in December! I really really like the design and size of this bag, but the craftsmanship on it is leaving very little to be desired. The design is great but i just want one that can last me a full year (especially for this price).	
1. 	During my first pregnancy, I used a Boppy pillow because it was smaller and took up less room in my bed.  That pillow worked ok but for my second pregnancy I wanted something that would support me better.  I researched this pillow and was very impressed by how comfortable it was.  I bought this during my 4th month and I was able to sleep restfully each night!  I was very impressed.  The reason I am giving this four stars is because into my 8th month I thought it was getting a little flat and I did not feel it held up as well as it should of - after only using it for four months.  Of course, by this time in my pregnancy I was uncomfortable a lot (not just when I was sleeping) so this may be a factor too. I still did not sleep without it!  As far as the size - it is bigger especially since I was used to a Bobby sleep pillow which was half the size but I am 5' 8 and and the length of it worked for me!	
1. 	These are my baby's all-time favorite spoons. They are wide enough to pick up quite a bit of food and get it in his mouth without (too much) mess, and soft enough on his cheeks and gums. The low, wide base of the bowl makes it very difficult to tip over. Totally worth it the price.	
1. 	I bought this years ago and I still use it all the time at the beach and at the park. Keeps you dry on wet grass. Easy to fold up. Light weight and easy to carry.	
1. 	After many years of fighting traditional cheap plastic child safety locks (we have a cat that likes to get into things too) and seeing our son still manage to pinch his fingers in doors (better than getting at chemicals or whatever, but still!), our pediatrician recommended these to us.  They were easy to install, and he can't get the doors open at all, so no pinched fingers or getting at something he shouldn't.  They also have a mechanism to keep the lock in the open position, like if you need to get in a cabinet a lot, or the kids are older and you don't need them anymore.  I would however recommend keeping an extra key around in case one gets lost, or locked in a cabinet by accident.	
1. 	I have two of these placemats. One for the diaper bag and one used as a backup while the other is being washed. I have bought this for numerous friends and everyone LOVES it. The one drawback for one of my friends is - their daughter learned right away to pull it off the table and refuses to use it. Eveyone else I know has had no problems with it. It catches food in it's little pocket, keeps the table clean and is easy to rollup and store away. I can't say enough about this product. My husband, daughter and I eat out 1-2 times a week (she is 230 mths old and we've dines out since she was born) and we use it everytime there's a table it will stick to (which is everything but tablecloth). We've used it sine my daughter was old enough for the high chair.	
- 1	I registered for this because I was living in Europe when pregnant with our son and though that (with the size of our TINY European washers) this would be perfect.  It is SMALL - even by European washer standards.  I use bumGenius diapers and I could only fit a few in here.  I did wash every day, but it still filled up fast.  Also, the handle lock was awkward (or maybe it was me?).  I would recommend a pail that has a step-open feature for those moments when you can't bend over and use two hands to open the bucket (where are your hands for holding down the baby on the changing table?).	
1. 	The baby loves this thing.  She likes to chew on the little &#34;feet&#34;	
1. 	Don't understand how this could get bad reviews!! I was worried at first that the adhesive wouldn't be included. I opened it and couldn't find them ANYWHERE!!! I was devastated because this seemed like the perfect rail protector. After a few minutes of investigating and thinking of a plan B, I noticed the adhesives on it!! The adhesive on it is super invisible as is the sticker that covers it. I was shocked and felt stupid. I followed the directions to a T (using the blower dryer to help the adhesive take to the crib (it's almost January and the cold temp definitely doesn't help it stick). Worked like a charm!! I checked the next day (b/c they ask that you give it about 8 hours) and sure enough it was fully stuck to the crib. I plan on using my crib for all future babies (as we are only on our first) and this will do the job in not only providing the crib rail protection but also giving my baby something to teeth on. Just look closer at the product and follow the directions.	
- 1	I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat.  The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit.  First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes.  Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard.  In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me.  I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter.  I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well.  My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work.	
- 1	I am 5'3'' and weighed about 135 pounds/6 months pregnant when I ordered this. WAY TO SMALL. Not comfortable and I had to return it.	
- 1	I got these for the sippy cup because of the great reviews and low price, but I didn't think these are as functional for my baby as the SippiGrips (which please don't pay more than $5 for -- found it at our local grocery store H-E-B for about $4.50 I think), and the length is longer, and just generally easier to use.	
- 1	I bought this for an overnight diaper, trying to avoid using synthetic fabrics, and paired it with a Kissaluvs wool cover.  I even used a Joey Bunz premium hemp insert and I still have leaks!  I re-lanolized my cover to make sure it wasn't that, and tried again.  This diaper is absolutely soaked by morning and the wetness goes right through the wool and soaks my son's pajamas and sheet.  I've washed this diaper and the Joey Bunz at least six times and it continues to leak.  I guess it's not all that absorbent.  My son is three months old and only 14 pounds and it still does not hold enough pee to last 10 hours.  I expected it to be more absorbent.  Guess I'm going back to pockets.	
1. 	Maybe not ideal for an infant, but after about a month, it works remarkably well. And it doesn't look like a SWAT vest, which is a plus in my book.	
- 1	did not work at all in my son's room. Virtually had no smell or impact on the diaper smell in the room	
- 1	We received this night light as a gift shortly after our son was born. It was a really wonderful light. I loved the portability and the long battery life. It was ideal for travel. I loved that the colored lights were bright enough to change a diaper in the middle of the night but not so bright to keep us from sleeping.After 9 months of use, it just stopped working one day. No signs of wear, it was never dropped, no contact with water (or drool). No idea what happened.I was ready to replace it with the same light when I read more consumer reviews that complained theirs stopped working after just a couple of months. We were lucky to get to 9 months with ours.We replaced ours with a similar style light (Kinderglo) and it's been wonderful ever since, over two years now.	
1. 	My husband and I originally tried the Avent bottles after several recommendations from previous users and after doing some research on our own.  However, we switched to Dr. Brown's when our son began suffering from gas and nipple confusion, since I am nursing. We can't express how much we LOVE the Dr. Brown's bottles.  Our son's gas IMMEDIATELY disappeared and he no longer suffered from nipple confusion.  The Avent nipples are TOO HARD for a breastfed baby.  Dr. Brown's bottles are the BEST BOTTLES ON THE MARKET!  We'll use them with our next baby and will recommend to them to ANYONE that will listen.	
1. 	This is an excellent and very affordable tub!  I ordered this for my 6 week old son and he loves it.  The sling makes it a comfortable experience for baby to relax in.  I love the colors and the little nook for the bath supplies to go into!	
- 1	I wanted to love this projector but it just wasn't as great as the reviews I'd read described it.  It looks and feels pretty cheap.  The projector is just a stationary image that switches between 2 slides.  There are a lot of controls/switches that just made it more complicated than I wanted.  Returning it.	
- 1	This is the fourth set of connectors I've had to buy in the six months that I've had my Medela breast pump. If they were of higher quality I would not have to replace them so frequently. I'm disappointed more generally that Medela would make them of such poor quality to begin with. Since I only pump at night, the pump gets very little use overall, making the quality of these connectors downright shoddy.	
- 1	OK...I can see this be a fun and interesting to get kids to go on it and potty/toilet training but beside that nothing else is ok. The material is super cheap and its poorly made. The instruction say to put it on the actual toilet bowl not on the seat and I did just that and 3 minutes later my boy was in the toilet with the seat together screaming to get out. I have twin boys 2 years old and whenever they used it leaked 100%. I am sure girls will not have the same problem. I would not recommend this product.	
- 1	Weird fit, weird material. But I needed a cover in navy which is really hard to find. Its barely worth the ten bucks i paid. It feels like it is 20 years old and is just really &#34;pilly&#34; and not really &#34;terry&#34; at all. Not soft either.Instead, I'm having a custom one made to replace this one. That one was 40 dollars on etsy but it has an 8 week delivery. This will work until then.	
- 1	I love this cup when we used it the first few times, easy grip, slick design with none of those crevices so many cups have that are impossible to get milk out of.  Now this could just be my child, but he is tough on his cups (and well, everything).  He is in a throwing stage and very much likes to throw things from the high chair, across the room, from the couch.  He is not a set the cup down kind of kid.  So we noticed the stopper (not sure of the technical term) comes out now when he throws it then he goes to drink again from the cup and milk is all over him, the floor, everywhere.  We have other cups where this issue does not happen even when he puts in a lot of effort into his long arm.	
- 1	I should have listened to the other reviews about how it's hard to get the treats out of this monster. The teeth are a little bit hard. It's even hard for me to get them out let alone my 18 month boy!	
1. 	This chair is a mother's best friend.  My child is entertained by the hanging toys for roughly 20 minutes at a time.  He never gets tired of making &#34;If you're happy and you know it&#34; play on the ladybug!  To be honest, I am not easily annoyed by the music children's toys play.  It is only one song, but it will only activate if the child gives it a generous tug on the pull string.  I love that he is safe and secure in the chair.The other fantastic part is the reclined sleeper position.  I can sleep him in any room of the house quickly and easily because of this chair and I don't need to resort to the pack and play or crib.I can't wait to see how he enjoys using it as a rocker as he gets older.  This really was a worthwhile investment.	
- 1	Unless you have a less than 6 pound baby this is useless.  My son was 8 lbs 14 oz at birth and could NEVER use this insert.  It was a  waste of money and it was too late to return.	
1. 	The First Years Infant to Toddler tub with New Born Sling is just great.  I could not believe, looking at it at first whether it would be comfortable for our newborn, but the sling is just great, and baby loves the warm water and fits comfortably in the sling as mom enjoys bathing her.It is built to place on the middle post or section between a double sink and the tub is rather sturdy when placed on our double sink, although like bathing our newborn in a warmer environment than a kitchen.  The tub is also not too heavy if you are carting it with enough water for the baby to bathe in.  There is a plug at the bottom for easy draining.  There are basically three ways to seat a babe. The sling for the new born a more padded seat for an infant to recline in and a more sturdy seat for the toddler to sit up in if you wish to use it.When you think of it, for the money, this Infant to Toddler tub will save you in the long run until your little one is ready for the larger tub.  Great gift idea and should be on every moms registry.	
- 1	The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same.  How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments?  I guess they don't have actual instruments in China.	
1. 	These cover the whole outlet and are hard to remove, as expected. Can't beat the price for what you get!	
- 1	I have forceful letdown, and I always leak right through these till my shirt is soaked. :( They also show through most of my shirts.	
- 1	I heard that my son might prefer this over the little suction bulbs to clean his nose... but this doesnt do anything! The suction is too weak and it can not get deep enough into his nose. I went back to using the bulb that the hospital gave me	
1. 	I love this ladybug!  I bought it for my newborn, and while it is for 3+, it works just fine for a baby if you don't put it in the crib.  I placed ours on a dresser and now that she's 8 months she loves looking at the stars.  The red doesn't show up on the ceiling although she still likes looking at the ladybug itself, but I think that's only because the room is so bright due to street lights.  We've used it every night for 8 months now and I'm just now thinking it needs new batteries.  I'll be buying another one for our second baby!	
- 1	I live in a techie house. Lots of WiFi, Cell Signal Extenders, etc. So I can't honestly say that something else might have caused the interference that I experienced with this model, HOWEVER, I imagine that living in a large city or apartment building that you'd run into the same problems that we faced with these monitors.I wasn't able to use these for more than a week without giving up. While the packaging, design and features were great, the actual quality of the signal was not.I do not recommend purchasing this product.	
1. 	This is a great thing to have.  I've used it right from the beginning.  She is a squirmy baby and it helps keep her in one spot and gives me a piece of mind during the night.  Also, because the sides are velcro, I can reposition them to make them wider as she grows and put her on her side for daytime naps.  Easy to clean as well, goes right into the washing machine.	
1. 	I haven't used it yet, but it seems really complete and full of everything we will need and I liked it better than others I saw.	
1. 	What a terrific invention!!  We give our daughter all sorts of foods in these cups (Cheerios, Veggie Booty, Cheddar Bunnies, etc) and the innovative lids really help keep the mess to a minimum.  Now that isn't to say we never have to clean Cheerios out of her carseat or stroller, because we definitely do!  Still, she is by no means ready for a baggie or an open container, so without these containers she wouldn't be able to snack on the go.My daughter is almost 19 months old and cannot get the lid off the cup, but I have heard of children who can.  I think my child is too interested in the food to spend time wondering about the lid!	
- 1	After only one or two uses one of the male snaps on the front of the diaper used to size it stopped snapping so now my cover can only be sized in the largest setting for my medium sized baby. I'm disappointed because I keep hearing how great these wraps are. It's the second to last wrap that I go to in my stash, which ultimately means that I never use it. Hopefully I'll be able to get more use out of it when my baby is a large size, but for now it's a total bust. Boo!	
- 1	I really loved the look when they first arrived. However, as soon as i out them to use, they started showing little cracks - 1 got 4 and all had the same issue. Within a month or so, all broke. These are meant for toddlers and infants and are super expensive. I wouldve expected them to last longer than they actually did.My daughter did love them while they lasted though - easy to hold, easy on the eyes!Had i written this review a few months back, i wouldve given a positive review. Not recommended at all!	
- 1	double check dimensions when you're ordering this! It's maybe 2/3 the side of most changing pads-- doesn't seem like it's adequate for my 12-month old. Also, I'm disappointed that I didn't notice that it can't be washed. I love that my other changing pad can be-- I just thrown it through the wash semi-regularly plus whenever it gets actually dirty. That seems a requirement for something that touches poop sometimes!	
1. 	This blanket is a must--pick any color but make sure you have one to wash and one to wear!  My son hated his arms down at first so we folded the flaps under him but eventually he started letting us bind them.  You can swaddle TIGHT with this!	
1. 	Didn't know the thing moved around kind of like a snake.  My daughter thinks it's fun for about 20 seconds and then tries to gnaw it to pieces.  Good toy!!!	
- 1	I thought this was supposed to be a good pillow for breastfeeding but it's not.  Because it is rounded and not connected to me it slips out from under my baby while feeding.  He ends up in a hole and I need to have a towel or blanket over the pillow to stop him from sinking.It is very cute and the cover is very soft but it really isn't functional for breastfeeding.	
- 1	I was excited about this bumper and it worked for the first couple weeks and then it started sagging. My son is bumping his head on the crib all the time now. It's a little too big for our crib so I've been trying to make it work but even in the places it's not bunching up it still sags. The quality is not that great. I wish I could return it but I've already washed it. I do not recommend this bumper.	
1. 	I wish I would have bought this sooner and saved myself some money!  My 4 month old baby loves to play with the little bears on this for at least 10 minutes (a long time in newborn land) which gives me a chance to take a shower - hurrah! Much prettier and more stylish than any of the other bouncers and swings out there which I tried. None were successful in entertaining my baby.  This collapses flat and is made from very comfy stretch cotton. Best part is the baby does all the rocking - No batteries needed!I see that BabyBjorn has come out with a nearly identical product for twice the price - hmmm...don't fall for it! Get this one!!	
- 1	Runs very large. My daughter will be in first grade by the time she fits in this. I followed the size guide.	
1. 	This was absolutely fabulous for my family.  We used it with frozen fruit for teething, and just about any snacks my baby wanted to eat.  I never had to worry about her choking and it was so easy to clean.I truely reccomend this product for worry free feeding!	
1. 	This was a good purchase.  My one problem with the blanket is that the inside seam where the stripes and the vinyl are sewn, are coming apart.  Other than that, this was a good purchase.  Good for beach, park, whatever.  Can get wet and is not an issue.	
- 1	Ended up returning this product without using it because it ended up being 'deeper' than I thought it would be. Thought it would hold diapers a different way but the way it's designed didn't allow me to put it where I intended. I'm sure it's a great product ... but I would recommend looking at the dimensions before ordering.	
- 1	My LO couldn't figure out how to use this and other traditional, spill-proof sippy cups (we tried at least 3 different brands). We used an occasional bottle from 0-6 months (not sure if that had anything to do with it), but now that we are ready to introduce water to her diet she was using the bottles and traditional sippy cups for teethers instead of drinking from them (Yes, I even tried taking out the valve...). I found the Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 9 Ounces and the First Years Take and Toss cups work much better for us. I'm sure this is a great cup as we love our other Gerber products (especially the spoons!), but unfortunately didn't work for us.	
- 1	Our baby really loves to be in a swing and so we used this swing daily. At first it seemed ok but we were bothered by the noise as the motor is quite loud. Furthermore, there is no AC adapter and it takes a lot of D batteries.  For us, it seemed to go through them more quickly than we expected. The stroller frame rocked a bit so it was not perfectly stable although there did not seem to be any real risk of it tipping. It is quite big, and so to move it around the house is a bit of a struggle.There are multiple setting for the swing but I didnt notice much difference between the highest swing setting and the lowest. The music options on this swing are not that great and we didnt like any of them. Unfortunately, despite being one of the more expensive options, this swing proved to be unreliable. First the sound went, then the motors went and now after just 3 months of use, it is nothing but an elevated baby bed.We replaced this swing with a portable bright starts swing that was half the price. There is no AC adapter on it either, but it takes C batteries and it seems to work longer without a battery change. The bright starts swing was simple to set-up and folds up quite compactly in a jiffy. We move it around the house and frequently take it with us in the car when traveling so our baby can enjoy it. The music is better, it has a timer, and the swing motor is whisper quiet. Furthermore, it has been reliable to date, with no problems.We were overall displeased with the Fisher Price swing, even before it broke, and by comparison, the Bright Starts swing is superior.	
1. 	This is one of the best investments that we have made!  We have two that keep half the house off limits.  It's aesthetically pleasing, durable, reliable and easy to operate.  It's also tall enough to discourage our two golden retrievers from jumping up on it or trying to get through.  My husband and I are fairly tall and it's nice not having to bend down at all to open them.  Our son (now 16 months) hangs onto them and shakes them with all his body, like a prisoner trying to escape and it's hopeless- he will not get through no matter how much he may try.The only reason to not give this gate 5 stars is that the installation process, however easy it may be, is very sensitive.  You have to make sure that the bottom of the gate is exactly level, otherwise the swing-closed mechanism may not work smoothly.  We had to re-install one cup that holds the pressure mount in order for the gate to swing closed on its own like it's designed.  Also- the installation requires you to drill screws into the door frame (or wall or wherever you install it) and this will leave holes once we eventually take the gates out.  We don't mind because we know they'll be there for at least a few years until we're done having children.	
1. 	What is good about this SuperBib:LightweightCan wipe off or washGood size to cover growing babyVelcro closure that goes on well and is a nice size for those cute little short necks.	
1. 	We were looking for a fence for our patio.  We bought this fence after looking at others.  It is good, we leave it out at night.  However, I wish there was a way to attach this to the wall.	
- 1	We had this item on our baby gift registry and just received it. The packaging clearly states that the backing is made of vinyl, not polyester. Only the batting is polyester. This is an essential difference if you are avoiding toxic materials in your baby gear.	
- 1	There's a lot of hype these days about making your own baby food and needing a special machine to make it.  While I enjoy making different foods for my little one, I don't think these baby food makers necessarily make the job easier.  After testing out this machine which will steam and food process (puree or chunkier textured food) the food, I came to the conclusion that it's more convenient for me to just cook the food like I normally would and then run it through the blender or my mini-processor.  I think this machine takes up too much space and really isn't necessary.  If you have a blender or a mini-prep already you can make your own baby food.  You don't need a pricey machine that is made just for making baby food to make homemade baby food.	
- 1	I purchased these training cups about a year ago when the spout had a Y shaped cut to allow the flow of liquid to pass through.  They were the best cups for transitioning my son from a bottle to a sippy because of the soft spout and the slow flow of liquid.  Recently the spouts on the 2 cups that I own became really worn out with one yellow spout turning black (at first i thought this was mold but I could not scrub/boil it off and realized it was the material itself changing color) and the blue spout finally being bitten through.  I purchased replacement spouts only to find that the cut in the tip was now a horizontal slit instead of the Y cut.  The material also seemed to be a lot firmer making the slit stay open instead of closing immediately once my son stopped sucking.  This allowed for liquids to spill out easily and also for too much liquid to flow out while my son was drinking.  After failing to find suitable replacement spouts I decided to call the manufacturer to see if they still made the Y cut spouts.  I was told they do not make them any longer and that they had changed manufacturers for the spouts.  When I asked if the materials were the same I was told they were.  However I doubt this to be true since the old spouts were much more pliable.  Overall the cup USE TO BE amazing but now with the new horizontal slitted spouts they are totally disappointing.  They leak everywhere!	
- 1	It's a nice toy, well-made and pretty, but baby got bored with it quickly (after just a couple of days). Now he only occasionally hits it, most of the time accidentally. Maybe we introduced it too late? (at 6 months)On the good side, I didn't have the technical problems other reviewers had: ours attaches well.Considering the outrageous price for it, I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it would work for such a short time.The two stars only is mostly because of the price, and also because it doesn't really work for us.	
1. 	I used these bottles when my daughter was born in 97 and they were great. I have seen reviews that complained about nipple size, but Avent makes nipples in a numebr of different flows. The newborn nipple is for newborns and you gradually progress as your child grows. I did have the nipples collapse, but it was only becuase I needed to switch to the next nipple stage. My daughter was sucking to hard for the newborn nipple. Other than that, I had no problems with the bottle at all. I found that my daughter was able to both breastfeed and drink from her Avent bottles with no problems at all. The nipples were not too hard and both my daughter and I were completly happy with them. As she got older I began using the traning spout and handles on the bottle which was definitely an added bonus. I would recommend this product to any mother looking to breastfeed thier child.Update: I'm using these bottles with my 2nd child and they are just as wonderful as I remember.	
1. 	I love, love, love this play pen, its money will spent, it roomy and colourful, would defin. recommend. it makes noises as well.	
1. 	Works great. Does it's job. Fits into the wall just fine. Snug enough that my daughter can't pull it off herself, but not too snug that I can't pull it off when I need to use that outlet.	
- 1	This container is extremely small. I'm sure if I'd read the fine print a little better I would have known that. However the opening to which the snacks come out is also very small. My son can't stick his hand inside to grab the snacks. He has to turn it over and dump it into his hand, and you know what that means! Food everywhere! I'm pretty bummed because it's cute and fits in my diaper bag well.	
- 1	We bought this for our son when when he turned 2 and was finally sleeping in his own room. He loved the stars and and colors and the plush turtle.Unfortunately, after a little less than a year of use, it stopped working. We replaced the batteries and it simply wouldn't turn on anymore. We even tried a different brand of batteries with no success.It was fun while it lasted, but some longevity with the product really would have been nice.	
1. 	Great product, planning to get more for family members to use when we are at their home. It is very secure and attaches very easily. Get this product rather than a high chair, have both, and this is far better.	
- 1	This monitor is pretty terrible. I bought it because it had good reviews but 3 friends who own this have all shared my experience. The main problem is it beeps all the time. I bought one with two hand sets and one we cannot even use because it beeps 100% of the time non stop even when plugged in. The other behaves most of the time while plugged in but when it is using battery power it also beeps all the time even when in the same room as the base (so not a distance problem). It is new so the battery is not old or anything, The other thing is at night even while plugged it it suddenly decides to beep from time to time waking me up even when my son is asleep. It has totally contributed to my lack of sleep with a newborn. I no longer use it and instead keep all the doors open so I can hear my son. I am now researching an alternative monitor to buy instead of this one. This was a huge waste of money.	
1. 	I have some of these cups that I have been using for my son, and while generally they are great, they do no t travel very well.  I end up taping over the mouthpiece and putting the cup in a ziploc plastic bag to prevent milk from getting everywhere.I was so excited to see these with travel caps.  Imagine my disappointment when I realized my SEVEN new cups came with ONE cap.	
- 1	I didn't like these at all. They never stayed in place. WeeBlocks stayed in place much better. These are too light weight and too small. A waste of money even though you love the prints.	
- 1	These bottles were great for getting a breastfeed infant started on a bottle. We had several different bottles in stock, and this is the bottle our infant preferred. Unfortunately after a few months the bottles quit venting. So I bought two more and neither one of them vented brand new. I called the company and got no response so I returned the bottles and I guess we will be trying something else.	
- 1	I totally understand that crib mattresses need to be firm in order to be safe, but seriously, this thing is much harder than is necessary to be considered safe.  We purchased the Nook pebble mattress for my 1st born (which I LOVE,) but during my 2nd pregnancy when we found out we were having twins, I went hunting for more affordable options.  We decided on the Colgate Classica I based on the review in the Baby Bargains book. I wish I would have spent just a little more $$ or maybe just tested a few more mattresses out before buying 2 of these concrete slabs. The girls refuse to sleep on these.  My son just transitioned into a twin bed, so we gave one of the girls his Nook mattress, but now I've got to look for a mattress topper for the other baby.On a positive note, this mattress is constructed well and is super light which makes for changing the sheets very easy.	
1. 	Everyone warned us how difficult it would be to bathe baby...how wrong they were.  From day one home from the hospital, our boy has enjoyed his time in the bath, and it's because he is so comfy on this pillow.  Would recommend for sure!  Who would want to sit in a hard molded plastic thing when you can sit on a pillow!	
1. 	I ordered four different kinds of prefolds to try: Gerber birdseye, OsoCozy bleached, OsoCozy unbleached, and these Kushies. Initially, I just used the OsoCozy diapers because they were smaller in size than the Gerbers or the Kushies. However, they were all dirty one day and I pulled out a Kushie and a Gerber. HELLO!! The Kushies are so much more absorbent than either of the other two brands. Even though they are large, they fit very well into my son's Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps Size One, which was my initial concern. The extra material increases their effectiveness, but the fabric itself (flannel) is more absorbent than the other fabrics. Even when the diaper is soaked through, it does not feel as wet and soggy as the other brands. For that reason, I think that it is more gentle on my son's skin--AND it's softer than the other fabrics! For now, I just have one pack, so they have become my overnight diapers. I will soon be ordering more and make them my sole brand.My diaper system:I use Thirsties Duo Snap Wraps with prefolds; I have tried several brands, but prefer Kushies. I stash dirty diapers in a Planet Earth wet/dry bag until I have a chance to spray them off with the Mini-Shower Bidet & Handheld Sprayer, them I dunk them in the Bambino Mio diaper bucket half-filled with water and a 1/2 cup of Borax until I wash them. I run them through one rinse cycle, then wash them in hot water with Charlie's Soap with a single rinse. So far, no stains, and no skin irritation! I do one load of diaper laundry per day.	
- 1	This play yard is chock-full of bells and whistles and pretty much does everything except wash your dishes and sort the laundry, which as a new parent I thought would be fabulous. As an experienced parent, I can now say that it's overkill. The biggest problem I've had with this play yard is its lack of portability. It's big and clunky, but the worst part is that if you don't carry all of the accessories, there's a ton of extra space in the bag and the playard moves around and becomes a real pain to carry. To break down the accessories:Bassinet: Works well, only good up to 15 lbs. like other playard bassinetsMobile: Attaches to the four corners of the mattress, so if you want to use the changing table you have to take it off. Can't be used when the mattress is in the lowest positionLight/Sound/Vibration Thingy: Vibration is too weak to vibrate the mattress, sounds are annoying, light times out so you might as well just get a night light in the room.Remote Control: Neat idea, but you have to point it directly at the unit, in a very specific, hard to hit spot, or it doesn't work.Changing Table: Good as long as your baby fits in it. It goes across width-wise and is actually smaller than the whole width. Our son outgrew it by 3-4 months.Extra Pockets: Just okay, only room for 2-3 diapers in each.Carrying Bag: Practically useless unless you stuff it with everythingPadded Mattress: Just barelyOther problems are that it doesn't fit through doorways, which I didn't realize would be something I really wanted until after I had to break the thing down to move it from room to room.All of that said, it's attractive and nice and roomy inside, so there's plenty of space to play. I also have just used standard playard sheets like the ones made for other brands. It's a great place for keeping the baby safe and occupied while I do chores, but we bought a second super-cheap, no-frills playard to use as a portable crib. I wish I'd saved the money.*******Update January 4*******Something else to be aware of--our son is teething and likes to chew on the edge of the playard (and his crib, and pretty much everything else), and his teeth are getting snagged in the fabric around the edges. It hasn't harmed his teeth at all, but he's literally shredding the fabric and it sounds kind of alarming when he pops some more threads. I wouldn't call it dangerous, but it's pretty ugly-looking, and since one of the only things this playard had going for it was being nice-looking, it's definitely a negative. Our cheapo playard doesn't have the fancy fabric around the edges and is impervious to the Teeth of Doom. Once again, I really wish I'd saved the money.	
- 1	It only works for my one year old's tiny toothbrush. My 4 & 7 year old's brushes are slightly bigger (still kid sizes) and they tip over in the holder. They are always falling out. I'm already looking to get rid of this.  It would work if it were taller/deeper.	
1. 	I bought this for my infant but it did not work out well for us (got the Moby instead) but once she was 6 months it has been an easy way to have a free hand while doing laundry or walking to the mailbox, without having to get all strapped in. I think this is a must have for an older baby for quick uses--where you just need 1 hand. The pattern is fantastic by the way. Very nice.	
1. 	I love the feel of these wipes. They are soft on my baby's skin. They did shrink in size considerably when I washed them, but they are still a good size for wiping bottoms.	
- 1	I don't know exactly what the issue is here, but we just got these and I immediately noticed that my baby got a red rash where ever these touched his skin. I'm not sure if it's the material or if it's a rubbing issue. All I can say is that I haven't had this problem with other teethers. We have a Sophie and haven't had this problem either... maybe it's a different material or the vanilla scent, but I'm not giving them back to him. My baby is almost 8 months and does have somewhat sensitive skin, but I was completely surprised to see the rashes developing from these teethers.	
- 1	I thought this would be a good idea to use since my son loves to walk on his own, but I just couldn't get the nerve up to put it on him. The strap looked as if it was too ruff and would cause redness on his wrist.	
1. 	I purchased this for my son and loved it. This model when I purchased it came in two pieces which you insert into the cover which is waterproof. Mine had no zippers, just a hole on the back to allow for the pieces to slide into. I used it with my first son from birth and he slept great. I also used half of it in our bassinet under the sheet with positioners ont he side to prevent rolling and he rarely spit up or had problems digestive problems while sleeping. I thought my son had outgrown it and gave it to a relative, but I'm buying two more, one for my son, and the other for our second baby due this July.	
1. 	I have these Neat seat potty toppers, the Summer Infant keep me clean and the Potty Cover, disposable seat cover. Of all three, this is my 2nd favorite. They are better than the Summer Infant Keep me Clean as they provide sticky tabs at three angles which seems to be better for sealing to the toilet seat. The price of these definately bet teh Potty Cover brand, but the Potty Cover seat covers provide ULTIMATE cover, they also seem to stay in place without any sticky tabs. Nevertheless, I will alternate between these and the Potty Cover brand. For areas where you dare too have to use the bathroom, you can't go wrong with the Potty Cover, but for everyday use and areas where you just desire toilet seat protection, these will suffice.	
1. 	Love love love our Halo Sleep Sacks!  My baby HATED being swaddled but I didn't want loose blankets in her crib, so gave these a try.  They're perfect!  Tons of room in the bottom for her to kick her legs around, and her arms are free, but it keeps her toasty warm on those cold winter nights!	
1. 	Very easy to use, combined with almost nothing to clean. The small cost of reusable liners is far overshadowed by their convenience.	
- 1	ahhhh where do I begin.  I had such high hopes for this one.Instead of this stroller, get the bumbleride twin if you can afford it (it's totally thin enough, don't worry :), or the joovy ergo (if you have a child willing to sit/stand).Here's my review of the aria twin 2010......- SHADE: the canopies look useless in the photo but they're actually nice & come all the way down to the tray.  They don't go beyond the tray like the bumbleride twin, they go down to the side of the tray closer to the child.  I don't know why they don't show that in the photos.  the only thing is that they don't go 'out' far enough so when you pull it down all the way it goes right in front of their face.  Kids don't like that.  my kids duck their heads forward to the outside of the shade (does this make sense?  like, the kids' faces are forward overtop of the tray b/c if they sat back the shade would be right in front of their faces.  so I guess in that way the shade is useless.  Oh, and the kids' legs are exposed.- TRAY: the trays are easily removed and put back - just a button (not the same as the pliko p3 but similar).  But there's a downside... (and this is a big but) ...The tray for the 40 seat is 1 inch wide.  seriously.  it's ~10 inches long and approximately 1 inch wide.  (1 inch deep too).  so if you line up 10 triscuits, that's the width and length of the indentation in the tray.  I'm not kidding or exxagerating.  no cup holder.  the other tray (for the '60' seat is about 2 inches wide and has two tiny round sections for a cup on each end.  really?  do you think the older kid will let the younger kid put his cup on their tray?  let me answer that for you.  no.  so the trays are there which is a plus, but the design is the worst I've seen.- SEATS:  seats are straight up & down which I LOVE.  My kids don't like it when they can't sit straight up & down.  (they do recline.  they also fit big kids.  with a 4year old & a 2 year old the seats were plenty big enough.- MANEUVERABILITY:  I was hoping to be able to turn it & push it with my pinky finger (like i can with my bob revolution or my bumbleride twin).  nope.  can't.  it's fairly good steering & turning fully loaded but you still have to use 2 hands.  ...and it has that catch up where the front wheels point in one direction and you want to go in the other direction, you have to reverse it & then push it forward.  (happens with all strollers with double wheels in front).  I had test driven the 2009 version & it pulled to one side horribly (whichever side had the heavier kid).  This one doesn't.  the 2010 model goes straight ahead.  The scary part is that when you turn it, you can feel the whole frame twist like it's going to break.  you can totally tell you're pushing a flimsy plastic stroller,  (the frame is made of flimsy plastic, unlike the bob strollers or bumbleride or joovy ergo)- COLORS:  the one that looks beautiful blue and brown is not.  it is this ugly gray stripe material and brown.  there is absolutely no blue on it anywhere.  it is very ugly.  I mean very very ugly.  it would've been pretty with blue & brown but they went with gray and brown which I wouldn't wear together if I were picking out clothes.  and the gray is gray stripes.  u.g.l.y.- FIGHTING:  there is no divider between the kids so they fight & have full access to eachother.  Did I mention that the '60' kid has to share their extra cupholder with the '40' kid?  not condusive to peace.- DOORWAYS:  it fits through a door but I definitely would not take this thing to the mall & expect to get around clothing racks.  You'd be pushing and pulling the thing trying to get it to turn & it wouldn't fit anyway.- STORAGE:  looks good - I think I could actually fit some stuff down there.  I could easily and comfortably fit 2  filled paper grocery bags down there to give you an idea.  they would be easily accessable too.  storage is a plus.- HARNESS:  they kept the harness design where the 5 point part of it is not secure.  I don't know how to explain this properly - just think of it like this - there is only a 3 point harness.  this stroller does not have a 5 point harness  (it does but the top of the 5 point harness is not attached to anything so it's worthless.  which is neither bad or good, it's just an observation.  (actually it's only bad if you were hoping for a 5 point harness.- FOLDING & UNFOLDING: easy to do- WEIGHT & MATERIAL: you can lift it with one hand.  very nice weight!  ......oh, but the downside!  when you turn this stroller, the whole thing is made of plastic so you can feel the entire frame torque.  simply by turning a corner.  the frame twists & I'm just waiting for it to snap.  It won't but it feels like it will.  I don't think this stroller would last long with my use.anyhow, that's my review.  here's my take on other strollers:- gracos?  too difficult to steer- bob double?  kids are reclined & no trays & storage is hard to get to  (their trays are so poorly designed they are not worth buying)  I have the bob revolution ($450 incl. accessories, great but only takes 1 kid & no useful cup holder (I bought the cup holder & it's worthless & the seats don't sit straight up)- jane powertwin?  great for kids under 1 year old but the seats still have to be removed to fold it- baby jogger same problem as bob - kids are reclined  (& they don't  have good trays)- kolcraft tandem?  $200, it's a beast. super super heavy & you have to take the seats off (difficult) every time you fold it- peg perego pliko p3 ($350, still use it but hard to steer),- joovy caboose triple stroller ($400, too big for our suv - have to disassemble it for it to fit)my 2 favorites are the joovy ergo sit & stand (i wrote a review on that one on amazon) & my favorite  (which is the most perfect stroller I've ever tried & the only one Ill ever need) is the ridiculously expensive bumbleride twin (I wrote a review for that one too).	
1. 	You'll need this, for the diaper changes. Safely place the diaper, then the baby fold, hold and tuck. Great product, nice quality of material. Has storage place for few diapers and wipes (wipes are inside a supplied plastic container) and very, very useful while travelling. Only caveat, as the material is synthetic on top, in cold climate - placing the baby on it, welllll he/she might not like it! Could have had a cloth cover on top.	
- 1	I was disappointed with the quality of these after washing them the first time.  They looked like they had been through the washer a dozen times after just once.  After a couple more washes, they started really freying and falling about so I just stopped using them.  Very disappointed as these matched our bedding.	
1. 	I'm a new mom trying everything for the first time and I recieved the diaper genie(the new one) as a shower gift. It's very simple and easy to use after reading the very short directions. This product is a must for my house since I have 2 dogs that love to get into the trash. The only time I ever had problems with the cutting mechanism was when it was filled too much and no big deal I cut it with scissors. And now I empty it when it needs to be emptied and have no problem. I don't put all my son's diapers into the pail if the diaper is just wet sometimes I throw it into the regular trash. But this is definitely helpful when it's a smelling diaper. My house and my sons room do not smell at all.	
- 1	These covers were the only ones that I could find that would fit my changing pad (LA Baby 4-sided changing pad). They are made with poor materials, are too thin, stain, and both of mine snagged on my wedding ring every time I would pick up the baby, so there would end up being long strands of terry cloth hanging off of them everywhere. I cut one up and used it as a template to make my own changing pad covers out of old towels, that was the only good thing it did for me.	
1. 	As a newborn my daughter was fascinated by this, we had it clipped on her bassinet and it was one of the very few things which could distract her when she went through a colicky phase. Then she lost interest in it for a while but now at 3 months she has just rediscovered it. I also have the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion which she enjoys watching but I think she loves her Flutterbug even more. I just wish it played for longer as it only goes for about two minutes at a time. I just hope it's durable enough to withstand the constant rewinding - it seems pretty solid. It is nice to have a quality, entertaining mobile which doesn't cost a fortune in batteries.Edited to add: (July 2008) My daughter will be a year old next week and she STILL loves the Flutterbug. I don't think a single day has gone by that we haven't wound it up at least once or twice for her. She laughs and claps her hands and dances when you crank it up and it helps calm her down on the rare occasions she wakes up crying in the night (sometimes even just humming its little tune to her is enough). I would have to vote this the absolute best value for money out of everything we have had for her in this first year.	
1. 	This pillow is wonderful, so beneficial for every pregnant woman...it helps me to sleep better..	
1. 	I got this for a baby shower I was going to and the mother to be was thrilled.  Since the baby got to be old enough he's loved it too! The variety of activities is wonderful.  The colors and stimulation of sight, sound and touch are great.  I would recommend this.I had no problem with the shipping or getting the correct product.  For the record when someone has a problem with a particular seller that feedback is supposed to go in the seller feedback section, it doesn't mean it's a bad product.	
- 1	these hurt the upper lip of my baby. We went back to the round shaped green shoothie which are by no means a breathing danger.	
1. 	Great gate! We bought three gates in all, and this was one of the easiest to install. You don't have to screw it into the wall if you don't want. It's just by tension. It's been up for about two months, and it's held up great.	
- 1	Update: Changed my rating from a four to a two. My baby just outgrew these at a measly 12 lbs. By that I mean that I cannot snappi them using the jelly roll fold anymore--they are shrinking with every wash, so I would have to trifold them and lay them in the cover, which isn't ideal because my baby is still quite young and exclusively breastfed. This means I'd have poop exploding everywhere, and I cannot keep changing covers constantly. I'd say just go for cheap but durable SIZED prefolds from cottonbabies, diaper-rite or green mountain diapers. These covers are still great, though, even for smaller babies, so spring for some used ones.Ignore everything the tag says and wash these at least 10 times (with regular laundry, if you want to save water) before using and they are the SOFTEST prefolds. They do NOT fit newborns, however, since they are ridiculously large. I started using them comfortably after my skinny kid hit 9lbs. There is still a lot of bulk/folding down in the front/back. The covers are of extremely cheap quality, but they do the job. Double leg gussets would have helped, but they keep clothes dry, so that's all I care about. I bought four of these trial packs, as another reviewer suggested, and they are serving me well.	
1. 	I have 4 of these changing pad covers in Ecru and absolutely love them! They fit the pad perfectly and the color is great. It is very neutral and although light, does not show a lot of dirt. Also when my daughter has an accident, the pad absorbs the wetness but it does not seep through to the pad inself. I have washed the covers dozens of times and they have retained their quality and are still very soft. I would recommend washing them by themselves the first few times due to the lint they generate. The cover is very easy to change and has elastic on the edges so it stays on the pad securely, which is very important when you have a baby that moves as much as mine does.	
1. 	These aren't bad. A little awkward to use the clipper lever - it is very small even for my small hands and tends to slip. But I'm guessing this is just the case with all baby clippers. It's fairly easy to see what you're about to clip and you don't need to press very hard to cut the nail. My handle was green, unlike the white in the photo.	
- 1	I purchased this seat in March 2013 for my husband's vehicle, a 1999 Ford Explorer. We didn't want to spend as much money as we'd spent on the Britax Marathon 70 that is installed in my car, and the positive reviews I saw were encouraging. My disdain for this seat developed very quickly. Because my husband's vehicle doesn't have LATCH, we needed a seat belt install, and even though the seat belt locks, the locking retractor causes the seat to tip to one side. That isn't unsafe, but it drove me nuts putting my son in the seat and trying to get the harness secure. I also found the seat got loose over time. I finally used the locking clip to stop the tipping, which did a better job of keeping the seat tightly installed and upright. This was a minor annoyance, however.My biggest complaint are the harness straps: they twist very, very easily. This is caused by the vehicle's seat belt pushing up against the harness straps along the belt path. The harness is one continuous loop, so it's very easy for the sides to become uneven. It's a rethread harness, which isn't a huge problem when the seat is installed rear-facing, as it is in our vehicle, but would be really annoying if installed forward facing. You have to be very careful when rethreading the harness; the first time I put my son in it after doing so I tightened the harness and one of the straps came completely off the splitter plate.My husband was growing very impatient with my continuous fussing over the seat, but proper use is important to me and it's darn near impossible with the Tribute, at least for me in this vehicle. As it is, the seat has a short shell - a full inch less than his Britax seat. Our son was at about the 10-15th percentile for height until his 18 month check-up; he's hit a growth spurt and is now above average. The short shell means he is running out of room to be rear facing in this seat, something I did not expect when I bought it a year ago. He's not yet two, and I had hoped to keep him rear facing longer. So, given my hatred of this seat and the fact it won't work for us much longer, we replaced it with a Graco Headwise 70 for my husband's vehicle. I installed the Tribute in my parents' car with LATCH, and that was slightly easier. For ease of installation,the Britax is the hands down winner; the Headwise in my husband's vehicle (even with the seatbelt) is a close second.I don't have many positive things to say about the Evenflo Tribute. It is very light, and even though it's not well padded, my son has always seemed comfortable in it. That's about all I can think of.	
1. 	My husband and I bought this for our little girl's nursery. It's perfect; however, the amber lights are barely visible - even when the room is completely dark. Furthermore, the blue lights are not that great (although better than the amber ones). The best are the green stars. They are the most clear and most visible. Overall, we are very pleased with this product and would recommend it to others. Enjoy!	
- 1	I bought this product because I realized that my nipples were too small for the standard 25cm. This how ever was still a little too big at 22.5cm and so I was still having discomfort and inefficent pumping. So I have to spend more money to get the soft areola stimulators which reduce the size to 21cm. Pumping has been much better since I considered sending this product back back decided to keep as a back up. I reccomend that if you have small nipples pay the extra to get the silicone areola stimulators. Overall its an OK product if it fits you but if not its just a waste of time and energy for little result not to mention it hurts it it doesn't fit just right because of the hard plastic.	
1. 	I recently bought this chair to replace my 1-year-old daughter's high chair.  I LOVE it.  I was pulling my hair out cleaning the high chair after every meal, this chair is so easy to clean and much more versatile.Pros:-Really easy to clean - no cracks for the food to slide into (ahhhh)-Chair attaches very securely to any chair with a back, the chair will not slide off, nice long straps in case you have a big chair-The tray is close enough to the baby that not too much food gets on their lap or on the seat (there are three different places you can attach the tray depending on your baby's size)-The tray is smaller than high-chair trays and fits easily in sink or dishwasher-You can pull the tray off completely and just pull baby up to the table (different heights in case your table is high/low - MAKE SURE you get the one with the three trays (labelled as blue, actually has a blue tray with a white tray on top and green tray cover), Amazon makes it look like one chair that comes in three colors but the red/yellow and green chairs have only 1 tray and no height adjustment)-Chair is light and folds up easily, easy to carry to restaurant to use as a booster, etc.-The price is right:  there is absolutely no reason to spend $100+ on a high chair with a nice cushy seat that you will have to dig food out of for the next 2 years; that you will have to roll around your kitchen/dining room to get it out of your way. This seat is comfy, versatile and folds up very nicely when you want it out of the way.Cons:  If you have a really big baby, this may not be the chair for you. My daughter is ~22 pounds and fits fine, but if you have a big baby, his belly might start to push up against the tray, it only goes out so far.******* UPDATE **********My daughter is now 2 and still uses this booster chair everyday.  And I still love it.  She has tested the limits of this chair - tried to pull of the tray, tried to lunge out of the chair while the waist strap was still fastened, tried to rock herself out of the chair, etc.  She is VERY secure in the chair, and it is no worse for all the abuse.  She is about average size and still fits just fine.  She now recognizes that this is her eating chair and taking it with us to restaurants makes dining with a todder a less miserable experience.  Especially since she can't climb out like she can from the restaurant high chairs.	
- 1	I'm not sure why I thought this would be any different than it turned out to be, but it's just a piece of plastic. And it covers the place where the DVD slides in and out of the player. Baby wasn't more than 1.5 (probably less) and quickly figured out how to move the DVD player so that she could still push all the buttons. This product was not the solution. The solution was to put that DVD player out of reach. Why didn't I think of that first??	
1. 	Tub has yo be completely smooth for ours to stick. For that reason, we have to place it by the fosset, which is strangely low but my sons still likes it.	
1. 	We have tried so many sippy cups over the years and these are the best. My kids are 6 1/2 years apart and I used these sippy cups for my oldest. For my second child we used Nuk silicone spout cups for awhile but he kept chewing the spouts. They were getting expensive to replace. I tried other hard spout cups but he didn't like them. I remembered my daughter liking these and looked around but couldn't find them. Looked on Amazon and so glad that I found them. My son loves these. They are easy to clean, don't leak and he happily drinks out of them. I have ordered several packs of them. All have been the blue and green as pictured except my last order I got purple and orange prints. I highly recommend these cups.	
1. 	This is a child sized toilet.  It is attractive looking.  We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.  Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.  I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.  My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.  I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.  We are big fans of this.	
1. 	My little one gets so excited now when I pull this out of the car to go to the store. I started her in it when she was 6 months. I feel so comfortable with her in the cart now with the side cushions.	
- 1	This is getting good reviews and I don't see why? First of all it has the snack tray underneath the regular tray and it is too close to the child. It leaves no leg room. My son actually, scratched his leg on it and he hates when I put him in it. We have had it for about 6 months and the bigger he gets the less leg room he has. It is also easy to pinch their fingers when putting the big tray on. When I had the seat in a lower position he could bump his head on the side bar thing that is used for adjusting the height. It is a very dangerous chair. And I should return it since I am so unhappy with it. I hate everything about it except the seat is a nice large size. But, the legs are wobbly when the seat is extended to the top position. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HIGH CHAIR!! IT ALSO NEEDS MORE TOYS TO APPLY IF NEEDED. THE LITTLE POT IS OVER TO THE SIDE AND DOESN'T SERVE MUCH OF A PURPOSE FOR ENTERTAINMENT. MAYBE GOOD FOR CEREAL BUT THAT IS ALL!! AT THIS PRICE THEIR SHOULD BE SOME BELLS AND WHISTLES....	
1. 	Next to BR Max the monkey (also by Lamaze) and Zach's lovey, pupsqueak is his favorite toy. Zach is four months old and really really loves pupsqueak. We use him to give variety to our son and Zach really loves him! If we make pupsqueak squeak, Zach goes into hysterics, and my 20 month old twins join in! ITs perfect for those really silent times when everyone needs a good laugh. Along with Max, pups (what we call him) is perfect for tummy time. Pups is also great for teathing, once Zach really starts getting those teeth in! Pups attatches well to almost anything, but my boistrus ball of fire gets so angrey and fustrated if we tether him to anything, he likes to hold him. Pups is very durable and has been easily spot cleaned and even in the wash! The colors are great for my son to stare at and he just loves him. I dont know what it is about Lamaze toys but they sure do put alot of thought into them to make them so gosh darn cute and interesting!	
1. 	I wish I had bought something before he got his little teeth marks on his crib....but I found this product by reviews and I do think its a great product. I wish I had known it was only one strip and not the whole crib. Im pretty sure they sell it by the whole crib. But for the price, it should be the whole crib.	
1. 	My husband bought this when we got home from the hospital and my daughter sleeps good while she's all bundle up. I have peace of mind while she was sleeping because I know she's safe. My daughter used it until she start rolling.  It's a life saver....	
1. 	These arrived in terrific shape and were a great purchase for our nursery! They are pretty good sized (especially the large and medium) and will hold a lot of items! I have one just for shoes at the moment, one for small toys and books to keep baby entertained at the changing station, and am still getting organized so am not completely sure what the third will be for - probably other miscellaneous small items in need of a home; maybe socks and booties.	
1. 	I've bought other brands of sleep sacks, and regret doing so after I came across this one, which I think is the original sleep sack. I can see why it's the best selling one; it's cozy, thick, incredibly well-made, and doesn't pill/ball when stuck in the washing machine, which- let's face it- with a baby you are going to need to do quite often! My daughter's earlier sleep sacks have pilled like crazy, torn, and had zippers that were of such poor quality that they poked at her- which obviously defeats the purpose of having this blanket which should be helping put baby to sleep!	
- 1	Product description says these fit windows up to 40&#34;, but they do not. Our windows are 39&#34; (just the windows, not including the molding), and these were too small. Screws also horrible - do not take a standard sized screwdriver. Super annoying! About an hour wasted fiddling with this thing before coming to impass. Also, quality of construction appears poor.	
- 1	Too big. After using a friends, I'm going to buy the Kalencom instead. Its WAY smaller and is really easy to use	
1. 	I love this toy. I've used it for my 2 girls and so far there is no show of wear! LOVE IT!!	
- 1	Bowl is made from a clear light blue plastic and is very tiny. This bowl in the picture is totally different.	
- 1	medela changed their nipples.  I am not sure why because even though my son liked this nipple and latched onto it easily, it flowed WAY too fast and I had no control to help slow down the flow.  I have like 8 of these nipples because I did not want to cause nipple confusion but was never really able to use them.  I am not the first to complain about it.  The manager in the store that I about one from told me that she too has endless complaints about the nipple and did not recommend that bought it especially at the price.  However because I HAD to try it,  i bought it.	
- 1	Maybe I got a defective one...? The coloring of the spout on this started to fade as if the coloring was leaking out or being washed away. I only handwashed this for about a month. It started out blue and now it's almost colorless... Not sure why this is happening but it concerns me that my 7 month old is putting her mouth on a part with coloring that fades...***Update***I reordered another NUK Learner Cup, this time with the silicone spout and I love that the spout is clear and color free!! No more strange discoloring =]	
1. 	I got this as a gift at my shower.. Itis beautiful, and if you have the money to spend, then go right ahead and get one. I personally would not have purchased it, because before my baby reached three months she had already outgrown it.  Thank heavens she was starting to sleep in her room, else she would be in bed with us every night, which I am not too keen on.Yes, it is beautiful, but I guess I wouldn't pay so much for something which will be outgrown so fast.	
1. 	I originally used those Munchkin bags that come in the holder in my son's diaper bag but I soon realized that they were small and you didn't get much for what you paid. They didn't have handles to tie and I didn't like that feature either. At home we were just using a regular garbage to throw them in but it STUNK! So I started my search for a new product and found these at our local Kmart! Needless to say....I LOVE THESE! I wish I would've found these sooner. Now they don't work well for in the diaper bag because they are all folded into the box and I would get annoyed having a bunch of random bags thrown in there but for at home use they are awesome! They are cheaper than a Diaper Genie too. Here are some things I like about these bags:1. They have a handle for easy carrying and closing the bag2. They are bigger. They hold all the wipes we used PLUS the messy diaper3. They do not smell up the room they are stored in. We just throw them in the bag and toss it in the laundry room garbage. No stinky diapers! (We have left them in there for 1 week till garbage day and they haven't stunk)4. They are excellent for potty training! My son is now 3 and only wears a pull up to bed at night so we only use one bag a day. You do the math on that deal! ;)Overall, they have a baby powder smell so they absorb odors and are just overall a great deal. I highly recommend them for anyone who has a child in diapers or are potty training.	
1. 	These are great little bibs.  The waterproof material is sandwiched between 2 layers of terry material which is much nicer then the typical plastic backed waterproof bib. These soak up tons of drool and/or milk keep my little guy dry. The bright colors are fun and are able to be coordinated with many outfits.  These wash up nicely and months later are still looking great.	
1. 	I bought these cups after seeing them at day care. I thought I would stick to the same type. And they are quite good.Pros:-Easy to hold-Easy to clean- Resistant- BPA free-Microwaveable- When it falls the spout tends to stay clean because it is not positioned on the edgeCons:-Every time I screw the top in, few drops of water or milk come out. I still can't figure this out. It is a bit annoying but not a big deal.-There is no indication of the oz but i don't think it is really necessary at this age	
- 1	I was really excited to get this in because we had similar items with several of our other children and never used icky restaurant high chairs.  This one is awful! The pad is held on by three loose pieces of elastic on the top, leaving the pad to flop around.  There is a rounded part bulging out all around the outer edge on the inside of the seat back, pushing the child's head forward if the child is small.  The three-point restraint is utterly useless, as the straps loosen up with any kind of movement and they aren't secure at all.  The restraint system will certainly not hold a wiggly child in.  The tray is a very tight fit and difficult to put on. I paid six dollars extra just to get it in pink instead of tan, what is the reason for it to be so much more on such a cheap item?  We have had many high chairs and booster seats through raising seven children, but this is truly one of the worst baby items I've ever purchased.  I find myself wondering who tested this product and said it was of good enough quality to be sold. My husband took one look at it and said, Send it back!	
- 1	While I think this item is a nice thing to give someone as a shower gift I'm not sure too many parents will wish they had one.The idea is great - pop your dropped on the floor pacifier into the item and in minutes you have a clean, germ free bink ready to pop into the little guys mouth.My biggest issue with it is - how do I know that it's really at least as clean as holding it under the hot water for a minute - I don't have a microscope to take a look so I guess I need to be the trusting sort of person that just takes the manufacturers word for it - If that's you than order away!	
- 1	With baby #2 on the way, we are in the market for a double stroller. We have loved our Bugaboo Frog (a hand-me-down) and naturally thought the Donkey would be the way to go, given our past success with the brand and the reputation. Plus it just looks so much nicer than all the other side-by-side doubles.I didn't want to spend $1,700 (this base plus the duo kit plus the various accessories) on something I hadn't test driven, so we went to a store and brought our older child with us. Much to my intense surprise, he is already tall enough that we could not comfortably extend the canopy (his head was level with where the canopy meets the top of the seat). I normally don't review items I do not own, but as I had not seen this mentioned previously I thought it would be important to point out.My son is in the 80th percentile for height with a long torso, but he's only two and a half, and one would hope that a stroller would last until at least age 4 or so--and it's rated for 38 lbs, so it seemed reasonable to think my 27lb kid would fit!If I were expecting newborn twins, I'd probably go for this as it's so pretty and conveniently sized and the options are fantastic. Plus I love how Bugaboos handle and think they are incredible versatile. But we can buy a less attractive double stroller that is the same width for 1/3 the price without cramping our older child or having to deal with the ridiculousness of folding up a Bugaboo (you'd really think they'd have fixed that by now).	
- 1	does not fit my stove properly at all based on knob location and the little window in the door. it's kinda rigged on there, plus the kid can reach around the edges. may be returning it, but haven't decided yet.	
1. 	This is a very cute and soft chew toy for babies.  My son loves it, I love the fact that it is not plastic! It also makes for some cute photo ops!	
1. 	I myself didn't purchase this but it was on my registry.  I'm going to keep it short but sweet.  Easy to use, easy to clean, I'm in control which makes it more comfortable and it's a great price (same with accessories).  I highly recommend this product.	
1. 	love these!  i use with california baby diaper area wash and love the results.  no waste and no nasty chemicals.	
1. 	Good size (36 x 36), durable, sturdy.  Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition; that's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen.	
1. 	I got this because of all the positive reviews on Amazon. The music is great, not annoying at all. Baby really loves the mirror and all the different toys that hang. I've caught him chewing on the giraffe's tail on occasion, too, which is pretty entertaining. Now that he can sit up, he likes to sit and reach for the butterflies, which is really cute, too. He's had this since 4 1/2 months and really enjoyed it then and still does now.	
1. 	This gate does its job for the price.  It is not the best quality gate out there, but it works.  We have it in our doorwary leading to the garage.  We like that it is low enough for us adults and older kids to step over.	
- 1	Great idea but won't suction to our wood table or formica counter top.  Only suctions to smooth plastic top of highchair. And have to resuction to highchair several times during meal.	
- 1	If it wasn't for the fact this stroller has nice padding for the child and the handles, a nice cargo basket and a cup holder, this would be getting 0 stars.  I purchased this stroller for obvious functional reasons but a main selling factor for me was the color.  I hate the strollers that are all one color but this one is not mint.  Don't be fooled.  It's more like nasty seaweed green.  The color up top is not a pinkish peachy tone, it's a dreary tan.  The brown is dark chocolate brown.  In other words, it's ugly to say the least and I checked the color on multiple monitors just on the chance my monitor was off and they all looked the same.  To make matters worse when you put the seat section down so your child can drop their legs down, it doesn't even go back far enough to allow the child to put their feet on the cross belt which is the whole purpose of the cross belt.  The seat itself has no support.  Basically it would be no different than your child sitting on a hammock.  Sure there's bars a couple inches down lower but like I said, sagging under the tush is bound to occur.  I don't want to know how much stitching will pull away when the child weighs more and puts more pressure on the seat.  And yes the strap for the crotch is super short.  This will never work for an older or bigger child.	
- 1	I'm actually not a fan of these bottles, but for me, the problem lies moreso with the nipple. My son spent half his energy trying to suck the formula out of them. Even after going up a size, it didn't seem to make a difference. I gave up after a few feedings. Also, when he did manage to actually eat, he would still get fussy and gassy- an issue these bottles claim to reduce. In my opinion, there are better bottle options out there.	
1. 	These bibs are great. They're soft, a good size (not too big or too small) and waterproof but completely terry covered (unlike cheaper bibs that have exposed vinyl on the back). I'd give them five stars, but I dislike that these are considered &#34;Boys&#34; even though they're all just basic colors and don't include pink or purple. I also think it's odd that two of them are almost the exact same color.	
1. 	This swaddle is A+ when trying to keep your little one in. My son is a mover and can get out of most swaddles, but this one really keeps him in! There are arm ties to help keep babies arms down, and the extra long wrap helps keeps a tight swaddle, even when baby moves. One of the nicest functions is that it does NOT have velcro, which I find to be annoying if your baby doesn't fit the mold of what size the swaddle is intended for. It also prevents ruining other clothes when you wash it.	
- 1	I had ordered this blanket a few months ago, and wanted to order a third for my baby to have at daycare. The Taggies I received, sold from The Pro Store, is not the real deal.  First, the material is fleece on this blanket, not boa as stated in the description.  There are also only four tags on each side, not five (16 total).  The product tag says &#34;my taggies&#34;, where the authentic item says &#34;Taggies&#34;. I will be attempting to return this item and will report to Amazon if possible.	
1. 	The Snoogle is a very cuddly and comfortable pillow for the legs and belly. It was nice that it came with cover.	
1. 	Each time i open and have a warm wipe in between my hands, i feel better and glad or this purchase. Before having it, my daugther was shaking when i cleaned her with a cold one. Now, we r enjoying to change diapers	
1. 	This is a great seat protector.  Our son spilled a milk shake in the car and it dripped through the car seat onto the mat.  The mat saved our upholstery and cleaned up with a damp rag!  Great!  It is very thick and sturdy, and the car seat does not slide when placed on it.  It also keeps your vehicle seat from getting indentations from the car seat as well.  It also covers the whole seat top to bottom.  I accidentally bought a Kiddopotamus cover for our younger son thinking it was this one and it doesn't go all the way up the back of the seat to protect it from indentations from the car seat...plus it's not as thick as this one.	
1. 	I love these cups. I take out the valve so the water flows freely. It's one of the only cups my daughter will use. Great size (not to big or small) and they hold up well over time.	
1. 	Great product. My newborn baby was swallowing the formula very fast when I used the 3 months size so I ordered this one. It is just perfect.Love it.	
- 1	Don't waste your money.  Go get a washcloth... wet it...and put it in your freezer.  It is the exact same as what this is.  I didn't listen to this advice and wasted my money- but I really wish i Hadn't.  Take it from me, just go get a washcloth lol	
1. 	This little thing could not have been more perfect for what I wanted and my daughter needed. I bought it when she was about 8 months old and just had her sit on it before bathtime while I got the water running to get used to having it in her environment. She went #1 and #2 on her first sit. Since then, she is now 13 months old and nearly every time we sit her on it, she goes #1. We're still only using it to allow her to adapt to its presence since they don't have potties for her to use at daycare, but I absolutely love this potty and so does she!The only one thing that has given us a hard time is that she has figured out how to scoot around on it which was making it more of a vehicle than a potty. I read another reviewer that just put some no-slip type of gripper on the bottom so I gave it a shot. It solved the problem and we are back to happily going in her potty.I highly recommend it! It looks incredibly comfortable and my little lady is very tall for her age. She has no problem sitting on it or using it to do her business. We all love it! Also, I was able to pack it in my suitcase when we went to grandma's so that's a huge plus!	
1. 	I cannot tell you how easy this makes pumping when you're on the go!  I use these at work so i don't have to bring everything into the bathroom to clean afterwards and love this...	
1. 	This seat was great when our baby was a newborn. As soon as she started rolling over she could just roll out of the seat. Very dangerous.	
1. 	These cups are perfect for my toddler.  Generally no spills even if it flips upside down and lands on the floor.  I can allow my daughter to drink on her own and not worry.  I don't throw them away just reuse them for months until the straws get too chewed up and buy some more.  I highly recommend.	
- 1	I purchased this potty seat for my 2 1/2 year old son.  While the quality is excellent, it simply doesn't function as a potty seat for my little boy.  Considering there is no shield for urine, and given the size of the opening, the pee would just go all over the floor and not in the potty at all.  Will have to send this one back and purchase another seat with a shield for little boys.	
- 1	Considering I paid over $350 for this stroller, it was a total disappointment. I was expecting more especially after reading all of the great reviews. Two issues: The design of it overall was just poor and the materials it was made of was cheap.	
1. 	Your basic, sturdy little potty. Kids don't need all the flashy crap on the more expensive potties. The big toilet doesn't cheer or play princess music when you pee. Why set them up for disappointment? ;PMy son has no butt so he kind of doesn't fit on it and gets scared but maybe eventually his butt will get bigger or he'll get over it. Who knows haha.	
1. 	I have a medal banister on my stairs and have been having a lot of trouble getting a gate to fit. The kidco gate in combination with the Y Spindle has given me a safe and secure option for the bottom of my stairs.	
- 1	my now 6 mo old son has been using it for almost 2 months now. He likes the toys that come with the seat, but that's the only things he likes about this seat. Here are some of the cons that I observed:1) the harness won't stay tight after being tightened. The buckles are poorly made that the length of the straps won't be locked. That means the harness is loosened easily when baby moves his body.2) the blue saucer pan that holds the toys does not rotate smoothly. Baby won't be able to move it around, so the parents have to rotate it for the baby to play with all the toys. I think it is misleading to state it allows 360 degrees of fun.3) the back is quite low that this is not suitable for babies without good head and neck control.4) my biggest complain is that the underside of the blue saucer pan is full of sharp ridges and crevices. My son always move his legs around and his feet always get caught by the crevices. We have to put socks on him to avoid his feet being cut by the sharp edges. Also, parents have to hold down the child's legs in order to turn the saucer pan around, otherwise the child's feet get hurt when the saucer pan is being turned.My son can never sit in this for more than 10 mins. I don't know if the seating area is not comfortable or what. So overall I don't think this seat does everything that the manufacturer says it does. I don't think the design is well thought of, and the materials are quite cheaply made.	
- 1	We bought these for our 3-year-old son, who is in underwear but still has lots of accidents, to cut down on leakage when we're places where a damp child might be unwelcome. They only &#34;sort of&#34; work; if we catch the accident right away, the pants can hold some of it, but if we wait even 5 minutes there's a total deluge with or without the plastic pants. The pants can actually make cleanup harder, as they are one more thing to wash, and as my son views them as an almost-diaper, he tends to have more accidents with them on. I think psychologically, some kids react to an article of clothing that reminds them of diapers. So these were not a good solution for us.Also, the sizes run GINORMOUS. My son wears size 4T shirts & underpants, and the 2T plastic pants were still so huge and puffy on him that he probably needed the 18-month size.As for using these as low-budget cloth diaper covers, I cloth diapered our son for 2 years and I can't imagine how messy and inconvenient these covers would have been. If there is poop, there is no easy way to get the diaper out of the cover because the cover doesn't have side closures. Poop smears must be common. I also don't think the leg elastics are strong enough to contain what an infant or toddler puts out. You can get Proraps or another basic cover with Velcro side closures and far superior durability for about $8 a pair. Don't waste money on these.	
- 1	I tried this on my Britax car seat. Here are the issues:- Its hard to put on while holding an infant- We live in the South and it does not deflect the heat, in fact I feel like it makes the seat hotter than without-It feels cheaply made	
- 1	Pros: bags close nicelyCons:  The lid on this is difficult to open with one hand (and usually there's a diaper in your other hand).  Also the lid gets stuck when you try to close it, especially of the bag is more than 1/2 full.  You have to push very hard to get it to close and I'm worried that the lid will break (the cheap plastic starts to bend).  Also, we have to take the bags out of the unit to be able to fill them all the way.Nice idea, but the manufacturing sucks.  It doesn't work at all.	
- 1	This warmer broke after only 2 months of use. It as extremely hot on the bottom and every time you grab a wipe,it opens so you end up having to use two hand to operate. The whole warmer is quite heavy and when moved it's cumbersome, not for easy diaper changes in another room. Only wipes that worked in it were Pampers, all other we have to pull out by opening it. What a waste of money! I have since purchased a Munchkin Warmer and was VERY pleased with that one thus far. That model has a lock on the door, as to not fly open every time you grab a wipe!	
- 1	I loved the idea of reusable labels for my daughters bottles, but after a few uses, they went downhill.  At first, it was really easy to write her name, but once I erased it a few times, it got harder and harder to write.  Also, the ink never fully came off, so I was just constantly writing over smeared ink.  Now I'm just using painters tape and a sharpie and it's a lot easier.	
1. 	By reading the other reviews, I wonder.... To me this is the ONLY thing I could use.  I hate the idea of the baby soaking in the same water I used to washed her.  We have a pot with warm water next to me and sat the baby bather on my bathroom sink.  I closed the door and kept the bathroom warm until we were done.  We have a big bathroom and I dressed her on the ocuntertop.Now she is 6 months and I still sit her on it.  Now I use an inflatable tub underneath it.  still the water runs out into the sink, but the countertop is too hard so we take her into the room to dress her.  For me, this is a great product!AHH! when we know we will be outdoors, we use it as our baby's chair.  since it is meshy, it helps her stay cool.  She is a summer baby.	
- 1	I'm bummed because this is the first bottle my baby has been able to latch onto easily, but the slow flow is much too fast for her.  She ends up crying because too much fills up on her mouth.  I went and bought more, twice, thinking maybe I had bought malfunctioning ones or something.  Unfortunately not, they are all way too fast flowing.  When the milk is warm and I turn the bottle over it doesn't even drip, it actually sprays out.  Not for us. I'll give it 2 stars only because my baby has a good latch on the nipple.	
- 1	Although the transaction went smoothly, I have a problem with the product itself. When I bought the item, I thought what a good deal I got, until it arrived. The shields do not hold a shape. They are sticky and flimsy. These are better left in the trash.	
1. 	I was looking for a gate to go on wrought iron stair railings (wrought iron on both sides of the gate) and noticed that most gates need special attachments for this, or just won't work at all on railings.  I couldn't believe when I stumbled upon this one - the price was just amazing and it came with all the necessary parts!This gate is easy to install - you basically attach 4 &#34;holders&#34; using either screws or sticky tape.  The holders are just areas that the gate uses as pressure points - they keep the gate from moving around while it's in place.  I did it by myself and it took a total of 15 minutes.Once the holders were installed, you just put the gate in using the pressure mounting system.  This is a little annoying since you need to make sure the gate is perfectly aligned with the holders, and it's a bit difficult to do alone.Taking the gate down is very easy (pull and turn the lever to release the pressure lock, then close it and put it to the side).Because it's annoying to put the gate up though, we end up not using it as often as we should.  It would be a perfect gate for low traffic areas, but in high traffic, it's just a pain to keep putting it back on.  It takes at least 2-3 minutes to attach it properly (maybe a little less if you have help from somebody else)So while this gate is great for what it is, it doesn't fully serve my purposes which is why I had to give it 4 stars.I will have to buy another gate for the bottom of my stairs, but I will keep this one to be used at a lower-traffic location.	
1. 	Nice quality, fits well, and easily tailored to fit my application with little effort.  Appear to be durable and safe!	
1. 	Cleans easy, vents great, works perfect for newborns.  These bottles also fit into standard size heating element.  Easy to fit into the mouth as well.  Lovely new invention!	
- 1	These are ok. They do their job for the most part but their size is small, I think. Lots of times when my LO poops, it goes off of the liner, so the diaper gets stained and needs rinsing anyways. Also, they are expensive for what they are, you could buy this fabric at the craft store for a lot less and have a lot more liners custom cut to your preferred size. I have used plain flannel cut larger and this works really nicely although it is not stay dry.	
1. 	This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.	
1. 	Love this! We were looking for an easy high chair option. I was checking out super expensive options and was a bit overwhelmed. I ordered this just to see... it was EXACTLY what we needed. No regrets and very excited to have saved a few hundred dollars:)//update: the tray insert got a little warped in the dishwasher (despite being dishwasher safe). No biggie except our 8 month old can now EASILY pry it off and wave it around (fun times!). I contacted Fisher-Price and - get this - they are sending a whole new seat (they didn't have just the tray in stock). How awesome is that?!	
- 1	My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds.  I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)	
1. 	I cannot imagine my daughter sleeping with out her wearable blanket.  It keeps my 20 month old daughter comfortable and she sleeps through the night because she doesn't get cold.	
- 1	I am a super busy mom of a toddler and a crawler. I have no time for reviewing stuff, but i simply had to speak up. I purchased this product in mid 2009, perhaps improvements have been made, but here are my gripes:1) Clear plastic cover over tray was IMPOSSIBLE to get off.2) Tray itself never sat properly in the circular niches on either side so it was always wobbly3) While it's visually appealing, hip, something you'd like to have in your house along with all your real grown up furniture (as it will be a fixture for at least a few years, right?) it looks AWFUL now. The espresso finish Im guessing was a poor choice, but the finish dings and nicks and looks like it's been through world war III at this point. I uploaded a couple of pics.4) there are about 800 allen wrench screw that allow for major adjustments as your kid grows, a good thing, but they loosen over time, and every few months you have to DIG THE GROSS FOOD out of each screw (and i DO wipe this thing down thoroughly each time my son eats!)  so you can fit the allen wrench in (if you can FIND WHERE YOU PUT IT) and tighten each screw. I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THS SILLINESS.5) and there are a million OTHER crevices for food to collect, I have to take it outside and scrub it with a TOOTHBRUSH on occasion just to get it clean.I went with the oxo for my 2nd son, and am far more pleased...so far.	
1. 	My daughter's daycare has this rocker and she absolutely adores it. She loved it so much that I bought one for at home too. She loves the vibration of Fisher- Price items better than the other companies. She's the kind of baby that likes as much motion as possible, so being able to turn on the vibration setting and rock her at the same time is great! I also love that when she's older, it will still serve a purpose instead of being outgrown when she's around 6 months old. She absolutely adores the rainforest bouncy seat. Fisher- Price has really hit the nail on the head with this one.	
- 1	Smells..okay.The scent seems short-lived. I don't smell it ever since I put it in the diaper pail lid. Eh. Would not repurchase.	
1. 	Everything was as expected. Great bottles for a reasonable price - better than what I have found in local stores. I have no complaints and would recommend to others.	
- 1	You have to keep winding this which is a big pain for me.  Other than that my little one likes it.	
1. 	Love this! It gives me much more peace of mind than throwing a blanket over the carseat. This keeps baby extremely warm, maybe too warm, baby only needs a few layers not a coat in this. I looked at other bundle me's but I loved this one bc it is waterproof - we had to go to his 2 month checkup and it was raining, the drops stayed on the fabric and didn't soak through. It fits good on our Graco Snugrider 32 carseat in Zurich.	
1. 	After our twins got too big for baths in the sink but still too small to just sit in a tub, we were at a loss.  All of tubs we saw were meant for one kid and we were hoping to be able to give them baths at the same time.  I finally saw the EuroBath and decided to try it out.  It worked fantastically!  One baby had to recline while the other partially sat up, but we could finally give them baths at the same time.  We've been using it for several months now with no problems whatsoever.  Our kids love it and so do we!	
1. 	For one year to start a good dental hygiene, he loves having his gum massaged, it also gives a refreshing taste.	
- 1	The dog is cute and my daughter liked it until it broke during the second use. I was never a big fan as the leash is short and the backpack itself does not open from outside or hold much of anything.	
- 1	I purchase this wrap when my son was a newborn in hopes of replacing my Moby Wrap. While I love the Moby, it is SO HOT. I live in Georgia and my son was born in the spring. I needed a lighter fabric that would be comfortable in the humid ninety-plus degree heat.The fabric is much lighter weight and much cooler than the moby. It's also beautiful colors and I received many complements on it in the few times that I have used it.However, it is not nearly as comfortable as the Moby Wrap. The Moby is made of a soft stretchy cotten that is soft on my skin and baby's. With this wrap, the edges dug into my shoulders the heavier my son became. It also seemed to rub under his legs.This wrap was useful to me while he was small enough to keep his legs tucked into the wrap (until about 8 weeks). Up to that point he was not heavy, so it didn't rub my shoulders. My son is now 18 pounds at 4 months and I can no longer use it. It was far too expensive for such little use.* I followed the instructions on the DVD, but some people may be able to tie the wrap to avoid the problems that I had. I purchased a Beco rather than continue experimenting with this wrap. It's so much easier.	
1. 	This is the best sleepsack out there. It's reasonably priced and it works great for us. So far we own 6 Halo sleepsacks in different sizes, and if I were to buy more, they'd definitely be the same brand.	
1. 	My daughter loves to do everything she can to make her sippy cups leak and make a huge mess.  After I opened these to test them out, the first thing she did was turn it over and start shaking it....and NO LEAKS.  Hallelujah!	
- 1	Note: When we first got this, we opened it out and let it air out for 3 days because it has a very strong vinyl/plastic-y type smell.  I absolutely could not imagine placing a developing newborn in such a strong chemical area for resting and breathing when you first open this.First, the manufacturer instructions state to use this for only 3 months max or when your newborn starts to roll or move around.  Well, in our Pack n Play crib, our newborn could squirm 90 degrees or more when swaddled.The primary reason I gave this 1-star is because the folding contraption is a hard-plastic-scissor-type hinge.  There's a thin layer of mesh or vinyl that separates this from your newborn baby's head.  Just tapping the side (from the inside) with your knuckle hurts, since it is hard-plastic.  I can't imagine a newborn squirming or rolling their head into the hard hinge.  Combined with the strong initial chemical smell and hard plastic hinge, I can't allow myself to give this more than 1-star.But I also don't like the practicality.  Not only does it have a short shelf life, we find that when we visit friends or the grandparents, a large bed surrounded by pillows is the most convenient.  Our newborn's squirming radius is far away from the closest pillow, plus newborns can't crawl or sit up, so we feel it is safe.  Sure, this is a travel bassinet, but in practicality, its just one more larger item you have to remember to tote around, whereas, everyone we visit has a large bed surface we can use in lieu of.We also thought it might be okay for those co-sleeping nights when she won't cooperate in her Pack n' Play or crib, but because of the hard-plastic hinge and design, we don't want to use this.I almost feel this was over-engineered with the hard-plastic frame.  This could have easily been done somehow with the soft foam type material used for those soft rectangular ice coolers.  They have no rigid plastic, yet still stand up and hold their shape.Unfortunately, for all the reasons above, I have to give this 1-star.	
- 1	I've had a few Belkin audio products and all of them have broken within a month or two at most. I tried this with high hopes that their video division is another animal entirely.Well, it might be, but that animal is at present wounded and lying under a tree wondering when the software folks are going to get their um stuff together.Like most everyone else here, the app for this ain't working for us. Freezes, goes buggy, or just won't even connect. And when wifi connectivity is the basic premise of your product, that spells one star.Belkin is doing a great job at making a bad name for themselves. I guess they sell their stuff semi-cheap at MallWart for a reason.	
- 1	I wish I could give this zero stars. I purchased this at the local Walmart. I gave it to my five month old to chew on. It's not his favorite teether, but he uses it from time to time. I guess he got it far enough back that it lodged in his throat and induced gagging and choking. I immediately pulled it out, but he already started vomiting and this started gagging and choking on his own vomitus. The whole ordeal of trying to stabilize him lasted 10 minutes. He turned red at one point and could not breath. We called EMS and thankfully, he was better by the time they got here. It's supposed to help the back teeth, but it goes far enough back that it can induce gagging and vomiting. It is a choking hazard! I've emailed the company and have called and I am waiting for a call back. This product is not safe for babies and I do not recommend it.	
1. 	My daughter absolutely LOVES this bouncer! She kicks & gets all excited as I put her in it. There are two settings, one with continual lights and music, the other is activated by kicking on the bottom (where their feet are). It keeps her very entertained & is a great help for me to get things done if I need to. The seat also has a vibration setting for the seat itself...sometimes she even falls asleep in it while watching the lights & the soothing vibration relaxes her. I highly recommend this seat.	
- 1	They shrunk after the first washing so they no longer fit the mattress. We are now using them to cover the top of the Christmas tree	
- 1	I've had 3 other monitors, and this is by far the worst. And the others were even less expensive, so you can't say it's good for the price. There is always a loud static sound, no matter where you are, and the 'out of range' beeping is super annoying and went off when I was in the next room! How is that out of range? This monitor is definitely being returned asap.	
1. 	This is the perfect on the go feeding bib.  It rinses easy in the sink when we get home, had a pocket to catch falling food, and dries quickly.  It even protects clothing more that others I've tried.	
1. 	I was almost ready to give up breastfeeding and resort to full-time pumping before I tried these. My nipples were extremely sore, raw, and tender, and I would tear up whenever my son latched on. It was ruining the whole breastfeeding experience for me, and I felt so guilty! I got these SoftShells and within a few days my nipples felt a million times better. They keep the nipple erect, which helps with latching, and the air-circulation has healed the cracks and raw areas. They are a little awkward to get used to at first (think of wearing a 'cup' on your boobs), but I find that they are pretty discreet under my clothes, especially when worn with a nursing bra/top. My only complaint is that the cups can fill up sometimes (if you have a let down between feedings), and if you're not careful you can leak out when you bend over or to the side, even with the foam inserts. So be sure to check them, like whenever you go to the restroom. Its amazing how much milk can collect in them... Small inconvenience compared to how beneficial these SoftShells are!! Don't give up on breastfeeding ladies!	
1. 	Being very pregnant, I know I am supposed to sleep on my side. But I simply cannot do it on my own and always wake up flat on my back. This pillow kept me on my side for probably 70% of the time (just a rough estimate based on how I find myself when I wake up). I am thankful for that.	
- 1	I do not actually hate this item, but my child does and hasn't once used it despite being quick to potty train. It doesn't feel sturdy in our particular toilet ring (it pops fully into the potty only once my child has sat on the seat), and though that is not the fault of the maker, it's been a total no-go for us. A stepstool and toilet seat reducer have solved our problems!	
1. 	We much prefer these over bags.  We have had several bags that have leaked on us, no matter how careful we are with closure, and never have these storage bottles leaked.  My husband has requested that the bags be sent to daycare and he keep the bottles!  He has mentioned that after defrosting, the transfer from bag to bottle is much less delicate and leads to more spillage.  I am about to order more of these bottles, so I can eliminate the use of bags entirely.  I also like that they are reusable and I'm not throwing away lots of plastic storage bags.  The small size is nice, and allows us to more precisely control our breast milk supply for less waste, which is nice because I am not a super-producer of milk.  Oh!  And I have an Ameda pump and while I mostly use the Ameda bottles with it, these fit on to my pump as well.	
1. 	I was happy to see that this is actually a Medela item in its original packaging. I was unable to find a replacement ice pack for my 5 year old pump in style model until I found this one. This was exactly what I needed!	
1. 	Bought matching crib and changing table.  Nice color and sturdy.  Is assembled but not in use yet (baby only 6 weeks old) but look forward to using it.	
- 1	I was satisfied with this product (good padding, easy to use) except my son was able to rip them right off table corners.  It needs a stronger adhesive, otherwise it is worthless and baby then tries to teeth on it, and it can be ripped apart with teeth and cause a choking hazard.  I never put them on anything after trying one table.	
- 1	There are a few reasons why I hate these training pants.1) The pocket isn't sewn very wide (and is actually TAPERED--so the pocket gets skinnier and skinnier the further it goes) so it's hard to stuff with...anything, really. I've had to fold everything in half, which just adds a lot of bulk. My son hates wearing these.2) The design is really weird. When you get these on the poor kid, they look fine from the front but the back just looks ridiculous! My son has a puffier butt in these than he does with cloth diapers!! Weird design. I really don't like it.3) Leaks. Always. I know it's not a fit issue and I've stuffed these with every type of material out there. We always have leaks. And we only put these on my son during nap time--AFTER having him got potty beforehand. Completely useless.4) HOLY HANNAH, THEY STINK!! I think it's the material the inner lining is made of. Oh my goodness, do these retain smells!! NONE of my other cloth diapers or training pants stink after being washed. I wash these with all the rest - so no different treatment - and these come out smelling like they did before being washed! They LOOK clean...but they smell AWFUL.Bottom line - these are a waste of money. Hard to stuff (which is why I bought them in the first place - so I could stuff them for nap time), weird puffy butt design, leaks, stinky. Bad investment. Glad I only bought one to test it out!	
1. 	These are a huge hit with my one year old son.  We received these cars as a gift when my son was first born.  He started taking a real interest in them when he was about seven months old and still plays with them every day.  They are simple, durable, do not require batteries, and are easy to clean.  We've traveled a lot with my son and these make terrific travel toys as they pack up easily and don't take up much space since they nest.  The smallest car rattles and is the perfect size for little hands.	
- 1	I chose these bottles specifically for the shape of the nipple.  Since I was planning on nursing I felt Tommee Tippee bottles were as close to the shape of a human breast as I could find.  The extra parts didn't bother me although the super-wide shape of the bottles made them a little bulky for the diaper bag.  I was not able to nurse and I used these bottles for three months before making the decision to switch to another brand.  The biggest issue was the leaking.  Now, when I say leaking I don't mean from the bottle itself, I never had a problem with that.  My issue was that my son couldn't seem to get a good seal around the nipple and it was a constant leak out of the side of his mouth.  I always had to have a burp cloth handy to wipe his face, chin and neck several times per feeding.  We found another brand that doesn't seem to have the same issue and we've switched to that brand.  I might POSSIBLY use this brand with my next one if I breastfeed, but I would not readily recommend this brand, especially in situations where nipple confusion is not an issue.	
- 1	this nasal aspirator is a waste of money, doesnt work for us.Like another reviewer said, I wish I could give this 0 stars.For me the best nasal aspirator is the most simple, a pigeon manual aspirator.If you want an advice, dont waste your money on this! Is a very weak aspirator...	
- 1	We registered for these and I thought they'd be a cute alternative to using a cloth diaper as a burp cloth. We used them once or twice, laundered them, and now they sit in the drawer.  They're wash cloths with a pretty piece of cloth stitched to one side.  Not quite big enough if your baby is even half as wiggly as our little guy.  They're not even that absorbent and the wash cloth is quite rough. The pretty material shrank up a bit, too, so now the cloth puckers on the sides because one side is smaller than the other.If you're looking for burp cloths, your best bet by far is a cloth diaper- they're soft, absorbent, launder really well, and can take lots of abuse and still last forever.  Gerber makes a 12 pack that doesn't cost too much more than a pack of four of these non-functional burp cloths.	
- 1	We used to have Britax sunshades to keep on the two middle windows, but they've lost their clinginess this past year. My wife drives our daughter to daycare in the mornings, and the route has the sun shining directly onto their faces, so we needed replacements immediately.I installed this one on the left window just to test it out. The clips on the top are somewhat thin, and I thought they'd break off eventually. However, I did like that this shade covered more of the window than our previous Britax ones did.When I closed the door after successfully installing the shade, though, I heard the plastic clatter against the window. I thought it was the window at first, so I immediately removed the shade and reapplied it. Sure enough, it made the same noise. I found out that it was the plastic bar that was hitting against the window when I closed it, but thought it wouldn't be a big issue.When I came home from work, I noticed the shade was on the floor of the car. I asked my wife later if she didn't like it--No. Apparently the clatter against the window keeps occurring whenever driving, and the noise became annoying. My wife had a guest in the car that day, and she too commented on how annoying that noise was.So, unfortunately, while the shade does cover a bit more, we're going to have to rely on the tinting already installed on our windows for adequate sun block rather than suffer the clanging noise.	
1. 	I never imagined how much fun Baby could have in a play mat. Our son used this for months, it was fun to watch him grow in it. He used to love laying on his back looking at everything, then seeing the pictures on the bottom. As he grew, he realized how the sound could be turned on by hitting the toys. He learned to roll over then crawl playing in this mat. He just never grew tired of it. It was interesting to him until he simply out grew it!	
- 1	it has one main job that it fails at: holding formula. the lid never seemed to properly close for me and powder would get stuck along the top seam. one day it fell out of the diaper bag and dumped the contents (luckily it mostly landed in the lid). I then went home and threw the stupid thing away. can't depend on it even holding the formula (let alone dispensing the formula) and I don't want to end up somewhere with a hungry baby and formula powder on the ground or the bottom of the diaper bag.	
- 1	I think this toy is very cute and colorful and that's about it. As others have said, it's pretty boring and the baby ends up mostly hugging it or mouthing it (but he mouths anything). Each worm segment has something inside, but the worm is so plush you have to press pretty hard.  He much prefers his other toys and i suspect this worm will soon become just a room decoration.  Oh, and the music is very tinny and ANNOYING-it's not loud but it's high pitched, which is the worst combination.	
1. 	Very soft cover that fits my changing pad nicely.  It's not really sage green though, more of a brighter green, but I wasn't too concerned with the color.  I just appreciate that it's super soft and cozy on baby's skin.	
- 1	I thought these would be great but I bought three and all three bags had broken zippers, probably from frequent washing in hot water, within a year. I used paperclips as a zipper and eventually, the fabric started to tear so I had to sew it together. I got pail liners and like them much more!	
1. 	I love these and the Sleepsacks. Every parent should have them. They make swaddling you child so much easier than using a blanket and the material is super soft. I highly recommend these and Sleepsacks for when they are older.	
- 1	This pillow must be designed for women with very short torsos.  I find that if I try to curl it around me, it feels like it is attacking me.  The pregnant woman shown in the photo fits neatly into the inner curve but I wonder if she is holding the top in place, because when I tried to use it that manner it would curl under my neck.The cover is scratchy,  you really cannot put your face on it.  So you will need to add the cost of a cover to this if you are going to use it for sleeping.I breastfed two kids, and used a U shaped pillow at times. I can see that this might be better for breastfeeding, since you can get a double &#8220;height&#8221; by wrapping it around yourself.  However, it is a fight to get it into that position, and you cannot just get up easily with it wrapped around you.It is much harder than a regular pillow and also thinner than it looks in the photo.  I also washed the slip cover to see if that would soften it up, but it did not. And getting the slipcover back on was a monumental struggle, like wrestling a reluctant snake into a tight jacket.  It actually reminded me of a topology problem and took almost 20 minutes to accomplish.  This means if you use it to prop up your baby and he/she spits up on it you will have to face trying to get the clean cover back on.Back to my full length body pillow, this one is just physically too hard, too scratchy and fights me too much.	
1. 	Ordered this one online after looking over potty seats in stores (the splash guards were all so small - why bother?) - my kid loves it, it's easy to clean, and the splash guard is comfortable.I took off one star because yes, you do need to take it completely apart and clean it (often!) as urine gets trapped between the parts. Still happy with the seat, though.	
1. 	At &#60;$2 per bib, these are a great deal!  I love the all the colors - there is always one that perfect compliments her outfit.  I have a bunch so that we can just throw them in the wash whenever they get soaked.	
1. 	This is my 5th potty chair and so far the best for a boy that I have found.  The pee still splashes out occasionally, but far less than all the other brands.  It makes me so mad that they don't have boy-specific potty's.  The splash guards are always too small and they leak ( like our defective Thomas potty seat)  So I am happy to have this one as a big improvement.  My son is on the large side he is 34 pounds and 36 inches tall and just turned 2 last month. He fits on it just fine and likes that he can lean back.	
1. 	I purchased this for the smaller of my one year old twin granddaughters, the larger baby uses a high chair I was able to borrow from a friend. So in order for  little peanut to sit with the rest of us at a meal time-I purchased this. Shes fits in it perfectly fine, she is happy as all getup in it and to be part of the family at dinner. She will be getting weighed this week at her one year checkup, but I am estimating she is about 19 lbs and 29 tall. the entire set up cleans easily,  And since I never leave her unattended in anything-I wouldn't have the problems some of the other reviewers seem to have with the white tray pinching the childs fingers. I love the fact that it is height adjustable and the straps are long enough to fit around any chair in my house as well as my daughter & son in laws house. All in all a great booster seat. I would recommend this to anyone.	
1. 	A friend recommended this blanket to me before my baby was born. I didn't use them right away. One day I remembered I had them and started to use them. They are awesome. I don't swaddle my baby the exact way as the instruction suggest, I modified it a little and it works great. If she is not swaddled, she doesn't sleep for a long time, she wakes up with her own movements. She is now two months.I enjoy this product.	
1. 	We are using this every night since we bought it. It takes some trial and error to figure out the water requirement but that's OK. It's easy to use, look good and works great! I use to warm breastmilk. Cleaning/descaling is the only issue.	
1. 	We have a Fisher Price Jumperoo, a Kolcraft walker, and the Baby Einstein Entertainer. At first, I was convinced the Entertainer was best, then it seemed like the baby liked to jump more. Then when we got the walker, it seemed like that was all he wanted.Over time, the Entertainer won out. The walker is still interesting, but my 6-mo old son figured out all its tricks pretty quickly. He still likes the walking, bumping, grabbing at things in his extended reach. But that jumperoo's time was really limited. Now, he can stand it for just 10 mins before he wants out.I am glad to have all of the products, they all served their purpose. But I'm especially glad for the Entertainer's longevity. There's a LOT of activity here. My son played with two toys for a very long time, then moved on to two other toys, then realized his ability to spin in place, then realized that some toys reached his mouth to chew on. He's really circling back to some of the earlier toys now.Since it extends a bit it's grown with him and, though he can stand nearly by himself, it's still supporting him properly when he wobbles.When I realized that the product (the little soft blocks) had undergone a recall (they used to have plastic on them) I was freaked out. But then I checked and that was back in 2005, and they fixed the problem. I'm so glad it stayed on the market. This is one great toy.	
1. 	This really helped me keep my posture while breastfeeding. My baby loves sleeping on this while I have him on my lap, it's that soft and comfortable for him. My only complaint is that two months after we started using it, the filling started pushing through the cover. I keep finding bits of it on my baby's face and it's becoming annoying. I haven't washed this, only spot cleaned the areas that need it. I always use a swaddle blanket to protect it from spit ups and drool but it would have been nicer if it had a cover in the first place. Still, we use this everyday so I'm giving it a 4.	
1. 	Fantastic little booster seat.  It's the only one we own.  Perfect for our small home where a traditional stand alone sort of high chair just won't fit around our table (I use it on an IKEA Stefan chair).  My little one has been using it for the past couple of months, starting at about 7 months of age.  Easy to adjust straps and simple to snap on to any chair.  We've carried and used it on long trips to grandma's, at various restaurants and it has worked perfectly each time.I've never used the removable tray and lid.  No need to-- the snap-on tray washes easily.  After a few very messy eating sessions I've taken the whole chair into the tub for a wash down... so easy!I highly recommend this seat.  It's made of a sturdy plastic that looks like it's going to hold up for a very long time to come.  It's way more useful AND economical then any stand alone high chair.	
- 1	Our LO doesnt seem to like using this, I think because the silicone part is too tough.  He can hold it well but doesnt like chewing on it.	
- 1	I bought these because they were less expensive than the ones I'd been using for 18 months (Bummis).  I use them because my child has diaper rash often and don't want our diapers to stain from the cream.  When I opened these I noticed that they were more of a mesh than a cloth-like liner and I'm not sure if they will keep the cream from touching the cloth diapers.  I guess I'll double-up on them for now because I've already bought them.	
1. 	I started out using Playtex Premium Nursers with disposable liners, but switched to AVENT because I heard that they are so great and my Playtex bottles wouldn't heat in the car. Since then, my baby eats better, sleeps better, cries less. I didn't realize that the others were making him unhappy, but he is a different baby since switching to these. The only issue I have is that it is hard for me to get the nipple into the collar without pulling the nipple through with my fingers and, if you don't get the lid on just right, it will leak. Other than that, these are great!UPDATE: I guess I jumped the gun on this review. As we have used them more, we have discovered that these bottles leak about 30% of the time. If you do not tighten the ring perfectly, it will leak all over your hand and baby. I am over these bottles.	
1. 	These are a MUST have for any new parent. These blankets are TRUE swaddling blankets (just like the hospital but MUCH nicer quality) not like a lot of the other blankets that claim to be swaddling blankets but are really just regular blankets. My son was a preemie (3.5 pounds) and when he came home from the hospital at 4.5 pounds this is all we used. We must have bought at least 12 of these and used every one without fail. My son was swaddled every time he went to sleep and he slept MUCH better. We actually used these much longer than most people do, we swaddled him for months and months but as time went on we just swaddled him around his waist with his arms out, it was a security blanket for him and he was just comfortable being swaddled. Now, obviously at 21 months we no longer swaddle him but these good early sleeping habbits really set the stage for his much longer term healthy sleeping habits that he has today. Do not hesitate, these are fantastic AND they come with a little sheet that shows you exactly how to swaddle in case you don't know how or forget. I kept that sheet on my fridge for months so that when my mom watched him she would have it in case she forgot (it's been many years since she's swaddled babies:) These come in many colors all white but with diferent colored dots (it's really a swiss dot print). blue, pink, yellow, lavender and sage green. They wash beautifully and always stay soft. The only color I would not buy again is the sage green as that one did fade, the blue, purple and yellow are all gorgeous, my sis owns the pink and that is lovely as well. Hope this is helpful! Pleasant dreams:)	
1. 	We chose this stroller as our travel stroller for our first vacation which included air travel with one layover each way. We have continued to use it at home when we don't want our full-size stroller (usually when I don't have a bunch of baby gear to bring along or bags to carry at the mall). I found it to be better constructed and more comfy for baby than the cheapy umbrella strollers. I thought it was a step up without being a pricey lightweight stroller that doesn't like to be called an umbrella stroller. The color Toapzio is a beautiful pool blue. I did buy it for a boy, but as with almost everything else we buy, I felt it could be used for either gender.Our son was very comfortable in it from the beginning. It is easy to fold up and down. The sunshade is functional, it has worked at keeping the sun out of his eyes. The small basket at the bottom is a little difficult to get to with the way the bars are at the bottom, but you can shove a small bag or a few toys down there. An improvement would be the option to lift the handles up to your level and then push them back down to fold up the stroller. I do like the shape of the handles though. Overall, we are very happy with this stroller and glad we spent a little more for it.	
1. 	We now own two of these in the same color for our boys.  Easy to transport, packs up nicely and easy to clean.  Overall a great product and highly recommended.	
- 1	This did not click my Chicco KeyFit 30 into place securely. Strapping a car seat into a stroller was not to my liking.The newer version MIGHT accept Chicco-I DO NOT KNOW.I got the Chicco car seat stroller/carrier and the car seat snaps into place and doesn't move at all which makes me more comfortable.	
1. 	this is so so so worth the cost. it is soo easy to install. totally clear. super strong. baby even likes to look through it so he doesn't cry when I walk to kitchen!!! comes with measuriong strip to show how far apart to put hinges. great	
1. 	Way easier than wrapping a baby in a blanket.  However, there is research out there that swaddling reduces a baby's rooting reflex so I'm not sure I'll use these on a future baby.	
1. 	I hesitated to register for this blanket because it's so expensive, but I am so glad I did.  It's worth the money because we get so much more use out of it than the smaller, cheaper receiving blankets.  This is our favorite blanket for cold weather or air conditioned rooms, while we usually use the Aden + Anais muslin blankets (also expensive but worth it) in warmer weather.  I also thought about getting this blanket in a different color or pattern, but I am glad I went with the off-white flannel with chocolate trim stitching.  It matches everything, and when it's in photos (which is often), it's neutral, keeping the focus on my son.  The blanket is a great size (big enough for swaddling), super soft, just the right thickness (warm but not too heavy), and washes/wears well.  The only things I would change are the tags.  There are two, and while they are silky and soft, they are still annoying.  One is kind of large and has swaddling instructions, which I think is unnecessary to permanently attach to the blanket.  The tags are sewn in with the decorative edge stitching, so cutting them off might mess up the blanket.  They are centered on one side, which makes folding the blanket in halves awkward, and we're frequently adjusting the blanket so that the tags aren't near our baby's face.  Even with that minor complaint, though, I still give this blanket five stars.	
1. 	Love this chair. Before our daughter started solids, we actually began using it as a seat to sit up and play in on the floor, to have her near when we ate, or for her to get a new perspective when playing under the hanging toys of her activity mat and when wanted to sit up more (instead of getting the Bumbo chair). Now we use it for its intended purpose and it's nice and compact to take to restaurants. Also, love that is not a huge eyesore that takes up too much space.	
- 1	At 20 weeks pregnant, I thought this pillow would be the answer to my achy hips during a night of sleep. Unfortunately, it is too thick and actually puts more pressure on my hips. I still think it will be a great nursing pillow, but it is not really the 2-in-1 concept that I was hoping for. Also, the zipper is flimsy and I would not be surprised if it broke on the next pull. Overall, I think this pillow is not worth the money spent.	
- 1	the bibs are too long for a 7 month old in a high chair !	
1. 	I purchased this to replace a Sassy dispenser when it broke. I am happy with the Munckin brand. The spout is slightly angled, making it easier to dispense that before. Three sections is fine, each can hold 8oz of formula (I usually only put 6oz in each) and I have never been gone long enough to need more than 3 bottles at a time. I use it for formula now, but have also used it for baby cereal, snacks, etc. It is much easier to dispense Cheerios out of one of these on the go than a regular tupperware container!	
1. 	This potty is the perfect size for anyone doing Elimination Communication with her baby.My baby is still too young to actually sit on it, but it works great for something to hold him over. The lip is especially great for little boys. :)Plus, it's light and easily transportable.I love it that Baby Bjorn has recognized the need for a smaller potty for the ECing crowd or those with smaller children wanting to use the potty.	
1. 	i like avent products. imagine those bottles can turn into sippy cups. indeed this spout is totally non spill and very gentle on baby's gums. i just wish i picked a different color because the white can get stained when you give baby a drink after eating baby food.	
1. 	We purchased this to place around our brick hearth, in advance of our child learning to crawl. This product has not been tested by our infant yet, but it's probably safe to say that he will be able to pull this loose. That said, my take on this product is that it is meant to cushion the edges of the hearth in the event he were to fall towards the hearth. I don't think this product was intended to be repeatedly pulled at or played with by infants, so I was a bit surprised to see so many reviewers complain that their children could easily pull this loose. Of course they can pull it loose! It's foam adhered to an extremely porous surface with some double-sided adhesive! My question is why are these folks letting their children play with the material that was installed specifically to protect their children from an area that was dangerous enough to begin with that it required said padding to be installed?? THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOOD PARENTING THAT WOULD TEACH YOUR CHILD THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE OFF LIMITS.As for the product installation, it was easy enough. I found it helpful to place each adhesive/velcro strip so that it would make contact only with the brick itself, and avoided placing where it would have to adhere to the mortar, since the mortar on our fireplace hearth is slightly indented and thus below the level of the brick, where the strips could more easily make and maintain contact. After letting set for 12 hours, I did attempt to remove the padding to see if the bottom velcro strips would remain adhered to the brick. It didn't. Again, this is not a huge issue, because I'm not really sure why we would want to temporarily remove the padding, leaving behind 2 dozen little velco strips on the hearth. All in all, I'm pleased with the appearance and installation of the product.	
- 1	Very thin and they have no trim around the edge so they tend to just ball up and not spread out. I found similar ones at Babies R Us that are far superior in quality. The colors are cute though.	
1. 	We received this bathtub as a shower gift. When my daughter was 2 weeks old she was ready for her first bath. This tub worked out perfectly. It fit great in our kitchen sink. It would let you know if the water was too hot.The sling for your baby to lay in seemed to be very comfortable. She has always loved bathtime. We would put the baby tub on our kitchen table for her bath until she was about 4 -5 months old then we started putting it in the regular bathtub. She used it until about 7 months old. Now she uses one of those seats. We are saving the baby bathtub for our next baby.	
- 1	Maybe I got defective one.  Baby was chewing on it and the color was coming off... My baby's mouth and around her mouth was orange from the color from the giraffe... We stopped using it.	
- 1	It was dead on arrival.  So maybe not the batteries fault...but just beware.  Sucks to have to return it and wait.	
1. 	These covers are fine.  They are not soft like other covers but they do the job they are supposed to do and fit my tall sided changing pad, which I love.	
1. 	My coworkers gave this carrier to meat the company shower. I have loved it-for the first few months walked aroundthe house with it and went on walks around the track &park with my husband and dog. It's been great as I wasable to get things done around the house whilebaby slept close to me.We also enjoyed our walks with baby &he was able to feel safe and happy while observinghis new world.It was mostly helpful to me the first few months, but as he began to grow, my back began to ache and we optedto use our Chariot jog stroller during walks.I no longer use the carrier at 9, 10, 11 monthsbut it has been the best/most comfortable carrier by far.	
1. 	Don't use the spoons or forks that came with this set.  However, the cups, lips and containers are great.  As another reviewer said: it is pint-sized tupperware.  Cleans easy but doesn't wear easy.  We use these all day long day after day and the whole thing can fit in my diaper bag on a light day to go to Grandma's.	
- 1	I love Playtex and liners but the 4 OZ ones are just too small.  You can't actually get a full four ounces in these once they are wrapped around the bottle neck.	
1. 	I bought two of these and I just love them.  I use both of them at the same time--one for his head, the other for his butt. They do the trick of catching spit-up, vomit, and leaking diaper problems.  These pads save me a lot of time beacuse I don't have to worry about doing the sheets all the time. They're getting a little fuzzy now that they've been through the wash a few times, but for $7, I think these pads are a great buy!!	
1. 	We use this every time we put our son down to sleep. Works perfect. Used since he was born until now and he's 5.5 months old. It's harder for him to fall asleep without it since his arms and legs are flying all over the place keeping him awake. With him swaddled he goes to sleep right away. The velcro closures are WONDERFUL in keeping the blanket held together the whole night. Swaddling with a regular blanket always led to an unswaddled baby within minutes.	
1. 	I realized very early on that I was receiving so many different sized clothes for my new baby girl that I couldn't keep track of how many pieces of clothing I had in each size. I purchased these dividers thinking I was being silly to go to this extent of organization! But as soon as I received them and put them in the closet I realized how much easier it was to keep track of what I had in each size. I probably never would have noticed otherwise that I was desperately short of newborn sized clothing before it was too late! I had previously just been looking at the total amount in the closet and thinking I was doing good on the clothing supply. Because I received so many larger sized clothes from recent new mom friends and shower gifts I was running out of room for smaller sizes so my next purchase is a closet doubler (see my link).Organize It All 1346W Closet Doubler, ChromeI think these two products will compliment each other very well! Only complaint is that if you use these in a closet with a shelf above the bar they may not fit completely as the tops of the dividers are very high.	
1. 	My little one is 6 months old now.  We've been using this tub in the sink since he was a few weeks old.  He loves his bathtime!  My only complaint is that the small pad at the toddler end of the tub fell off.  We just used some goo gone to remove the remaining glue and he seems to be fine without it.  We'll soon be moving it from kitchen sink to tub as he is now learning splashing is fun.  :o)	
1. 	I used to have one of these small baby tubs with a hammock for newborn.the Hammock thing was great when she was a newborn but as soon as I stopped using it and put her straight into the baby tub she would just slipped, flipped and I always need to hold her which made it very hard to clean her....this tub just solved all of these issues.she is hold into place and can freely splash and move without me holding her and in exchange I have my 2 hands free to clean her.PROS:the design is such that:Baby can lie down and splash and play while being hold well.Baby can sit and play while being hold well.This is a two stage tub-it looks big but fits well in my bathtub which is very standard.CONS:Nothing yet.UPDATE:Baby is now 10 months and she still fits in the tub (and she is very tall- size of an 18 month old baby)- I will keep using it as long as I can as it way better than dealing with the regular bathtub. I like it so much that when we go on vacation I always try to find a baby equipment company renting that kind of tub.	
- 1	I really wanted some velvet baby hangers, and these were a great bargain!  Unfortunately, they seemed very cheap.  I returned them because they were starting to shed the &#34;velvet&#34; material the first day I got them.  Disappointing.	
1. 	i find this super absorbent compare to the thin breast pads i have but i'm giving this a 4 star because the tape that's suppose to be attached to your nursing tank or bras doesn't really adhere to the fabric. again in terms of absorbency it does its wonderful job. it has thick layers it keeps leaks away from your skin. i love it. great deal for the price.	
1. 	These squirt toys are adorable. I originally bought them for the beach, but have since moved them to the bathtub. My 14 month old loves them. They hold quite a bit of water and can have a powerful squirt, so beware once your little one gets the hang of squeezing them.I've seen some reviews complaining about &#34;mold&#34;. I fill mine with a little bathroom cleaner each time I clean the bathroom and rinse them out. So far, I haven't had a problem, but that's the nature of bath toys that you can't reach to clean. They're not expensive so just replace them if it becomes a problem.	
- 1	After reading all the positive reviews I went out and purchased this item and was disappointed at how difficult it was to use with one hand.  Think about it....in most cases you're going to be holding a squirming infant in one arm and trying to put this thing on a shopping cart or high chair with the other.  It does come bundled up in it's own cute little sack, but it takes two hands and about 30 seconds to actually work the thing out of it's sack.  Once out, it's not super easy to get on the cart with one hand but can be done.  No biggie there...the real trouble comes when you're done shopping and you once again have your squirming infant in one arm and are trying to remove and repackage your floppy seat.  This thing is not small and trying to get it back into it's cute little sack takes some doing. And because it's so big, it's not the kind of thing you want to keep out all the time, loose from it's baggie. Too much work I say, for something that could and should be more convenient.  I exchanged mine for a Buggy Bagg. At first I balked at the price of the Buggy Bagg but later realized it is worth the extra 20 bucks.  Super easy to open, set up, remove and store all with one hand.  Plus it's got a ton of room in the diaper bag compartment so when we go out shopping or dining we don't need a diaper bag anymore.	
- 1	These cups are ok. What I don't like is that whenever the straw is inserted into the cup with any amount of liquid inside, the liquid shoots up through the straw and flows over, making a mess almost every single time. I have other straw cup that don't create this problem. The other version of these cups with the spout is much better. Would not recommend this and won't be buying these again.	
1. 	We use this all the time! It is great for on the go, fill it and toss it in the diaper bag. The lid is secure, and we have never had a problem with this dispenser. I also like to use it at home, it makes preparing bottles quicker and when you pour the powder in all at one time instead of using one scoop at a time, it mixes WAY better and you can shake less vigorously. I fill it and leave it sitting on the counter...which is great because my husband can make a bottle with out asking me for prep. directions (because for some reason he can't ever remember how to make a bottle when he needs to, lol).	
- 1	My daughter is 3 months old, and this doesn't work well for her. I have it spaces as far apart as it will go, and it's too small to safely fit her head, yet just fits inside the carseat. I thought I would like this a lot more. I think the side pieces are too stuffed for it to be helpful.	
- 1	My other cloths are just as absorbent, even the cotton ones- like Osocosy brand (size2). I have to use this as an insert because at 18lbs my 9mo' old doesn't fit into this w/a large snappy.It works, and it's not disappointing.. but the price I paid for this makes me kind of nauseous when I could have gotten four for the same price from hempbabies or osocosy.	
1. 	Very easy to operate with one hand and fit perfectly in the archway between the living room/kitchen. Keeps the kid in, and the dog out!	
- 1	This was small for a one month old baby of average size. And because the zipper started from the bottom (not sure if by design, or if it was defect), the neck area was just too tight -- we could not use the swaddle at all.	
1. 	While my husband and I were registering for baby items for the birth of our first child, inevitably, a highchair was thrown into the mix.  Family and friends *insisted* we needed one.  So, needless to say, we spend quite awhile searching for a highchair we liked and registered for one.  As it turns out, we were not presented with one as a gift.  This turned out to be a good thing.Shortly afterward, our daughter was born, and immersed in the daily duties of being new parents, we didn't think much about a highchair again until we began feeding our daughter solid foods.  Unburdened by other's opinions, we decided we did not want a full-size highchair, as we originally considered.  Too hard to clean, too bulky, yet another single-use/stage item.Amazon to the rescue!  After looking at several chairs of this type, comparing features and reviews, we couldn't be happier after purchasing this one!All plastic = Easy to cleanRemovable DISHWASHER SAFE tray = Awesome!Adjustable height = Grows with our babyAdjustable/Removable seat back = Great for all stages of developmentStraps double as carrying straps = Super portable!Very affordable price = At least 1/4 - 1/3 the cost of a full-size highchair!I have already bought two; one for home and another for 'daycare' (my Mom's house).  We will be buying a third and fourth for our second child to be born this summer.In short, this product just makes sense!	
- 1	Cute, sturdy bowls.  They are a wonderful idea, but they don't stay put.  These bowls don't even require pulling on from my infant, and up they come.  She thinks they're super fun to dump out.  I think the clean-up game isn't quite as fun.I wouldn't recommend these bowls, and I'm debating on just throwing mine away.Save your money.	
- 1	As a matter of fact, he's better at getting them off than I am because his tiny fingers make it easy to grasp this product.  They are easier for him to get off than the old standard generic flat plug covers.  Not a good buy.	
- 1	The brush itself is ok. I like the sponge & bristle brush together. But the base/stand is very wobbly & doesn't securely hold the brush. I think this is great for the price, but I'd spend a dollar or two more for a better brush!	
- 1	I love the compact and easy to use design of the Baby Bjorn Travel Crib. I bought it in addition to the pack n play I have and bought a special suitcase to bring it on a trip... however, when I got to my destination, it became very obvious what a hazardous design this is. The legs stick out and you can easily trip on them yourself or while holding your little loved one! If you chose to purchase, put in a safe area where no one travels often and perhaps put some orange markers on the legs to help avoid an accident. My recommendation to Baby Bjorn would be to add some type of element surounding the top opening to clear the same area as the bottom - to help keep a clear safe zone around the crib.	
1. 	Works really well for us. My daughter (27 mo) wouldn't use public toilets, and this has changed everything. It's pretty secure -- bends slightly at the back, but it's really sturdy and she feels secure sitting on it. It's designed so it won't pinch. I like that it's super small and light when folded. I've ditched the diaper bag and just keep this and a change of clothes in my purse now. I just bleach it off every now and again. Easy! I do wonder if the hole in the middle is a little small -- maybe forces her to sit with her legs too close together to &#34;go&#34;?? It's hard to tell though.  The &#34;carry bag&#34; it comes with shouldn't even be advertised as such -- it's just a regular ziplock bag.	
- 1	I was not impressed with these storage bags.  I prefer to use the other brands that offer ziplock type closure.  This brand is harder to close, more time consuming and wasteful (due to spilling)	
1. 	The Boppy is GREAT! When I first brought my baby home, it didn't seem to serve me any purpose and I didn't think it was going to be useful. But once I got the hang of nursing and got the hang of using the Boppy...well, now I use it all the time! I can lay the baby on the Boppy to nurse and it frees up my hands to sit at the computer or do whatever else I'd like to do (while sitting) with both hands. The cover comes off and can be washed, which is great. I purchased an additional cover so I always have one clean one.	
1. 	I really needed a pack of soft, cute bibs at around four months for my drooling baby.  These were perfect--they attach securely but comfortably, are absorbant and soft.  When we first started solids a few months later, they were great for that, too.  Once baby started really eating we switched to a less absorbant, rinseable bib.  Initially they worked for eating without a problem.  They got very messy and we never had the food or milk soak through all the way.	
1. 	We have twins so when purchasing products, it was all about investing money in things that would make our lives simpler.  These Drop-Ins work really well for the bottles. The bag collapses as they consume the contents, which supposedly improves problems with gas but I'm not sure this system accomplishes it better than any others. Because the bag is thin, it also takes a lot less time to warm bottles if that is a consideration. The real savings is the manpower and time necessary for cleaning. I only have 4 bottles per baby, replace the liner and nipple when necessary, and wash everything once a day.  These don't come cheap so I don't think there is any cost savings associated with this versus buying a boat load of bottles.	
1. 	For the first couple months, our daughter wanted to be held constantly (even when napping). This carrier freed up my arms and hands, so I could get things done around the house while she was content to be close and cuddly.  My husband even used it while mowing the lawn.  She isn't quite old enough to use it in the back position yet, but we have definitely already gotten our money's worth.  I don't think that it was difficult to use at all once the straps were all adjusted properly after the first use.	
1. 	This is a very sturdy and good looking crib for a very reasonable price. It took a little effort to put it together, but we have been using it for 5+ months with no issues. I never had to re-tighten the nuts and bolts. If you can get someone to help you put together I think it will be lot easier and quicker. Great purchase if you are looking to buy a crib!	
1. 	I have had this high chair for 18 months now and I love it!  It has such great features that grow with your child.  The 3 positions of recline let you put your infant in the chair before they can actually sit up.  My son was not the best napper, but he very often fell asleep in this chair in the reclined position.  When he was a little older and started eating solid food, I really appreciated the removable tray cover.  When your toddler is covered in avocado slime or smearing butter in his hair, sometimes you need to just remove the food from reach.  The tray cover snaps off easily but leaves the tray in place until you can wipe off those little hands and let them down.  The tray also slides out a few inches to make room to lift baby out without catching his feet.  Another feature I like is the double sided cloth cover.  When it gets dirty, just flip it to the other side.  It washes beautifully... dries quickly and keeps it's color.  A friend of mine has the Peg Perego with the plastic wipable seat cover, but her son sweats too much when sitting on the plastic and there is always some sort of dried food caked in the corners.  You can't throw plastic in the washing machine.  I'm so glad I didn't spend twice as much for the Peg Perego!!	
1. 	I love these dispensers, time and space saving.  easy rotation and cleaning.  i need to order more, wish i could pick my colors.	
- 1	I'm sure these are probably perfectly fine pacifiers, but my baby really doesn't like them. She prefers the spendy gumdrop pacifiers from Hawaii Medical, figures.	
- 1	These are ok. They do their job for the most part but their size is small, I think. Lots of times when my LO poops, it goes off of the liner, so the diaper gets stained and needs rinsing anyways. Also, they are expensive for what they are, you could buy this fabric at the craft store for a lot less and have a lot more liners custom cut to your preferred size. I have used plain flannel cut larger and this works really nicely although it is not stay dry.	
- 1	Bought one and tried and tried and cannot get any kind of consistent reading with it. I seem to read as 97 or 104 degrees with readings taken a minute apart. We read all the directions and followed instructions and nothing seemed to improve accuracy. It doesn't seem to be better on the forehead or the ear. It just doesn't work reliably at all. I would never trust this to take my infant's temperature.	
1. 	This stool is so dope.  You can totes let your kid use this to rock the toilet on his or her own.  She can totes pee and that is way better than changin' diapies.  Changin' diapies stinks... see what I did there?	
1. 	these were stocking stuffers and my kids absolutely loved them... when I showed them how it worked they both said its MAGIC!! when they are older I will explain to them how it works but for now they are Magic at Christmas time and the kids love them. They are very thin and fragile but my kids have enjoyed so much they have taken great care of them ONE down fall is you cant pick the color we got lucky and got a purple for our girl and a green for our boy but it would have been bad had we gotten two purple.	
1. 	I needed about 3 packs to cover the house. I started with the nursery and then after my child got bigger I just lambasted the house with these for safety. Good buy. They fit tight and children will not be able to remove these	
1. 	I can't say enough good about this potty chair.  It's inexpensive (but very well made), SUPER easy to clean, has a very comfortable splash guard for boys and is comfortable (I'm assuming).  I originally bought the Safety 1st Potty Chair/stool.  Don't like it at all.  Tough to clean (lots of spaces for urine to get) and I don't think it's very comfortable as my son refused to sit on it.  Within 20 seconds of sitting on the Baby Bjorn he peed.  Refused for weeks to do that with the Safety 1st.  Great product.  Can't say enough good about it.From a parent's stand point, it's the best b/c it's soooo easy to clean.  I'm not clean freak, but this is a huge benefit with anything in the bathroom.Kudos to Baby Bjorn for a simple product.	
1. 	This mirror is great, gives a clear image so I can glance back to make sure the baby's okay.  It isn't a safety concern as far as breaking, because it's not glass; it doesn't block my view because it attaches over the middle seat headrest; the biggest safety concern is that you'll get distracted watching the baby instead of the road.  I'd be way more distracted trying to somehow look or feel back to be sure he's okay.  Well worth the investment!	
1. 	They stay together well, barely spill (unless my toddler throws it really hard) and the straw stays in well! Very happy!	
1. 	I originally bought this when potty training my child and didn't like it.  He was afraid to go near it because it was just too flimsy and scary for a child who was basically afraid of the potty to begin with.  However, I realized later that it isn't an effective potty training tool, but is still very useful later on.Later, after he was potty trained, this became indispensable, and it still is now that he's 4. I use it in public bathrooms to cover the seat with more than paper.  It folds up small and fits easily in a large purse.  It's especially useful in super dirty bathrooms where there are no seat covers available and paper just won't do it.  So I've come back to change my review, now that I realize it's a great product as long as you use it correctly and at the right time.	
- 1	I got one based on the review last year for about $20. Baby used it while teething, but not like everyday. like other people say, it is a squeaking toy similar to dog toys. Nothing special and i do not think it is worth $20.Update: it was left outside for a couple of weeks. the whole thing became sticky and something was peeled off in some places. the colors disappeared (maybe peeled?) in some places. Does that mean the baby was eating paint/material slowly? not sure. I trashed it.	
- 1	First off, this contraption is a pain to put on. You have to struggle to zip it up and get it on properly. after 1 use I found myself preferring to just hold the pumps with one arm and type with one hand rather than spend 5 or more minutes strapping the dang thing on.It is also uncomfortable. I felt stifled because of the thick fabric, and worst of all, this thing hangs from the upper area and provides zero support to your boobs. The bottom is loose and just hangs out. A better designer would have designed this with a stretchy fabric (or something) underneath to provide support underneath the boob and push the whole area up.I wanted to like this, I really did. It would have been glorious if I could have used this and have both hands free to type!!	
1. 	Good size (36 x 36), durable, sturdy.  Colorful and the little bugs on the mesh wall are a great interactive addition; that's a plus plus for me and the over riding reason why we got this specific playpen.	
- 1	The piano is a good size, soft easy to clean cloth, but it has to be tied to something in order for your baby to enjoy it.  It's too heavy to hold.  If you try to hold it and the baby and play, well good luckThe sound coming from the piano is very faint, you can't have any other background noise going on, if you want your baby to hear the music.The baby will have to push fairly hard to get the keys to play music, or you'll have to do it for them.The turquoise color is a little feminine for my taste - for a boy.  I wish it were more of a neutral color.Overall, not worth $29, that's for sure.  The music is virtually almost impossible to hear.  Not worth the cost they want for it, by any means.	
1. 	I took my son to the toy store to pick out a toy, and this is the item he picked.  He loves shaking things (he's 10 months) and it makes a pretty great sound.  The core of the frog is elastic, so when he's older he'll be able to stretch the toy a bit too for additional entertainment.  I like that the HABA toys are made in Germany to EU standards; it makes me feel better about him constantly putting it in his mouth.  I don't know how educational it is, but he certainly seems to enjoy it and it seems as though it will last a long time.	
1. 	This was really great for my newborn daughter.  It got a little smelly despite rinsing and air drying every use.  But it had served its purpose before becoming unusable.  At 4 weeks we switched to the Primo Eurobath Tub (which is TERRIFIC).	
1. 	It appears many of the reviews here are for the OLD Diaper Genie.  Please note:  These are NOT the same products.  As the owner of both the old and new Genies, let me tell you there is a BIG difference!  We had to replace our older one because of a broken latch and bought the new version.  The new one has improved all of the problems with the original.  It is SO much easier to use!  You now seal off the diaper using the top knob, instead of turning the inside ring.  And the refill just drops right in -- no more hassle trying to get the ring inside the refill.  Easy to empty when needed.  Night and day difference.Don't be turned off by the reviews for the old product mistakenly posted here.  Even I suggested people look at competing products when I had the old version.  But the new one really has corrected the problems.	
- 1	I bought this because I liked the idea of the handles and I thought... well... we have two different shaped toilets in our home... it'll at least fit one.  Other reviewers mentioned that it worked on round toilets but it didn't fit any of our toilets.  Our oval toilets are new, and we also have one round toilet from the 80s that it doesn't fit on, either. Bummer.  We ended up buying the Prince Lionhart weePOD, Basix and it is such a better product!  It fits on both of our toilets, is easy to clean, lightweight, secure, and super cushy/comfortable.  My daughter loves to sit on it.Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey	
1. 	This is the only swaddle blanket that we have managed to utilize thus far because our little one has a tendency to take his arms out of all the others.  It's impossible to remove his arms and hands from this swaddle and once he is wrapped up and cozy, he loves it!	
1. 	My in-laws wanted to purchase a cot for my son, who is 24 months old.  They had trouble finding one under the $60 price point in local stores (Seattle area).  This cot fit the bill, pricewise.  When we received the cot, we opened the box and my son was interested right away.  The quality is very much the same as adult cots in the $50 and up price range.  The stitching is very sturdy, the middle is reinforced with straps and double stitching as well.  The ease of folding and placing into the carry-all cover is incredible.  We intended to use this cot for travels to Grandma and Grandpa's home, since our son has outgrown his playpen; however, since opening this cot, our son has used it for his daily naps in our living room!  Everyday use with a 24 month old boy, who weighs 35 pounds and is 37 tall, and this cot has held up just great!  I would highly recommend this cot to any toddler parent looking for a nap cot or a travel bed for their child.	
- 1	I cannot stand this highchair! It was way to difficult to clean. The tray sits up to high for baby! I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!	
- 1	I used these temporarily since initially my nipples were cracked and bleeding.  My husband had gotten me NUK-barely there at Walmart.  I ordered these (since I had their pump and loved it) and another brand through Amazon to see if they were better, and they both failed miserably.  My daughter latched on without problems with the NUK-barely there, but she hated these.  I believe since they were thicker and bulkier she disliked them.  After trying to use them multiple times, I gave up and ordered extra NUK-barely there nipple shields.  Don't waste your money on these.	
1. 	My son loves this gym. He is eight weeks old and just starting to reach for the hanging toys. It is nice that you can add extra rings to the hanging toys to make them lower. I have laid him on the mat since he was about three weeks old and it is great for tummy time. We have hardwood floors and the padding is sufficient. He loves to watch the sun toy that plays music/flashes lights and especially loves the mirror. I like that the toys are detachable. When he was younger we would place the sun and the mirror on the mat next to him. We have also hung the toys from his bouncer chair toy bar. The mat is easy to fold up and fits nicely in his closet. A previous reviewer complained about the rabbit picture. I like that the frame of that picture is a pocket and I have replace the rabbit with a picture of daddy.The only bummer about this toy is that our cats love it and think it is their toy. I have to kick them out of it all of the time and have caught them batting at the toys more than a few times. The mat is big enough for the baby and one of the cats, but not all three at the same time!	
- 1	This car seat was put on the do not buy list by the Institute of Highway Safety in November 2013.  It failed safety tests because of the placement of the belts (too high on the abdomen and too far out on the shoulder).	
- 1	These cups leak in two places, both from the air flow valve in the cap and all around the top. It's not impossible to get the straw back through the flip top after cleaning, but it's not terribly easy each time either. Within an hour after first washing the cup and helping my son learn how to use the straw top, there were milk spots, puddles and drops all over his high chair, the floor, my pants (he had sat on my lap), and his clothes. I actually would have been far happier if it had leaked from the straw! That I could understand, but how hard should it be to screw it on and go? I've played with how tight I twist it and I'm sure I'll continue to in hopes I can minimize the leakage as much as possible. But all in all, it just shouldn't be this complicated.The straw does take some practice, too. I tried it first myself. It's straw shaped, but you have to bite or press your teeth along the valve in the straw in order to get fluid. Not a bad design at all.My hope is I'll find the sweet spot and be able to get some real use out of the cup. We'll see.	
- 1	does not fit my stove properly at all based on knob location and the little window in the door. it's kinda rigged on there, plus the kid can reach around the edges. may be returning it, but haven't decided yet.	
1. 	I finally got sick of cleaning all the nooks and crannies filled with gross, mashed up food with our regular high chair and just purchased this booster instead.  We purchased a similar Fisher-Price booster from a local store when we transitioned him out of his infant car seat/carrier because he wasn't sitting up very well in the high chairs restaurants provided and we needed a secure place for him while we were eating.  A year later, we still keep that booster in our car and use it every time we go out to eat.  Although it can be a hassle to carry it in and attach it to the chair, I feel better that it's more sanitary (many of those restaurant high chairs are GROSS!) and my son behaves much better when he's secured into this booster.  I ordered what I though was the same exact booster to replace our high chair at home and keep permanently in the house so I could leave the other in the car for restaurants.  I was hoping we'd be able to use the tray insert interchangeably on both of them, but they are slightly different and won't work interchangeably.  None-the-less, we are all happier using this booster.  It wipes clean easily and there's no where for food to get caught.  Plus, since it uses one of our regular dining room chairs, we are not using up the floor space that a high chair would take.  When baby #2 comes along, we will just skip the high chair all together and use one of these!	
- 1	I looked far and wide to find an eco-friendly stuffed animal for my son.  I was happy to find this little cute monkey.  But, after only a few months, the threading that links the head to the neck is showing A LOT.  Frankly, I don't know how long it is going to stay connected.  It wouldn't be a big deal if this toy was played with a lot or my son had had it for a long time but that is not the case.  It's rather disappointing.	
1. 	The only regret I have is that I did not have this frame when I had my first son.  Great alternative to hauling the baby car seat in your arm.	
- 1	this stroller is cheap, flimsy, and the fabric on the seat started to rip within a couple weeks of use. The whole canopy bent and the wheels started to squeak within 2 months of use. I paid $51.00 for this stroller on clearance at a store and i paid too much! The only positive thing about this stroller is that it folds up very small	
- 1	the zipper broke on both bags pretty fast, and the elastic doesn't adjust to fit into a diaper can. I won't buy it again. Blueberry makes a much better one.	
1. 	This stool has really good grips. It never budges. We use it for the potty and sink, and haven't had any slipping accidents. I would purchase this again for sure.	
1. 	A great product, well-made and well-priced.  They're titled &#34;take & toss&#34;.  The &#34;take' makes sense as they are inexpensive and loosing one would be merely inconvenient.  But as to &#34;toss&#34; I find washing and keeping a much more reasonable approach.  A nice product.	
1. 	Keep in mind that this adapter is not for new Medela pumps. I don't recall what year the cut off is for this adapter, but you should research that before purchasing. The cord length is great: would have easily spaned the length of my vehicle. The speed of the pump is faster using the adapter vs. the regular electric cord, so I just used a slower speed when I pumped. No complaints at all.	
1. 	Ok this item is something that has made life so much easier for us.  Firstly let me say that we tried A LOT of different bottles to find the right suction for my son and went through Avent, Gerber Nuk, Evenflo, Playtex with the liners and eventually settled on Playtex Ventaire.  All these bottles warmed up quickly, quietly and beautifully in this warmer.  It says it takes 5 minutes, for a full 8oz maybe but with a newborn the bottles warm up in next to no time at all.  All you do is just put the water in, snap on the switch, let the bottle sizzle away for a really short while and you can feed with ease.  I keep a small jug of water next to my bed as well in case I need extra I don't have to go to the bathroom to get more.  The water holders are such a bonus as there is no having to get enough light to look inside to see the fill line or anything like that.  It heats pretty evenly and I would recommend this item to anyone wanting a bottle warmer.  We usually just leave the bottles at room temperature, seeing as it's winter, and just warm them from then.  Well worth the money!	
- 1	The only nasal aspirator that works well is the one that comes home with the baby from the hospital. I have no idea where you can buy those, but they are most effective.	
1. 	I did not originally sign up for this item; it was given to me along with a box of 6 4-oz Avent bottles at my baby shower. I really like this product; according to the sterilizer's instructions regarding my microwave wattage, it only takes 2 minutes to sterilize and 2 minutes to cool down. I've never had any issues with getting burned or anything melting. And all it takes is 7 oz of water (I use filtered water instead of tap water) that I recycle every 2-3 uses to avoid wasting water(beyond that the water level decreases so it's best to measure to make sure it's still 7 oz).However, I have a gassy baby and wanted to see if I could switch to the Born Free bottles since several of my friends have raved about them. My 1 month old daughter is drinking 4 oz now, so I bought the 9 oz Born Free bottles and unfortunately they do not fit this sterilizer. She seems to be growing out of the stage of being fussy all night long due to gas so I guess I'll stick with the Avent brand bottles instead of buying a new sterilizer to accommodate using a different brand of bottles.	
1. 	I use these wipes every day when I pump at work and in the car. After pumping, take the shields, valves, and membranes apart and give everything a wipedown. You can't get to the inner part of the shield without running water through it, but there isn't anything you can do about that. I then let everything air dry inside my bag so I can put it all together for the next session. After using, it does seem like it is going to leave a weird film on the shields but I haven't noticed a problem when it dries. The size of the package fits perfectly into the inner pocket of the Medela Metro bag so it is super easy to always have a pack in there. I wish these were available on the subscribe & save plan.	
- 1	The bag size is nice big size but there is no compartments inside to organize everything. At the end of the day it's just like carrying a trashbag that I threw all the babys things in. I am looking for another bag :(	
1. 	The waterproof layer is the best feature.  Our baby drools all the time but it never gets through to his shirt.  Regular bibs just won't cut it anymore.  The neck size is good for a child probably up to 16 lbs.  After that, it gets quite tight.	
1. 	My toddler loves the stool and I love it since it works as storage as well.  I would recommend it to anyone.	
- 1	I didn't like these for a few reasons. They take up too much room in my freezer. They take too long to thaw. I don't care for the avent isis pump. I have been using the gerber freezer bags instead and I can freeze my milk flat and it thaws much quicker.	
- 1	I ordered these after having great success with two other packages of liners and discovering how much I really like the Bestbottom line! Only problem is this pack is pilling and shedding like crazy and it gets all over everything! I really appreciate the ease of use with these covers and liners. They have a trim fit and good absorbancy but this must be a bad batch. I plan to return and re-order and hope for a better liner.	
- 1	I like think the idea of our child not flinging his bowl on the floor while his was becoming more independent.These suction bowls did not do has promised.They become just another baby/toddler bowl in our cupboard.	
- 1	My baby was over 8 pounds when he was born.  I had this, but found it easier to just tuck a blanket under his butt.  This is like a huge winter coat that wraps around them & you still have the Ergo around them too.  I found it way too hot & bulky.  I just took a swaddle blanket, tucked it under his butt & it worked much better!  And as he grew I could change the amount of blanket under him so it was actually adjustable.	
1. 	Fits our toilet seat very without sliding and no space left on sides. Does not wiggle when set correctly. Suitable for boy or girl. Classy, not gaudy, if you can say that of a toilet seat.	
1. 	Our baby loves the feel of this.  It keeps her warm and the material feels really soft and doesnt irritate the baby.  We dont usually swaddle her with it but we use it for keeping her warm. We got the slightly larger size (size small) so we hope the baby will grow into it :)	
- 1	We LOVE out Britax Boulevard, and thought we'd love this one, too.The basic mechanics are different, though.1. The locking clips to lock off the seat belt (when not installed with LATCH) are awkward to close, hard to get to, and HURT LIKE HELL if you aren't using some sort of hard object to press them down with. SO hard to get a proper installation with a seat belt, rear facing.2. The cover constantly bunches up when my son is in the seat.3. The foam under his butt tore the first time we had to clean throw-up out of the seat.4. He can unlock the chest clip and get out of the seat when rear-facing (at 17 months old) and starts to get out when forward facing (at 19 months old)5. The head cushioning is so high above his head that he drops his head forward when he falls asleep, but if it were any lower, the straps would be behind his shoulder.HOWEVER: Even with these small issues, this seat is MUCH safer than the older design for forward facing.1. The new base design compresses in an accident, lowering the center of gravity, and reducing forward head rotation.2. The latch system is on a broader metal reinforcement, and gets a tighter fit than the other model. (wishing my car had latch!)3. The side air cushions protect both baby and other passengers from head trauma4. The slow-release tether slows the movement of the seat in an accident.If I could Keep Sam from escaping, we'd use the car seat still. The only one he can not get out of is a Graco Nautilus.UPDATE: 4-23-13We got rid of this car seat in December, after owning it for LESS than 6 months. At 23 months, 29 pounds, my son was too broad-shouldered for it! Seriously!? He was so squished into his seat that he was screaming, and my son loves the car. He's not even supposed to be forward facing and too big for this amazing seat. We tried a few other Britax products before going to Graco MyRide70 in Odyssey print, to match his strollers. I'm very displeased it, and hated that I wasted so much money on the damn thing. Britax was almost no help, either.	
- 1	Once I put in the car seat for out baby, he could barely move.  He was only 2 months old but fully dressed I could see this wouldn't last long.  *instead roll some receiving blankets up to put beside baby to support them*Also, tried it in stroller - a no go.	
1. 	We plan on using this play yard for our new puppy. It is easy to set up and with the extension creates a large area. The non-skid pads the mfgr provides prevents it from slipping on tile. Sometimes the panels are hard to move (to change the angle).I checked many other websites and stores and this was the best deal. I requested that is show up on a Saturday but it arrived on Friday. Great job, Amazon!	
1. 	Better safe than sorry. Easy to install. Totally toddler proof.	
1. 	Works great, but i'm not convinced the cubes are actually a full ounce.  Seem smaller than another tray I have with 1 ounce servings.	
1. 	My 4 month old son has such a cute ALL STAR room. WE have all the bedding, the lamp, wall boarder, and diaperstaker. His walls are navy blue and the wall boarder is on the top and bottom of the walls. The bedding looks so precious on his natural wood crib. The only piece of the whole set that dissapointed me was the crib sheet, it didnt fit too well so I just use it over his changing pad and use a different sports sheet instead. My son LOVES staring at his bumper and he will just look at it for HOURS sometimes, seriously! Well we also have the aquarium bed attatchment which works well. I couldnt pick a better set for him and I like thats its not cars like his 20 month old twin brothers were. I love this set and it washes VERY well, doesnt rip or fade. A perfect set and just absoulutly adorable!	
1. 	I purchased one of these 4 years ago, just before my first child was born.It's still in use in our SUV. I have a 1.5 year old also and did not put one of these under her car seat. Needless to say - it's a lot harder to get her car seat installed evenly, and I recently removed both kids' car seats and was surprised at how deep the indentation was on the side that didn't have one of these installed, so I went ahead and bought another.I love that these protect the seats, not just from dust and debris, but from deep indentations caused by car seats. They hold up really well to use. Ours has been used for the last 3.5 years and it still looks almost like new.It's a small price to pay for what you get. Don't hesitate to buy this.	
- 1	I thought this playmat would me more soft and cushiony. It's kind of flat and sticks when walking barefoot on it.It came rolled and it's been several days when we put it on the carpet and still rolls up on both ends. Also I had to put bed and shelf on 2 sides to keep it in place.I like that there are two themes on both sides, but the ocean is a bit too dark. The details are nice though.I wouldn't buy it, I would go for something more soft, and heavier to lay down by itself on the ground.	
1. 	I have checked out many of the baby foot print frames and this one is by far the best quality and the easiest to use. The plaster is quick to set, easy to do and looks good in the finished product. The frame is high qulity and has great clean lines. This is a great product that has been hard to find in the stores. I have two! Love them! (I have even knocked one off the wall on accident and it didn't break - they are good quality, not cheap!)	
- 1	My son is not interested in these toy at all. It's not very interactive or exciting. It's so cute but was not worth it.	
- 1	We needed a tub without all the bumps in the bottom so our son could play a bit more without using the whole bathtub and wasting water.  This was too narrow but would've been okay if it weren't so slippery!  The bottom is ridiculously slick, he fell 3 times at the first use.  Also, the latch is hard plastic and just stick up like a toy.  I'm sure that would break if we used the tub long enough, but we won't be.  Just awful.	
1. 	i love the fact that you can buy replacement nipples for the different stages instead of buying new bottles. Wish they would sell in stores but I guess the stores would lose money.	
1. 	We like this munchkin brand dispenser rather that the bargain one we got at the supermarket. It has a solid click to it when you shift from one serving slot to the next. With the generic brand we would sometimes over serve because the slot would be open in another tray. Great buy!	
1. 	I looked at a lot of cart covers, and I am very happy with this one.  I'm not sure about the reviews saying it doesn't fit on carts, I can't imagine how it wouldn't fit other then not being able to use the back pockets if the seat has a higher back. but the pockets are really just  small bonus, so not being able to use them in some shopping carts is really no big deal at all.The material is very nice, the pillows are so soft, no more worrying about my son chewing on the cart handle!  I really think he could just take a nap while I'm shopping.I have used this cover at the following stores, and it fit perfectly with no issues at allWalmart,Food Lion,Army Commissary (not sure if the all use the same carts)	
- 1	I originally got this because of its simplicity and the price.  I found, though, that it doesn't do a very good job of getting the food mushy enough, even with the food steamed.  I gave my daughter some of the mash and she was spitting out bits of un-ground food.I will be looking for something that purees the food a bit more.	
1. 	These plugs are pretty difficult to take out, even for me.  They are actually a bit of a pain in the butt when I want to plug something in, such as the vacuum cleaner.	
1. 	We bought one of these for my car because I was concern that the car seat would damage the leather in my car. We liked it so much that we bought a second one for my wife's car even though her car has cloth seats. It really helps keep things clean, and prevents crumbs and liquids from going into the seat cracks. The front pocket is convenient, and the 2 in 1 feature means this product will be useful for years. We have the car seat mounted in the middle back seat and the cover does kind of cover the seat belt anchor for the rear passenger seat, but its easy enough to find once you know to lift the flap.	
- 1	I laughed out loud when I opened this. It is a small SMALL piece of fabric with some ties on it. It covers about 1/4 of the sheet. What are the chances that my son will wet/throw up./whatever perfectly in that spot? Some people say to get two, but why dont they just make it bigger and charge more? It seems silly to me. Not happy at all with this. Sending it back for sure!	
- 1	I have always subscribed to the AAP's recommendation that bare is best when it comes to crb bedding. But when my son started pulling himself up in the crib he was constantly getting his legs and feet stuck through the rails. So I ordered this to keep his limbs safely in the crib. I easily installed it and it really did look sharp and stylish. However I didn't think it looked like it would still allow for air circulation. I used it for 3of my son's naps and every time I got him up from a nap he was sweating and flushed. That let me know that the air wasn't circulating as normal. So I took it off and returned it without any issue. I guess I am just a nervous nelly. I have friends who use these without any problem. It's just not for us.	
1. 	This pillow made breastfeeding noticeably easier for me.  I was set on using a Bobby from my sister, but decided at the last minute to get this.  I wanted to try it right away, but when I got home from the hospital I couldn't.  I had gained so much weight with my pregnancy that it wouldn't fit around my waist - even with the straps pulled all the way out!  That'll destroy any shred of good body image you have left!!!  So I struggled with pillows and positioning.After 2 or 3 weeks it did fit, and what a difference!  This pillow positioned her perfectly.  FINALLY, I was done with the stress, the neck pain, the backache!  I didn't even realize how tired my arms had been getting from trying to hold her in a good position until I didn't have to.Don't let your mother, sister, lactation consultant - whoever - tell you that propping the baby up with pillows is just the same.  That may be fine in bed or on the couch, but when you're struggling to stay awake in the rocking chair at night, a nice wide, flat nursing pillow is a huge help.  Besides, breastfeeding can be difficult enough.  Spend the extra money and make it a little easier on yourself.	
- 1	Shipped through low cost carrier LASERSHIP which is notorious for losing packages.....like this one. Never received product.	
- 1	It's impossible to suck water out of this cup! Got this on sale at Target and now I know why... very disappointed. There are much better sippy straw cups out there!	
- 1	I ordered the size according to my child's size, and it looked as if she had on a grocery bag around her thighs.  They were also kind of noisy, not like a plastic bag, but still noisy.  They also don't really work for keeping the pee inside. They're sitting in the drawer, because I didn't want to just throw my money away that easily. LOL!	
1. 	Wow- when I researched strollers for our baby- the Snap N Go looked like a great option with our car's limited storage- but it seemed difficult to use with the Graco SnugRide- and it lacked those little red lock-down tabs to hold down the car seat on travel systems.  When I saw Graco had issued a similar car seat frame- I was thrilled!The assembly is easy and requires no tools.  It takes me more time to prepare my diaper bag than it did to assemble this.The compact size fits beautifully in our car, the stroller is small enough to take anywhere and has a small turning radius so it's quite maneuverable.I like that the stroller gives you the same perspective of an old style pram where you can see your baby's face well while standing  or sitting.Good handle height for people around 6' tall.  The wheels are good on mostly urban surfaces and rolls easily.  The wheel locks are easy to engage and disengage- even wearing sport sandals.	
- 1	I feel as if I wasted my money here. Normally I LOVE The First Years products as I own theThe First Years miPump Single Electric Breast Pump,The First Years Quick Serve Bottle WarmerandThe First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy- all are products I adore but these are NOT EASY by any means and my two week old son busts his arms out of the top of these so easily (that's if I can get his arms to stay inside in the first place) and this defeats the purpose.  I purchased theThe Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle, Newborn Short, Kiwi Greenand it worked like magic.  Please don't waste your money!!	
- 1	This worked for awhile and then I lost some weight.  I much prefer the kind that adjusts with you as your size changes.	
1. 	I bought this years ago and I still use it all the time at the beach and at the park. Keeps you dry on wet grass. Easy to fold up. Light weight and easy to carry.	
- 1	This strap is too small to fit around my double door handles on my fridge as you see in the picture. It's got some elasticity but not enough, either the handles or the strap would break in order to make it work. Very disappointed.	
1. 	We just bought this and it is winter where we are at...well sort of and now that our toddler has gotten taller it has been very useful since she cannot fit the sacks anymore. She is still too short for the legs on these but it's like using a blanket. We bought a 2T-3T size while she is 15 months old and obviously it is too big but she can definitely grow into it which means we will get our money's worth. Just wished that they had a summer version because I have a feeling that it is going to be too warm for her during the hot summers.	
1. 	This is a fun toy for babies as the sides move into different shapes.  The plastic surfaces have various textures for chewing and touching.  Simple, yet a great product.  I recommend it.	
- 1	I put this on my registry, but after setting it up on our changing table, I realized it was not what I wanted.  It's much larger than I thought from the picture.  It took up a lot of space, and I didn't have enough misc. items to fill it up.  Everything was sagging.  I tried to put wipes at the top, but they just slid to the front.  We folded it up after a month and haven't tried to use it since.	
- 1	We are starting to potty train our 18 month old and wanted something to use while on the go.We tried using this potty seat at my friend's house and at the chiropractor's office. It did not fit both times. I could tell my son didn't feel secure on it either. I was also scared that he would pee on me, due to no guard.If you don't want to have to worry about figuring out the quirks, as it seems some have, I would just spend a little more on the Potette Plus (what we purchased later). It worked great from the get go. It is smaller than this potty, but you can also use it on the go as a stand alone potty for those times when you don't even want to bother with the hole in the wall restaurant or gas station! Also, it does have a little lip on the seat, not as prominent as a regular pee guard, but definitely much better than no guard! My son feels more secure on this and I feel less like I have to hold him the whole time to make sure he doesn't fall in.Also, here's a tip: We get a travel pack of sanitizing wipes to wipe down the toilet seat and surrounding area before we put our potty seat on.	
1. 	i do like this product but i dont think it was worth 15 dollars. if it was under 10 bucks i may have given it 5 stars. it seems a bit cheaply made. however, it does hang on the side of my changing table nicely and keeps all the little items together. i have a regular wipe container sitting on the top and it fits well. the smaller sized diapers dont fit too well because they just slide around in the little compartment and often more than one diaper pops out when you just need one, but i suppose it was made this way so you can use larger diapers as your baby gets older.	
- 1	I ordered this for my little girl's nursery that includes gray accents. I thought it would be perfect for all of the stuffed animals she's already accrued. However, once I got it out of the box, it was a lot furrier and shinier than I expected. It honestly looked like I skinned an animal and put it in the corner, especially since we didn't have enough stuffed animals to fill it yet. Maybe in another color it would look cute in a child's rooms, but for a nursery it just didn't match what I was going for and returned it.	
1. 	My daughter is 12 months today. We have had this walker for 2-3 months. She still loves it. She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean. OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!	
1. 	This is a great starter set for a new baby. I think these bottles work just as well as other more expensive bottles. You can hear the air venting from the bottle when baby eats.Pros:Prevents baby from swallowing a lot of airInexpensiveDishwasher safeAngled bottleCons:Lots of parts to put together/take apart and wash (bottle body, bottle bottom, bottom vent cover, ring, nipple, cover)Leaks- Sometimes they leak from the bottom	
- 1	I loved this audio monitor for 9 months. It was easy to set up, easy to use, worked great and the 2 parent units were awesome. Why don't more baby monitors come with 2 parent units?Well, today, I accidentally kicked the power strip while sorting stuff in the baby's room and powered off the baby unit. When I powered it back on, the parent units wouldn't connect with the baby units. I tried everything in the manual and on their trouble shooting website, and then I came here to see if anyone else had had this problem. And what do you know... LOTS of people have had this problem.So it's a known issue and the manufacturer's solution is to send you a replacement. So let me see if I understand this situation: every time I power off the baby unit, the audio monitor will cease to function I have to then call in and get a replacement? That's ridiculous. We're about to move and I don't have time to deal with getting the audio monitor replaced knowing that in a month when we move and have to unplug it, I have to call again to get it replaced. I will be returning this unit and shopping for another product.I should probably note that we did unplug it 2-3 times before this happened, so it doesn't happen right away. Looking at other reviews, it seems to happen if you unplug it after about 6 months of use.	
1. 	I'm not sure if this is normal for a child or not, but once we put this next to our toilet, our son started using it all by himself without any kind of training from us.  Even weeks later, he still runs to the bathroom to use it...The other odd part is that he likes to empty it himself.  He takes the seat off, pulls out the bucket, dumps it in the big toilet, flushes, and puts everything back together...No complaints here!	
- 1	I was so disappointed with this product, the red closure does NOT provide an airtight seal, so within a couple days all the wipes were dried out and useless.  The reviews I had read before purchasing seemed to praise it, and I was looking for a way to take just a few wipes with me vs a whole pack -- but this was a big waste of money.  DONT buy it!!	
1. 	My baby would take the bottle with a lot of bouncing fussing etc. sometimes, but I was on maternity leave so I didn't really mind the work cause bottle were occasional and I could always switch to BF if I needed to. But at 14.5 weeks I had to go back to work and there is nothing worse than A)leaving your baby to go back to work and B)being told that he won't take the bottle so that your normally happy baby is crying and fussy all day long.I was using the nipple that came with the drop-ins and it's very round and the tip seems harder and rounded too. Not exactly like the shape I am when he's breastfeeding. I had seen these in Babies R Us and didn't get them because it said medium flow. After about 3 days of my caregiver telling me he just hates the bottle I hopped on here and looked for another nipple because I had already looked in the store and there wasn't a lot of selection. I read the reviews which lead me to believe you shouldn't trust the flow speed when comparing the two nipples so I decided to go get these. The next day my caregiver text me and it said I love these nipples! He took them right away, she said it was 100% difference and now he eats when I'm away.If you use this system and baby doesn't like it very much switch to these nipples and see if it helps. My good friend is pregnant and I gave her these as part of her shower gift. I feel they are closer to a real breastfeeding experience and these should come with the bottles.	
- 1	I expected excellent quality from Fisher Price for this Meal on the Go container and was sorely disappointed. The idea of the two compartment container with a travel spoon is great but it has more design flaw than positives.  First of all, it can only be used for dry snacks because when I tested if it could hold liquid without leaking, it failed miserably! I put a little bit of water in both compartments, shut it, and when I tipped it to the side, most of the water leaked out the sides. Part of the reason it leaked is that it doesn't snap completely shut - you have to push down in about 5 places to get it to close, but even when you shut one compartment, the other comes unsnapped and the cover pops open. Lastly, the plastic just feels very cheap. The only reason I didn't give it one star is because it can carry dry snacks when traveling. Overall, this is not worth $1.00, let alone the $8.00 price tag.	
- 1	First of all, zippers for baby clothes are TERRIBLE. They roll up to the face and catch every bit of drool and puke, whether or not you have a bib on the baby. Then they also serve as binky and thumb blockers and frustrate the heck out of littles who need one or the other. I suspect the idea for them came from someone who either did not have kids, or who didn't spend enough time with their baby (or anyone else's) to ever have to deal with puke/drool cleanup and binky/thumb management. Add to that giant swaths of stiff velcro patches and you have a pretty awful execution of a great idea. My baby girl loves her hands and being tied down annoys her, but being completely unwrapped causes the startle reflex and wakes her up. The solution is to swaddle her loosely enough to allow some hand movement, but tightly enough so her upper arms and shoulders feel secure most of the time. It's a tricky balance and is nearly impossible to achieve with the overlay for this since the velcro is very specific about where it needs to go to fasten correctly, which you would think would make it smaller, but it's big huge stiff patches. Plus she can work it up to her chin quickly if the bottom velcro straps aren't fastened, and they're a pain in the neck to use. They're also very stiff and both she and I were scratched by them. The whole piece can also ride up through wiggling, so even when the swaddle part is fastened correctly; it rides up her back, binds her legs to her and blocks her mouth/nose.The only sensible design element here is that the zipper is upside down, allowing you to open up just the bottom half for midnight diaper changes.This might be great if you don't have a wiggly, grabby baby... some little one who is very still and calm and who doesn't move often, I guess. Mine's been a wiggle worm since about 13 weeks in the womb, and every ultrasound showed her with her hands near her face, so this is just not a good fit for her.	
- 1	Reviews were great so I bought it. Waste of money. Doesn't recline enough for them to even call it a &#34;reclining&#34; stroller. Feels super cheap and rickety. Very bumpy ride. My daughter couldn't begin to nap in this - and she naps anywhere. Regret the purchase. Spend the extra money and get an uppababy g-lite or something. Wish I had.	
- 1	This product was a total bust for us.  It does not stay put in either of our cars (Equinox & Prius).  If it could be installed properly, it would be perfect.	
1. 	We purchased to have this as a &#34;to go&#34; spoon, and it ended up being a favorite spoon.  Best for ages 6mo-10mo, after that they bite too much and want more substantial spoon.	
- 1	If you buy the Medela Quick Steam bags this really isn't needed - everything can go in the steam bag, dishwasher, or be washed by hand.  It's bulky and we literally haven't used it once.	
1. 	I got these bibs for a 13 month old and love them. They're light, waterproof but soft enough to be comfortable. Pocket works well for melting frozen fruit pucks she loves to eat.  Wash the right after the meal with the dishes and hang them up They're dry before the next meal as claimed.  Prints are really cute and I'll buy more.	
- 1	This crib sheet felt rough right out of the package, but I thought it might soften up with washing. Nope. It's bordering on itchy, and nowhere near &#34;sateen.&#34; I wouldn't buy his product again, and I would not recommend it.	
1. 	This pinch guard goes on easy (and comes off easy on the rare occasion that we want to close the door to our playroom).  The kids used to play with the door so much we talked about just taking it off.  Someone was always getting their fingers pinched.Since we got this they actually stopped playing with the door all together since it won't close.I would have given it 5 stars if it was just a little thicker  - if it was it would also be able to prevent the hinge from closing on little fingers too.Overall, it does what it says it does, for a good price, without being permanent.	
- 1	I didn't really do any research first and I should have.  I wanted a different warmer but this was available at the store and I liked the reservoir and the flexible options.  It worked really well for about 2 months.  Then is started leaking and now you can tell the electronics are getting wet...the beeping is sounding funny.  We are scared to use it now.Pro's flexible, water reservoir is a plusCon's leaks, loud beeping	
1. 	I bought these sturdy cups for my grand-daughter, age one year. This age and beyond love to explore with objects that can be stacked, nested, and rolled. They also have holes and are fun for water play.	
- 1	We might have a weird screen door though we are in a newer home. Amazon customer service was wonderful during the return process. We measured inside of screen to edge, and outside of screen to outer edge and both measurements were within 32-36&#34; as described though no matter what angle we used it even the wider, the outer holes would not line up with metal part of screen. So had to return ...Was a bummer as seemed like a solid product.	
- 1	Ok I thought these were much bigger. I guess that is my fault for not reading the description better. So for the money you get two small tissues err &#34;security blankets.&#34;  Seriously who could call one of  these tissues a blanket. Now this company does make some wonderful much bigger swaddling blankets. More of what I was looking for.	
1. 	I purchased this tub for a friend, off of her baby registry.Prosexactly as picturedlarge enough for an older babythe sling seemed sturdyhas a plug for drainingConsI think it has a bit too many areas/crevices to be considered easy to cleanthe foam padding on it is a bit thin	
- 1	Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.	
- 1	I wish I bought the jjcole's instead. These are so thin and the velcro strap always turns inward towards my sons face.	
- 1	I gave these away.  After going to the trouble of making baby food, I don't want it spilling and leaking everywhere.  The little tray idea was a great IDEA, but it takes up so much space in the freezer, its just not practical.  The lids don't stay on consistently.  Some were great, some weren't.  I reused old baby food jars that I washed in the dishwasher to sterilize instead.  Avoided the issues of plastic that way, anyway.	
1. 	These are fantastic.  Very thick and sturdy.  Some of the other reviews mention leaking, but I haven't experienced that at all.  As long as you follow the specific instructions - especially about not getting any milk caught in the zip-lock because as milk freezes it expands and could cause leaking - you will be fine.I also do not pump directly into the bag.  I get a much more accurate measure if I pump into the measuring bottles that came with my pump and then pour it into the bag.	
- 1	These are a pain for all of the adults involved in my son's care b/c each cup comes apart in three pieces for washing and they are a tight fit (making it so nicely spill-proof I'm sure).Tough to disassemble, and tough to reassemble.  I've also noticed the deep grooves in the spout don't like to come clean in the dishwasher, and instead collect residue and/or soap stains.	
1. 	Our daughter started fighting the diapers when she was only 6-7 months old, so in a fit of desperation, I bought this potty, put her on it and never looked back. It helped that the potty was really comfortable, with a wide, flat bottom that left no marks on her tush, and stable enough so there were no accidents.I only give it 4 stars because I really could not snap the seat to the toilet and because the whole construction is so darn plasticky. Ah, and the music never worked (no loss in my opinion, I was there to do the encouraging) and the training book seemed a bit cheesy. A toddler may also entertain thoughts of removing the easily accessible container while sitting, which may lead to a whole new set of problems. But overall, this potty has made our lives so easy during potty training, that I cannot but lavish praise over this little piece of plastic!	
- 1	My husband and I had trouble getting this monitor to work because when we finally synced up the camera to the monitor then we would accidentally push one of the side buttons which would power off the unit. Then we'd have to reprogram it again. It was just annoying. After using this monitor only a few times it just completely stopped working. We are going to try another brand now.	
- 1	The band rolls up and doesn't stay in place. The Velcro has a hard plastic underside or backing that wrinkles and is uncomfortable against your skin. Also the gel insert that you can freeze or microwave does not stay warm at all. It stays warm for like 3-5 minutes and then you have to keep reheating. Glad I got it on sale for $20, but still a waste of money. But you get what you pay for.	
- 1	the material is good - however,  it comes with only 8 small  2 inches double sided tape pieces which is nothing for a 6-feet long piece - this won't stay in place! now i have to go get some 3M tape. I also got the safety 1st guard, which does cole with long 3M double sided tape - much better option	
1. 	I breastfeed my son for 95% of his meals, but every now and then, I like to have the convenience of a bottle. If you're not trying to build a humongous stash, this is perfect. Simply twist in your pump and freeze. Thaw out the milk, shove in the dishwasher and repeat!	
- 1	We received one of these and two of the Munchkin (3 compartment dispensers).  Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it. When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle, it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid. The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping. ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3.  The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money, had we purchased it ourselves. Get the Munchkin dispenser instead.	
- 1	These were terrible.  They leaked everywhere.  I must recommend the tri-flow!	
1. 	My 2 yr old daughter it now potty trained.. I dont like her touching the public seats.. this is perfect.	
1. 	what a cost efficient way to get rid of diapers.  We scratched the diaper genie and decided to do this.  Best decision yet because the diaper genie will only mask the same amount of stink as these baggies.  Best thing, you can throw some in your diaper bag and you can change him anywhere in the house without running to a diaper pail.	
- 1	we have owned both this and the potty plus. There are some things I really enjoyed about this potty, but out of the two I strongly prefer the potty plus.Pros:*This potty is very small and easy to pack. LOVE THE SIZE. though my three year old is getting to big for it.*can buy small 5gal hefty bags to use in these.*can easily be set up. easy enough that my 2 and 3 year old can set it up by themselves.Cons:*though it is easy to set up, it is not always easy to lock the legs in properly.*I find it a bit flimsy and have worried that it will collapse while my child is on it. This has only actually happened once. She was unharmed but i wonder about pinched fingers.*can only be used on the floor.I give the 2 star rating because the flimsiness causes safety concerns. Public bathroom breaks with 2 toddlers need to be easy, fast, safe and manageable. I think this product doesn't provide the security for me to watch BOTH children. I have to focus to much on the one on the potty. The potty plus DOES give me that security, but this one does not. I also find that that though I love the SIZE and easy of packing, this doesn't make up for my not being able to use it on a toilet seat. basically. its a decent potty in a pinch, but not a great staple travel potty.	
- 1	For solid foods this container is okay.  I would avoid this item if you want something leak proof.  The lids are difficult to snap down, and even with a lot of effort to make sure that the lids were sealed all the way around, liquid still escaped from both sides.  I would only use this for foods like mac/cheese, cheerios, and items of similar consistency... Cleans really easily in the dishwasher, though.	
- 1	I was terribly uncomfortable and needed some support for my baby belly, but this was not even close to the answer to my problem. I'll say it again because these are the only two words worthy of writing about this product:Terrible and pointless.	
1. 	I was so hoping this would work with the drop ins bottles so I could pump right into the drop ins, but no.  It was a waste of money for me but I'm sure a dandy product.	
1. 	we use this every day at the kitchen table.  very easy to wipe clean.  I think of the various chairs I've seen this one is the best for every day use because it wipes clean so easily.  I don't think they really need the padded style.  One thing that was a slight issue when she was little was that she seemed to have difficulty drinking her bottle because she had to tip her head back.  This chair makes it a little difficult to tip the head back when they're really little and short.	
- 1	The suction cups won't stick to the formica around our tub.  I thought maybe they would stick if we had tile, but I see that others with tile tub surrounds can't get it to stick either.  Now that I think about it, suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower & glass storm door too, so I guess I should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder.  This Fisher Price corner bath cubby is a waste of money, I'm going to try the kidco storage caddy instead.  I wish I had gotten it in the first place & I suggest you do the same.	
1. 	&#34;Take and toss&#34; sums it up perfectly -- these are perfect for toddlers who are more interested in tool use than actually eating, and more to the point, toddlers who count &#34;spear throwing&#34; as &#34;tool use&#34;!PROS* Bumpy, squeezy handles make for easy gripping* Fun, mix-and-match colors* Good valueCONS* For actually coming into contact with food, the softish plastic concerns me somewhat. I will NOT be giving these to my toddler to use with warm foods or even for regular meals. Instead, I'm reserving them for picnics/outings and this specific stage at which she's just playing with her food (not much eating it).	
1. 	My 4 month old is teething and drools EVERYWHERE so we just put one of these bibs on (comes in almost every color so it always matches what he is wearing) and it saves me from changing his shirt 8 times a day!	
1. 	don't waste your time trying to find a cheaper, generic nipple for your Avent bottles!!  ours are so old they don't even indicate which newer Avent nipple is correct... so figured 'classic' ought to do it!!  it does!	
1. 	This really worked great for my baby from day one. I used it until she was about 6 months. It is a really nice, comfortable pad and I think my baby enjoyed using it. The only thing that I didn't like as much was when she got to be about 4.5-5 months she would slip down and I would have to keep re-positioning her. But that didn't bother me too much. I still really like this product and would recommend for new babies.	
1. 	I thought the regular Bumkins bibs were great, and then I got these! With cold weather came long sleeves and I was tired of pulling my 17 month old daughter's sleeves up, which only sort of worked anyway - she is a messy eater and getting into a defiant stage. These have been wonderful! No liquid soaks through, and the sleeves fit well so they drag in the food and are not cumbersome. The fabric is lightweight and breathable. We even used them with her formal Thanksgiving dress and, as usual, not a single drop or stain on her outfit. Now if they just made something for the hair and face! Hahaha! Seriously, best bib ever.	
1. 	I find it very useful when I have to take milk or liquid with me that I don't need right away. Fits gerber bottles too.	
1. 	I bought a new play mat because my daughter didnt enjoy being in the other one, it had only 3 toys hanging and was really boring. I bought this one and she loves it! There is a setting and you can make it so the music only goes off when they kick it or play with it or you can have so that is plays for 20 minutes. It was worth the money. My daughter also likes tummy time on this and she hated it on the other one. My daughter is almost 3 months old so i think it is good for even for newborns.	
1. 	This toy is very nice with great colors, textures and a nice clicking noise. Good for little one's who can crawl after it.	
- 1	The finish is just as described, fairly simple but time consuming to put together and perfect for a small amount of clothes. This is not a long term dresser by any means, Two knobs refuse to tighten and the drawers don't line up quite right. It's being used as a dresser in a nursery. Eventually, my two children will share and room and I'll be getting a matching suite of furniture but in the mean time this does do the job.	
1. 	These are great for little ones, Once my daughter got a little older she became attached to her blanket and had to sleep with it, by that time she could roll over, etc. so we weren't as worried about her sleeping with it.  When she got older she didn't want her feet confined, but when she was little, these were great for cold winters.	
1. 	I like these they are great, they do the job they are intended to do and protect my LO's clothes from all the messiness of solids!	
1. 	This exersaucer is my duaghter's favorite, and I couldn't live without it!! She is always, and constantly, entertained by it. We began using it when she was 4 months old and she is now almost 7 months and she uses it all day long! There isn't a day that goes by that she doesn't play in it! The toys are very safe, she pulls and tugs and chews on them, without any problems. I've even washed the cloth flag and frog because she saturates them, and they wash easily and hold up beautifully. Cant' say enough about it!	
- 1	We wanted to use this as a crib for our baby's first months when he was sleeping in our room. We also wanted to use it for travel. Unfortunately the mattress is really flimsy and doesn't lay flat. Also the bassinet doesn't have adequate support frame so it really sags in the middle. I try to lay my baby in it longways and he ends up perpendicular as he gradually slides down into the divot. It seems like there is a propensity for the baby to roll over because of this sag/slant. We put a giant piece of cardboard under the mattress as a support and this helps some but it still sags in the middle gradually as the cardboard starts to give.My mom also bought a Graco pack n play for when we are visiting and it has a simliar issue even though it is a more expensive model. Apparently Graco doesn't make them like they used to. My mother in law has an old Graco pack n play and it has an awesome bassinet that doesn't sag at all.We are looking to buy a new pack n play as the sag is so bothersome to us.	
- 1	I ended up not even using this calendar. The drawings and information felt like it came from a textbook in 1970. It looked like something my mom would've used as a teenager. Besides that, it just came with some useful, but unnecessary stickers. Wouldn't buy it again.	
- 1	I bought this because my baby was kicking up a storm and of course it looks adorable... the issues I have with it are 1) the mat is paper thin - no padding so you'd have to put it on carpet or a blanket, 2) the pieces don't connect well- the yellow arch never stays up and connected to the mat, and the forget the piano 3) inherently, your kiddo is laying down so if they actually kick the thing, they can't see it, 4) if you're thinking you'll just use it as an activity mat - again it's really thin and the toys are kinda boring...I just think if your babies like to kick, let them kick on their own and save your money for either a good activity mat or a fun little piano when they can sit up - the mixing of the two on this is really not well designed/well worth it.	
1. 	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!	
1. 	I bought one of these after my daughter was born to replace the My Brest Friend (which was terrible).  I love it and so does my baby.  We are still using it 9 months later.  So when my sister in law had her baby shower I knew she had to have one.  The Velcro safety strap is a great bonus.  Except this one doesn't have a removable cover for washing and the one I purchased for myself did, so I left out a star for that.	
- 1	Not really soft at all or absorbent multiple feeding if you had a spit up. The colors are cut and it does the job.. briefly.Also when I got them I had to wash right away (would've anyway) cause it looked like they'd been dropped and trampled before packaging.	
- 1	These don't work that great at keeping our kids poop smells at bay in the trash. I found that using a 13 gallon trash bag twisted around the diaper and then turned inside-out and twisted again then tied worked far better. You can get almost just as many uses from a pack of 75 13gal trash bags and they are so much cheaper (about $2). I say this because I had to double bag the sassy bags to actually control the smells. I'm no longer using these because I've switched to cloth diapers.Another bad thing is they aren't biodegradable, maybe they should change that.	
- 1	I purchased this for my four month old.  She was only entertained for a minute and then screamed until it was removed.  I'm not sure why but she just didn't like it.  I wonder if it was because it was too close to her face.  The infant carrier handle was as far back as it could go but this toy still seemed to be right on top of her.  Unfortunately I will have to return it.  I gave it two stars because it had an excellent price ($9 at Walmart) and it stayed attached well.	
1. 	My son (7mths) and his live in cousin (6mths) love this toy. They just bounce up and down like crazy. My son will only play in it for a few minutes though because he does not like to bounce as much. As for his cousin he loves it beyond words. In fact he loves it so much that when we hold him we have to be ready to be the Jumperoo because he will start jumping. Since he does spend so much time in it his legs are much stronger and he is able to push himself more when trying to crawl verses my son.We love:1. The colors2. The sounds and the fact that you can set them to where every movement made by baby sets them off.3. The toys are fun and easy to clean.4. It is height adjustable5. I folds up in a snap6. easy to put together7. seat is pretty easy to pull out to cleanDrawbacks:1. It is pretty large2. Legs are not as sturdy as I would likeupdate 6/5/06my son is now 9.5 mths old and he still loves this toy!! We put him in it before nap time and within a few minutes he is passed out while still jumping!!!!!!!! This toy is FANTASTIC and we still have one more size adjustment to go, so we have at least a few more months to go before he grows out of it.	
1. 	THEY ARE I WAS I SPECTED, GOOD QUALITY, GOOD PRESENTATION, PERFEECT PRICE, GOOD FOR CHILD AND GOOD FOR BABIES FROM 9 MONTHS	
- 1	I wanted to love this, because it received such good reviews, but we tried using it to no avail.  If you are nursing I recommend you use pillows at the hospital to prop your baby up, and then decide once you know what positions, etc. you are going to use whether you need something like this.  My guess is you will not once you figure things out.	
1. 	I purchased (2) sets of these and love them.  They are easy to install and easy to operate from the front or back seats.  The shades provide ample protection from sunlight to the grandchildren.	
- 1	I got this bottle for my exclusively breastfed 6 month old who was never introduced to a bottle as a young infant. We tried several other bottles and nipples and he would never latch. After reading the review from the lactation consultant I decided to they these.At first I was impressed with the bottle because he would latch 50% of the time - a huge improvement from never latching. Sadly, after several weeks of practice I was never able to get him to latch reliably. I left him with grandma while I attended a wedding and he outright refused to latch for her.They are very annoying to clean. They are dishwasher safe but the interior lip of the bottle always traps water even when placed in the dishwasher completely upright. I never felt like they were completely clean since leftover dishwasher water was sloshing around in them. Even when I hand washed them and set them out to dry the water would pool on the lip.Milk gets trapped inside the bottle lip during feedings. I struggled with milk supply so pumped milk was like gold and it was frustrating to see milk wasted. The only way to get all the milk out is to hold the bottle completely upside down and swirl it around to encourage the milk off the interior lip. Not exactly a natural angle to hold a bottle while feeding a baby.I never did find a good way to warm milk inside this bottle (it is short and fat). Instead, I warmed the milk in the glass bottle that I pump into and then poured it into the mOmma bottle.My son started on a straw sippy cup (Playtex Baby First Lil' Gripper Twist 'n Click Straw Trainer Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary) at 10 months and I completely gave up on bottles. I've learned the hard lesson for the next baby that I need to introduce a bottle before they are 2 months.It is encouraging to read the other review that says the nipples from this bottle fit Avent bottles. If that is true I would skip the bottles all together and just get the nipples. I had some success with the mOmma nipples and perhaps if the bottle wasn't so terrible I would have pushed the bottle training more.----UPDATE----I had some Dr Brown's Wide-neck bottles in the cabinet so I decided to try the mOmma nipples in them. They fit perfectly and didn't leak when I had my son drink his almond milk from it. He still struggles with latching continuously but with some time and patience he drank 4 oz with no leaks.Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 oz - 3-Pack	
1. 	Bought these as a snack cup for my daughter. They work great for most snacks. We've had goldfish crackers, Gerber Graduates Puffs, cheez-its, and even animal crackers in these. They just don't work so well for cheerios.The silicone lids stay on reasonably well and are easy for children to reach their hands through and soft for sensitive baby skin. They won't stay on if you kids waves them about really wildly, but stay on better than I had expectedThe one draw back is that the fins of the lids don't completely touch leaving a very small opening. This is fine for most snacks, but cheerios are small enough to slip through with just a little shaking. Otherwise they work as intended and are great for snacking when the kid is on the move; especially in the stroller.	
- 1	This crib is awful.  The only good thing about it is that it is so small and lightweight.  Here is why I hate it1. It is so hard to set up.  You have to shove these tight bungee cord things into the legs each time.  It takes two peole at least a half hour and leaves you sweating.  Not cool when you have a screaming baby in a hotel room at midnight!2.  The matress is uncomfortable and my baby hated it.  It is so thin!3.  It is hard to take down and you can't stuff it back into that little bag correctly.4.  The bag it comes in is cheap, mine tore after two uses.If you want something almost as small and light but 10000 times better go for the baby born travel crib!	
- 1	Don't use for baby, made out of PVC (vinyl) - not good for baby (or you). I don't know of any other retractable gate on the market that is vinyl free. We used summer infant metal and mesh gates for our living room and doors.	
1. 	I bought this for cloth diapers and so far its holding in the smell really well. It holds two or three days worth of diapers which is perfect. The lid DOES come up easily so it won't keep kiddos out.	
1. 	This is a great swing and my daughter loves it.  She likes to look at the moving birds and leaves at the top.  I love that you can change swinging directions.  Worth every penny!	
1. 	Highly recommend buying online from Amazon the prices in the store are a lot higher these are good bottles cause you can actually hear the air coming out bottom less colic, and you can take them apart so your getting a cleaner bottle and can order different flow nipples . Recommend this item .	
1. 	Just perfect !!! works great, small, easy to use very practical! For the price it's great! Work with my glass and plastic bottles...	
1. 	My daughter has been using these for the last (6) weeks and loves them.  They are easy to use and clean, and the nipple really seems perfect for moms who are breastfeeding.The baby has not had any gas issues while using these. Now purchased them in (2) sizes....5 STARS	
- 1	I purchased this when my son was still a newborn, and ended up returning it. I am a smallish person and this was my first time nursing, though I wouldn't characterize the experience as particularly troublesome. I just needed something supportive to prop the little guy up on, and to keep me more comfortable in those early months. This didn't cut it: Too soft and floppy to be useful to me, though otherwise the product seemed to be of good quality. I found a my brest friend type of product--something firmer--worked best.	
1. 	My daughter had trouble taking a bottle at around 2-3 months. We tried every single suggested bottle out there including the silicone nipples that came with the drop ins. I ordered these latex ones and she finally took the bottle! This is her preferred nipple now. After about 1-2 months they don't show any wear yet. I've heard latex needs to be replaced more frequently but I haven't noticed it yet.	
- 1	This is the second Yookidoo bath toy we've owned that stopped working only a couple of months after we got it.  Changing the batteries didn't help.  These toys are WAY too expensive for the shoddy craftsmanship they provide.  I've tried to e-mail Yookidoo with no response so I guess their customer service is non-existent as well.  The only reason they get two stars is because my daughter did like the toy while it worked.	
- 1	What genius decided to make this thing so SHORT?! A lady who just delivered a baby doesn't need the added back ache of having to bend over nearly to the ground to throw away a diaper.Not only that, but the handle sticks (and then pops off the side) on a regular basis.Also, when you open the chute to dispose of a diaper, you get a giant nose full of everything that's in the bin.  In other words, the awful stink that is in the bin is scooped into the disposal chamber and wafts out into the room every time you throw a diaper away. This is definitely NOT odor proof.The old model was taller and didn't hurt our backs.The old model did not STINK every time you threw away a diaper.WHY IN THE WORLD DID THEY CHANGE THE DESIGN?!	
1. 	Just what you need for the braun ear thermometer.  Snaps on easy and discards easy.  No problems with this.	
- 1	Our infant has GERD and swaddling works well with her colic-like symptoms. She's also a big baby coming in at 9 lbs 9 oz at birth. At almost 12 weeks she's 14 lbs and 25 inches tall so fitting in a swaddle is important because you don't want to shove her in one and hurt her growth. Length, these work well, so well I'm not sure how a smaller baby would fit. They're soft and seem well made (hence the 2 stars), BUT our girl can wriggle out of these in about ten seconds. And it only takes her that long because she is so tall, if she were shorter, it'd be even faster.	
- 1	Dont buy or waste your money really bad. It gets a star because >The hippo is cute but it's piece of garbage. Sending back hope I can.	
1. 	I found it very useful. It fits nicely with all the BabyBjorn carriers. The material is very good and durable. It doesn't look cheap. It's also light weight. My baby stays pretty warm and comfortable in it. I'm not sure if it can cover her the same way in her infant car seat though. Anyway, I still recommend it to others.	
- 1	Put it in the fridge and when I took it out an ooz was coming out of it. The ooz was sticky and would not come off, it just kept coming out. Don't buy.	
- 1	I ordered 8 of these sets for my wife now, since on the first 4 the rubber seal (in the middle) started shrinking and warping after 4 months. This almost caused an issue feeding the baby since my wife was first thinking it was her output.Just be warned that these seals (which can't be purchased on their own) have a VERY high failure rate. Especially very warm water (dishwasher, steaming or just very hot dishwater) causes them to shrink/warp.If you check other reviews, you will notice similar reviews. When we contacted Medela, they more or less confirmed the issue.They should really sell these seals as a separate unit since the plastic pieces are doing well.	
- 1	The formula doesn't stay in its compartments. I started out with four compartments of formula and ended up with two nearly empty compartments and two nearly full compartments. I no longer had properly measured out formula and it was a disaster. I tossed it that day.	
1. 	I really like this cover. It's very pretty and it folds up small to fit in my diaper bag. I love the hoop at the top to be able to see down to your baby. Using a blanket is awful compared to one of these. I also love the terry cloth pocket in the corner to hold your nursing pad or wipe up messes.That said, it seems a bit expensive for what it is, and the &#34;multi-use!&#34; claims above make me roll my eyes. No, it can't double as a blanket, it's way too thin for that. (Which is nice so your baby doesn't get hot while nursing.) I'm deducting a star for what feels like too high of a cost, but other than that it's a good cover and I'd buy it again if something ever happened to this one.	
- 1	I wish I had researched these a bit more carefully before I bought them. I was sucked in by the cute contrast stitching and organic material. However once I washed them for the first time I realized I had wasted my money. Let's face it, the price isn't cheap for only five cloths. When you first receive them they are super soft and the perfect size but after one wash (on delicate, with baby detergent, and dried on low) they were pilley, paper thin, and had shrunk to a size that is way too small to be effective. Yes, I suppose you could delicately hand wash them and line dry them, but is this really going to get something clean that you are using to absorb baby spit up and drool, I don't think so. I would NOT recommend these!!!	
- 1	many times my girl has hurt yoo hoo when sitting down. its sometimes hard to pop off the bowl you empy which is gross when you splash. my daughter who likes to put the pottys back together can never get this one. for the price there are better potty's out here.	
- 1	My son just chewed off the top of the silicone spout right away, so the cup became useless.  Otherwise it works fine.	
- 1	I bought this because it was a cute idea. It's cute to wear and my little guy liked to gnaw on it. But then I realized that it could potentially be a choking hazard if one of the beads came loose. We no longer use this product.	
1. 	I ordered the unbleached ones and received them in the mail today. They are SO soft! I love the colored rainbow thread around the edges. They are so pretty I almost hate to use them as baby wipes. I love how soft they are and I can't wait to start using them!EDIT:After washing these for the first time prior to their first use, I decided to edit my review. The wipes shrank a LOT and they also are not as soft anymore. They are still soft enough for baby and they seem like they will still be pretty absorbent, but they are not as soft as they were nor nearly as large. I wanted big cloths so that I could use fewer wipes, so I am kind of disappointed.EDIT:After using these for a while I decided to edit my review once again. The diapers have not shrunk any more after the first washing, or at least not that I have noticed. They are VERY absorbent. I use a cloth wipe solution in a spray bottle that I first spray on the wipe and then use. One wipe goes a long way I have noticed. I really like these. I also have some soft terry cloth wipes and some flannel wipes cut from old stained receiving blanket and these are the best by far. The nubs on the terry cloth are better for cleaning super duper messes, but we have very few of those and they still aren't as absorbent as these. I love them. I would order more if it wasn't for the fact that the serging around the edges hasn't stopped some of them from fraying. Also I have a ton of stained receiving blankets now that I think I would rather use for wipes instead of paying for more of these.	
- 1	I just got back from a trip to Puerto Rico; this was the first time we used the bag since I purchased it.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it would accommodate our car seat, which is pretty large - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WH3RB0/ref=oh_details_o06_s03_i00 - but unfortunately, by the time we got home from the trip, it had a number of holes in it; ranging in size from 1/8&#34; to 1/2&#34;.  The casters worked well and the straps are sturdy, so I'll give it 2 stars.  Bottom line:  It looks tough, but I can't imagine what it would look like after two or three more trips.  For the price, it should hold up to dozens of trips...	
1. 	This SleepSack is great. It swaddles perfectly. As it turns out my son hates to be swaddled, so we'll be giving this away and replacing it with a wearable blanket.The fleece is super soft and warm, perfect for winter nights.The zipper zips down, rather than up, making for really easy diaper changes at all hours while keeping the baby warm.The only downside is the sound the velcro makes opening. Its startling to my son, but honestly the velcro does seem quieter than some I've used, and I don't know how else this would give such a secure swaddle.For reference, my son was born at 9 pounds even and is 20.5 inches long. The newborn size fits him well right now, but would likely need to be replaced with a bigger size in a month or two.	
1. 	This is one of the few seat covers without odd sticky stuff on the back that will ruin leather seats! I love that it comes up the back and protected my seat from my rear facing tall guy.Highly recommend, have in all cars.	
- 1	I got this as a gift and it worked well for my baby's first 4 weeks or so, but once he hit a certain weight (maybe 10 lbs.) the thing stopped swinging even on the highest level. Now we have to push it manually, which is stupid. The bar in the middle also falls down and won't stay in place. My son really likes watching the things swing and those flowers were some of the first objects he focused on, but the bar topples on him easily. It's soft so it doesn't hurt or anything, but again it is poorly designed. I wouldn't waste your money on this glider at all!	
- 1	These bottles were a nice addition to the collection, before I noticed how poorly they were constructed. The anti-colic valve at the base may help to relieve the symptom (I never noticed since I have a jackpot baby that's never been colicy), but the base leaks. Out of 4 bottles, at least 2 will dribble when placed on a flat surface and a third is suspect. While this could be understandable after months of use, these're so new they still have some of the cling wrap on them.The odd shape may help with holding but also makes the bottles a little more difficult to clean, making it feel like you have to remove the valve at the base as well as at the head to get every part of the internal curves.Overall, not worth it. I got these as a set of backup bottles, and they're almost all going in the trash before a weeks use.Seeing as how I got two negative votes on the day I wrote this, please provide feedback as to why you do not find this review helpful, as I feel like this is fairly written to illustrate what I felt was a serious design flaw.	
1. 	Here's the deal. If a kid wants in somewhere bad enough and has enough time to work on it, they will overcome safety features. I put this on my toddlers closet door to keep her out. After about 6 months or so she learned to push all her weight on the one side and then pull the other side toward herself. The glue did it's job! the lock stayed in place, but one of the wings cracked. It still does the job, but she now has it figured out. This is not really a flaw in the product, my toddler just has a way of sticking with something...	
1. 	The bear works well, but I wish the sound would go for a longer period of time. It only plays for 5 minutes, which isn't enough to get my little one to sleep.	
- 1	Its probably because my baby isn't tall enough, but He can't put his feet on this thing without it sliding when he is on the toliet. The top surface is nice, but the bottom needs more slide resistance.	
- 1	I did not buy this camera from Amazon but wanted to share my disappointment with others looking for a reliable video baby monitor. We received this monitor in October 2012. I loved how clear the picture was, the range was decent, and the additional cameras are convenient. However, after 6 months, the sound stopped working. Motorola sent me a replacement. About 1 1/2 months later, the sound on THAT unit stopped working. Motorola sent me a replacement. Not even 1 month later, and the sound on THIS unit has stopped working. I continue to have it replaced since it's still under warranty (rather than pay another $200 for a new system), but I suspect they are sending refurbished units as the replacements, which is why the life of the product has dropped dramatically. I'm really disappointed and, obviously, frustrated.	
1. 	Our son had reflux, so he slept in a Rock and Play rocker bed for the first 6 months.  When we tried to transfer him to the pack and play or crib, he just screamed and cried and did not sleep more than 30 minutes at a time (with protest!).  Since he was able to sit up and his legs were starting to hang out the end of the Rock and Play, we had to do something!We bought this wedge (which came in one piece unlike some of the other reviews) and put it under the mattress on the pack and play.  We then took two rolled up towels and put them under the sheets on either side of our son.  This recreated the feel of the Rock and Play and he slept in it the first time we tried!  We also let him play in the pack and play for the few days before the wedge arrived - hoping to create a positive feeling about the thing before having him sleep in it.I know we're lucky he slept in it right away, but without the wedge and the towels, he would not sleep in it!  So, it worked for us.  Also, he is now 7 months (two weeks sleeping with the wedge in the pack and play) and he does not slide off the wedge.  Not to the side or the bottom.  We will slowly start to remove the towels (use smaller ones...) and then eventually remove the wedge.  But for now, it works great.A note: If you are expecting this wedge to be high enough for the recommended reflux elevation, it isn't!  It is fairly subtle in terms of lift.  So, if your child is still dealing with reflux and needs a significant incline, read the details so you know what you're getting.	
1. 	For our first child we did not have this awesome little gadget. Just bought it for baby number 2. It fits perfectly on the diaper changing station attached to our crib. No more bending in a hustle!	
- 1	I don't know if it's because of the size of my baby (over 10 lbs and 22 in long as a newborn), but this sling doesn't hold my baby up during baths.  He slides right down it and ends up in a hunched over position before too long.  The only good thing about this product is that it's cheap so I don't feel like I wasted a lot of money on it.  We used it twice before giving up on it.	
1. 	This is a very cute and interesting toy. It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience. This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.	
- 1	I got this blanket today and it seemed small.  I measured it and end to end, including bindings, it was 25&#34; wide and 29.5&#34; high.  Certainly not 30&#34; x 40&#34; as stated.  If it shrinks even more when it washes, that's even worse.	
1. 	My son is very content sitting in this bouncer. He is 2 months old and has found out that if he kicks the toys on the toy bar move so he will entertain himself for quite a while. The vibrator is a little noisy but that is the only flaw of this chair. I was afraid it wouldn't be deep enough and wouldn't comfort him but now at his age but it works just fine and I can put a blanket in it if I feel he needs more comfort that day. I probably wouldn't recommend this for any baby under 2-3 months because of this though.	
1. 	The free one we got from the hospital at delivery final wore out and I was looking for a replacement. This one is perfect! Holds two large DrBrowns bottles. Definitely recommend	
1. 	I was watching my son, 18 months old, play with his nesting cups this morning and I realized how wonderful this product is.  The colors are vibrant.  The largest cup has a handle.  On the bottom of each cup, there are ridges to help stack the cups.  The #1 reason this product is superior to other nesting cups is the size of each of the cups; each cup is clearly smaller than the next.  Maybe that's not a great reason for some people, but life doesn't always have to be frustrating, especially at 18 months old.  We can upgrade to a more challenging set later.	
- 1	Very flexible and small, so a child can push the whole teether into her mouth. This product should be recalled.	
1. 	It is very soft, and I like the color.It is large for my 7 month baby. Also recommended .the price is also good for the quality.	
1. 	We were looking for old fashioned alphabet blocks with letters and numbers on them. These are perfect. Exactly what we had hoped for.	
1. 	For such a cheap price, you really get a workhorse of a high chair. I love not having a separate/standalone high chair in my dining room. This attaches to chairs so easily and it feels sturdy. I love how it's all plastic and easy to clean. My only complaint has to do with the white dishwasher-safe tray. Because my son was dirtying up the sides of the seat when eating I found that I could never get away with just washing the dishwasher-safe white tray -- I always had to wash the blue tray as well because the sides had food on them. So I gave up using the white part and just use the blue so that I only need to clean the blue tray.	
- 1	We purchased Kidkusion Hearth Kushion (Taupe) expecting it to adhere to a hearth. But, no! We followed instructions to the T, but as soon as our 14-month-old granddaughter inspected the kushion, she removed all of it and carried it around like a new-found toy. We might try applying the Seal 'N Peel caulk (as recommended by another customer); however, if this product were any good, additional material and labor would not be needed. This is the first item purchased through Amazon that I have rated so poorly.	
- 1	LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! I JUST LIKE THE HANDLES ON THE CUP BUT NOT A GOOD CUP BECAUSE IT LEAKS.	
- 1	I have to say I don't really love this one.  My daugther who came with me to register for my shower was really wanting this for her little brother.  I was really wanting the Baby Papasan bouncer because it looked much more cozy and comfortable.  I should have gone with my gut feeling on this.  First of all, I think that for a new baby this is much too upright.  You cannot adjust that part of the bouncer at all.  It is just really upright and that's all there is to it.  They should have really considered that there would be very young babies in this because after all, that's the time when you need a bouncer the most.  Also, I feel like it was way too stimulating at times.  My other kids would come and turn it on while my son was in it and everything would go off at once.  Also, the little red frog on here was so annoying.  It gets stuck and just clicks and clicks.  You really can't fix it.  Finally, my daughter did something to it and it has stopped.  I could not figure out how to make it stop though.  My son does seem to like the monkey and the parrot, but as he got older I felt like he got a little more frustrated because they are always in his way.  When he is in this there is so much stimulation going on and he cannot see over the bar to interact with anyone.  I hardly ever use the bar any more, but I still just wish that I had registered for a different one.  Not a great product, I feel like Fisher-Price could have done more with this instead of just adding every toy and sound they could to it, not to mention your little baby is practically sitting up like a full on adult.	
1. 	Our toddler has been sleeping in Halos since he was a tiny baby, they're so practical and easy to put on.	
- 1	Crystal clear sound? Check. Yes, I can hear my baby breathing, but I can also HEAR a lot of nothing. Which is what I'm trying to avoid. In my dreams, no sound from the baby's room would result in NO SOUND on the baby monitor. This one doesn't do it.As far as the other reviews, the lights really aren't that bothersome, and I am very sensitive to light when I go to bed. The static/white noise, however, is killer.If you like to sleep with a sound machine, maybe you would love this one. You can hear your baby AND constant white noise at the same time!	
- 1	The 2013 model is defective. The crotch strap is too short and apparently causes problems for many children as it did for mine. When this happens to you, you will need to pay an additional $5 plus $5 shipping to get a replacement part, if they happen to have any in stock. Next year's model has a longer crotch strap. It's very frustrating to spend so much money on a car seat and then have to repeatedly call a customer service line that no one staffs to then pay more money to fix seat defects (sorry not defects because those they would have to pay for, clek calls it an improvement that they are making to other models). Before this I was a huge fan of the seat but the way the company chose to handle this clear product design problem means I'll never do business with them again.	
- 1	I should have listened to all the other reviews about this product. I read them and thought, &#34;eh, how hard can it be to watch it and make sure it doesn't get too hot&#34;. Well, when you are sleep deprived and it's the middle of the night and you fall back to sleep the answer is HARD.  There is no signal that the bottle is ready you have to just keep checking it. Hate this bottle warmer with a passion.	
- 1	My husband and I both tried to use this shade and it just constantly blew back on windy days thereby defeating the purpose.  It is not 'firm' enough to withstand even a breeze really.  We tried attaching it every which way to keep it stable and we just couldn't get it to work well.  Not to mention, our son really likes to look around and it blocks his view a lot.  I'm still looking for a good solution to the sun issue!	
- 1	The clasp is cheap and didn't stay. Kept coming undone. I stopped using and found other ways to cover up creatively.	
1. 	Why I love this toilet....it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the toilets out there...but really, why do you need them? This one is easy to clean...must be pretty comfortable because my kid will sit on it and read in the bathroom...it is the perfect height...and has a nice seat back....best part, it doesn't tip over (yet at least). Not sure how it works for boys...but for a girl it worked well.	
- 1	I live in a fairly large complex with tons of neighbors all around me.  Everyone has wi-fi around me and I was afraid of getting a baby monitor with a video on it.  Yes I am a little paranoid about this but I am also a parent.I looked all over the place read tons of reviews on various websites and thought why not it's made by Sony it has to be good.  I was super excited that it is waterproof for bathroom uses (showers)!  The first night I was super impressed.  I was to a point of writing a five star review on this item.Then my cell phone rang.  When my cell phone rings and is even five feet away from this monitor the monitor has a very high pitch screeching death to my ears sound that is constant until I shut off the monitor then I answer my cell phone.  I can't even be by this monitor when I am talking on my cell phone either.  This is okay if you never ever call anyone or want to talk to anyone when your child is taking a nap which is the only time a parent can actually even talk on the phone is during nap time.  So it's an okay monitor.The other downside to this monitor is that it BEEPS to let you know when it needs to be charged and there is no indicator to let a parent know when it's getting low on its battery charge until it's 3 AM and everyone is asleep and a parent hears BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP until you plug it in.  It's bad enough that a monitor wakes you up to get it charged and not a child.The plus side to this monitor is that my child wakes up and talks to himself for twenty minutes or so.  I can hear him talk to himself with no static on the monitor as long as my phone doesn't ring.  This was the point of getting the monitor as he does not cry when he first wakes up.  I can tell when he needs to get picked up as he starts to huff on the monitor and I can get him before he wakes the world up with his cry.Overall it works --- and it does not work for us ---  Overall, I think I would try a different waterproof monitor, if there is one out there let me know THANKS!	
1. 	I don't pump into the bag because I don't pump 5oz on each side and then it would waste a lot of bags.  So I pump into the plastic containers and pour into the bags. It's a little tricky to get the milk in and out.  The new design of Medela bags are worse - they have holes in the top for a direct-pumping contraption and the milk can pour out the holes as you pour it into the bottle for feeding if you're not careful!  My husband cuts the tops off the bag before pouring to avoid the milk coming out the attachment holes as he is pouring it out.  Otherwise, I have been very happy with the bags.  I've used hundreds already and never had leaking or freezing issues.  You do have to do the ziploc up really tight - I go over it 5 times to make sure it's sealed - because otherwise the milk can come out if the bag falls on its side.	
- 1	I like the safety of these outlet covers, but the casing is too thick so plugs will not work unless it is perfectly flush with your walls.  We live in a 20 year old home and these outlet covers work on 1/3 rd of our outlets.	
- 1	Waste my $$$!!..Can fit but water keep leaking out fr the rubber ring..Cannot return because it is openedI am stuck with it.. but I like the hippo.. kinda cuteWont recommend to anyone	
1. 	The body support is great, however our daughter's head never stayed properly in place even with both this support & the car seat's head support cushion. We ended up getting a completely different head support that actually worked.	
- 1	I bought this for my 9 month old. She immediately loved it. I love the soft supportive seat and we all know it's absolutely ADORABLE. However, and this is a BIG however, The bar on the back is situated in such a position that the baby's heels hit, and get stuck. I mean, my daughter screamed as soon as she moved forward because it cuts in to her acheles tendon! Aweful. I will be getting rid of this and opting for a Chicco walker instead. Such a shame. They really should have the seat centered instead of towards the rear. Awful Awful.	
- 1	Right out of the box, it did not work! Probably needed a new battery. But who wants to have to replace a battery in a cheap potty watch/timer they just bought! I returned it.	
- 1	I bought this item because the go mama go brand that I bought for the main front rail had been back ordered and my son was trying to eat his crib for lunch.  They are not very well padded and so when my son hit his head on them he still hurt himself.  The real dangerous part is that the thing is held on primarily by one long strip of standard velcro.  It goes over the vertical slats of the crib and velcros on in the gaps between slats.  Because it is not a strong enough bond and because my son was easily able to get his hands under it on the inside crib slats and then pull the velcro apart he slipped because the rail cover that he was holding onto for support gave way and he smacked his head incredibly hard on the rail of the crib.  Shame on this company for making a piss poor product, Leachco you have lost my trust as a consumer and you could have seriously injured my child.	
1. 	Durable and easy to clean, this is just what i was looking for. If your babe is a climber, be careful because it doesnt' secure to the chair	
- 1	I bought this & the greenish circle rattle by Sassy as well.  I thought it was a good toy until I noticed mold growing inside of the clear ball!  I yanked it out of my baby's hand - who was biting it.  I did handwash it from time to time (not in the dishwasher) since it's plastic.  I wish Sassy's quality control is better.  I would've exchanged for another, but I also noticed that my little one sometimes would hit her own head with the ball by accident when she waves her hands around while holding the toy.  So I returned it.	
- 1	No way to turn then on/off therefore they all come &#34;activated.&#34; The package  was opened when i got mine so they all just fell out. I think they lost  potency by the time i got them as there wasn't much going on.	
- 1	Fiddly, way overpriced for what is just a piece of material. Try wrapping this long piece of cloth around yourself, and then getting an impatient baby into it... and you have to tie it really tight for it to give sufficient support to the head, with the result that its too tight around their little legs. Or - like the lady in the photo - you have to keep holding their head, which sort of defeats the purpose.It also can make them way too warm. Maybe that is OK for European winters, but not otherwise.I am getting rid of mine (and I see that lots of people are doing likewise) and now using a rucksack-style carrier - MUCH less hassle.	
1. 	This is the best &#34;teether&#34;gets in the tough areas and he doesn't realize he is brushing his teeth.I have a million teethers and toothbrushes. This is the ONE to buy	
1. 	We got this as a hand me down and even though it's a few years old, it works great! I love that it's portable and uses batteries so I don't have to keep it near an outlet. It glides smoothly and the seat can be rotated to change directions of the glide. Our little on loved it for his first 4-5 months of life and slept well in it for naps. I don't recommend it for sleeping through the night just because baby doesn't sleep flat on his back in this glider.If you're looking for more baby gear reviews visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com It has down to earth reviews from a perfectionist mom who does a ton of research on baby products.

- 1	I don't recommend because I used this to mash apples and the apples came out squished and intact with very little juice extracted.	
- 1	This mobile sounds great in theory, but doesn't work in reality.1) Music only plays for 3 minutes, tops, no matter how hard you crank it.2) Mobile looks good in terms of contrast colors, right? Okay, but think of what the baby sees, not what you are seeing in the ad. The baby is seeing the BOTTOMS of these pyramidal shapes....aka, flat white spaces you fill with the graphic cards. So unless you place your baby at quite an angle from the mobile (and why would you do that? because the baby would not be able to see the graphic cards unless s/he is directly underneath them....) s/he will never see all the red, black and white colors and graphics that we see in the picture!!! I guess I am no genius, because I did not realize that until I actually constructed the mobile.... Frankly, the tops could be stark white...the way these dangle, the baby just does not really see the top half of the mobile elements.3) Shipping is really high for this. And they left something out of my order. They apologized and resent it, but I expect better for nine dollars ground shipping.In retrospect, I would have bought a fisher price jungle one with better musicFisher Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobile, because I have the fisher price melodies jungle theme gym, and the baby likes that, OR I would have bought the cheaper infant stim mobile with just the cards hanging from the strings.Infant Stim-MobileThere is one available that ships directly from Amazon and is eligible for free shipping.	
1. 	This changing pad cover is ridiculously soft!  I had read that it was wonderful to the touch, but couldn't believe how wonderful it felt. I'm sure our twin daughters will love it.  When my 8 year old was a baby, I'd used a terry cloth cover (can't recall the brand) and it actually seemed very scratchy and uncomfortable, so this one seems much nicer to me.  It also fit perfect with our contoured changing pad (we also chose a Summer Infant changing pad, which works great and seems nice and firm and supportive).  The wash and care for this cover is pretty basic, and the material seems durable.  I'm not sure how clean the white will remain, but my 8 year old's cover was also white and it stayed white the entire time we used it, so I'm hoping that won't be an issue.  However, the price was so nice, that even if we have to replace it down the line, I won't feel too bad.	
1. 	The Miracle Blanket always comes highly recommended and did not disappoint in terms of quality and ease of use.  However, keep in mind that every baby is different, so results can't be guaranteed.  Our baby never really enjoyed swaddling, so she would often wake herself with the startle reflex and need to be soothed back to sleep.  We hoped that because the Miracle Blanket is designed for snug swaddling, that it would serve as a much faster and effective alternative to using a traditional swaddling blanket - and that baby would fall back asleep quicker.  Unfortunately, this was not the case for us, but we're saving it to try with future babies.	
- 1	If it wasn't for the fact this stroller has nice padding for the child and the handles, a nice cargo basket and a cup holder, this would be getting 0 stars.  I purchased this stroller for obvious functional reasons but a main selling factor for me was the color.  I hate the strollers that are all one color but this one is not mint.  Don't be fooled.  It's more like nasty seaweed green.  The color up top is not a pinkish peachy tone, it's a dreary tan.  The brown is dark chocolate brown.  In other words, it's ugly to say the least and I checked the color on multiple monitors just on the chance my monitor was off and they all looked the same.  To make matters worse when you put the seat section down so your child can drop their legs down, it doesn't even go back far enough to allow the child to put their feet on the cross belt which is the whole purpose of the cross belt.  The seat itself has no support.  Basically it would be no different than your child sitting on a hammock.  Sure there's bars a couple inches down lower but like I said, sagging under the tush is bound to occur.  I don't want to know how much stitching will pull away when the child weighs more and puts more pressure on the seat.  And yes the strap for the crotch is super short.  This will never work for an older or bigger child.	
1. 	I was skeptical to purchase this product because I didn't know if it would stick to our granite hearth however it works GREAT! My little guy can't pull it off and it blends in well and looks neat.  Definitely glad I took a chance!	
- 1	I ordered this sippy cup for my daughter because it was BPA free.  It now sits in our cupboard, not used because I could never get the plastic taste out of it.I would also caution parents with babies who are just starting to use sippy cups that this is not a great one to start with.  While it may be effective in preventing spills, it also is hard for newbies to get fluids out because they have to suck so hard and they are not used to doing that.	
1. 	I received the changing pad in mail yesterday. I bought it based on the positive reviews. I only give it a 4 out of 5 b/c I have not used the pad yet. It looks like it will be a good changing pad but I will just have to wait and see.	
1. 	We bought several swaddles through the 5 months my daughter was swaddled and loved the swaddleme the best, but even the large was too small for her when she hit around 4- 4 1/2 months.  But the small and the large were perfect when they fit DD.  I love the swaddle so much though.  it stayed tight, washed well and was super cute and stylish.  It was nice because you could just put it over the babies clothing.  And our friends were shocked how fast DD fell asleep when we wrapped her up.  She really never got out of this until she got older.  Its a must have for a baby that won't stop moving their hands!!	
- 1	Loved this originally.  Very light and easy to fold.  It didn't seem like a very sturdy construction and sure enough, it stopped folding after 2 month's of use.  It feels like it's stuck on something, and after many attempts we never located the cause.  Returned it.	
1. 	We love this chair (we also had the infant package)We received it as a gift and have used it since our daughter was 5 months old...she will be 2 in 2 weeks...it is the perfect size for her, and our room.  She now has full access to the chair, and can get on and off herself for mealtime.  It was very easy to put together, and has a multitude of adjustments in the seat and footrest to grow with baby, it is very durable...seemingly knick proof, easy to clean...there are a few nooks and crannies which get a little crumb traffic, but easy to get with a vacuum hose.  The cusions also wash and wear beautifully.  In conclusion, we highly reccomend this chair, the only drawback is the hefty pricetag, but a chair to last through childhood.	
- 1	Okay, this product stinks.  The concept is great, but the product isn't.  The spinning thing is quite hard and not comfortable to lay on for long periods.  My 4-month old is much happier laying in the same position on something that's much softer, like a boppy pillow (which we don't have, but he likes the one at his daycare).  We have 3 tummy time mats, and this one is by far the worst quality.  It constantly bunches up and is pilling even though it's barely been used.  The bunching up issue is even worse since the mat/spinner set are designed so a baby would really be grabbing onto the mat while spinning - so you'd think the mat would be a little sturdier to grab onto, but the way it is, it's really hard for the baby to grab and spin.	
- 1	We found these Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets to be very pretty, too small in size, and of not of such good quality compared to other receiving blankets that we purchased.	
- 1	We got it and it was so cheap.  I ended up just throwing it away.  Don't bother.  Waste of money	
- 1	I'm pretty annoyed because I didn't realize it wasn't working right until now and I've had it a couple years. Thankfully, my family hasn't had any high fevers, so it really hasn't been needed. I most recently tried using it to chart my bbt, since it reads in .1 increments. I can't even get it to give the same reading twice. It's ridiculous. Do not buy, unless you like throwing your money away.	
- 1	the vibration is really strong and I worried about overfiling my baby's nails.  I also purchased this for my sister in law who agreed that the vibrations were too strong. The file is metal, as well, so I don't see how metal can be gentle on the baby's nails.  I would not recommend.	
1. 	I brought this tub for my newborn. Great bath tub for babies because it provides the back support for babies. However as your baby get older, you may have to switch out of the bath tub since it doesn't provide much sitting space for older baby. Great bath tub still.	
- 1	This swing has some nice features. The music, the different swing positions, and the mobile. Unfortunately the swing is very loud sometimes. It sounds like it is working really hard. It wakes up my baby when it gets very loud. My husband is going to see if he can use a silicone lubricant to make it quieter.	
1. 	used this for my son once it got cold, kept him warm and swaddled all night. love it. much better than tying up blankets	
- 1	Did not lull baby to sleep, even though he sleeps well in the car.  In fact, I think it makes him seasick because he threw up.  Wish I'd kept the box and receipt, I'd return it.	
1. 	Highly recommend these nipple shields for protection of your nipple but also for babies that are between the breast and bottle feeding.  It's clears the nipple confusion instantly.	
1. 	I had orignally registered for the 4 in 1 bath station.  Then I read the reviews of injurys cause by them.  Plus, my own cousin said it hurt her daughter as well....Then I read the reviews and switched to this tub.  My son and I love it.  The hammock makes it so easy to wash my 2 month old.  His body is supported so I rest his head on my arm.  I don't have to hold him up until I have to wash his back area.  He has fun kicking and pushing off of the front of the tub.It fits nicely in the kitchen sink as well.Love it!	
- 1	This pump never had enough suction. I could barely get any milk with it. I ended up just using a manual pump and giving this one away to a friend.	
1. 	I love this bath. It was awesome for when my son's umbilical cord hadn't fell off. It has grown with him every step of the way. The bath toys and extras are great to.	
- 1	Usually I cloth diaper only when we are home, or visiting family. I use disposables for running to the store, or play dates. Although the description said that the small holds one to two diapers I disagree.  Honestly I wish I would have ordered the medium, because I love Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bags otherwise. The hanging one rocks, but this small bag is too small, it is off by the listed measurements. It measures an inch less both ways. My son is a toddler and it only holds one diaper which I need to ball up and squeeze inside. I do own the large which can hold about a day and a half worth of diapers. I use Happy Heiny's, Tots Bots, and Flip.	
- 1	The real thing doesn't look as good as the picture. The fabric is flimsy. Should have bought the Halo wearable blanket.	
1. 	My baby is 11 lb plus at 3 weeks and 24 inches long. He likes to sleep with his legs bent or he just sticks them over the end. I think we will get another month out of it.He loves this bed and I love that I can sleep so close to him. Its safe and great for both of us. Its tight in a bed with my husband but we do it anyway :)I understand all of the negatives that other people wrote, but what do you expect for $40!? Well worth the price to our family!	
- 1	I'm sure you have already read the most liked review about this snack cup, where someone states that gelato cups fit this munchie mug top.  That should give you an inclination how huge it is.  Its like 2 munchkin snack cups stacked = 1 munchie mug.  What little kid wants to carry around something as big as his head for snack?I bought this because everyone commented how a toddler can no longer remove a fist full of snacks.  I may have the most clever toddler then, because she's figured out how to get a fistful and spill it same way as with the Munchkin cups.  Maybe instead of 20 snacks flying, I'll have 15, but none the less, a mess anyway.  Also, the clear part of the cup is rather flimsy and easily breakable.  After being dropped twice onto hardwood floors, I see the cup has a slight crack.  The most expensive snack cup I've had, and it lasted a mere 2 days?  Unacceptable.  If I didn't anxiously throw away the packaging, this would definitely be going back.Simply put, not worth the investment.	
- 1	I purchased a similar crib sheet at a local store a while back and decided to get another sheet (from who I thought was made by the same company), but this one is not the same quality. The seams don't line up with the mattress so it doesn't fit properly and several seams actually lay several inches over onto the mattress itself, making it look very awkward. It's soft, but very thin. I don't expect it to last long and have only been using it as a back-up sheet when the others are in the wash.	
1. 	We picked this because it was lightweight and it is easy to change the sheets.  We really like it and it fits tightly in the crib.	
- 1	ok these is nice looking but all the cirles come out and its just a pain to clean, and move around, all the cirlces fall out when you move it maybe when my son is older he will enjoy this puzzle mat but for now i do not like it and prefer the abc 123 ones that i found at toys are us lol	
- 1	I purchased this for a dream on me port a crib. I figured being from the same manufacturer it would be a good fit, but unfortunately no. There is way too much of a gap for me to feel comfortable having my not quite 3 month old sleeping on it. It is too much of a hassle to send it back, so I will just hold on to it to use in a pack n play when he gets older and sids is not as much of a risk. In the mean time I ordered the SUNSHINE 3 ULTRA FIRM MINI CRIB MATTRESS which is 39 x 25 x 5 inches  vs. this mattress which is 38 x 24 x 3 inches in the hopes that it be a tighter fit and not as soft. I know it is not recommended that you use a mattress thicker than 3 in a porta crib, but common sense will tell you that the reason for this is that it would be easier for them to climb out once they are able to pull themselves up and walk, but obviously once they are able to do that the risk of sids/suffocation will not be an issue and a thinner, softer mattress would be acceptable.	
- 1	Strangely, out of all the 4 boxes I purchased, only the unicorn one reals chemical smell out of box.  Peacock, gorilla and kangaroo are okay.	
1. 	I was told that carseats stretch out your leather if you don't place anything between them so we decided to try this saver and boy does it save. I have just small pressure points in the very back that you can see when you remove the carseat but they have gone away within a couple days. The bottom of this is a harder plastic the the others I have seen in stores which I think is what helps this. No complaints here and I would defiantly recommend to anyone. In fact I'm ordering one now for my mom's car as the little bit extra cost makes it well worth not having stretched out leather.	
- 1	I got these for my baby's cloth diapers, however they don't absorb all of my baby's urine, I made some out of cotton batting and it works better than these expensive, practically useless things.	
- 1	Waited for this color for about 2 months, finally came but..... The peacock color is not as pictured. Color is more of plain blue with a darker hue to it... quite far from the image shown for advertisement, so sad, I thought it would be pretty. Returning it for kiwi. Here's to hoping kiwi color is same as pictured!	
1. 	My daughter started noticing it around 1 week of age and has loved it ever since!  (She's 8 weeks now.)  It's like her own little friend that she can't wait to see during diaper changes.  She doesn't make a peep during a diaper change if I wind him up.  She waits and gets so excited as soon as I put her on the changing table.The song is not annoying at all.  It can be a little loud in the middle of the night and sometimes the initial first note can startle her, but it has never scared her.  She just loves him so much!It's very sturdy and stays in place even while winding with one hand.  Easy to put together.  Easy to move to a different place if you wanted to.Some reviews said it didn't play long enough for diaper changes, but I guess I'm a speedy diaper changer since it still plays for a while after I'm done.  Besides, it's so easy to reach up with one hand and wind it up again if need be (sometimes I'll do that just so she can watch him some more!).I even brought it with for a trip and it fit on to my Combi Play Yard just fine, not perfect, but it worked very well and I was still able to wind it up with just one hand and it didn't move too much.  I knew I had to bring him with!!!As soon as she can reach him (manufacturer says to take it away at this point since the wings could be a choking hazard if they came off), I am going to keep it on her play yard so she can still see her little friend without being able to reach him.  It will be a very sad day when we can't use her Flutterbug mobile anymore!  We will be heartbroken for our daughter!!!!!It's so cute, so colorful, very inexpensive, and my daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES it!!  I can't say enough wonderful things about it!If I could give it 10 stars, I would!!!!BUY IT, you (or at least your little sweetie pie) will LOVE it!!****** UPDATE July 2013 *******We used this awesome little guy for sure as long as our daughter was in diapers, which was 2 years, and I'm fairly certain we left him on the changing table for quite some time after that as well.  She would reach up every now and then and managed to grab his wings, but for the most part, she just enjoyed watching him, cooing/talking to him, and smiling/laughing with him.We put it back on the changing table for our newest daughter who has REALLY been enjoying watching him and listening - she's 9wks old.  She smiles at him, is attempting to laugh, kicks, and gets so excited.  She used to scream during diaper changes and now she's happy the entire time with this little friend right there.  It's been so sweet to see another child enjoy him so much.  For being almost 6 years old, this colorful guy has really held up well after a couple years of constant (and far from gentle) use and several more years of harsh storage.  I'm so sad to see that it's not really available anywhere anymore as it was my number 2 recommendation for new parents and I've given it as a gift to several friends!  (My number 1 recommendation for new parents is the AngelCare Monitor!)Find it somewhere, buy it, and you'll love it too!  My husband and I both have a soft spot for this mobile and I see us hanging on to him so our future grandchildren can enjoy him too.	
1. 	We've had great luck with this tub. Many of the negative reviews seen to focus on the hump in the middle, and it must depend on the relative size and muscle development of the child. Our son has fit just perfectly.  The only problem we had with the sling, was our son did seem suspended too high--but we just added more water, so that the tub was full to the brim.  He was then high enough up that his back didn't rest on the hump and he stayed warm in the water.It is a big tub, so we have used it in the bathtub ever since his second bath on the kitchen counter when he peed on our toaster oven.  Which is sort of irrelevant to the tub, but highlights the dangers (an hilarity) of a bath in the kitchen.Once he got bigger, he fit just fine in both sides of the tub. Sadly, at 10 months he had gotten too big to wash easily and he can stand up, which is awkard with the shape of the tub. The first time we bathed him without the tub he CRIED!  But I bribed him with his favorite toy and now all is well.	
1. 	We love the Svan chair (see my review posted under its listing), and we love this cushion! I got the Sage color and it really looks much better in person (fortunately). It fits the chair very snugly, feels soft and nice, and looks classy. Plus, I've found it very easy to clean. So far, I've just wiped it down, but it's machine washable in case we ever have a messy incident. But the most important reviewer is my 7-month-old -- he loves it and smiles every time we strap him in. If you get the chair, spring for the cushion. You won't regret it.	
1. 	i use this cuz my baby is too short but already active and wants to bounce/etc. so i use this under his feet. later it can be used for potty training, and it is also a step stool in the kitchen area for the shelves that a just a little too high for me. love this, use it all the time for everything. does slide on my bamboo hardwood floors tho, the antislip doesnt work perfectly with smaller weights like a baby.	
1. 	easy to put together. moves easily and is entertaining. its a great value. my baby was 7mo when we got it she was 28in we've had it almost 2mo now.	
- 1	It does not rotate freely and its a pain putting it together and taking it apart. Does not store away easily. Ended up putting all the sticks & pieces into ziploc bags.	
- 1	I couldn't figure out how to get my baby in this comfortably. She never stayed happy in it. And I kept trying, but maybe I was missing something? I did like how comfortable it was for me and my shoulders, but I just didn't think she would ever get used to it or like it.	
- 1	This baby tub folds in half, which it then does not take up much space. it has to snap open, easy to do.Then unfold the legs down..Easy..Then you have to blow up the plastic liner underneath. There are two plastic holes to blow up on each side.It was like blowing up a beach ball,which is easy,  but this is much harder..Not only harder to blow, which I could not do, but if you can blow this up, you then have to putthe rubber stoppers to close it FAST or any air that you could blow in it, will leak out fast.This also has a plastic smell to it, which I think after awhile will dissipate, I hope!I could not for the life of me get any air into this thing.Maybe I did something wrong!The plastic liner is thin, and I think it could leak after a while.Before putting a baby On the plastic liner, you have to put down a baby towel so it is soft for the baby to lay on to.So far I should have given this a 1 star. But it looks cute  and the colors are nice!I have not given my Hubby a chance to blow this up yet.If he can figure this out with success, I'll be back with a new review.	
1. 	We have two of these - one for upstairs, and one for downstairs. It's great for our 2.5 year old boy who is learning to use the potty, and easy for us as parents to try to get him to use it.Pros:- There's a barrier/guard in the front so he doesn't pee everywhere. It's a huge improvement over other potties - sometimes boys just don't get that they need to hold it down.- The potty part removes easily for cleanup and pouring out.- It has a back so he doesn't fall off of it when trying to sit down. Sometimes sitting is a bit iffy at his age.- It's nonslip on the bottom, so it doesn't push around when he goes to sit.Cons:- A &#34;pour spout&#34; or something would be great along the back side.	
- 1	I received these locks as a gift, and thought looked like they would be great. I installed them into an outlet and the cover would not lock. Once my 8 month figured out what I was doing, he came to investigate. It took him all of 10 seconds to figure out on how to pull the cover out of the outlet. Won't be using these at all.	
1. 	I used this to wash my baby in the sink until she was about three months old and no longer fit. I still use it occasionally to lay her on the bathroom floor when she won't let me get ready in peace :) It does get moldy so needs to be washed and it has started to pill but it served it's purpose.	
1. 	My boy really likes the toothpaste. I think it's because there is a fruity sweet taste that tastes like banana. However, the toothbrush damages easily. As kids, they tend to bite the toothbrush.For toothbrush, I will recommend the following. It's much strongerhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KJBK3E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B003KJBK3E&linkCode;=as2&tag;=travguid0ca-20	
- 1	The bristles of this brush are very stiff, and are not the best option for gums that may be sore from teething.  Oral B offers stages brushes for various stages of childhood, including a brush for infants/young toddlers, that has much much softer bristles.  I do like the handle on this Gerber brush, it is easy for a young toddler to hold; however a young toddler isn't doing much brushing, the parent is doing the brushing any way.  I do like the toothpaste that comes with this set and have continued to use it.  My recommendation would be to buy the tooth paste separately and use a different tooth brush.	
- 1	The guard to prevent choking is useless if, say, your child decides to put the hard end in her mouth. They should have designed this with the soft parts at both ends. Also, the end harbors bacteria.	
- 1	These really dont do anything special. I cant find a use for them. The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money. Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products. There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price	
1. 	We were using a diaper pail for my son's diapers, but we had to put it in the bathroom because the smell was really bad! Now, we put all poppy diapers in these bags and into the trash bin they go into the garage. No more stink! Much cheaper than the muchkin ones I was buying at the store!	
- 1	Way too big for a baby just starting to use a cup or a toddler. Disappointed because exactly what I was l	
1. 	These are abit thicker than the medela ones they gave me in the hospital but me and my baby seemed to like them better. Great for latching problems!!	
1. 	I tried this one and the Thirsties, and I love both of them. I prefer the velcro/aplix on this one, though, than the Thirsties because it seems like it can withstand more use, but only time will tell. I use this cover with unpinned pre-folds and it works really well and has never leaked.	
- 1	These wipes do not contain enough moisture to really do the job, and I cannot stand the way that they smell.  I try to use products without a lot of chemicals on my baby, but there are a lot of better options out there than these wipes.  I definitely won't purchase again.	
1. 	This is such a cute playmat. My little guy likes it. It provides music, lights, and toys......plenty of activity to keep him busy for a little while!	
1. 	Great product, planning to get more for family members to use when we are at their home. It is very secure and attaches very easily. Get this product rather than a high chair, have both, and this is far better.	
1. 	THEY ARE I WAS I SPECTED, GOOD QUALITY, GOOD PRESENTATION, PERFEECT PRICE, GOOD FOR CHILD AND GOOD FOR BABIES FROM 9 MONTHS	
1. 	This has been worthwhile.  It was cheaper and more adjustable than some units we looked at.  My only real complaint is that if you were using these for a larger dog, the dog might end up tearing out the see-through plastic in the middle, which is quite flexible and easy to pull out / destroy.  That said, it works for kids (bottom of stairs only) and it even travels in the back of the car sometimes when we go on trips.	
1. 	These were great at getting our baby to calm down and sleep. Babies often has muscle spasms that wake them up. This keeps them under control and makes me feel warm and comforted.	
1. 	First of all, when I read the ingredients on the package I went yuck. But the more I looked at them, I realized that it wasn't actually bad at all - it was actually excellent! The main tooth decay ingredient is Xylitol. Check out the wiki page on this to get a better feel for how good this sugar alcohol is. It has all kinds of studies indicating that it can help tooth decay significantly and has no known toxicity issues. The sugar alcohol is derived from trees and seems very safe.This is important. My kids are not old enough to realize that they can't swallow the toothpaste and I still need to keep their teeth clean ...As a side note, they use Xylitol in chewing gum. In fact it is in many of the more expensive chewing gum brands that promote healthy teeth.This is the only beginner toothpaste we use in our house. Check out the wiki page on Xylitol  and I can say pretty confidently that you will use this as your only toothpaste with kids that may swallow their toothpaste.Other than the Xylitol, the rest of the ingredients are pretty innocuous and are claimed to be all natural. So there you are.Thanks!!	
- 1	For all intents and purposes, this bag does its job. It's just too big for my needs at home. I do diaper laundry every other day and this bag is kind of a pain to wash. I use it as a hanging bag and it's OK - but again, not my favorite. I like Kanga Care's other wet bags, the round ones with the zippers.	
1. 	The nipple is one that got rave reviews.  It is not difficult for a baby to drink from the nipple which is a good and reasonable size.I like the way the bottles come in sections which make clean up jobs easier.  You don't have residual feedings left in these bottles for that very reason.The angled shape make it easy for whoever is holding the bottle.  The weight is more or less evenly distributed and leakage, if any is minimal.  This also results in less gas and burping and a cleaner feeding time all around.	
- 1	When they say &#34;small&#34; it is truly small. I chose small because they suggest you select your size, but in the end the baby's size &#34;prevailed.&#34; Couldn't fit her in, it was very uncomfortable.	
1. 	this pillow rocks, it does take up some space, but if you get more sleep who cares i do recommend using an old pillow case and cut hole in it so you dont have to remove cover to wash its a pain to get back on and i ripped mine, but  still its like a dream and was hard to give up lol	
1. 	I have 5 of these all over my house and have used them for over a year. They are incredibly easy to install. Only 2 screws are needed. The white color blends into the door trim and is minimally noticeable. They also couldn't be easier to use.Note: The included screws are horrible because they are soft and strip very easily. You will want to drill a pilot hole so less pressure is put on the screwhead. If the screw starts stripping, remove it immediately so it doesn't become a permanent fixture of your door frame. Use a drywall or wood screw instead - available at any big box home store.	
- 1	These bottles are truly nothing special. I can't believe how insanely expensive they are! They didn't decrease the amount of air my daughter swallowed, and you can visibly see the bubbles entering the milk. Isn't that the whole point of these? To reduce air intake? They're definitely not the first bottles I reach for, but I will use them in a pinch. Overall, I would not recommend.	
1. 	I tried the orginal VentAires to help my baby with gas, but he didn't seem to like those nipples at all, so when I found these I bought them right away.  He loves these and does so much better with the nipples.  He also gets less gas.  I find them easier to put together and clean then the regular VentAires also.	
- 1	Love the colors and design.  Easy for my baby to use but it leaks so badly that I threw them out.  Save yourself the hassle of buying this bottle  and just pour the liquid directly on the baby, carseat, or floor.	
1. 	This is actually pretty good! I use it for warming breastmilk & formula. It took a few tries to get it perfect temperature, but I have never had too-hot milk, so my baby didn't get hurt. There were a few times where the milk wasn't too warm - but didn't take long. My measuring cup's markings did rub off after 2 months, and I contacted Munchkin and they sent me a new one for free.	
- 1	My wife and I picked up a couple OXO Tot On-the-Go Feeding spoons for our son. It features a silicon sheath over the spoon head, to keep things soft for your little one's tender gums, a plastic spoon handle, and a little case for when you're on the go, but we end using this spoon more at home than anywhere else.Our son is a little demanding when it comes to food. He grabs at his spoon, sometimes by the head, when it's still full of mush, and it ends up making a big smeary mess in his clothes and even his hair. The way the handle tapers in the middle in makes it harder to slip the spoon out of his little fist when he has a good grip. As parents, we have no problem letting out kid try to feed himself, as it's supposed to help children develop their hand-eye coordination. But ultimately, we want him to eat.One of the tactics that seems to work for now is using two spoons, so when he does get grab-happy with one spoon, we can still feed him with the other spoon and he doesn't really notice. But is it really worth it to spend sixteen bucks on two spoons? There are plenty of other feeding spoons on the market that'll get you more bang for your buck. While they might not have the same brand cache as OXO, there's no reason why they won't be able to get the job done.	
- 1	My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray.  He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly.  I'll be returning it today.	
1. 	I love this blanket. ALthough I could never actually swaddle my son (he hated it), we use thsi all the time for his regular blanket. I use the green for the car, cover him in his carseat. Its light enough that I can double fold it and it fits nicely around him. We use the other on the floor when we have him on the carpet. They fold up nicely.I have washed both of the blankets hundreds of times and they have not faded. They are super soft and are my favorite blankets!	
- 1	my tub floor has a texture.  The mat did not stick.  I loved the little kneeler and it was a great price for both items, but I had to return due to it not working out for me.	
1. 	this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not. It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat. The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling. we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.	
- 1	I must not have paid attention when I ordered these because I thought they were crib bumpers that go around the crib.  These zip around the slat of the crib so you need like 20-30 of them depending on how many slats your crib has.  I returned these because 2 doesn't do much, and to buy how many I would need would cost way too much!	
1. 	While the hospital offered to take footprints of our baby, we were so exhausted of being there that we refused so that we could leave more quickly. Though I didn't regret this decision, I did regret that we didn't have any footprints of our little newborn. So I purchased this product as a way of remedying that. We found it really easy to use, you just put babies feet on the little ink pads and press the feet onto the included thick pieces of cardboard-ish paper. Though you have to be careful that you don't screw things up, since you only get to ink pads and there are 2 feet, we found it pretty easy to do, even with a somewhat squirmy baby. We got four really great prints of both feet and are so happy to have this keepsake.I then scanned in all four sets of prints and now have them digitally to send to grandparents and others. I also plan on making some little photo frames for Christmas for relatives who would appreciate that, and having these digitized will make it easy to do that for everyone. Overall, a great product, easy-to-use, and well worth the price.	
1. 	For one year to start a good dental hygiene, he loves having his gum massaged, it also gives a refreshing taste.	
- 1	I am a grandmother who has raised several children so I know babies. I have a 9 week old infant living with me and bought this chair for her. I wish I had bought something else. I find that when the rocker is in the infant position our baby slumps from side to side due to the width of the chair. Also in the infant position her feet are held much higher than her head. This occurs because of the incline of the seat when it is in the infant position. Therefore we can't use this seat after feeding her. Secondly, the padding under the head area has several hard lumps in the padding and it is not thick padding being very slight and skimpy. Last but not least, when we use the vibrate feature, the battery makes a horrible racket banging against the plastic battery holder and seat frame. It is so loud that we can't use it.On the positive side, our baby is attracted to the bright toys and tries to reach them.  I also like the way the toy bar moves out of the way. This purchase arrived much earlier than Amazon promised and we appreciated that. We decided to save the chair until she is older because it is too much trouble to return it and hope that when she is bigger it will be a better chair for our child.	
- 1	I was told that I needed this to strip diapers. So I bought it and had it shipped to my house. I used it to strip the diapers however it didnt work. The diapers came out of the wash the same way they went in. I wont waste my money on this product again. But I guess you live and learn	
- 1	Nowhere on the actual label attached to the toy does it say organic cotton.  What it does say is, Content consisting of PLA-polylactide fibers and Made in China.  Make your own conclusions as to whether or not you should trust this company.	
1. 	I bought this for my husband but after trying several different diaper bags I took it over.  It was especially great while traveling.  At some point functionality takes over style.  This has easy to wear with the baby and carry everything else.  It has easy access pockets so you can get to what you need quickly.  Really, other than the look (for girly moms) it has everything a diaper bag should.	
1. 	I purchased these for my baby girl I have used the other AVENT nipples for younger babies with no issues. Great product, no issues.	
- 1	A lot of the pins were broken had to go to store to buy more pins cause so many of them were broken into halfs	
1. 	This comes in its own carry case, is light and fits in a diaper bag.  I used it for my daughter and then gave it to my sister to use which her boys.  They haven't used it yet but it's fantastic for taking out and about, because after all you should be able to potty train on the go.  You're out shopping and your kid has to go, you don't have the potty chair with you so what do you do?  You whip out this bad boy and show the other moms what you're made of.  I love being prepared.	
- 1	It wasn't worth the money.  The sensor was not very strong, we basically had to hit the side of the crib to make it start.	
- 1	This is nothing more than a straw you stick in your baby's rectum.  It looks more complicated, but it isn't.  I can't believe I bought this.  I have a comically gassy baby.  She passes gas like a 250 lb drunken man. She often farts herself awake.  Tummy massaging, gas drops, gripe water... None of it works - AND NEITHER DOES A BABY BUTT STRAW!!!!	
1. 	This kept our baby nice and warm when the weather was cold and windy. Easy to use, and easy to attach onto the stroller. But we are using a Quinny Buzz and this is not a perfect fit since it is not of the same brand. It still attaches ok, but just not perfect. I really like the colour and the top is easy to take off when you get indoors. Definitely recommend for the colder season.	
1. 	So far these are the best I have found. Though they do have one downfall. After weeks or so of abuse from 4 boys ranging  from 1-5 they eventually start to leak. I do wash them in the dishwasher and my kids are in no way easy on them. But they leak proof for a while which is the best yet. We have tried over 10 different brands and so far these are passing. I would give them a 5 star rating except that I cannot find anywhere to buy just lids!!! The cups are insulated and so cute. We have all of the different themes... boy related anyways... no princess stuff here!	
- 1	First of all, you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident (as the police officer who installed my car seat told me.)Second of all, When you buy this mirror it comes with a protective piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror, but when you remove it, you see that the mirror is very foggy. I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth, thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic, but it made it worse. Now the mirror is foggy, scratchy, and totally unuseable.It's going back to the store today.	
1. 	I loved this tracker so much, I bought several more and used for the entire first year. It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.	
- 1	I bought this diaper from Amazon on the recommendation of a friend and cloth-diapering guru- but I had no idea they were polyester! It says that nowhere on this Amazon page and I finally went to the Thirsties website. The entire lining and all the microfleece (the part that touches your baby's skin) is 100% polyester! If you are ok with that, then it's fine. However, I don't like the idea of synthetics to hold in all that moisture right next to my baby's skin. No thanks. I use cotton flat diapers normally with a wool or cloth cover and while they are messy, they don't normally leak. I was excited about trying this fitted diaper, but now that I know how they work, I will stick to REAL fabrics. I guess this diaper will make a nice gift for someone who doesn't mind polyester. They may work well in holding in liquid, but gee, that's what polyester DOES. I can't in good faith rate this well when it uses cotton only for the outside.	
1. 	After reading everyone else's reviews, I was nervous to try this product.  Once I received it (I got 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs), I read the very short and easy directions, and voila!  Perfect warmth on first use.  Whoever who states its too hot or too cold and complains about it clearly has not read the directions and did not try again because it tells you what to do if its not the temp you want.  To use this simple tool, you need to know if you have an old school bottle or the newer wide mouth bottle and how many ounces your bottle can hold (not how many ounces you're using) and whether you're starting from refrigerated or room temp.  These factors will tell you how much water to pour in the heater using a measuring vial that it comes with.  Press the button down (not in, I thought my warmers were broken) and you'll hear a click or see the light go off when it's done (in about a minute or so...amount of time for a diaper change).  If you leave it in there after its done it will keep heating and get too hot, just like when you're cooking on the stove and turn off the burner and your food keeps cooking.  Keep a rag/towel handy to wipe off the moisture around the bottle when its done.The reason why I give it only 4 stars is because the measuring vial is a pain in the a$$ to fill each time and you have to be exact with the amount of filling water to make your bottle the right temp, but the filling lines are so close together.  I'm planning on using a syringe so that I can have a fail safe, thoughtless, easy way to get the right amount of water in the heater.  Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars.	
- 1	I wanted to love this product since it was easy to install and did not radically change the look of our coffee table. (Dark wood, dark foam corners)Unfortunately, my 1 year old  daughter is curious and she notices EVERYTHING. Needless to say she noticed the new foam corners in her toddling travels and made a B-line for them.  Between trying to eat them and pick them off of each corner, they lasted about a week before the adhesive became weak from repeated removal. It had become a game for my daughter to make a grab at them any time she was near the coffee table.I spent more time trying to stop her from removing the Toddler Korner Kushions than enjoying the piece of mind that she wouldn't crack her head open falling into the corner of our coffee table.In the end we replaced the Korner Kushions with one of those padded elastic covers that wraps around the whole table. Ugly, but more effective the the Toddler Korner Kushions.	
1. 	I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol. But they are not too bad, so no complaints.	
1. 	I got this smock for my two year old who likes to play with water in the kitchen sink. I was sick of changing her clothes after sink time and so I bought this smock. It goes on easily over her clothes and has worked to protect her from getting wet. She is picky about clothes but she likes the pocket and she seems to like the bright colors. It has worked for us.	
1. 	We love this gate for our house.  Our daycare provider recommended it to us and we've been very please with it.  It works well mounted or unmounted and it's so nice that it swings on it's hinge when mounted.  We also like that it doesn't have bars for our son to use to pull up on.	
- 1	I was so excited about this cup in principle- no chemicals, easy grip, cute. Within minutes it had become an epic disaster. First of all, the plastic looks and feels cheap. It's not flexible, but it's not as hard as the standard playtex sippy cups... it was just hard enough to be unpleasant and difficult to use. It was a little too wide for a small hand to comfortably grip, so my daughter dropped it repeatedly, thus defeating the purpose for the harder to clean shape. The top was almost impossible to get off, and unless you took a long time to carefully set it down and then took care not to breathe on it, it wouldn't stand up on its own. But the true fatal error of this cup is that it leaks abominably. I'm not talking about a couple little drops, either: it was practically pouring out. Now if this had been a one dollar sippy purchased at Walmart, I would think I'd gotten what I'd paid for, but for the asking price, I just about expect it to sing to me. No good, Boon. No good.	
1. 	I dont really have a lot of space so putting this on a chair made it easy to move from room to room. I would highly recommend.	
- 1	I ordered this item and returned it. I couldn't figure out why my 18 month old wouldn't drink from this...until I tried to drink from it myself and realized that it's VERY difficult to get anything through the straw. I would recommend the Munchkin straw cups instead. Much easier.	
1. 	Our son enjoys being in this jumper because he loves to bounce.  I like it because he's very mobile and it keeps him out from under foot while I'm working in the kitchen, etc.  I just move it to where I need to be.  I've read several reviews that were unhappy with the height adjustmant.  Once you figure out how to adjust the strap, it's a snap - you just can't do it while baby's in it.  Now that our son is bigger (10 mos.) the strap does slip as he jumps because he's more vigorous in his actions.  I adjust it before I put him in and when it's slipped to the point where he's too low I figure it's time to take him out.	
- 1	My son used this once and its already broken.  Doesn't work as well as other reviews.  Too bad.	
- 1	I thought these would be great but I bought three and all three bags had broken zippers, probably from frequent washing in hot water, within a year. I used paperclips as a zipper and eventually, the fabric started to tear so I had to sew it together. I got pail liners and like them much more!	
- 1	I bought these because they were less expensive than the ones I'd been using for 18 months (Bummis).  I use them because my child has diaper rash often and don't want our diapers to stain from the cream.  When I opened these I noticed that they were more of a mesh than a cloth-like liner and I'm not sure if they will keep the cream from touching the cloth diapers.  I guess I'll double-up on them for now because I've already bought them.	
- 1	We tested a bunch of different brands of cloth wipes, and these got the thumbs down for the following reason: the wipe is composed of two layers sewn together at the edges. When in use, the layers separate and smeared the poop. On the positive side, the edges are sewn together well and have not frayed or curled after lots and lots of washes. The winning wipe for us was Grovia cloth wipes.	
- 1	These are too hard for little ones to get hands in! The plastic is hard and not very flexible. My 16 month old could not get the snacks out to save his life. I tried it and I even found it difficult. Spend the extra money and get the munchie mug. It is the greatest thing since peanut butter!	
1. 	My daughter just loves these!  The colors are bright.  The Dora on the blue animal does not float upright, but my child doesn't really care.  They were great for the price.	
1. 	Received this set at my baby shower and we have used and abused these since then!They are very well made and durable and definitely can take a some baby abuse!Love how many pieces are included in the set with awesome bright colors.Would recommend  to everyone!	
- 1	Since you cannot train a 6 month old baby, my daughter tends to hold it by the round shape and tries to chew on the giraffe's leg and body. She gets frustrated because the only favorable chewing part is the ring shape. A baby cannot chew any other part. But since she tends to hold by the ring, she cannot chew the ring. Bad design	
1. 	My daughter is 10 weeks old and absolutely loves this mobile! I got it for her when she was 4 weeks old, and since then it has made diaper changes fun and easy. She stares, smiles, laughs, and kicks excitedly every time I lay her on the changing table, and I can spin and rotate it with my hand to provide her further entertainment. It clamped easily to her changing table, and it comes with more cards than you need so you can switch out the cards. Rather than switch them out, I used the extra cards and an embroidery hoop and ribbon to make her a second mobile for over the crib, so that was an unexpected bonus! She still gets the variety of all the shapes, and I don't have to fool with switching out the cards, which is admittedly annoying. I agree with some other reviewers that the cards hook together oddly and don't hang perfectly straight, but after the initial putting together, I haven't thought about it.  And you can use a little bit of clear tape to make them hang straighter if it bothers you. Doesn't bother my daughter! It grabs her attention like nothing else. She loves it so  much that it's definitely worth it!I also recommend the travel version, which easily clips to her pack and play. It is way more engaging to her than the little stuffed mobile toys that came with the pack and play, and whenever we take a trip, I take it off the pack and play and clip it to the car seat handle.	
- 1	I thought this would be a great idea but I tried using it and it squirted in my babies eyes because the dispenser got stuck.  She now plays with it but it didn't really serve its purpose.	
- 1	I bought this(2) months ago to keep at our house for my now 8-month old grandaughter.  It's terrible for a couple of reasons.~ Way too big for a teething infant to hold never mind put in their mouth - what were they thinking?~ Can't be put in dishwasher or soaked in the sink (just run it under water)Overall, a total waste of $5.00. I'd recommend seeing teething products in stores before randomly picking something out on line like I did.  There are definintely better products for the price out there that your baby will be able to handle and enjoy.	
- 1	Received this as a gift. My son is 3 months old and been teething for about a month. Because he's so young still he's not as coordinated with his hands yet. My son has large hands, but the toy is still too cumbersome. I don't recommend this teether to a child under 8 months.	
1. 	A friend made a changing tray for us that sits on the dresser and I wanted to be able to have wipes and diapers in reach without taking up dresser top. This was the perfect solution. Looks sturdy and I think it will really meet our needs! :)Here's a link to the changing tray:[...]	
1. 	$80.00, fine.  Knowing what I know now, I would've paid $200.00.  This is the second pair of hands you need.  It is very comfortable to use, even as your baby gets heavier.  It's got the option of facing your baby outward as well and my daughter loved to look around as she got older.  I washed it and it faded a bit but I still feel the Bjorn can do no wrong. An ansolute must and a fantastic gift idea (maybe get a few people to go in on it to help if finances are a problem).	
1. 	I just wish it was softer... My son keeps wanting to take it out and make a lot of mess!!	
- 1	My 2 month old was diagnosed with torticollis at 6 weeks. I saw this online I thought it would help keep her off the flat spot. In theory it's great, however my newborn can wriggle out of it immediately, even though it's appropriately sized. Plus, when we put it on her she screams bloody murder.  So I'm disappointed, but I've already scheduled the return.	
- 1	I can't really comment on the product itself as I never got to use it, but I do highly recommend not to buy from Dorel Juvenile Group.  After waiting for over two weeks for the delivery, I gave up and went to a nearby store and bought another walker.  It never occured to me that Dorel Juvenile Group may not accept returns (I did not see anything indicating this at the time of the purchase).  We had sort of a fight over email, and they finally agreed to accept the return, but guess what?  It's been three months now since I sent the item back to them, and they never returned the money.  When I contacted them, they claimed they never received it...	
- 1	We were very excited about a swing that would allow us to move the kiddo straight from the car or stroller (Graco Snugrider Stroller Frame) without taking him out of his Snugride 35.  However, we were sorely mistaken when we thought this swing would function as a, well, swing.  The motor isn't even REMOTELY powerful enough to keep the Snugride 35 moving.  Brand new batteries won't get it moving.  Even if you kick start the swing by giving it a push, it will NEVER continue to swing unless you put it on the highest setting (there is a turtle to rabbit scroll wheel that is pretty worthless).  Once below absolute bunny the swing slows to a stop in a matter of seconds.  Not only that, but the fast setting is pretty jerky... way too fast back-and-forth in my opinion.  The vibration setting works fine, and the nature sounds are OK.  Music is, as always, awful.  When will they let us load up our own MP3's into these things?!  Overall I'm disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone... even my baby enemies.	
1. 	I have used this with my son since bringing him home from the hospital. It has done wonders for his sleep.  I tried traditional swaddling blankets but he would often break out of them and wake himself up.  I highly recommend this swaddle to all expecting or new parents.	
1. 	I love this water resistant, easily folded travel blanket. There are many blankets like this on the market, but so far this is the only one I've found that has a good amount of weight to it. It doesn't bunch up every time someone moves an inch on it- it really stays in place! It's heavy enough to stay down in a good amount of wind too. It's SUPER easy to fold up, and to clean. We've had ours about a year now, and it really still looks brand new- even with plenty of use for beach trips and park trips. My only complaint is that it's a little small- two adults sitting up and a baby with a couple toys are about all it can fit comfortably. I'd love a super-sized version of this blanket!!!Warning: as you will see in other reviews, it does have a kind of strong plastic-ey odor right out of the bag. Don't worry, the smell goes away quickly. We washed ours once, and it was gone.	
- 1	I was really excited to receive the Britax Bassinet and find that it indeed clicks on to my B-Agile stroller. (I have posted a photo in the customer images section.) However, the internal base of the bassinet is made of particle board which off gasses a terrible smell that gave me a headache. I did some research and found that particle board can contain toxic chemicals such as Formaldehyde.Needless to say I'm packing this up and sending it back to Amazon. I'm sad because absent the particle board this product is very well made and I was looking forward to using it.	
- 1	First of all, you should not install this in your car as it can become a projectile in an accident (as the police officer who installed my car seat told me.)Second of all, When you buy this mirror it comes with a protective piece of plastic over the mirror that you have to remove to use the mirror, but when you remove it, you see that the mirror is very foggy. I tried cleaning the mirror with water and a soft cloth, thinking that it was just some adhesive from the plastic, but it made it worse. Now the mirror is foggy, scratchy, and totally unuseable.It's going back to the store today.	
- 1	The idea sounded intriguing so I figured I'd give it a try. To my suprise these cups gave me even more work. My son easily took the top off of it after I made sure it was on very secure and had a blast shaking his cup full of cheerios all over my entire car. So, I figured OK, let me try one more time just at the off chance I didn't have the top on perfectly. Nope, same thing. A complete waste. We threw ours in the garbage, no luck here on these.	
1. 	I don't know why they call this a mobile since it has no moving parts, no motion or sound, it just hangs there.  That being said, this is the best toy I've gotten for my 10-week-old son so far.  I don't know why he loves it so much, but now the changing table is his absolute favorite place to be.  He smiles, laughs, and flails his arms and legs in excitement any time we get near it, and would probably stare at it laughing and cooing for hours if I let him hang out on the changing table that long.  Its been a real godsend for distracting him from his hunger screeching at 6am while I'm trying to get his diaper changed first!	
1. 	It's a little smaller than I expected and I wouldn't fill it up with heavy toys then try to carry it around, but over all it's no worse or better than any similar type hamper/toy box, and I've owned 4 in the last 9 years from all different brands. My 9 and 7 year old boys have destroyed them all, along with 3 heavy plastic hampers and one expensive wicker one. This one I purchased for my 5 month old son's toys, and it is by far the cutest one I've had.I guess what I'm saying is, it's not going to last forever, and it won't hold a bunch (barely holds one load of laundry packed tight) but it's way cute, and the price is right.	
- 1	Wanted to love this but the zipper broke after 2 months (& a handful of uses at that.)  Just emailed customer service, we'll see how that goes, from other reviews on here I'm not hoping for much.	
1. 	I actually bought two baby bath tubs.... ( I wanted free shipping) so duck was extra tub.. We have not used it for bathing, but it is just so cute that baby likes to play in it . It is great for storing soft toys and  baby loves to remove all the toys and get inside.Well worth the price what ever the use. Would make a great and useful gift.	
- 1	We used avent, Playtex Ventaire adn Dr. Brown's with our daughter.  This rack didn't work with any of them!  The Ventaires didn't fit well on dryer adn would wiggle all around and fall off if it was jiggled in the least.  It did hold all of the Ventaire part well which that would be the only plus for this item.The wide neck bottles fit better in the dryer but still didn't fit well.  But then the collars and nipples were really too big to work with this rack.  The Dr. Brown's were even worse becasue of the inside pieces.We never really were able to get stable enough to use in the folded position and we were never able to get anyting to hang on the hooks without falling either.  We also had to buy 4 of these toeven find one that wasn't broken when we took it out of the box.  The first two were broken and the basket wouldn't hook on and the third one was broken and could not bend in the middle.  This rack leaves alot to be desired to say the least.	
- 1	These are cheaper than other disposable pads...for a reason. They are the only brand I've tried which leaked through. Also, there are no sticky tabs to help keep it in place in your bra. I won't waste my money on these again.	
1. 	I got these for my 3 year old and 14 month old daughters. I got them to replace my gerber ones that didn't keep anything in them if the child held them wrong. My kids can't get anything out by shaking these or holding them upside down. The only problem I had was my 14 month old sticks her hand in it and then tips it upside down, which keeps the top open and sometimes smaller stuff falls out. But all in all a very good product.	
- 1	Poorly made and it does not hold heavy objects.  I returned this right away.  Don't even bother wasting your money.	
- 1	I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already.  However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones.  My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore.  The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.	
1. 	I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington. I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again. They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know. I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.	
1. 	I waited four months before purchasing a hand pump, and wish I had done so sooner.  My insurance covered the full cost of the Medela Pump In Style, which I use daily while at work.  While you can't beat an electric double pump for efficiency, sometimes it's really nice to have a hand pump.  I chose this one simply because the valves, bottles, and breast shields are interchangeable with the ones for my electric pump, and it works just fine.  The pumping mechanism itself seems well designed so it's pretty comfortable to pump, even for my relatively small hands.  It's really easy to clean since the pumping part itself never comes in contact with milk.Having a great sleeper, I've struggled with engorgement, especially at night, and this hand pump has quickly become essential.  It's so much quieter and easier to set up than my electric pump that it's perfect for quick night-time relief.  The suction seems gentler than the electric pump so is more comfortable, but takes longer to fully drain the breast.  Since I'm not looking for full drainage or stimulation at night, this pump is perfect.  I've also used it while a passenger in a car and in various public restrooms when it's bulky electric big sister would be inconvenient.  Everything comes apart and is small enough to fit in a zip-lock sandwich bag (except the bottle).	
1. 	This is very soft, and doesn't shrink when you wash it (which is important, considering it gets washed a lot!). I bought two, so I could always have an extra on hand, and I'm glad I did.	
- 1	Sigh. Why did I waste my money?These are too big and bulky - you can't easily see or &#34;feel&#34; what you're clipping, so you better just hope that they're going into baby's fingernail and not his flesh. The LED light is not bright enough to make up for the bulk of the clipper obscuring the other ambient light. Better to have something small that doesn't block what you're doing and sit by the window or under a reading lamp.Somebody gave us a cheap little manicure set containing a cheap little pair of clippers. Those suckers are awesome and are worth ten of these at what was probably a tenth of the price.	
1. 	I love these liners. They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk. I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere. I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all. My only complaints are: 1. They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho. 2. The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk. Otherwise, this is a great product!!	
1. 	Honestly, I don't just use these for babies.  In fact, it's the nail clipper of choice in the house for all 9 of my kids.  They won't touch the metal ones, but these work really easy even for them to clip their own nails.  The only thing I would add to them is some type of metal file to clean under the nails... but you can't beat the ease of clipping with these things!	
- 1	We were looking for a disposable liner that would allow our son to continue using cloth diapers once we decided he needed diaper rash cream with every diaper change (once he started eating adult food at around 10 months old, it turned out that his skin was sensitive to a lot of the food -- citrus, berries, tomatoes, some spices -- after they emerged in his stool).  These liners are not the solution, as they have lots of perforations.  I was so disappointed when they arrived.  Even if you layer two or three sheets, diaper cream still gets onto the cloth diaper, which then has to be extensively laundered to get the zinc oxide out.  We're going to go with the Bum Genius fleece stay-dry liners, which we put between the diaper cream and our regular diaper liners (we use Flip covers with a combination of Flip inserts [at daycare] and prefolds [at home, on the weekends]).  This means extra laundry -- which we were trying to avoid with disposable, biodegradable inserts -- but at least our entire stash of diapers won't be ruined. I hope my review will help others avoid the mistake I made.	
1. 	We plan on using this play yard for our new puppy. It is easy to set up and with the extension creates a large area. The non-skid pads the mfgr provides prevents it from slipping on tile. Sometimes the panels are hard to move (to change the angle).I checked many other websites and stores and this was the best deal. I requested that is show up on a Saturday but it arrived on Friday. Great job, Amazon!	
1. 	It did exactly what I wanted. It lines the nursers perfectly. Liners are nice because all I have to wash are the bottle nipples!	
1. 	Works great if you follow the directions. My husbands not so good at that so the results weren't always consistent, but is never had a problem :)	
- 1	It looks cool, it feels cool, but your child won't be able to drink from it. Greatly disappointed with this purchase.	
- 1	My baby didn't like it to be swaddle in this. I rather use a cotton blanket.	
1. 	Love under the nile products for being fair trade and always using organic cotton.  This is a great toy for a teething baby.  My daughter loves chewing on the ends of the green bean.  I think it is very comforting to her.  This kind of toy is a much better shape then some of the other under the nile toys because my daughter can chew and hold it easily.  We also have the strawberry, broccoli and tomato and this is her favorite one to chew on out of the bunch.	
1. 	My other nursing covers are fine, but this one does not heat up as much underneath. My babies tend to help cool it down buy lifting up the covers and flashing the public. So far with this one my baby is content with feeding completely without exposing be because of the temperature. It is also the softest feeling cover I have seen and is very comfortable for me and my baby, plus it is longer than most as well.	
- 1	I'm sure this jumper is a hit among other babies, but not mine. It was way to overstimulating for my son. He would spend about 5 minutes in it before he would start crying to get out. I tried turning off the music, but he found the toys boring. He would often get his finger pinched on the elephant and like other parents said, it seems like the toy is made more for parents.  Also, after doing a lot of research about jumpers in general,  I found that it can be harmful for a child to jump before they are developmentally ready.  If you do purchase this device, in my opinion I would limit the time your child is in it to just a few minutes a day. We got rid of ours soon after purchasing.	
- 1	I was specifically looking for a narrow backless booster to fit 3-in-a-row in the back seat of my sedan, this was not so narrow.  The description says 12, but now I see that means the internal width, not the width of the whole thing!  I'm sure it's a great booster, but I feel like I just wasted a bunch of time... it will be going back.	
1. 	This potty seat works great.  My daughter would not sit on a public toilet, especially with a protective paper cover over it.  This potty seat will fit in a good sized purse or small backpack.  It has never pinched her.  We have not had problems with it sliding around.  She happily sits on it without any complaint, which is a great stress reliever while potty training.  She calls it her special seat.  Highly recommend.	
1. 	This is a great product, works as advertised, but is pretty slow heating.  This product works best if you're going out with a cold bottle and know when you're going to feed your child.  For example, our town is 25-30 minutes away, so we start warming the bottle in the car on the way to town so that it is finally ready once we get to our destination.	
1. 	These are the first VentAire bottles I've used, and I'm impressed!  The air bubbles really do vent out!  My baby wasn't too great about taking a bottle before, but he actually started drinking from these.  He seems to like the nipple.  I like the angled shape of the bottle because it makes for a more comfortable feeding.The one draw back to these bottles is that there are two extra parts to clean.  But if I'm washing a bottle anyway, it's really not a big deal.  I also like that the bottom comes off because It allows for better cleaning.	
- 1	I bought this as I was planning to have a home birth and realized the initial footprint isn't taken like it is in hospital, and I really wanted that first footprint.  I liked that it was inkless and came with paper, but to call it deluxe is a complete overstatement.  The paper was nothing more than thick printing paper and the inkless wipes left more than just a footprint on the paper - like inkless blots.  I followed the instructions and the result was a messy, ink-like footprint on paper.  The only saving grace was there were no inky feet to clean off afterward - a simple wipe down with a wet cloth did the trick (though, I'd highly recommend a thorough hand wash if you do handprints).  There were other products just like this for far less and I'd have been equally happy with those.  Would not recommend this product.	
- 1	I use an electric double pump and returned to work a few weeks ago. I bought this manual hand pump in case i was traveling or somewhere and couldn't use my electric pump. The first time I used it was after a wedding and it seemed to work fine. It was very efficient and I was impressed with how much milk I got considering it was manual. The pump was a bit loud but it worked. However, I used it again the other day and my experience was not so great. I forgot a part to my electric pump at home and remembered i had this one in my car. I decided to use it instead of driving home to get my parts. I figured it would take longer to pump but would still be effective. Unfortunately it was very painful and i had to stop pumping. I usually pump 3 times at work and could only do one regular length and one really short time. I'm still sore and raw the next day and its painful when my son nurses. I'm disappointed. It was the first time it actually hurt to pump. The pain I'm feeling is not worth using this pump again. Next time I'll drive home to get my parts!	
- 1	The product serves it's purpose, but it's far too large. Since it extends out past each side, if a drawer is opened without moving the guard (ex, open a drawer to the left or right) the oven door comes flying open and the guard crashes off loudly. I guess it's not meant for leaving on full-time? It hit my baby last night (luckily not too hard) but gave us a big scare. It should come coupled with an oven latch and/or in unique sizes.The plastic pieces affixed to the oven door has turned dark in color and it concerns me that toxic chemicals from the plastic are leaking into the air when it gets hot.The plastic edges are sharp, and my husband cut his finger on it fairly badly.I feel better that my daughter can't reach up to grab a pan, but all the other problems are dangerous in themselves. I'm not very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I am so happy I got this thing.  I don't have sidewalks in my neighborhood so when we go walk, it's at the park.  This thing makes for and easy transition for my infant from the car to the walk so she doesn't get all upset and being unstrapped from the carseat and restrapped into a stroller.  Definately cuts down on the fussiness.  It is extremely lightweight and easlity stored b/c it collapses so flat.  The basket is doable and the cup/key holders are sufficient.  Once she gets bigger I expect to get a different stroller, but I had expected that no matter what I had bought prior to her birth so you can't beat the price on this one.One thing, it doesn't go well over bumps or cracks, you have to tilt the wheels up a little - but that is probably any stroller with these kind of wheels.  However, not a con for me, b/c my 2 month old loves the bumps.	
1. 	I lived this! I used it the whole time I was pregnant. It really takes the pressure off your hips and thighs when you sleep on your side, and gives you support for your belly as it gets bigger. We have a queen size bed and it only took up my half. It does compress as you use it, making it less supportive. There is also an annoying tag, but I guess you could cut it off.	
- 1	This pump is very slow so unless you have 45 minutes to an hour to pump 4 ounces, don't get this.  In addition to being slow, it began leaking while in use and this is only after being SPARINGLY used for 5 months.  It's a waste of money all around!	
1. 	My triplets were born at 33 weeks and from the beginning they did great.  Except that the biggest (4 lbs 9 oz) had reflux almost after every feeding.  It was so bad that when it happened he would scare himself and would not be able to go back to sleep without being held and rocked.When you have to feed 3 babies every 3 hours, holding a baby and rocking him back to sleep, cuts down on your sleep.We bought the Inclined to Sleep.  During the first night, after his first two feedings he was reflux free and at his last night time feeding he had a minimal episode, which he quickly returned to sleep afterwards.We did cover the head area with a cloth to catch any spit up.  He did slide down after having an episode of reflux.  When babies get reflux it hurts.  Babies arch their backs to try to get away from the pain and that is usually when they start to slide down the wedge.  I never have any concerns with my baby sliding down and pressing his nose against the side barriers because I am right there to clean him up.  .I would highly recommend this product to parents that have babies with reflux.  It may not prevent your baby from having reflux but it does cut down on the episodes and brings comfort to your baby.	
1. 	This item is great for on-the-go feeding. Plus I figure when he's done with formula, we can use it for cereal or another small travel snack. Very pleased with this purchase, especially because we got lucky on the colors and got the green and blue shown for our little boy!	
1. 	The cups are very good and I bought them online because it's difficult to find them in stores. Out of all choices I had a 1/4 chance of getting VERY girly colors and I did. I received a pink and purple one for my boy. Perhaps it would make sense to actually have an option for customers to choose their own colors? I don't see how it would make the seller's life more difficult, but it would certainly make a customer's life less difficult:-) Unfortunately I will not order other colors may vary merchandise on Amazon until then.	
- 1	I have leather headrests in my car and this product slipped all over the place. It never stayed put while driving. I also hated the installation design and directions. You can only loop it around one way (over/under) and it is just slippery on the leather.  There isn't a way to stabilize this mirror. I returned it and am trying one by britax back seat mirror that has way more features and costs the same on amazon.	
- 1	Not Impressed with the design of this diaper. The snap placement is not what you would expect and is strange. The inner layer of bamboo is this and you have to buy your inserts separately. What a joke. It leaks and I'm not getting more.	
1. 	I wish I had bought this much sooner, but once I finally caved, I definitely think it helped my son gain the confidence to walk independently. It was barely used, though, so we're returning it. One thing to note: it's pretty small. We used it when my son was 16 months and it didn't quite fit around the chest (the buckles helped), and he's pretty average in size. I think this is a great product for a baby or toddler who is almost walking (cruising and using push toys) but not quite ready to be on their own. The only thing is that it helps so much you won't get much use out of it!	
1. 	This Diaper bag is nice and roomy. I can fit in all the bottles, diapers, and extra clothing items in this bag neatly without a lot of fuss. And the weight of the bag is perfect for additions so that it is not overly heavy when I do add items to it. The strap is nice and wide so there is little slip off the shoulder problems with the bag. The design is very cute, even daddy doesn't mind carrying it. I have a little girl, and eventhough it is baby blue the characters are cute enough for either baby use. The bag also comes with a changing pad in it's own individual slot in the front, so there is no digging for it when you need to change baby fast.This is a perfect gift and it doesn't cost a lot, not exactly stylish for conservatives, but for the new mommy who is on the go this bag is perfect (great for a registry item too).	
1. 	Really pleased with this crib. We looked at much more expensive cribs in the big name stores, but decided to see what this one was like, and I am so glad we did. It is well made and because we saved so much we were able to put the money into an organic fibre mattress instead. The crib is well made and the instructions were straight forward. Our little lady is just over a year old, so we haven't used the toddler rail, but it looks straightforward when we do. The only negative thing I noticed was the screw holes are visible in areas, but if the only alternative is to fill them with potential choking hazards, I can live with the screw holes!	
1. 	We've had this wipe warmer since our son was born (he is now 6 months). I wasn't sure what I thought about it at first because of a few things:1) It took a a whole day and sometimes longer for the wipes to warm up once you put them in.2) It always seemed to dry the wipes out after a few days of being in there.3) It was always really hard pulling them through the opening at the top to get them out. For the longest time we were just opening it up where you put the wipes in to get them. It gets the job done, but it's not what I would have expected.A few weeks ago I decided to try a different brand of wipes. We were previously using Huggies brand wipes. I purchased Member's Mark wipes from Amazon and this really has made all this difference. I don't have any problems now whatsoever. The wipes heat up a lot faster because they are a little thinner than Huggies. They haven't dried out yet, and we've had the same pack in there for a week. We can also pull them through the top perfectly now. Even though the wipes are thin, they are very soft and durable so they still get the job done, even with the messiest diaper changes.All in all, I have really grown to love this product. It might be inconvenient for some people to have to buy a specific brand of wipes to get the best use out of it, but I don't mind doing it.	
- 1	I bought this for my 13 month old son to keep him safe at my mom's house which is not baby proofed.  It is very difficult to snap the pieces together and then even more difficult to get them apart.  The hinges also have a clicking mechanism that hold them in place, so that if you want to change the angle between them it is also difficult to do.  So if you are planning on using it in a way that you would be changing the shape or opening and closing frequently, it is a real pain.  It is very lightweight and so easy to carry, but then again you would have to set it up when you get where you're going and that's a huge pain.  Because it is so lightweight my son just pushes it around with him.  We actually ended up building a small square of just 4 panels and he just pushes it around the house (wood floors).  That way he can't get to the dog or anything else that isn't baby proofed, but he can still get around a little to follow us as we move around.  However, since the sides have the small mesh, he is now learning to stick his toes in there so that he can climb the sides.  All in all, a pretty disappointing purchase.  We have the other style at home where the panels are thicker and look more like a fence with straight up and down panels instead of the lattice work. It is much easier to open and close and reconfigure if needed, but obviously heavier and less portable.	
- 1	PROS1. Easy to assemble. I just had to put together the arm rests, back rest, and cusions.2. The arm rest cushions. They actually snap on to the seat on the bottom part, keeping things (or baby) from dropping through. Moreover, there are handy little pockets on the outsides of the arm cushions.3. It's cheap and comes with the ottoman.CONS1. The paint on the wood is sparse in some spots and, even worse, had some scratches on the wood itself, up on the top of the back rest. Thankfully, the cushion covers it, and the other paint issues aren't too noticeable since they are toward the bottom of the glider.2. Uncomfortable! When I fall asleep in this, I wake up not being able to feel my arms. Also the chair area is kind of small and makes it so that I have to sit up stiffly with my back straight. I don't usually notice it until I'm getting off the chair and realize that my back is a little sore.3. The arm rest is too short. My baby has the habit of leaning back for a stretch after she is done nursing, and on this glider, her head dropped off the end!04. The cushions are very squeaky, kind of like the hinge of a door that needs to be oiled. The back cushion as well as the seat cushion will make these loud squeaks with any amount of movement. Even after three months of use, they are just as bad and have become more and more annoying. And the sound is loud enough to wake my baby up when I want to leave the room. Terrible!I would definitely rather buy a used Dutailier on Craigslist than buy this again.	
- 1	These wipes started unraveling after the first wash without ever even being used! Thin and rough material...not high quality at all.  Very unhappy with this purchase.	
1. 	I purchased these for my 21 month old. She loves them!  They are very durable. And wash well in the dishwasher.  Great for travel if you need to toss them not a waste of money.	
1. 	our baby loves the crib as do we.  we look forward to many years.  it is beautiful.  also bought the Emily changing table.  very good quality and matches other dark walnut wood furniture too.	
- 1	I just got back from a trip to Puerto Rico; this was the first time we used the bag since I purchased it.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that it would accommodate our car seat, which is pretty large - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WH3RB0/ref=oh_details_o06_s03_i00 - but unfortunately, by the time we got home from the trip, it had a number of holes in it; ranging in size from 1/8&#34; to 1/2&#34;.  The casters worked well and the straps are sturdy, so I'll give it 2 stars.  Bottom line:  It looks tough, but I can't imagine what it would look like after two or three more trips.  For the price, it should hold up to dozens of trips...	
- 1	If your looking for a good teething ring/keys this is definitely not the one! It's too bulky and hard for little hands to get the 'key part' into his mouth. maybe for an older baby but I still think it sucks.  Also,I just read a few reviews that this product is for children OVER 3 YEARS old (still teething??) & could pose choking hazard!?  My 5 month old son received a cheap dollar store set of keys on a ring that are much smaller and plain and he prefers them to these. I would not recommend to anyone or at least with younger teething baby...	
- 1	Almost every night there would be a false alarm that almost gave me a heart attack so I just returned this monitor. I followed the instructions very carefully and I'm confident I was using it correctly...but maybe my baby squirms too much.	
1. 	If you have ever been somewhere with your child and didn't want to lug your entire diaper bag into a public bathroom stall, this is the product for you!  No more deciding where to put your diaper bag (or having to place it on a nasty floor - yuck!).  The pronto holds all your diaper essentials so you can leave your bag and just bring the bare essentials into the changing area.	
- 1	I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all!  Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome.  It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head.  Furthermore, it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back.  Honestly, you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable (chamomile or lavender) beanbag pillow.  Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead!	
1. 	The easiest bottle ever and at an afforable price. The drop-in liners are a blessing when you're always in a rush (like me). The nipples come in three sizes (slow, medium and fast flow) so you can use these bottles as your baby gets older just by replacing the nipples. I bought a two-pack of fast-flow nipples for about $4.00. Replacement nipples and liners are available in many stores so they are easy to find. Target sells their own brand of 4 oz liners that are just as good as the Playtex brand, but cost less (about $4.00 for 100 count). Another great thing: the liners don't have to go in the garbage, they can go in your recycle bin instead.	
1. 	I have both the kick and play and this and I found this to be MUCH better. Here is why:1. the fabric is SO much softer2. the music is much more entertainig and not annoying. Also the music isnt so loud like the K n P3. There is 3 vibration modes, unlike the 1 with the K n P. Also, the vibraion turns off after awhile as to not wear out the battery. Also, the vibration is MUCH quieter with this one.4.  The base seems much more sturdy.5.  The mirror is much larger and the lights are more entertaining.6.  There is many different modes for interaction, unlike the KnP which only has 2 options.As you can see I REALLY love this and so does my 1 month old daughter. You just cant go wrong with this purchase! I save $10 and bought it at Target ($39.99).	
- 1	I have not had a chance to use these for actual diapering yet, so I can't speak about their effectiveness with that. But I did wash mine, in preparation, and can already see a problem. There are no laundry tabs for the velcro, so you have two choices with this diaper: wash it closed (and I can't imagine it'll get as clean that way), or wash it open and have the velcro attach itself to everything it comes in contact with... Not a good design, if you ask me. Velcro is already less durable than snaps, and to have it catching on your laundry every time is not going to help with the durability.	
1. 	You can remove all of the air from the liner so it minimizes ingestion of air. Initially we were hesitant/worried to use this system since we solely breastfeed for 5 months. The baby had no issues with the liner/bottle system. We use this in conjunction with our Medela Breast Pump. Works great, met all expectations.	
1. 	This changing table pad fit on our changing table perfectly. It comes in 2 sizes so make sure you measure! It has attached straps if you want the extra security for wiggly baby. Also screws to attach (although I'm not sure where you'd attach it). It seems to be plenty cushy. The plastic covering is perfect to clean quickly if there's a mess. This is a great product for the price. Although I have not used another changing pad, I'm perfectly happy with this purchase.	
- 1	These bibs have a very strong chemical odor.  I do not feel comfortable putting this on my baby.  Babies put everything in their mouths and with this strong of a chemical odor, I can only imagine what these are made of.	
1. 	This seat protector has been great at keeping seats looking new and catching snacks the little one has dropped!  Easy to clean too.	
1. 	This item is awesome. My baby would not sleep for more than 2 hours in a stretch, but the first night I used this, he slept for 4 hours straight. No matter how well I swaddled him with receiving blankets, he would wiggle his way out. There's no way of getting out of this one. My son outgrew his small once, so I've ordered a larger one. The only thing is, the small one I Had was in fleece, and my baby is a warm baby so he would get hot. So in the warmer months, I had to dress him in only a diaper shirt to prevent him from sweating. I ordered the larger one in the cotton version.	
- 1	my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).  The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.  Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.  I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.  Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.  I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?  Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.	
- 1	These sheets do fit okay on the crib mattress, they breath good and have kept shape quite well after being washed, but it annoys me to the core that they are not made like normal sheets. Instead of being seamless on all the edges, and having seams only on the corners where the edges meet, they have seams that run along the long sides of the sheet and after constant use the seam ends up on the flat part of the bed where the baby sleeps making it look all &#34;fat guy in a little coat&#34;. It doesn't prohibit the sheet from doing its job, and it isn't a safety hazard, it just looks so crummy. I wouldn't buy these sheets again because my OCD wouldn't dare allow it.	
- 1	I'm going to start by saying right now - DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I applied these according to its directions exactly, taking good care to secure the suction cups tightly, while I was cleaning my car.I then went inside. I came outside five minutes later and both had fallen, each time I tried to re-attach them, they fell right after I attached them. I then decided to roll them back up and take them down, but realized that the casing that holds the shade actually cracked by falling on a cushioned seat repeatedly.In addition, I attached them in mild 50 degree weather and the heat sensor said it was 'HOT', much too &#34;hot&#34; to touch!These are the most faulty piece of crap products I've ever purchased! The heat sensor is a sham in EVERY Munchkin product I have purchase, the suction cups are extremely faulty, and the shades never roll back up!Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!	
1. 	great fit in my 2006 Malibu and it helps prevent the car seat from digging in. like that its also meant for when the kid gets older. great investment.	
1. 	I like the bent neck but since I didn't use any other bottles I have nothing to compare it to.	
- 1	Super cute, good grip. I specifically set out to find something my daughter couldn't spill, and she managed to find a way.The small air hole to allow liquid to flow also allows liquid to leak. No matter what we always find my daughters cups on their side. Do not buy if you have the same problem.	
1. 	my baby loved it and it got her interacting more than most kids her agw	
- 1	I returned this bib, as I was dissatisfied with it.  The main selling point of the bib is that it will catch food that the baby drops while eating.  However, as soon as my baby lifted his arms to put food into his mouth, the pressure of his arms against the bib caused the lower portion of the bib to collapse, so any food he dropped fell straight to the floor, or into his lap.  I am very pleased with the Baby Bjorn bibs, which in theory seem comparable to this one, but in reality, they are made of much harder plastic, and therefore do not collapse.	
1. 	These looked huge when I took them out of the package! Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash. These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them. They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached. After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue. In short, I love them. I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day. I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that! She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.	
1. 	I purchased a travel size Pack n Play to keep at my house for my granddaughter.  This sheet fits the mattress perfectly and it is a nice quality.  I should have bought two!	
- 1	I thought this travel tray was great, the two times we used it.  Then one of the webbing straps frayed just about the point of useless.  I can probably repair it, but I would expect this item to stay intact for more than two uses.	
1. 	I really wanted something to hold baby down during diaper changing. But he is so smart he will wiggle his way around and then crawl out. While it did not contain him as I would have liked the pad is really nice and gives him a soft landing.  Very comfortable to change him on. Covered It withCarters chocolate dot changing pad cover.	
1. 	Our daughter is picky when it comes to sippy cups. I remember using these cups when I was her age and I liked them. So I went on the hunt to find them. After going to every store around us I finally went on Amazon.com and typed in what I was looking for. And sure enough these cups came up. I ordered 6 cups all together. Though they do spill a little when they are tipped that are great. Our daughter like them and they are easy for her to drink out of.	
1. 	I've had this things for like 7 months now and it STILL hasn't leaked despite very rough treatment (my kid stood on it, jumped on it, etc), so ones that leaked are faulty.Who would need instructions on how it fill it?! It has a hole and a plug. Run water into the hole. I never thought twice about it. That's like needing instructions on how to blow up balloons. Put it in your sink and run water into the hole... I'm not trying to be rude, I'm really not, I just don't get how that isn't obvious and easy.Is it an amazing, spectacular toy? No. It is a neat toy that is fun to smack and jiggle and squish? Yep. And it was totally worth the $10.	
- 1	What a poorly designed toy.  I can't understand all the positive reviews.  I really can't.  Just look at the design!  Of course it's going to tip!!  Our little guy actually cried in this contraption.  He *rarely* cried.  We live in a historic home with very wide doorways but I'm certain if you hung this in a standard doorway your kiddo could easily tip over and bonk his or her little face on the door frame.  I tried tucking a blanket in around my son in an effort to keep him centered but every time this stupid thing moves it tips to the side.  I honestly think a child could actually fall out of this thing.  It's an accident waiting to happen and I can't believe it hasn't been recalled.	
1. 	This pail is not only good for disposable diapers but cloth diapers as well! It's great that it doesn't require any special type of bag. You can put in a regular trash bag if you want or you can buy their refill bags. I use it with a pail liner for my cloth diapers.It does a great job of keeping the smells in. The only time I notice a smell is when I'm opening it up to throw in a diaper or to change the pail liner.I like this product so much that I recommend it to anyone I know who's having a baby whether they are using disposables or cloth diapers!	
- 1	The pacifiers are great. My baby loves it. It was MY mistake to buy all translucent pacifiers. DON'T. Once you set them down, it is hard to find them, spot them and when you have your baby asleep... the hustle with no lights to find these translucent pacifiers is hell. My first mistake as a first mom: wanted &#34;cute&#34;pacifiers and forgot about practicality. AVOID translucent. I then bought the same with colors and my baby loves them. So i do highly recommend the brand and product, just not the translucent ones!	
- 1	I'm so sad this chair didn't work out.  I hope the product designers at Keekaroo read this review and make some changes. oTHE GOODOnce you put the chair together, you'll think to yourself, wow this is a nice sturdy chair, lovely color/ overall aesthetic and the infant seat is super comfy. All this is true.HOWEVEROnce you put an actual child in the chair, you'll wonder if Keekaroo tested this product with real babies/ toddlers and their parents.  Here is what I mean:PROBLEMS WITH THE TRAY1) Size. The tray is about half the size of other trays on the market.  Sure this is OK to look at.  But imagine for a moment that your dinner plate was not 10 but 5, and you had to eat with it pushed up against your chest. This is what it is like for your toddler to dine in the Keekaroo.In my baby's old chair (Chico 360) I could place a small bowl of blueberries, a small plate of cheese and his sippy cup in a special circle indent. On the Keekaroo, because he has no room, he accidentally knocks over the bowls, plates and without that circle indent, his cup goes flying to the ground, and it all ends up in tears. So now I have abandoned giving him anything other than food directly on the tray, yet the tray is so small that he gets his forearms and elbows covered in food.2) This is the only tray I have seen that requires TWO ADULT HANDS to remove. So you are probably thinking, if you need two hands to remove the tray, and a few seconds to put the tray down somewhere, is the baby safe? The answer is NO.The infant insert seat is attached by a flimsy piece of velcro. This is nice for easy cleaning, but when I take off the tray with both hands, and my 13 month old starts to wriggle to get down, the seat pops off with no resistance and he falls.  The 3 point harness, as other Amazon reviewers have mentioned, is flimsy.  It snaps together low on my baby's hips, and  does not stop him from falling when the infant insert seat detaches. This is extremely DANGEROUS.PROBLEMS WITH THE FOOTRESTI was so glad that there was a footrest so my baby's legs wouldn't dangle. However, this is a big heavy wooden tray that barely fits into the loose slots. It's very wobbly so when my baby rests his feet on it, the entire thing comes crashing down. Now as I am the one sitting close to my baby to feed him, on more than one occasion it crashed on my feet, leaving my toes bruised. I have another baby on the way and I could just picture this crashing on him. We have since removed the footrest as it is dangerous.SUGGESTIONS FOR KEEKAROOHere is what needs to happen to make this lovely chair both functional and safe:1) Infant insert seat needs to properly attach. An inch of velcro is not good enough.2) The 3 point harness needs to be replaced with a 5 point harness.3) Tray size needs to double, with a special circle indent for bottles and cups. Heck, sell me an XL Deluxe Tray as an accessory for another $80. I'll buy it!4) Tray needs to detach with one hand (examine at all those plastic high chairs at Babies R Us. Yes they are hideous to look at, but you'll notice their trays all detach in the middle, leaving the adult with one hand free to keep on the baby).5) Foot rest needs to be secured by a screw or some other mechanism.	
1. 	On more than one occassion I've had a crying hungry baby on my hands in teh middle of the night or the very early morning, and walked into the kitchen only to find that all of the bottles are in teh sink or in the dishwasher yet to be run.  It's much easier to keep my daughter distracted four the 4 or 5 minutes I need to wash and sterelize in this product than to wait for a load of dishes to run!  If this sounds like somthing that could happen to you . . . buy this product! (Or put it on your registry).	
1. 	I received this as a baby shower gift. Our little guy preferred this over the standard plastic baby tub. I think it's probably more comfortable for him. No hard plastic poking him. Also easy to wash his hair with him laying in this. Bath time became much more enjoyable once we started using this!Our little guy is 4 months old now and really stretches over the bottom so I think we'll only be able to use this another month or so. Well worth the price!	
- 1	I have and love the OsoCozy pre fold diapers, but these were disappointing.  They work fine, but the lovely rainbow edging came unravelled on several of the wipes on the FIRST WASH.  The flannel is also a bit too slippery to catch poop, so I'm investing in the textured grovia wipes, as well.  For pee or face wipes, though, these are gentle, soft, and work great.  They've withstood quite a bit of heavy washing and high heat drying.  Just don't get them for the rainbow edging.	
1. 	I was looking for some bibs that helped block pureed food from getting on my baby.  These bibs aren't totally waterproof, but they do block so much.  They're a good length and width (6 months old) plus they clean pretty easily.  We rinse them off after each meal and then put them in the wash with everything else.  They are now our go-to item.	
- 1	The opening is a little small and it's hard for my 3 year old to pee with it without peeing all over the pee guard.  Plus, why would you put ridges in the pee guard?  It makes it so much harder to clean and sanitize.  My 3 year old is in the 50-75th percentile for height and weight, so he's not a huge kid so I feel this seat is just made too small for the average 3 year old.  I don't think I'd recommend it to others.	
- 1	We couldn't even install this gate, because it arrived warped - the door of the gate would not close, because it was not level with the lock. Does this company ever check the quality of their products? For the price they are asking for it, there should be a much, much better quality control. I am extremely disappointed with this gate. Obviously, it is going back ASAP!!!!!	
- 1	I bought this seat to use for my one year old and I was planning on using it rear facing until he was at least two. First of all, the installation was ridiculously complicated. The instructions were not helpful and it took my husband (who is an engineer) two hours to put it in my vehicle. He installed using the seatbelt as my car is not equipped with the LATCH system. Frustrating, but we were not planning on moving it once in place so as long as the seat functioned okay we would have kept it. We then tested it and realized that it was nearly impossible to adjust the straps in the rear facing position because the release was so far into the car's seat. To make things worse, as we tried to adjust the straps they kept being uneven on either side of him. We finally gave up because who has time to do that much work every time you use the seat. We have another brand convertible carseat in our other vehicle that was not nearly this complicated. We decided to return the seat.	
- 1	I bought these and I was actually disapointed because I love ergo...I thought there were going to be something really cool and that wouldnt get wet...pretty much all this is a  shoulder strap pad...save your self $10 and go buy some car seat shoulder strap pads from walmart.	
- 1	My son is only 10 months old and can't use this seat because there's not enough space between the seat and the tray.  He's not a fat child, either, only in the 50th % and it cuts right into his belly.  I'll be returning it today.	
1. 	This cup hasn't spilled on us, is easy to clean, is easy for my 17-month-old to grip, and fits easily in cup holders.  Would certainly buy again.	
1. 	Great bottle brush! Even includes a micro cleaning brush in the handle for little hard to reach crevices in bottles.I love that the brush head is so stiff as it really scrubs the bottom of the bottles well.Definite must have for any parent who is bottle feeding!	
1. 	this is a wonderful changing pad.  i appreciate the contours because it does seem to make the baby more comfortable and secure.  i highly recommend it!!	
1. 	For all co-sleepers out there or those considering co-sleeping, this is the perfect solution!  We are all nervous having this new little body next to us as we sleep yet we do not want to leave the little baby all alone!  This solves the problem perfectly!The Snuggle Nest fits right on your bed and baby sleeps in it.  That simple!  You fall asleep knowing that baby is safe and next to you.  The construction is hard plastic, like a little half bucket and it has a thick and cushiony pad that removes easliy for cleaning!  If anyone rolled onto this you would know it fast!Purchase extra sheets although I wrapped the little mattress in receiving blankets until my baby started moving around.Know that if your baby grows fast like my baby, you won't be using this past 3 months, BUT for the peace of mind it gives you, it is worth the money!By the time your baby is too big for this, you are used to sleeping with him/her and have already established a ritual and feel comfortable with him on the bed with you!	
1. 	I love these pad covers! The fabric is so soft and feels great to the touch. We just found that putting a small muti-use absorbant pad under the diaper area saves a lot of time and hassle. We keep plently on hand and just replace one when it gets soiled. That way the plush cover stays fresher longer and you dont have to remove and clean it so much. Washes and tumble dries easily.	
- 1	I ended up returning this... it would most likely be best for a flat bottomed baby bath. The suctions are too small and in effective in my regular tub and the mat it self is not enough room for even my little one to sit on (if I could get the suctions to stick). If they made a bigger one, I would try it as I generally like their products.	
1. 	This is so much cleaner and useful than my old sponge-tipped bottle brush.  The bristles are soft, but still give you cleaning power.  It fits well into any bottle... I only wish the thin end also had some bristles to give more friction inside nipples.	
1. 	I initially bought this set because I wanted to change out the hanging toys on my daughter's Boppy activity center for variety.  She loved these!! They have various rubber surfaces that she liked to chew and touch.  Very colorful, encouraged her to grab for them.  During teething these are really great--you can put all of these in the top rack of the dishwasher for easy cleaning (even the fish). Great value for the money.	
1. 	As a working mom, every moment counts.  These wipes have saved me a lot of time from having to wash and rinse pump parts after every use.  The wipes clean the pump parts very well, and my child has never had a bad reaction from milk pumped after using these wipes to clean the parts.  Highly recommended (just wish they were cheaper)!	
- 1	We didn't care for this seat at all and will be returning it. It's very loose after it's assembled and would not attach securely to the table (our table fits all the specifications as being one that this chair can be used with). The pieces that are pushed upward to hold the chair to the table are lightweight plastic then the arms that come out to keep it stable are attached to the same center plastic part and come out at an off angle (and cannot be adjusted) so they don't press against the table and the whole seat can be moved up and down.Even if it fit the table safely I would still be disappointed, the seat sits back from the edge of the table leaving a big gap which I can see lots of food falling down. The fabric part is cheaply made, crinkly, and only comes in an unattractive red and black.We also own an inglesina fast chair and it's wonderful. We tried this chicco chair because our fast chair does not fit our table. If it will fit your table or you're only planning on using it while traveling the inglesina is the way to go.	
1. 	I bought this because I was looking for waterproof bibs since my baby it's spitting a lot and teething, I use to love the Carter's bibs, but since he is spitting more now they only last two bottle feedings .... When I opened the package and saw the bibs I think to my self, that's it? because they look plain, simple and to be honest cheap, after I touch them it just got worse, they felt thin and not waterproof at all... Well, that night I tried one, but I was pretty sure they were going directly to the trash can after that. Was I wrong!! OMG, these are the best waterproof bibs I have use! I have three boys and I have gone through a lot of bibs and these are the best!! They don't look cute, they don't have fancy stuff but man, are they good keeping my babies clothes dry!! And the velcro closure is super strong! Two thumbs up!! Looking for waterproof bibs? This are the ones for you!!	
- 1	it has one main job that it fails at: holding formula. the lid never seemed to properly close for me and powder would get stuck along the top seam. one day it fell out of the diaper bag and dumped the contents (luckily it mostly landed in the lid). I then went home and threw the stupid thing away. can't depend on it even holding the formula (let alone dispensing the formula) and I don't want to end up somewhere with a hungry baby and formula powder on the ground or the bottom of the diaper bag.	
- 1	The concept of this is amazing! I was so excited to give it a try. Try was all I did, however, because it was not as expected. The tray is 4 pieces that snap together and its flimsy at best. The snap together sections leave openings which pinched my daughter's arm. Also, the foam insert felt cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled by the thickness of the Bumbo but this foam part falls out and was very thin. I returned it.	
1. 	I really needed a pack of soft, cute bibs at around four months for my drooling baby.  These were perfect--they attach securely but comfortably, are absorbant and soft.  When we first started solids a few months later, they were great for that, too.  Once baby started really eating we switched to a less absorbant, rinseable bib.  Initially they worked for eating without a problem.  They got very messy and we never had the food or milk soak through all the way.	
1. 	I love this in a cherry finish but the crib I already had was in the natural finish.  I love the changing table up top.  When the baby gets older and it is no longer needed it still looks nice.  I saw some people complain about the cheapness of the drawers.  Children's clothes aren't that heavy and the drawers are spacious.  If you know what you are doing you can add extra support in the drawers but I'm perfectly satisfied.  Nothing missing/Extra parts actually which made me second guess myself at first lol.  For the price and decor you can't beat this deal.	
1. 	We originally bought the wedge for our newborn's reflux and it was great to put in her crib and keep her elevated. We just slipped it under the sheet at the end of her crib. It unzips and folds in half, which makes it easy to store when you don't need it. Our baby is now 8 months old and just had her first serious cold. We got the wedge back out to help elevate her so she could breath and it's helped immensely.  Would recommend it.	
- 1	I really wanted this monitor for the temperature readout as we have a January newborn and I worry about her being too cold.  Another selling point was the fact that it was supposed to be a private channel (2.4 ghz) and relatively quiet.  The temperature is WAY off- like 5-6 degrees higher than the actual temperature in the room.  I wrote to customer service and there is no way to calibrate it.  The monitor buzzes about half the time- maybe it is our wifi?  There is nothing to be done about the buzzing.  The other functions (flashlight, lullaby, nightlight, tc.) I have not found to be useful yet.  I would probably look into an avent or anglcare monitor if I were to replace this.	
1. 	We love Kiddopotamus products and this one is no exception. We don't use this anymore because my daughter is a toddler but we used it since the day my daughter was born and we brought her home from the hospital. No slouching, very comfy and cozy - a definite must buy for any baby shower. (In fact I've bought quite a few for friends having babies.) AWESOME. Yeah Kiddopotamus!!	
1. 	We use a munchkin wipes warmer at home. My baby had really bad diaper rash during the 2nd week, so we switched from disposable wipes to using cloth wipes with a wipe warmer. Then we started to travel a little bit when he turned 1 month old and we quickly realized that we needed a wipes warmer for him when travel. This Dex Baby travel wipes warmer is a great product because it can be used in the car and to a wall outlet. We have ours plugged in at all time. When we travel, we plug it in the car and plug it to the wall outlet when we arrive at grandma's. It holds about 5-6 wipes (we use wash cloth) at a time - we roll up our wipes and not stacking them. All the wipes stay equally warm for a long time because the heating surface is on the top. We are planning to use this at the day care beginning tomorrow as well. We make up a bunch of cloth wipes and store them in the munchkin wipes warmer and transfer 5-6 to this Dex baby to be sent to day care daily.  It is a great product and we definitely wish we'd known about this product earlier.	
1. 	Keep in mind that this adapter is not for new Medela pumps. I don't recall what year the cut off is for this adapter, but you should research that before purchasing. The cord length is great: would have easily spaned the length of my vehicle. The speed of the pump is faster using the adapter vs. the regular electric cord, so I just used a slower speed when I pumped. No complaints at all.	
1. 	I have 30 of these. I got one pack as a gift and bought the other.In nearly 4 months of daily use, several of them have lost stitches on the edges. It does not affect the functionality of the wipes, but I wonder how long it will be before the fabric frays. However, as many others have mentioned, these are very inexpensive, and I suppose I could find some time and maybe figure out how to use that sewing machine I have stuffed away somewhere and restitch the edge. But honestly these are so inexpensive that when they really start to fray and go, I will have gotten my money's worth out of them.	
- 1	These stuck to our windows okay (even in winter in Utah), but they hardly provided any shade. We returned them for something else. I wouldn't recommend them.	
- 1	Nice product and concept, although we only used it for 2 weeks before it quit working.  Started to leak and just wouldn't heat up our bottles.  The bottle itself would be hot but the contents would still be cold.  Never tried to use the cooler.  Was using Dr. Brown bottles in it.	
- 1	If you buy the Medela Quick Steam bags this really isn't needed - everything can go in the steam bag, dishwasher, or be washed by hand.  It's bulky and we literally haven't used it once.	
1. 	so far so good. the hippo we purchased has been effective at preventing the child's head to hit the water spout. it has not come off yet either, which was a key consideration point, as other devices were too flimsy and easily taken off.	
- 1	I find this carrier to be beautiful, and I actually don't mind the long straps because this carrier fits a wide variety of body types.  I, for example, am 5 feet tall and 115 pounds.  My husband is 5 foot 10 and about 170 pounds.  We liked the idea of being able to switch the baby back and forth between us without readjusting all the different clips found on other carriers.I was so excited to try this carrier, and I first used it when Em was about a month old.  She curled into it, in a ball, and I didn't bother making her put her legs in the legholes, because obviously they were way too wide for her.Fast forward to today-My daughter is 4 months old, and screams every time I try to put her in this carrier.  The leg holes are WAY too far apart, and I can't figure out how to make it more comfortable for her.  She basically has to do the splits in order to ride in this carrier!  I wish I had returned it and gotten something else.If anyone has any suggestions on alternate configurations for the leg holes, they would be greatly appreciated.  Otherwise, we will cut our losses and buy a new carrier to use.  I strongly disagree with the 8-35 lb weight guideline, this is obviously a mistake.  Unless, of course, I am missing something?	
1. 	fit as expected,,my baby love it .This potty chair doesn't come with all the whistles and bells like other potties. But is the best. When i was shopping for a potty, i read the reviews and then went to the store to &#34;explore&#34; for myself. i wasn't convinced of any other potty. why? 'cause all the others either didn't sit sturdily on the floor (and this is w/o a child sitting on it)or were difficult to clean. This potty is simple and sturdy, gets the job done, comfy (my picky daughter never complained, she likes the teddy bear logo on it), and so easy to clean. Never had a spill too. Besides, potty training should be as simple and natural as possible, so choose a simple potty. i have 2 of this item (1 downstairs and 1 upstairs, now thinking of using 1 at home and 1 for the car).there's plenty of space to stick stickers as a reward everytime she goes potty too	
1. 	Nice quality. Very soft. Good quality. Love it! Wish there were more colors/patterns to choose from.	
1. 	Only takes a few minutes to fill up. Temperature thing at the bottom tells you if it thinks the water's too hot. Nice thought, but I think its worthless. Pretty cute, my daughter squeals and waves her arms every time I get it down for her.	
1. 	I bought this product to serve two purposes. To reduce sliding of the the carseat on my leather seats and to protect my leather seat from the car seat. It has done both! Plan on buying one for our other truck.	
- 1	I don't recommend these at all.  If you're looking for a washable trainer, spend the extra $ on something that works and get some from Little Beetles or Imse Vimse.  These are no more absorbent than a pair of regular cotton underwear.	
- 1	The mirror always moves.  We try to secure it, but then it seems to move again.  Not impressed with this product.	
1. 	I didn't need one more thing to add to my already stuffed diaper bag but I wanted a mat when I have to use the diaper changing stations in public bathrooms.  What I found in this product was such a huge convenience!  I don't have to take the entire arsenal with me anymore into a store, just the Fold and Go kit, I leave the diaper bag with the binky, extra onsie, bib, etc in the car now.  I have a disposable diaper or cloth insert, wipes and a clean mat all in the size of a small clutch bag (even smaller).	
- 1	I'm thinking this pail should be used for babies with diapers under #4.  Anything bigger/heavier and you can't fill it half way without the lid putting up a fight to close which causes the gears to strip past themselves which are what are to close the bag at the top.  We'd love to replace it, but it looks like NO ONE makes anything better.  We gave up on the backing soda dispenser on the top, and bought some A&H; pucks and stuck them under the bag.  This actually seems to have helped with the smell somewhat.  I've gone as far as cleaning the thing with bleach.I wish someone would make one out of metal.  If this design was made with some solid metal gearing it would cost considerably more, but it'd last for years.Good design idea, BAD execution.EDIT: OK someone emailed me about one made by Ubbi that's METAL!!!  OMG it rocks!  So far (2 weeks) and the room is relatively poop smell free.  Our son is 20 months old and MAN do his diapers smell.  Not cheap, but WORTH IT!  Check them out peeps!	
1. 	We have at least five different sleeping sack.  This time order is  for baby shower gift to a friend. Wonderful design, easy to clean, keep our baby nice and warm.	
1. 	I used this throughout my pregnancy, and in those final days when you are so big and your belly is so heavy . . . you can careless how big and this darn thing is! My husband named it Leroy because it often was like having a 3rd person in the bed . . . but it saved my back and hips.It was a wonderful present to receive in the beginning of my pregnancy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to congratulate a friend, daughter or sister, etc.The only thing I found which was untrue was using it to nurse after, it is way to long for that. I tried wrapping around me and then I was pushed forward and I was uncomfy, but the baby was fine ;-) I just passed it on to a non-preggo cousin that has back problems.	
1. 	Great sheet. I know that the label says not to put it in the dyer but I've always dried it on high heat. I've even washed it in hot water and thrown it in the dryer. There is just no way I would always remember to line dry it. It still fits my mini co-sleeper perfectly. I've always found putting the sheet on to be quite easy. I like how this sheet fits the co-sleeper perfectly. You won't have to worry about it coming lose. It's not super soft but I actually like that.	
- 1	I really wanted the clear plastic that come with the older versions and the picture shows the clear plastic. However, I got the cloudy plastic when i got them in the mail - the cloudy plastic is softer and it doesn't pull as well which means i get less milk with the cloudy flanges. :(	
- 1	I needed lables for my daughters' items for daycare. These were relatively cheap so I got them. They don't stick well to clothes, tags, or bottles. I could see them being good only for books or something with a hard surface. I also don't like that on every label it says &#34;My name is&#34; instead of &#34;I belong to&#34; or something along those lines. Maybe that's being too picky!	
- 1	This bag was too small once i got the diapers, wipes, change of clothes and a blanket and a toy.  the bag ended up being so over stuffed that i couldn't get the top flap to close back down, and would end up leaving the bag half open. I since gone over to a backpack. Its the easiest diaper bag, and keeps my hands free to chase after and hold my toddler.	
1. 	I used these bottles when my daughter was born in 97 and they were great. I have seen reviews that complained about nipple size, but Avent makes nipples in a numebr of different flows. The newborn nipple is for newborns and you gradually progress as your child grows. I did have the nipples collapse, but it was only becuase I needed to switch to the next nipple stage. My daughter was sucking to hard for the newborn nipple. Other than that, I had no problems with the bottle at all. I found that my daughter was able to both breastfeed and drink from her Avent bottles with no problems at all. The nipples were not too hard and both my daughter and I were completly happy with them. As she got older I began using the traning spout and handles on the bottle which was definitely an added bonus. I would recommend this product to any mother looking to breastfeed thier child.Update: I'm using these bottles with my 2nd child and they are just as wonderful as I remember.	
1. 	Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips? I couldn't get this to cover my living room power strip for my electronics because it wasn't quite long enough. Great for a smaller/medium sized power strip though.	
- 1	This is the only bottle warmer I have ever used so I really have nothing to compare it to.  However, I stopped using it after a couple of weeks and realized my son took the bottle just fine without the need to warm up the bottle.  It was difficult to get the bottle at the right temp - it was either too hot or too cold.  By the time I had it at an acceptable temp, my baby was already screaming for the bottle.  The bottle would sometimes be too hot and would leak at the top.  That left a residue at the bottom of the warmer which would emit a weird odor that might make you think something is burning.  You might have better luck with it but it just didn't work for us.	
- 1	I registered for and received this bag as a baby shower gift. I get compliments on the appearance of this bag almost every day but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend. I've used this for six months and within the first month the pockets on the inside loss all their elasticity. And I don't overstuff this thing because I'm an on the go person and don't like to carry a lot of things. All I have in there is the changing pad it came with, the white Huggies travel wipes container, like 5 diapers, a nursing cover, two burp rags and a blanket. Then the stitch that separates the pockets came undone to the halfway point making those pockets useless. Now the straps are showing age with white strands hanging and the loop with the metal ring is starting to peel. Now I'm in the market for a new bag.The only good thing about this bag is the multitude of pockets on the outside, 8. I keep my wallet, phone and all that jazz on the outside so I don't have to dig through the bag for my stuff. If I had paid for it myself I'd be pissed. There are better options out there for the price. It's such a shame because I adore the look of the bag and it passes as my purse easily.	
- 1	The problem with this monitor is that it doesn't hold a charge. I go to bed with a full charge at 100% and in the middle of the night I am awakened by the annoying beeping sound alerting me the battery is dying. I have a baby, I am awakened every night by him, why would i want to be woken up by this monitor TOO????  Why not keep the monitor in the charging unit? Because the manual says that if you consistently keep it on the charging unit, it will ware out the battery and limit battery life!!! Then I will have to buy a new battery. I have returned this item 3 times in case it was just defective and they were all like this. I finally had to buy a new monitor from another company who's monitor last 36 hours while in the sleep mode without being charged. Much happier!Other than that, I like the monitor but the charging issue was just a terrible.	
- 1	This is the cheapest and worst sling ever. It's not even a sling just a cheap piece of fabric sown in a circle. All the negative reviews are dead on. Don't waste your $$ on this, there are many good wraps and slings out there and this definitely isn't one of them!	
- 1	We had the smaller, two handle version of this cup so I picked up these thinking they would be great.  These leak like no ones business!  My kids can toss the two handle ones all over and besides the little spray from the straw sometimes, they don't leak.  These left a good 8 puddle on the floor after less than 5 minutes.  I much prefer the Playtex Click n Lock straw cups.	
- 1	Had it not fallen apart after one wash, this would have been the perfect mattress pad.  It never even made it into the dryer.  What a waste of money.	
1. 	Overall, I like this sling. It's fairly comfortable and easy to use.PROS: Strong, quality fabric. Nice fabric design. My son can sit in it comfortably (I bought the sling when he was 6 months old), and it seems like he should continue to fit in it comfortably for at least another year. Maybe longer.CONS: The sling feels a bit bulky. It can be difficult to slide the fabric through the ring to adjust it.  However, I suspect that some of my gripes with bulkiness and adjustment may be due to my size (I'm 5'2&#34; and slender). Also, it sometimes slides around on me, and I'll suddenly notice that the shoulder part is digging into my neck, so I need to adjust its placement periodically. But when it's on me correctly, it's comfortable.	
1. 	This is one of my favorite toys!  My daughter started using this at about two months old.  I'd lie her on the floor and she'd either bat at the hanging toys or kick at them like crazy for minutes on end.  She loved the music and the lights. In fact, the minute I bought the thing out she would smile and squeal with delight.  This toy bought her many hours of joy over the months.When she learned how to crawl we put it into the upright position and she would pull up on it to bang on the keys.  As she learned to cruise she would push it all around the house.  Now that she's a pro walker she still plays with it on occasion but I look back fondly on the days when this is the only toy that could truly captivate her attention.This toy is very durable and I think it's such a small price to pay for something that will most likely bring your child such sheer delight.  I would recommend this to ANYONE at ANYTIME.  It's bound to be a hit in your house, it sure was in mine.	
1. 	I bought this because my friend had it and recommended it. I also read the reviews of other parents having difficulties of their kid's skin getting pinched in the plastic hinges. I have not had this problem at all. I would definitively recommend it!	
1. 	Simple, basic, functional.  As indicated, the pad comes with strap that can be screwed onto your changing table, but once our twins got too wriggly for the pad on the table, we moved it to the floor.  It has a low enough profile that it can just slip under a bed, or a sofa, and be stored wherever you find you change your baby the most!	
- 1	Thought this was good, but then I saw how much trouble cloth diapers are.Sorry, but a working mom cannot go this way.  Back to disposables we went.	
- 1	We bought this seat for our 8 month old son to use at our cottage because we didn't want to buy a second high chair. We liked the toys and thought they would keep him entertained and give us some time to eat, but it didn't work. The toys are probably made for older babies since none of them were close enough to be chewed on. He seemed to think they were pretty boring. The tree doesn't spin very well, and the critters are a bit hard to move. What made us return this seat is its very hard plastic and straight back, which seem very uncomfortable, even if our son is able to sit properly. He would tend to fall a bit on the side when tired, and there are no shoulder straps, so it wasn't safe enough for his age.We'll just pay $25 extra and buy another[[ASIN:B005IWM99K Fisher-Price 2012 Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug], which we are very satisfied with.	
1. 	This step stool is the perfect size!  Bought it for our 2 year old and he is able to carry it from bedside to bathroom with no problems.  It is very sturdy and has no sharp edges.  Great, simple product!	
1. 	Love them. I use these when I have to pump a bottle for travel. They are handy, easy to use and I love that you use them and then toss them right in the trash. Good price for the amount.	
- 1	This GoCrib is fabulously durably and I LOVE how it can be packaged so nicely into the GoCrib backpack. It also comes with a sheet for the pad. Really my only cons for this product is the ease of set up. I anticipated it being much easier to set up. The pump fills it up relatively quickly but laying out everything, pumping it up and blowing up the mattress was just a little more labor intensive than setting up a Pack n' Play. The Pack n' Play isn't nearly as portable or lightweight so it's the trade off you make I suppose.UPDATE:After only a handful of uses the pump has completely broken. Very disappointed in its durability	
- 1	My 18 month old son is ready to be potty trained. In fact he asks for the potty. However, the faucet extender is a pain. When he washes his hands he obviously plays with and touches the extender. The unfortunate thing is that this product is actually 2 pieces. So in effect he pulls the yellow part off and...tada, no more extender. The game becomes to throw the yellow part and have mommy go pick it up. There are faucet extenders out there that are 1 piece. Oh well, waste of money for me but at least now I know. Be warned. Child might find this a toy and this 2 piece extender will be useless.	
- 1	These bottles were great for getting a breastfeed infant started on a bottle. We had several different bottles in stock, and this is the bottle our infant preferred. Unfortunately after a few months the bottles quit venting. So I bought two more and neither one of them vented brand new. I called the company and got no response so I returned the bottles and I guess we will be trying something else.	
1. 	I purchased a travel size Pack n Play to keep at my house for my granddaughter.  This sheet fits the mattress perfectly and it is a nice quality.  I should have bought two!	
1. 	Thank GOD for this swing! My daughter is 4 months old now and she's loved it since she was 2 weeks old! Though she couldn't sit up in it, the chair supports her and keeps her upright.And because of this swing, I CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT! During her first month, I would put her in the swing on high speed and let her sleep there with her pacifier in her mouth. She'd sleep for a longer period of time there than anywhere else!Please note that the swing is bulky, so prepare an area of about 4 feet by 4 feet so you have enough space...or opt for the same swing style, but the portable swing. My daughter LOVES that one, too, and it takes up about 3 feet by 2 feet. ENJOY and SLEEP BETTER!	
1. 	Santa gave this to our 6 month son for Christmas.  Both he and my 2 year old LOVE it.  It is wonderfully sturdy, and has many music functions.  My 2 yr old will announce each instrument as she adds them into the melody.  My husband is a music educator, and he gives this a big thumbs up!  Thank you Santa!  Would buy again and again.	
1. 	this pump works well, has pleanty of power, comes with a cute and practical purse/bag, and since i use the playtex drop-in bottles, it was a great match. it also works with other bottles.	
1. 	Our house is a front to back split. We have a lot of stairs. 5 openings to stairs! These gates have been great for my sanity. At first we bought a big playard gate that we opened up to cover two sets of stairs. I had to climb over that at least 100 times a day! Now we have these walk-through stair gates which are easy to use when holding the baby. Before we also had a gate that just expanded to fit the door way and was attached to walls. I was always concerned my daughter would fall down the steps if the gate gave way because she would pull herself up on it. These gates I know they are locked and they are much sturdier. I like that they slide back and forth; it's easier to get through entries.We used wood that matched our stair case so that we didn't have to drill into the post of our railing. I highly recommend this gate.	
1. 	We used this on top of our stairs, so we had to screw this one. Just to be clear, we're not very handy with tools. We started installing it and then got stuck - I think we started with a bad spot to screw the mounts to.Anyway, our handy-man came in and completed the installation for us, and the gate has worked great ever since. I am no longer afraid of leaving my baby (+1 year) unattended for a few minutes upstairs... he bangs on the gate, leans against it with all his weight, and bends down to look through the gap between the bottom of the gate and the floor - and the gate has held its place each and every time. I love it!	
1. 	I love that this is a simple visual mobile, no noise, no nothing. I hung it using an eye hook in the ceiling above the crib - had to add a chain to make it hang low enough.	
1. 	While watching my friend lug her whole travel system out of her trunk, I can pop this baby open with one hand.  It's a great product, very maneuverable and light with an excellent basket underneath for all that baby stuff.  One drawback: the cup holder is small and shallow - won't hold a thermal mug, but holds a standard styrofoam coffee cup.	
- 1	The light is spot on, very bright and precise (it gets right in the baby's nails) but the clipper isn't that easy to handle, it is bulky and because of the edges being &#34;protected&#34; by the plastic it makes very difficult to put a tiny little nail right in the middle. Not to mention the toenails! these are impossible to cut with this clipper.The blades are sharp so they cut the nail (or skin) in the first try.My advise: if you can see normally buy a clipper without the &#34;spacecraft&#34; around. But if you cut your baby's nails at night, while the baby is asleep, this might be the product for you.	
1. 	I started to prefer these bottles when my daughter was born in 2005.  I've had 2 more children (one in 2008 and the other in 2012), and each time we will try out different (and pricier) options before confirming once again, these bottles are the ones we prefer to use.  I can always find these at any grocery store, our babies have never had issues with spitting up or gas, and they do not leak.  My infant easily goes back and forth from this bottle to breast.You will have to disassemble these down to clean them properly.  Some prefer this, I find it a little annoying to keep track of so many pieces.I continue to purchase these for my son and have given this Newborn starter kit as a gift.  It comes with five bottles (2 stages) and 2 variations of the nipple (including slow speed which is critical for new babies and a faster flow as they become more accustomed to eating).  It's the perfect variety to get a new mom started.	
- 1	I have owned two of these pails. I enjoyed my first pail for almost 2 years until the twisting mechanism broke. I decided to buy another one since I was fairly happy with the first one. Now, after having owned the second pail it for a mere four months, the twisting mechanism has broken again. I don't fill the bags chock full of diapers, so I have no idea why the twisting mechanism has broken twice. I'm really disappointed and have decided to go with a different brand diaper pail for my upcoming baby.	
1. 	Have had these over a year and still going strong, even after innumerable washed in the washing machine. I have a feeling I will never be purchasing any more bibs!	
- 1	I wanted to try a wooden teether for my son. In my opinion, this particular teether is too rough and I will not be giving it to my son again. He played with it once after I wiped it down with mild soap and water. I did not immerse the teether in water because I believe the packaging instructs not to (although I don't have it anymore to double check.) It is a good size for little hands and the circles give it some interest as opposed to other wood teethers that I've seen. I really wanted my son to like this and I'm disappointed with how rough it feels.	
- 1	My baby is two years old now and he loves his pacifiers. I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.	
1. 	I did a lot of research before buying this carseat.  I am very impressed with how easy it is to install.  My husband and I switch cars a lot and thought we would have to buy another car seat, but I can literally install it is less than a minute, so there is no need.  My daughter loves the carseat.  We are about to purchase another carseat from Britax, as we have had our second child in 15 months.  Britax does a great job!	
1. 	My TV has buttons on the side going vertically. Around 1 my son kept turning them on and off and on and off......ugh. So I bought the 10X1 one. It's EXCELLENT and fits perfectly. He's a little smarty pants because he tried to take it off at first and struggled but it would not budge. :-D The ONLY downside is that I sometimes like to turn the TV on or off without the remote and since it's there until I remove it forever, I have no way to turn it off unless the remote is handy. But, I'm ok with that because I know it's serving it's purpose and I rather spend 2 minutes looking for the remote than constantly redirecting my child and potentially damaging my electronics with the constant on/off routine (which is how my computer's harddrive died).	
- 1	The wedge has a pretty big bump where it meets the mattress and our son just slid down the side of it. We only tried using it one night and then took it out. I would not recommend it.	
- 1	I got this awhile ago for my first son. it was a great idea, and he loved it, but man did it STINK! no matter where or how soon I hung it up to dry. outside, inside, febreezed... any of it. plus immediately after the bath it's a huge pillow soaked with water, so it's heavy and not too convenient. we also lived in a super SMALL house in philadelphia with no good spot to store it. we've since switched to theSummer Infant Fold N' Store Tub Time Bath Slingand it's been through 2 kids and I'm about to use it for one more. it's convenient and folds and best of all doesn't STINK like mildew! blech! don't waste the money, you'll end up buying something else anyway!	
1. 	This is one of my twin sons favorite teethers, but they are only six months old and right now it is too heavy for them to hold by themselves, so we have to sit and hold it in their mouths for them.  This is not a huge deal, and I'm sure in another month or so they will be able to manage, but I just wanted to let other parents know that this is not something you can just hand your baby.  Having said that, when we do hold it for them, they love it and want to gnaw on it for at least 15 minutes or so.  Also, it is different from other teethers in that when they are done using it, they don't seem like they are still in pain and need to go gnaw on something else.  They actually seem like they feel better, so we are able to give them less ibuprofen which I feel is really a good thing.	
1. 	I've unfortunatly had to use this recently for the 1st time. It's so easy to use!! I've always been scared to use a thermometer rectally but I wasn't nervous with this one at all. The reading was very quick and easy to read. It saves your last reading so you dont have to try and remember what it was last time to know if your baby's temp is better or worse.  It also has a backlight on the screen so you can use it in the dark, which is nice if the child/baby is sleeping and you dont want to turn the light on and wake him/her up to take their temp.And I LOVE the way to folds up inside itself so you dont worry about loosing the cap or cover, which I always do.This is a quality thermometer and especially for the price!! So easy to use and much more accurate than the ear thermometers (dont EVER buy one of those, theyre a complete waste of money and dangerous to your baby by being so inaccurate!!)	
1. 	We received this as a baby shower gift.  I had not intended on purchasing a baby tub like this and was uncertain about it after reading poor reviews for it. I was concerned about the hard plastic on his back.We started using the tub from week 1.  We put him in the sling and he didn't seem to fit right in it.  The pillow seemed to be up a bit too high and I realized why people are so concerned about the hard plastic.  If I had put his head in the pillow, his back would have been right on the lip of hard plastic.  So, we moved him down a little so his butt sank deeper into the water and his head was below the pillow.  He was a happy baby and enjoyed his bath.  We put him in the sling up until about 2 months old when he was around 13 lbs and just under 25 inches long (he is over the 90th percentile for both height & weight).  We removed the sling and sat him up in the back of the tub.  He gave a little cry at first, but calmed down fairly quickly.  We realized that you need to leave the sling in, but remove the bottom attachments so that the sling sits on the bottom of the tub and the pillow is behind his head.  The sling will also hold some water to keep his back a little warmer than the cold plastic of the tub (the reason he cried at first).Overall, I am very happy with this tub.  I am so glad we got it as a gift as I would not have purchased it myself.  It has worked out great so far and I see us continuing to use this tub for the next few months.  Baby boy loves his baths, so we get a lot of use out of it!	
- 1	This just doesn't keep my little one's arms swaddled. He loves the soft fabric but my 5 month old can easily break through the Velcro.  I would recommend the miracle blanket or swaddle me instead.  It does wash up well and keeps him warm.	
1. 	My one year old loves these!  We have been searching for a way for her to enjoy her snacks while on the move since she is now walking.  These hold in the snack even if she shakes them up and down! I do wish the colors were all the same price, instead of a cheaper price for various colors, so that way she could have a more girly cup, but its no biggie! I would definitely recommend this to all my mommy and daddy friends!	
- 1	My daughter is three months, and we had been using this as a nightlight.  Last week it just stopped working. It was great for late night feedings and diaper changes.  She was just starting to become mesmerized by the changing colors when it stopped working. Too bad, I really liked it.	
- 1	We bought this for a 10 day trip with our four month old daughter.  It did fold up and fit in my carry-on suitcase as advertised but it did not really work well for bathing her.  I tried it three times in three different sinks but it never seemed to fit properly.  It only ended up holding a small amount of water so she got cold and uncomfortable (but not very clean).  It was easier to just sponge bath her, in which case we did not need to buy this kind of expensive tub.	
1. 	Similar to a Boppy, but the extra strap is neat if you want to sit your child in it. And it is great for breastfeeding support. I wouldn't go without it.	
- 1	I'm glad I only bought one.  It says good for 10 lbs but over 10 lb baby wears this and it is so bulky.  It also leaks. It leaked so bad one night that his jammies and bed sheets were soaked in the morning.  If it leaks when he is 7 weeks old how bad will it leak when he's older and pees more?  One of the elastic bands does not stay in the hole.  It continuously pops out and rubs my kids skin.  I do like the snaps, pocket, and cover.  However, I like Bum Genius 4.0 or thirsties better.  I tried emailing the company regarding the leak but never heard a response.	
- 1	I hate this bottle brush because I use it to wash out Madela bottles and they have a small opening. I can get the brush in and it touches the sides but when I pull it out I get sprayed with water. every. single. time. I have only had it a week and am already looking for a new bottle brush.	
- 1	The variable nipple is really just a nipple with a big hole in it. Pours out like a stream! Leaks everywhere and is unusable. With the sippy cup the fluid comes out very fast and my daughter (9mo) chokes on it...though maybe this would get better with more experience..? The only good thing about this bottle/cup is that it comes with a handle. You can use the handle on the other Avent bottles...as well as the collar, seal, and lid. So I guess it wasn't a total loss. But it definitely leaks!	
- 1	I bought this diaper and two different brands for comparison. This is my least favorite. The sewn-in insert does not go all the way up the front so it would work ok for a girl but my little boy, even when pointed down, has had this diaper leak all over him. I never leave diapers on for more than two hours, but this diaper doesn't last that long. It's best if you turn it inside out when washing it, otherwise you'll never get the smell out. I am not sure how you are supposed to strip this diaper once a month since you are not supposed to strip the covers. I do not recommend this all-in-one diaper. I suggest buying pocket diapers.	
1. 	This is pretty cool. I thought it would have music, because we received it as a gift, but it does not. Which turns out to be totally fine. It displays stars on the ceiling and lights up different images, if you choose. It's pretty neat and my baby seems to really like it and likes pushing the buttons. It's pretty bright so it's definitely a good night light to fall to sleep to.	
1. 	I pump at work and it's not easy, fun, or convenient for me but I pump for the benefit of my son. This product has made pumping at work so much easier and so much less stressful. I don't have to worry about cleaning another part of my pump during my already short break times at work.	
1. 	I bought the small cow used on ebay for my son when he was 8 months old.  He didn't get into it until he was about 15 months old.  But now, he absolutely LOVES it.  He wheels around all day, and spins, and just has so much fun going around the kitchen island, and down the hallways. It is SO much better than the plastic ones (we have a hand me down one, and it's nothing but frustrating for him, as the wheels don't turn).  I got the small, and he's totally fine on it.  He's almost 33 inches tall now and it's not too small for him at all.  I will definitely invest in the bigger one when he does grow out of the small though.	
- 1	It came off the crib within a week, I applied it according to the directions. I wouldn't purchase this again, However seller was great to deal with!	
1. 	I actually bought two baby bath tubs.... ( I wanted free shipping) so duck was extra tub.. We have not used it for bathing, but it is just so cute that baby likes to play in it . It is great for storing soft toys and  baby loves to remove all the toys and get inside.Well worth the price what ever the use. Would make a great and useful gift.	
1. 	My 2 year old daughter is SO PROUD to go on the BIG GIRL POTTY... and Mommy is so happy not to have to clean the potty chair 500 x a day! She just turned 2 and she likes to put the potty on the toilet and take it out, fold and store it, all by herself. I have a TALL and ALONGATED toilet so we had to put a little piece of board (cement board leftover from construction) under the carpet/rug to make it a little higher... and the seat doesn't fit perrrrfectly on the toilet but it is good enough. If you center it well, it doesn't wobble.  We use it on TOP of the regular seat. I just bought a second one for my bathroom upstairs.	
1. 	You can see the stars in blue/green/yellow - for each color different button. Sooo easy to operate.you can see the stars on all walls in the room and it looks so nice.all 3 colors.i do recommend this.	
1. 	The product is smaller than your typical oversized baby nail clippers. Very easy to store. I would buy another one if I needed it.	
- 1	We bought this twice and it died both times! Each only lasted a couple of months. The problem was that the water seems to leak into the power cord, which corrodes it.  Not to mention it is unsafe to have it by your baby! Buy the munchkin one instead!	
1. 	These are the coolest things you could possibly have if you child is already snacking on goldfish, cereal, grapes or anything small like that. they can grab and hold their own food without you having to worry about picking up a mess later. there's no lid that you have to remove, unlike what i used to have to remove when i carried my sons snacks around. they're ready to go! these are especially great for the car. with my son my car is a disaster from all the little things he used to eat and then drop. this is no longer an issue with this. although my son is a little thinker and loves to figure out how things work, so when he's bored he'll get fancy and make a small mess, but as long as your kid is hungry and isn't too worried about how this little cup is supplying their food, no worries for you. i especially like these ones compared to another brand, snack trap i believe, these are see through, and i think they look a lot better. i like the way the plastic feels also.all in all, get these!!! eliminate messes everywhere you go! why NOT get them?	
1. 	I tried on 4 different brands of carriers in the store and the 2 I found I liked were the Baby Bjorn and this one. My hubby is much larger than I and the specifications of what size straps to buy for the BB were confusing: if you wear a size Large shirt, get the large, etc... Not very specific! I need real measurements. Though the large straps on the BB would probably extend enough to also fit my husband, I wasnt spending a $100 and not be sure, not to mention, $30 is a lot less to have to spend- our budget really wouldnt allow for such a splurge! So we bought the Sungli and so far, very pleased. I would have given it 5-stars but in comparison, the BBjorn has more cushion in the straps BUT it is more difficult to un-do the straps- maybe that is because you need to break them in- not sure, didnt buy it. I also think that BB would be easier on the back but so far I havent used it for very long periods of time, like 1/2 hr, and I have yet to have any back pain.	
- 1	The SIDS alliance suggests not using anything in the crib, including any of these sleep positioners or wedges, because the baby could kick his way down and suffocate against the foam bars.  The truth is that you will probably not need it.  Babies naturally sleep on their backs if placed that way.  I was given this as a gift when I was in the hospital and when my doctor saw the box he suggested that I return it.  He said that these things come in and out of style and for some reason have come back in fashion again, but can be a big risk for SIDS- scary!!  My baby is now 4 months old and we have done fine without a product like this.	
- 1	I have great difficulty fitting bottle nips into the basket, and it does not hold much overall, and hence, I continue to wash my baby's bottles by hand.	
1. 	We have been using these bibs for the past 6 months for our baby. I love the size as it helps keep her outfits clean, and the little pouch is great in preventing most food from hitting the floor. (Although that makes our dog sad!) These bibs are super easy to keep clean, either through hand-washing or throwing in the washer.  I received/purchases other bibs and none hold a candle to the durability of the Bumkins bibs. Even after 6 months of use, there is no need to replace them at this time.	
1. 	This pad is fairly large at about 27 in. x 36 in.  The natural-colored plain-weave muslin organic cotton top is quilted in a Moroccan tile pattern.  The padding is polyester and the soft water-resistant backing is polyurethane-coated polyester.  The edges are serged.The pad can be washed and dried at cool temperatures with non-chlorine bleach only although I have washed it in hot water and didn&#8217;t notice any shrinkage or damage.It is very absorbent and will soak up a cup of water without any leak-through.  It is comfortable and large enough to be used not just for changing diapers or for a waterproof barrier in a bed, but also as a bed or carrier liner for pets or as a clean and soft surface for play- or nap-time for infants.  It can even provide protection for an upholstered chair when needed.A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.	
- 1	We've been using the Born Free bottles for the past few months and they've worked our really well - except, as I'd read in another review elsewhere, I don't know if I see a point to that vent insert.  It's pretty annoying.  I tried simply not using the vent, but then the bottles seemed to leak.SO, because I've used Born Free for some time now, I thought I'd give the born free sippy cup trainer a try.  And because I'd read the reviews about leakage, I decided to also buy the Think Baby Sippy Cup Trainer, as well, to compare the two.I used Think Baby first and LOVED it.  No leaks at all.  AND no annoying vent insert to deal with, either.  Then I tried the Born Free trainer after, and it leaked IMMEDIATELY.  I double checked to make sure everything was screwed on tightly, tried again, and the thing still leaks.I was going to give this bottle 2 stars, to be nice & because I've used the bottles for so long, but... ARGH! That stupid vent insert.Seeing as these cups aren't exactly cheap, I'm going to return this one and get a few more of the Think Baby cups.	
1. 	Tihs play yard works well for us right now. We needed a space for our 10 month old to safely play while we did other things (cook, clean, deal with the pets, etc.). It's sturdy enough that he can pull up on it.  However, we he gets going, he can slide it across our wood floor.I like that it easily folds. When we have company over or the cleaning lady is coming or we just don't want to look like a playground anymore (!), we just can fold it up and slide it in a closet. Overall, it meets our needs and we are happy with the purchase.	
1. 	I've tried all sorts of swaddling solutions for my now 3 month old son.  As he's gotten bigger, swaddling in a regular blanket just wasn't cutting it.  He outgrew his Summer and Halo swaddlers and I was left needing a new solution.  I ordered a few different swaddlers on amazon based on reviews and this is by far my favorite.My son is a little Houdini and can get out of pretty much any swaddle in very little time.  This one takes him a full 10 hours to free his arms from.  I like how you don't have to free the arms to change diapers at night; this saves me from waking him up too much.The key winning point is the separate arm flaps.  Pinning the arms to his sides before even starting the normal swaddle really helps calm him down and helps me get the rest of the swaddle nice and snug.  Size wise, it looks like this will fit him for a few more months at least (and may stretch to fit longer).  I'm considering buying a few more.  :)	
1. 	I love the boppy, when my back hurts it's the perfect way to nurse, baby loves to play on boppy!	
1. 	I love these old fashioned blocks. The colors are bright and there is a nice design on them. The corners are a little sharp at first, but they smooth out over time as they are played with.	
1. 	In a move of overzealous anticipation which has become common for me, I bought both this toilet trainer seat and the Bjorn stand alone potty for my daughter when she was 18 months old. Obviously she didn't do much with either, but she liked to sit on the stand alone potty and pretend she was going, or put her stuffed animals on it to make them pee. Fast forward to about a week ago, she just turned 2 in August, and she uses this toilet trainer all the time. For some reason she will not use the stand alone at all. As others have mentioned, she can place it on the toilet herself, which she really enjoys, and even helps me wipe it off after using. Even with a girl, she has managed to pee over the splash guard twice so far, but it is really a small price to pay for how clean and convenient this seat is. Partially it is because she is so fascinated with seeing what is going on that she leans back and the pee goes out, so it is not actually a flaw in design. I love that it fits in my (formerly) diaper bag, so she always has a clean toilet seat, even while travelling. I was skeptical of this seat initially, but bought it anyway based on the reviews, and boy am I glad I had this on hand and ready to go, because when the timing is right, it's right!	
- 1	These work OK, thr top that you put the food in does not stay closed very well though. The disposable ones work better.	
1. 	She finds it quite comfortable and falls asleep within 10 minutes of me putting her in it when she is tired. It is very easy to put in your car (especially if you have a latch system) and the straps are pretty easy to adjust as well. If I had to say one bad thing about the seat is that sometimes I find it a little difficult to snap the bottom part of the belt into the position between her feet. It's a little low down and you really have to push the buckle down into it to hear the click. Otherwise, the seat was well worth the money (and it's also rated very high on safety).	
1. 	Loves to take it apart, play with the balls by shaking them or hitting them together.  I can see this toy lasting a while, looking forward to when he figures out he can toss the ball back in the top for music and lights!	
- 1	This seems like such a great toy...... until you try to wash and dry it. Washing not so bad but its really hard to get it completely dry, a moldy toy mama does not like	
1. 	Just a quick review here to let you know that this IS vinyl as its final layer (layer that goes closest to the mattress).  My little one just moved into a big boy bed and I was looking for underpads to further protect the mattress (in addition to the mattress cover we have on) and that would be quick to change if he leaked overnight (diapers) and for when he starts truly toilet training. But I did NOT want a vinyl-layered one. There are such good ones out there that protect every bit as well but don't use that hot, body-heat-reflecting vinyl layer. I could NOT find an answer anywhere here OR on Target's site about whether this had vinyl or not, so I bought it, figuring I'd take the chance. It DOES have vinyl. So if you're also not wanting vinyl and can't figure out if this has it or not - here's your answer. Yes it does.If you want a really nice one that does not use vinyl (even though it does not have the nifty tuck-under flaps), try the Duro-Med 3-Ply Quilted Reuseable Underpad. I got that one too and it's really nice. And not hot.Can't say a word about how this Soaker actually works - I'm sure it works just fine! - because we'll likely be returning it and getting a second Duro-Med.	
- 1	I tried this belt it the last few months of the pregnancy.  Thinking back, I probably did not even need a belt, but I thought I would give it a try anyway.  It's very uncomfortable, caused more pain than comfort.  Returned it.	
- 1	I was thinking that this would be really handy for outlets that I use more frequently and I am sure if could be if I had not had trouble installing it. I removed my old switch plate and replaced it with this one. However when I was installing it (using the screw that it came with) the screw broke off and the tip is now stuck in my outlet box. I now have to turn off my electricity and remove the outlet box to try and fish the screw out from the other end. In the meantime I have an exposed outlet which kind of defeats the purpose of getting a safety cover. Hopefully once I managed to get this item installed it will be smooth sailing.	
- 1	Ive owned several hand pumps and this was my second electric pump. I had the old Lansinoh pump which was the same as Ameda Purely yours. So when I accidently dropped it and broke it I read all the reviews and decided to buy a Lansinoh pump again. I figured if they changed it, it must be improved ...... wrong. I like that its a closed system, that was a requirement for me, a top priority. It also did work for awhile so that got it a second star. But it is LOUD. REALLY LOUD. Like you cant have a conversation its so loud. Im pumping right now with my new Ameda and I can barely hear it. This Lansinoh Affinity worked for me, pumping exclusively for my daughter, for about 9 months. I started thinking I was having supply issues because I was having really bad days where I just couldnt pump what I normally do. Finally it occured to me that it may be the pump. I called Lansinoh and they suggested ordering new valves. I did that and nothing changed. Because I didnt save the receipt (the time we bought this was crazy, she had RSV, etc) there was no option but to trash it. I understand not replacing it without a receipt but it would be exceptional customer service to do so. So I had to buy another one and I went back to the Ameda. I love it so much more. you can get it for the same price here on Amazon so there's no reason to buy the Affinity, in my opinion.	
- 1	I was really excited about these bottles but the water kept leaking into the formula compartment. I tried a couple and they both would leak the water into the formula compartment. I didn't notice right away until I went to wash the bottles and saw most of the formula clumped at the bottom of the formula container. I have now returned them.	
1. 	My son is 10-months old, and we've been using this product even before he had teeth starting at 4 months.  We used it to clean his gums and rub the milk residue off it.  Works great, and he actually loves chewing on it!  I still don't understand how the tooth paste is flavored and good for you, but it does what it claims though.  I plan to purchase this product all the way up until he has a full set of teeth, before converting to a real toothbrush.  I only wished that it came with 2 of the gum cleansers, instead of only 1.	
- 1	Doesn't fit a single door in our house. They don't stay in place and if you do manage to get one wedged in, doesn't stop the door from closing anyway.	
1. 	I bought this when my 5 month old got too big for his small baby bathtub (he was 20lbs then).  He was a really big baby and his arm and legs were starting to hang out of the other one.  The baby seat my mom got me wouldn't stick to my bathtub floor and would tip over. So I'm so happy I found this.  It worked perfect. Exactly what I needed. Super easy and my son had so much fun taking a bath since he could play with a couple toys.  My son is 15 months old now and I have started putting him in the regular bath tub now and he does fine now that he has good balance and everything.  He is 30 pounds now and for him if he leaned over the side he would start tipping the whole bath.  But I think it's pretty sturdy, maybe just that my boy is a big for age.  Lifesaver for me when he was 6-12 months though! And it still looks brand new now, so I can use it again for next baby.	
1. 	This is a great mini crib for the price, and beautiful.  We like that it fits into our master bedroom, as a full-size crib would not.  It's also pretty lightweight.  Our twins are not here yet, so this crib has not been kid-tested yet, but it looks sturdy and solid.  Pieces attach very firmly together.  I gave the crib 4 stars instead of 5 only because the assembly kit was missing one of the specialized bolts, so we had to call the company to get one shipped to us.  They did send us more (several actually), but it took a couple weeks to get them.  Luckily, we were not assembling at the last minute, so it wasn't a big deal.  We would buy this again.	
1. 	We started off sterilizing using the old-fashioned, boiling water in a pot...what a mess and waste of time! Standing over the boiling pot and risking steam burns ran out of fun very quickly. After I got over the sticker shock for the sterilizer and got it home, I couldn't see how we survived before! It's quick, easy and efficient. New moms have enough to mess with, don't spend you few, precious moments each day waiting for a pot of water to boil, splurge on this item and you won't regret it!!	
- 1	Because the stink is inside of the bag, and these go in the pail but outside of the bag, they really don't help with the smells that arise when changing out the liner. They're also very very small.	
1. 	I never thought I would see the day that I would be reviewing bibs. I had no idea how important bibs would be in my life before my son was born! He started solid foods a couple months ago, and anyone knows what a mess that is! I bought some other bibs for feeding time, but they were sort of like a vinyl tablecloth material with fabric around the neck, and very hard to clean. I am a bit of a germophobe, and I never felt they got clean.  I was on the lookout for something waterproof and easy to clean. These are exactly what I was looking for!I got them about a week ago, and I LOVE them. I bought the boy assortment, and though not exactly as pictured, they are very cute. One has blue with circles, one is green with airplanes and trains, etc., and the other has brightly colored cats and dogs. I love all the designs. I can't say enough about the quality of these bibs. Nothing so far has stained them, and they are super easy to clean. You can throw them in the washer, but I just use a little dish soap and hand wash them and hang them to dry.  They dry REALLY fast. Since I have 3, I can use a different one at each feeding, but even if I only had one it would be dry by the next feeding. I like that the velcro strip is long, so they will grow with my son. I can adjust these to be small enough so the food doesn't get under his chin and through the neck opening and onto his clothing, which happens with a lot of bibs because of the neck hole being large.I also looked at the Baby Bjorn soft bib. I couldn't decide which, so I asked my husband's opinion and he thought the Baby Bjorn looked weird, so I decided on these.I am SO glad I bought these.  They are definitely worth the price. I would recommend these to anyone! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them.	
1. 	I registered for this product and received it at my shower. The nurses tried to show me how to swaddle tons of times, but my daughter always seemed to squirm right out of it. When we got home from the hospital I got it out and used it right away.  It worked like a charm, no hassles.  I  could only use it for about 3 weeks and the she learned to kick her way out of it.  She doesn't like to be swaddled anymore, plus she likes her hands free to suck on.  It was great while it lasted and I didn't have to worry about the blanket coming lose and possibly suffocating her.  I recommend this to all new mommy's that can't get the hand of swaddling.	
1. 	The mattress is still wrapped in plastic as the baby will be born in May and my child care will begin in July.  It fits the DaVinci crib thank goodness.	
- 1	It's too hard to roll and turn. Plus, I'm not sure if they are swivel wheels or not. But I do like how it's adjustable height (just the seat is not the entire walker), and how baby can stand behind and push it.	
- 1	It is NOT no-slip.  I bought this after The Baby Guy reviewed it as being great for not slipping around the table.  I figured it would be really challenging for my daughter to pick up/throw.  It's not.  She picked it right up and threw it on the floor (along with the food in it).  Once she gets over this throwing phase, it should be fine, but it's definitely not worth the cost compared to other similar items.	
- 1	This is only good for starting up. But once I started pumping more this became impractical. I recommend Lansinoh bags instead.	
1. 	After some disappointing options from the local big box store I finally came to Amazon to do some review research. After an afternoon of reading a full diaper-load of reviews, I decided to give this economical duo a try. I could not care less that my son received a purple and pink set and certainly no one else has cared either. What I cared very much about was the spill-proof, leak-proof claim and I was not disappointed. Just like they were supposed to, the tops audibly clicked into place and didn't leak.Of course, after more than 6 months of heavy use the valves have become a little tired and weakened, but even now they need to be completely upside down or at a very specific angle to leak at all. But because my son is also now that much older, that happens less and less.We have now moved on to Playtex's bigger sizes without handles and once again I am impressed.Our other go-to cup is the Safe Sippy (stainless steel with soft plastic cover) and it too is a leak-proof champ, so long as the handle is on. But since that has a hard plastic straw top, these First Sipsters were definitely used the most when our son was first starting the transition to sippy cup.I give these sippy cups a non-super mom's recommendation for sure.	
- 1	I found this crib to be decent quality, albeit a PITA to put together, but the chemical smell out of the box was horrible. It took a good 2 weeks to go away. I make a point to avoid excess chemicals in my home and especially around my baby (he was already born when we set up the crib), so that was upsetting.The other thing is the changer part is TOO SHORT. My son is only four months old now and I have to constantly be vigilant to make sure he doesn't fit his head or feet on the wood. Also, forget trying to find a pad that will fit--you won't be able to. I've looked EVERYWHERE. So we're stuck using the crappy pad that came with it, which as a newborn he hated so we ended up using the bed anyway.Would not purchase again. I wish we'd just bought a separate changing table and crib for when our son outgrew his bassinet.	
1. 	...and also the fact that it has a timer it's horrible...I mean if it also had the possibility to stay on longer than 45min it would be great...I finished buying one that you could leave on and plug in and I am using the insert in the sheep for the stroller naps when I am in the stores and the noises would wake up the light sleeper baby :)	
- 1	It makes me very nervous.  It doesn't look safe.  My son would fall asleep in it instantly, which was nice, but it was almost impossible to ensure that his airway was was unobstructed, so we stopped using it.	
1. 	I registered for and eventually purchased for myself the Active Carrier. I love this carrier. With a bad back, I find the lumbar support VERY helpful. I do have to tighten it up, but is far from cutting off my breathing. My little girl loves riding in it too. She usually falls asleep within minutes of me putting her in it.If you aren't sure if you'll like it, go to babies R' us and see if they will let you try on the display model. They would at my store. LOL Throw in some heavy cans of liquid formula to see how it feels with weight. :)Why I love this carrier:1. I love giving my little girl kisses on her head when I am out running errands.2. I love the attention she gets and the oh isn't that cute when I have her in it, while at the same time I love the distance those people keep since she's strapped to my chest (as opposed to my friend who has people leaning in on her stroller to get a closer look at the baby.) E[...]3. I love being able to use my arms when I shop or go out.4. I don't feel lop-sided like I do when I carry around a car carrier. (I hate seeing guys lug around infant car carriers while their wives follow behind them with the diaper bag. The baby jerks around in the carrier with each uncomfortable step his/her parent takes.)5. I really don't have any trouble sitting or even eating when I have the carrier on with her in it.6. The lumbar support saves my back. I have degenerative disk disease and have had two herniated disks, but with this carrier, I have not had any problems even after a day at the mall (at least 3 hours of walking around with a 12 pound baby.)7. It really is quite soothing to my little girl as she tends to sleep the entire time unless she's hungry.The only thing I don't like about it is that it's getting warmer outside and with the padding I get a little sweaty where the carrier sits (the small of my back and my shoulders.) :(	
1. 	This was on my daughter's gift list for her baby shower. I am so happy to have found it on Amazon not only because of the price but because of their shipping - wonderful - this Turtle is so cute - it shows the stars up on your ceiling which is interesting and comforting for your child. Great idea. Love it.	
1. 	Baby's nails too bendy for file, too easy to cut his fingers with clippers. These little scissors are sharp, small, thin, and quick. I feel safer using them than the clippers.	
1. 	I like this booster seat but I didn't take into consideration when purchasing it that my son would need a tilted seat as he can not support himself sitting up yet.  If you have a special needs child or a premie with low muscle tone go with a seat that reclines to help support the head and neck.  Otherwise this is a good choice and very nice.	
- 1	I literally watch my son's saliva roll off this bib. I do not know why the material is slightly waterproof. This bib is useless! I thought it was because the material was new but there was no improvement after several washes.	
1. 	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the Shop'n'Dine) didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.	
1. 	Got these hoping they'd be more comfortable than regular shields, and they definitely are.  However, the more you wash/sterilize them, the more they start to yellow and will eventually need to be replaced sooner than the regular kind.	
- 1	We received this graco digital monitor set for a baby shower gift.  When it works, it is very clear.  Most of the time it's annoying.We've suffered through it losing connection and beeping extremely loudly.  It would be fine if we were pushing the limits of the range, but one room over it loses connection and reconnects twice an hour without being moved or touched.In addition to the annoying beeping from disconnects, there are static pops, most likely from power line interfereance.  If you want true clarity with this device you may have to keep it on battery or use a power filter in front of each plug.Such a waste of money - we ended up turning it off and leaving all of the doors open to listen for the baby.  Our child sleeps through the night without event but the bleeping baby monitor wakes us up every other hour with incessant crackling and beeping.  We're awake while our baby is peacefully sleeping.We decided to buy the Philips SCD590 DECT based monitor that costs twice as much to replace this.  It was money well spent.  We'll give up eating out for two months to get non-interrupted sleep.  Our child sleeps like a baby.. we want to as well.Don't buy this product -- it's not worth the frustration and annoyance.	
- 1	In the picture for the item it looked like shade was on a Van window but I don't know what window would make it appear normal size.  This is very small.  Not happy with it.	
1. 	I got this as a baby gift when my son was born. I absolutely loved using this changing kit! It folds up so easily to fit into the diaper bag and was perfect to take into restrooms when we were on the go. It was comfortable for my baby to lay on to be changed. It also was nice to have on vacation. The kit comes with a container to store wipes in and has a holder for that inside the kit. There is another pocket that can hold around 3 diapers inside it. You have everything in your reach! There is also a zippered pocket on the very front of the kit to hold other things. It folds up nicely and is held together by Velcro and doesn't come apart if you don't want it to. I would so recommend this because it is so handy and saves a lot of room in the diaper bag!!	
1. 	Folds up so easily!  I have used in the house, at friend's house, in the grass, on sand, it goes everywhere!  Easy to simply wipe off.  Handle is nice for carrying.  Fits in bottom of my Bob stroller.	
1. 	I like the fact that this swing can swing in two different directions, because my son doesn't like the typical side-to-side.  He likes the front-to-back.  And the music is very subtle, not annoying like some baby toys are.  The swing seems sturdy, but he's only 2 weeks old so we'll see.  The thing I'd say I don't like about this swing is that the slowest setting goes pretty dang high.  I'm sure when he gains weight that'll probably change.  But the slowest setting could probably scare the heck out of some newborns.	
1. 	My son's aunt recommended these to us.  They're user-friendly and perfect for little toddler hands.  Although the cereal does fall out, there is a much smaller mess than there would be with a regular bowl.Sometimes a piece will get stuck in-between the flaps and if my son is shaking it (upside down usually), cereal will fly everywhere.  But that's to be expected.  Overall, it's a great invention.  The plastic lids are also super soft and flexible, being gentle on my son's soft hands.	
1. 	This Kneeler & Step Stool thing looks great.  We gave it as a gift but I totally wanted one for myself after seeing it.  I think it would really help your knees & elbows during bath time.	
1. 	I don't think this works so great as a tooth brush but it is a great chew toy in the tub.  I put a bead of toothpaste on it at times.  It is very soft and very chew friendly.  I is my son's favorite toy in the tub and great for teething babies.	
- 1	We expected this item to work to it's full 100% and it didn't.I bought this bad to go with us but after five hours with a dirty, wet diaper it was pretty damp and some what smelly on the outside.We no longer use this travel bag while on the go. Instead, we bring with us the Wee Huggers hobo bag, it's similar to a small purse and keeps the smell and wetness down 100% !Kissa's one size wet diaper bag is not with the near $12 they are asking for.	
- 1	Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!	
1. 	Like many other users, I also have problems with the lid, it just never closes.  I have to use a paper weight just to close the lid.Other than that, I've had no problems with it.  I use Huggies wipes and it dispenses well from the Prince Lionheart Wipe Warmer.  I have to add a couple ounces of water into the unit once a week to keep the wipes moist.I like the little light that comes on to let me know that the warm function is on.My baby doesn't really care whether her wipes are warm or cold.  But it did make difference when she was a newborn and we had to do diaper changes throughout the night.  We noticed the regular cold wipes jittered her.  The last thing we wanted was for her to be more alert from her half-asleep state.  So I plugged in the wipes warmer and it helped!  By the time we were done changing her she was almost alseep again.  Once she got her milk, she was definitely out.So I would say I got this wipe warmer more for us than for the baby.It's been 8 months since we owned ours and we're still using it ... with the paper weight on top of the lid, of course.	
- 1	The idea of this product is great. This model in my opinion does not have good sound choices. I would research and get something with more relaxing sounds for you and baby since you have to hear it too. I have the sleep sheep which we love but wanted soemthing that didnt turn off after 45min. This was a bust.	
- 1	This survived all of 3 yanks from a not terribly insistent little girl. and I did clean and dry the surface prior to applying the adhesive as instructed. Good idea if it worked, but it does not.	
1. 	It is Ok, but not as warm and cozy in a cold winter day. I still had to put a jacket on the baby. But since we don't use car seat that often I use it to wrap up the baby in my pram carriage with the snow suite under. At this point I am assured that my baby is warm and cozy.	
1. 	We've tried several sippy cups and this one is one of the few truly leak-proof ones we've found.  More milk leaks from from my baby's lower lip than from this cup, even with vigorous shaking.  The only downside is there aren't any volume markers on this cup like most starter cups.  Plus the handles are integrated into the lid, which means that we'll be buying new (Playtex) cups when we're ready to ditch the handles.  But just having a leak-proof cup is worth 5 stars!	
- 1	We bought this for our 20 month old baby and she likes using it, but the toothbrush is really made of cheap quality materials and the vibration switch doesn't always work. This product is just so poorly made and not ideal for infants because it just falls apart and can be hazardous.At the time of writing this is the first review, but make sure you read the review onSummer Infant Gentle Vibrations Massager And Toothbrushwhich is essentially the same thing. You can see there are lots of reviews mentioning pretty much the same defects.	
1. 	This replaced our soft toy-type faucet cover.  We don't use the bubble bath option.  But the kids think it's great to rinse under the cascading water.  No problem getting it to fit our faucet.	
1. 	I love how this folds up and stays folded in the diaper bag. It is great that the wipes stay put inside. I find this item convenient and of good quality. I am glad I purchased this.	
- 1	My wife and I purchased one of these for our second child to try.  We have had good luck with Tommy Tippee and Playtex sippies in the past but this cup looked interesting & pretty good.  It is THE WORST.  It leaks like crazy every time and we end up with a major puddle on the highchair tray.  I am sticking with Playtex and Tommy Tippee because this is just ridiculous.  We haven't had it long enough to see if there is the mold/slime problem that others have mentioned but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.  This cup is very poorly designed.	
- 1	the thermometer on this duck is lousy. the water has to be scalding for it to change color so it is not very useful for its intended purpose. as a toy, it is not great since it doesn't quack and is kind of hard plastic.	
- 1	The sound quality is terrible and the battery life is tragic. If I don't bring the plug in everywhere, I lose battery. It picks up alot of static and any cell phone within 10 feet causes feedback. I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.	
1. 	It works well for our Sorelle Rosa crib which has relatively thin bars and hidden hardware.  The covers are a couple inches short for the length of the crib but this works well since cribs with hidden hardware also have bars flush against both ends of the length that would have made it hard to pinch off the last bits of velcro.  Note that the velcro attachment extends the full length of the teether cover.Also worth noting is that the material can be bunched up for the attachment of a cozy crib tent.  This takes out the extra length provided in the attachment strips of the tent while giving a bit more volume to teether cover.  It looks seamless to the casual observer.We're still waiting for the baby but the product looks quite durable and the initial wash didn't cause any pilling.	
- 1	Perhaps our door jamb is non-standard (with &#34;rounded&#34; edges on one side), but the clip would not prevent the door from opening when applying repeated, mild force (as a toddler would).  If you purchase this, test it profusely, and make sure the clip does not become disengaged.  It could be that this product is just not compatible with some door jambs.  We returned it to Amazon.	
1. 	These plugs are nice and tight.  My daughter cannot get them out of the outlets.  I also love the affordable price.  Would definitely recommend to others.	
1. 	I love this product.  Struggled with swaddling using blankets despite the nurses' best efforts to teach me.  First son tended to punch through the blanket, ruining my swaddle attempts.  Converted to this product when he was about 8 weeks old and fell in love with it.  Just had baby number two and this time I brought the swaddler to the hospital: so much easier!  This is now part of our standard gift pack for baby showers for friends.  Indispensable!I'd also like to recommend the Snuza Halo SIDS monitor: something we've used for both babies and so important for safety and peace of mind, check it out.	
1. 	These bibs are awesome. The thin, waterproof fabric cleans up easily and dries quickly. The pouch has saved many outfits... surprisingly can catch and hold a lot of spitups and spills. Definitely much better than the plastic ones.	
1. 	This potty is great. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's one piece so nowhere for the pee to go except inside. I think the only fault is that it's incredibly low to the ground, so although that is great for new learners, once they master the potty training and you just need an extra around the house, it doesn't encourage them to go because it's too short. If you can spend a bit more, the newer model with the inside that comes out ($24.95) is much better in my opinion. HIgher for sure, and actually easier to dump since it has an insert. Make sure never to use bleach in these, though, I ruined the bottom of one of these by letting it sit in a 50% bleach solution, it ate away the smooth bottom.	
1. 	I have twin babies, so I got two of these for them to lay in. The fact that it has a &#34;seat belt&#34; helped them stay put and not slide down. While it would have been nice to have a cover for it, I instead used a thin blanket between the pillow and the baby. The blanket even created less of a hole for the baby to slide through. In the first 3 months, my babies had pretty bad reflux, so they slept in this. It kept them elevated, and cozy (like mommy or daddy had their arms around them). As soon as my babies started being able to roll over on their own, their reflux also improved, so I was able to graduate them to their cribs (one baby likes to roll to her side to sleep, while the other one rolls over onto to her tummy) within less than a week. I never used these as nursing pillows because it's just too big for me (I'm 5 feet), but I'll be taking the pillows out again when my babies start sitting up on their own (to provide a cushion for when they fall over). I would definitely purchase again.	
1. 	Now I know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap. Wish I has been able to see this side-by-side with the cheap ones. If I had this would have been the one I would have bought. This potty seat is well designed, doesn't rock, and is one piece. It's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house. My granddaughter wouldn't sit one the cheap one bought originally but really likes this one. Dry days are coming soon, wish they had these when my kids were at this stage.	
- 1	It is a good drying rack, but you have to take it apart because it gets dirty fast. The white bottom tray often feels with dirty water residue and bacteria can grow in the white tray easily. It you buy this product, make sure you wash it often, at least once a week.	
- 1	Well I actually read from the site that the Diaper Genie was good and bought it.  Well..nope.  Here are the things that stink (no pun intended) about it..1.  You are supposed to be able to twist the dial at the top to seal the diaper up.  At almost every playgroup I go to (and my diaper Genie as well) the top has not sealed the last diaper so when you go to put your new diaper in, you get the wonderful aroma of aged poop.  Lovely!2.  The blade that is supposed to cut the bag so that you can empty the contents has never worked the first time.  You have to sit there and push the button over and over again.  It is pretty silly.3.  The replacement bags are expensive and they have different types for different ages in order to be more complicated.  I guess one has to be picky when it comes to diaper trash bags!4.  All diaper trashcans are going to smell.  Both Diaper Champ and Genie cut down on the smell but you are asking for a miracle if you think you are never going to smell poop in your baby's room.Anyways, after buying the Genie, I bought the champ and I am perfectly happy with it.  Plus it is kind of fun flipping the top to get the diaper in.  (simple pleasures!)	
1. 	These spoons are perfect for babies just starting solids. They are light weight, easy to hold small amounts of pur&eacute;ed food and I love that they are dishwasher safe. The package claims top rack safe, but I have been able to wash them with the rest of the silverware on the bottom.	
1. 	This is the greatest toy.  My 5 month old son will bounce for hours in it and I feel safe because it has a metal frame and it's not attached to the doorway.I only have one complaint...why can't it be portable?????  Nobody makes a portable one, so I have to take it apart and bring it with me when we go out.  If I know that we'll be at someone's house for a few hours, I will make the effort to take it with me.Kelly	
1. 	First off, this is not a high quality product. The shades are however exactly what i needed! They are fairly dark giving my newbie plenty of shade n keeping him from being fried or blinded by the sun. They are a great size compared to other shades. Still not quite big enough to cover the whole window of my suv tho. The price is great! I spent $15 on a set that reteacts. They were way smaller, kept out little sun, and were always falling down. These are way better. I deducted a star for quality and installation. They are very clingy which is awesome AFTER u get them on, not so much when applying them. My husband and i both worked on them and after many resticks, they still have a few bubbles and wrinkles but functionality vs style w 4 kids? Functionality always wins. Also i can roll my windows down completely with no problem. Big plus. All in all, for the price, these are a winner. Glad i purchased them.	
- 1	plastic melts in heat.  These are plastic, if you leave the oven door open for any amount of time the metal pin hinge in the cover conducts the heat from the oven and melts the hinge...	
1. 	Love this crib! Haven't put the babies in it yet, but will soon! They were very easy to set up, and the finished look is beautiful. We are expecting twins any day now, and ordered 2 cribs to sit side by side.None of the pieces were damaged, and we weren't missing ANY parts. I love that they also come with the toddler rail for future use.The only thing (very minor) that I would like to have seen different, is the color of the screws that show on the outside. They are a gold-ish color. If they were white in color, it would've had a slightly more 'finished' look. But that is easy to fix yourself at home if you wanted to :-)It was difficult to order this crib b/c every where I went said it was sold out (the white only) then it would be in stock for 2 days and sold out again. I'm guessing the white is very popular. Finally we got them, and they came in 2 days with PRIME shipping.Overall, a very satisfied customer so far.	
1. 	I love these bibs. They are the best kind I have used so far. They are big and help keep the mess off the little one's clothes. Material is easy to clean and quick drying if you have to rinse it off in the go. I recommend these.	
- 1	I love the bright colors of these mats and the easy of portability as you can just roll them up and stick them in your diaper bag, but I was so disappointed to find that they slide on my table. We have a wood (pine) dining table that is stained with wood stain and the mats slide all over the place. We're hoping we can use these later when our kids our older and understand not to pull on the placemats, but for now, we have to put them aside as the second they go on the table, the bright color attracts their attention and off they go, taking all of the food with them. Oh well.	
1. 	We live in an apartment, so we don't have room for a normal size high chair, so we got this and use it everyday, 3 times a day for my 8 month old. Plus it's great cause when we travel we just unstrap it from the chair, fold it up, and take it with us... which is SUPER easy!! The ONLY thing I would change is the dishwasher safe tray (the white one) would have a better lock on to the tray beneath it cause my son has figured out how to take it off while eating, which is really annoying. Other than that it's amazing and I recommend it.	
- 1	BabyHaven fulfilled this order, and instead of sending the one pictured, they sent the crappier, new Deluxe version, which everyone says does not contain odors.  Unfortunately for me, I ordered this before my baby came and had the box put away in the nursery.  I only discovered the mistake outside the 30 day return period.  Both Amazon and BabyHaven told me tough luck, even though they clearly sent the wrong item and had advertised the older model (which is what I wanted) falsely.  Very disappointed.If anyone wants to know about the version pictured, the older version, it's GREAT.  I ended up having to re-buy that one on Ebay.  Worth every penny, that one.  Baby Trend needs to get its act together and change the design back to the original.	
- 1	I had to return the bundle me because it doesn't fit our Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP 30/30 car seat.  The car seat has side impact protection wings by our baby's head (which I love for the added safety) but it meant that the bundle me didn't fit.  First I tried stretching the back of the bundle me over the side impact wings which made it impossible to fit the 5-point harness straps through the bundle me without interfering with the straps positioning to the point that I thought it was unsafe because the straps had to loop up and around to get through the holes.  Then I tried not putting the bundle me over the impact wings but that left a lot of extra fabric where the baby's head would be, which I thought was a suffocation hazard.  In the end I just wasn't comfortable that my son could be safe in his car seat with the Bundle Me.  I was very disappointed because I thought the Bundle Me would be perfect to keep my winter baby warm through a New England winter.  I got the Kiddipotamus CozyUp Black/Red or BLue/Ivory Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Covers instead because it goes over the top of the car seat only and it worked really well.  My son seemed comfortable with it and I didn't have to worry about anything interfering with how the car seat was designed to work.	
- 1	I clearly got carried away with the hype for all the new things out there to transition a baby to the cup.  Wow when my mom said just use a cup.  I will I'm done with the wired illogical designs.  Time for a cup, use a cup.	
1. 	I own the Original Bundle me and bought the new Urban bundle me for my cousin's baby.  The Original Bundle Me seems to be warmer with the faux sheepskin on the inside instead of the micro-fleece on the inside of the Urban version.  The faux sheepskin seems to be cozier for baby, too.  When it is super cold outside, you have to add your own blankets inside either bundleme, but having the bundle me definitely helps keep the blankets where you put them.One aspect of the Urban version that I liked better is that the nylon exterior of the Urban picks up less debris than the fleece exterior of the Original.  The fleece seems to attract hair, dirt, etc.  The nylon Urban is also rain/water resistant.  The Original fleece one never seemed to get wet even though it doesn't make the claim that it is water resistant.Another point to make is that I bought the Bundle Me Lite for the spring and fall months, but didn't really use it all that much.  Unless you live in an area where the spring and fall months are cool for an extended period of time, I would just stick with the Original or Urban version.  Here I guess the weather goes straight from Summer to Winter!The whole line of BundleMe products is an AMAZING god-send if you have ever had to put a baby into a coat or snowsuit and then tried to put the car seat straps around them.  I can't tell you which one will suit your needs more, just trying to help make your selection process more successful!!  Whichever one you choose will definitely make your life SOOO much easier!This is a link to the Bundle Me Urban:JJ Cole Urban Bundleme Ice	
- 1	I liked this just fine.  It didn't leak much at all, but you can't get replacement straws!!  My kids chewed up the straw and now it's useless and you can't get a replacement straw as far as I can find from Amazon or the SkipHop website.  Buyer beware.	
- 1	The mattress shrunk! I read reviews about some mattresses being too small,  but I ignored them. I figured if it was the wrong size, I could just send it back.  I purchased it in October 2011 & it fit perfectly in the crib. So I thought great, the mattress I received is fine.  The baby started sleeping in the crib in December. By February 2011, the mattress has gotten smaller lengthwise by about 2 inches --especially at the corners. It seems as if the mattress pad & sheets have permanently compressed the foam. Amazon customer service is willing to exchange the mattress or offer a refund if i return it, BUT its going to be way too much of a hassle to find a box that fits it & then lug it to the post office. Boo :(	
- 1	The price should've tipped me off but the corners of fabric totally frayed and torn looking upon opening and the pink was more of a mauve color than what pictured. Returned item	
- 1	This says it fits all prince lionheart warmers. Not true, I had to return it and purchase another model which then fit	
- 1	This sippy cup is so close to being perfect.  My son is 1 and really likes straw cups.  We live in Phoenix and really need an insulated cup for outings.  Finding a good insulated straw cup has proven to be impossible.  This cup does have a lot of great features: removable handles, cover, and stainless steel with a rubber sleeve make it awesome for little hands and keeping beverages cold.  However there is one huge downfall.  The valve you use for the straw attachment is NOT leak proof.  The straw valve is completely open and only serves to attach the straw to the top of the cup.  If the cup gets tossed, like ours do frequently, the straw will leak lots of fluid.  This cup would be perfect if the straw was able to attach to the sippy valve (which is leak proof, unless shaken upside down) AND to the open straw valve.  It would then be the perfect cup for all ages.  Leak proof sippy with some fluid restriction for younger kids(if your kid is like mine, if he gets too much in his mouth, like he does with this cup with the straw valve, anything extra gets spit out.  Which equals spit out milk all over the place.)  For older kids the wide open straw valve is perfect - wide open straw cup with out any fluid restrictions for those that know not to throw the cup :)  I really really hope they make a spill proof valve for the straw.  Regardless my son totally loves this cup - even in sippy mode since we're not at the point of using the straw without it leaking like crazy.UPDATE:  At first I thought the sippy valve was leak proof.  Wrong.  We used it in the stroller the other day and it wasn't upright the entire time - it spent some time on its side - and we ended up with wet pants and a wet stroller.  So disappointed! It seems that if the cup is on it's side that any tiny movement will case drops of liquid to come out.  A few drops I wouldn't have a problem with.  But this leaked so bad our stroller was totally wet and my sons pants were soaked.  At this point I'm going to stick with playtex insulated straw cups.  While they are plastic and don't keep beverages as cold they don't leak for us EVER.  I'd rather bring a little cooler pack than deal with milk all over my son, car, stroller, etc.	
- 1	It arrived broken.  Total waste of time. We also tried the portable model.  It stopped working after 2 weeks.  If I could I would give -5 stars for both models.	
1. 	Nice quality toys -- I liked them so much I purchased all of the fruits/veggies in this series.  Carrot and bean work well for teething (although daughter favors her plastic teethers over these); tomato and mushroom are too large for little mouths to get around them.  I like that we can use these to teach my daughter about vegetables as she gets older.  We had to keep the wooden crate separately for a while because she would throw it around, but at 1 year now she can play with it safely and really enjoys taking the veggies out of the crate.	
1. 	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie....and we definitely prefer our Champ!  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.  Only problem...it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.	
1. 	I use these with evenflo, dr. browns and medela. They work well. No fuss over the lids and the little poker chip thing.	
- 1	What a weird shape. The edges don't lay flat so wearing them in my bra is not my favorite look...they look like hockey pucks. I also have pretty small breasts, even for a nursing mom, so you would think the pads would always be in place but no. Often I have to rearrange the pad to cover my nipple during letdown and if I forget the milk soaks one side of the pad so thoroughly it leaks through. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.	
1. 	Okay, so I'm pretty sure that they could make breast shields out of rainbows and sunshine and I would still hate pumping.  That being said, I did find these shields more comfortable than the hard plastic shields.  I could create a better seal with it around my breast which led me to be able to pump a little more and a little more efficiently.  I was getting an extra ounce or so per pumping session (and considering I would get 2 oz or so with the other breast shields, was a HUGE improvement).  If you are having trouble, I would definitely say give these a try.	
1. 	This diaper stacker is a good product, but is smaller in length than the picture shows. Overall we are pleased but probably wouldn't buy again.	
- 1	I bought this thinking it would be easier than the hand nasal aspirator but it is not.  You have to use both hands to hold it so cannot hold baby with the other hand, making it much harder to use.  Mucus can and has gone into my mouth so pretty awful to use.  Would not recommend.	
- 1	leaks, was a pain to wash since the straw was always dirty. i have the playtex ones that work much better and doesn't leak.	
1. 	I love this diaper bag because of all of the compartments.  Within the main compartment there are two pockets to hold diapers, bibs, clothes, or wipes (at least that's what we use it for) and the outside has multiple pocket possibilities as well.  We can carry just about everything we need or could want to have with us when we go out with our little one.  I like to be prepared, so we have usually have in the bag: 4 diapers, a container of wipes, a bib or two, Infant Tylenol, Mylicon, a change of clothes, a bottle, formula in a small dispenser, baby food, a spoon or two, insurance cards, a booklet from the pediatrician, immunization records, & my wallet, chapstick, and cell phone.  My husband teases that ew could go camping with what I carry in my purse, but I always have whatever it is that he needs...  I also really like the zippered bag included for dirty/wet clothes--nothing else get contaminated and it's easy to wipe out.  The padded changing mat with zippered pockets is great too.  I keep diaper cream in one of the pockets (they unfold so baby doesn't lay on them when being changed).	
1. 	I used this product a lot when breastfeeding in public. It's very discreet and it has a very good size (not too big, not too small). The fabric quality is excellent and I like the fact that I could secure it behind my neck very easily so it wouldn't fall and I could still see my baby's face while nursing. Besides using it as a nursing cover up I used it as a sun shade all the time. It was very easy to secure it to the infant car seat canopy.	
1. 	MADE OF GOOD QUALITY, VERY SECURE FOR AN ACTIVE BABY TO ENSURE THEY CAN'T CLIMB OUT! COMES WITH A HANDY TRAY	
1. 	I only use AVENT brand bottles for my babies so I absolutely need this when washing the bottles by hand. It's a necessity and it lasts until my baby gets out of the bottle stage.	
- 1	I love the features on this mirror, but unfortunately they don't work.  I ordered two of these because of all of the great reviews, so I'm really surprised at the low quality of this product. :(1- The mirror makes the baby look too far away, so I can't even see if his eyes are open or not.  It just shows a little pea head really far away!  Not too helpful.2- I returned one of these because the remote didn't work, and when I got the replacement, I accidentally dropped the remote on the floor once, and now it doesn't work either. Unfortunately the features don't work without it, either.3- The light is a great idea, but is nowhere near bright enough to light the baby. Unfortunately neither I or my husband are handy enough to replace the bulb with LED lights, like the other reviewer!Unfortunately, I have thrown away all the packaging so I can't return these products now, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.	
- 1	Although the bug is cute, my daughter really wasn't into it. She started out with the Eric Carle ladybug that is similar overall, but she preferred the ladybug to the bug. My daughter from 1 month now to 9 months, just chucks this toy aside in preference for more interesting toys.	
- 1	Couldn't use this because even the 0-6 is gigantic. Ended up donating it to Goodwill because our baby's head didn't fit into it until it was too warm to wear.	
1. 	My baby loved a tight swaddle - something I could never do with a blanket.  This made it so easy, especially after middle of the night diaper changes.  It's very soft and easy to wash.  Makes so much sense!	
- 1	This screen worked for about a week and then all of a sudden stopped sticking.  I've tried cleaning the windows, cleaning the suction cups, wetting the suction cups, and I put it on 2 different windows.  I had it stretching on a big window and then loose on a small window and it still falls off.  Worst product ever.	
1. 	This swing was great when my daughter was an infant.  She has since outgrown it.  It is one of the few swings that gives you the option of swinging from front to back or side to side.  My daughter was facinated with the fish mobile and would always let me know when they stopped - unless she fell alseep first.  She was a fan of the ocean sounds, but there are others to choose from.As far as the problems with the sound, that only happened for me when I needed to replace the batteries.  With new batteries, it works great.The speed - I thought the faster setting would be to much for my baby until I saw her in a swing at daycare.  She was swinging on high speed and loving it.  I started using the faster setting at home after that.The only complaint I have is that the sounds do not play long enough.  But, you will find that no item play long enough when you have a fussy baby that is right on the edge of falling alseep when the music stops.	
1. 	This gate is extremely easy to install using the pressure-mounted method, opens easily, and latches firmly when the gate swings closed. Most importantly, our cat can't jump over it!!!!!!!!! Hooray! My only issue with it is that it doesn't have a stay open feature (that we can tell). This is a pain for us because we really only want it closed at certain times of the day and the rest of the time we would prefer it to stay open. We have employed chains, ribbons, sticks, etc to keep it open.	
1. 	We will be buying a second for our other carseat. The price can't be beat and it weathered the trip to Alaska, around Alaska and back. It fits our Britax Marathon easy. (Other bags are a stretch to house the Marathon.)This has nothing to do with the quality of the bag, but I do wish it was in stock more often. The two times I have come here to order it, it is out of stock. Last time I ended up ordering it from a different vendor and paying more plus paying for shipping. Please Amazon - get this in stock before the holidays!	
1. 	We tried a wide variety of bottles, some were gifts, some we just picked up to try. The baby seemed to prefer these so we ended up getting rid of the one-offs and stocking up on these. They do seem to be very well designed and from the looks of things, I can see why babies like them, they look like they are comfortable to suck on.I've knocked off a star because they are a bit of a pain to clean. Sure, we use the dishwasher, but these things break down into 5 parts with all the rubber seals. Plus my hands always end up covered in milk when I'm breaking them down. I understand the reason for the bottom cap and seal, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant to deal with. In some ways I kind of wish the baby had preferred one of the brands that only broke into 3 parts for cleaning!Edit: A couple other things, our baby breastfed and we used these to feed breast milk when mom wasn't available. I'm not sure if that played a part in the baby's preference. The other thing is that they carry these at our local Target so it is easy to get additional accessories including additional nipples with different flow rates. Of course you can order them at Amazon, but sometimes it is nice to have local access to stuff as well.	
1. 	Easy to install and works great for the price. Keeps my dogs at bay and my baby safe. I hate the bar on the bottom though and the opening is pretty skinny.	
1. 	what more can i say i like this idea. even my grandmother and aunt in laws are so amazed with these snack catcher. they said they haven't seen one before. this works great on the go, when we're in a hurry to leave i can just pour in snack and my son get occupied eating while traveling in the car. it prevents mess but not 100% unless you teach your toddler not to put their hand in the snack catcher and take the snack out. i told my son just get enough food you can put in your mouth at a time. then this snack catcher has served its purpose well. i'm happy with this purchase i have another baby and she's starting to learn to use this. glad there's two of them.	
1. 	This toy keeps my 8-month-old daughter entertained.  She seems to like all the sides, as she flips it around and plays with each one.  It's portable and quiet enough.  I wish there were more toys of this variety.	
1. 	I love this sheet!  I have 4 of them (2 for each child). It is super absorbent and stays in place! They are great for potty training accidents and for one unfortunate night with the stomach flu.  I used to wrestle with matress when changing the sheets but not anymore.  I have the pretty sheet that matches the bedding on the bottom and the crib sheet on top.  Now if there is a middle-of-the-night accident I just unsnap the cirb sheet, pull it off, and put a clean one in its place.  This is one a the gifts that I give at all baby showers because I think no Mom should be without at least 2 of these (you need a spare!)	
1. 	My little one is 6 months old now.  We've been using this tub in the sink since he was a few weeks old.  He loves his bathtime!  My only complaint is that the small pad at the toddler end of the tub fell off.  We just used some goo gone to remove the remaining glue and he seems to be fine without it.  We'll soon be moving it from kitchen sink to tub as he is now learning splashing is fun.  :o)	
- 1	The material seems to make my skin itch around my breasts. I've never encountered a reaction quite like this before to any materials. Perhaps my breasts have just become sensitive since I've given birth and started pumping/feeding, but I every time I use this bra, I get itchy breasts and red marks; especially on the underside. I'll try re-washing it.	
1. 	This is a perfect fit for all changing dressers, soft under baby's body, is well made, cleans up easy and last.	
- 1	Good stroller set, but reclining the stroller seat to put the carseat was a pain. This was not worth the pain for me as we live in the northwest where it rains alot.  I am stuck outside in the rain trying to recline the stroller seat to attach the car seat.	
1. 	Beautiful bright colors and covers a  large area for kids or pets. Also purchased one with a gate opening and would order that style over this one next time.	
- 1	Everybody I know loves these, but I hate them. They aren't very stretchy. They are hard to get fastened to the diaper correctly. I switched to old fashioned &#34;safety pins&#34; instead. Maybe I wasn't using them correctly? Like I said, I'm the only one I know who doesn't like these so I'm sure it's a good product, but not for everyone (or at least me). Lol	
1. 	We have both this and the ones with the straw for my kid.  She seems to like this more so we keep getting this one.  It does drip a little but doesn't flip you in the eye like the straw ones.  Note that when you put cold fluids in this they will leak out due to expansion of the air as they warm up if your kid isn't using it.  FYI	
1. 	Love this rattle. Our daughter loves it so much I ordered this as a back up. She is able to hang on to it, spin it, and use it as a teether.	
1. 	This product is doing what it is supposed to do--protect my leather car seats!  BUT, the top half and the bottom half are two slightly different colors.  They aren't quite tan--one piece is actually sort of gray.  (I think it is the bottom...I can't remember)  I actually returned the first one I received because it was so obviously mismatched; I thought it was a packaging error.  But after checking the same product at a local baby store, it became obvious it was just the way the manufacturer made it.  A bit weird, if you ask me.  But better than the actual gray one.So, if having it be two different colors doesn't bother you, go for it.  It works well.The only thing I wish were different is that the back piece could be taller.  It doesn't cover the entire back of the seat, so our Britax Marathon digs into the car's upholstery a bit.	
- 1	I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom, but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up.  It drives me crazy!  I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me, but the latch just doesn't keep.	
- 1	I was hopeful, even after reading some of the negative reviews - however, this just didn't cut it for our needs. I'm not upset by the purchase (it's not that expensive) but I'll probably never use it again.I got this strap in hopes to avoid bringing a stroller (save space), but also enable us to use my 15 month old's car seat once we reached our destination.  To put it plainly, we only used the strap for 1/4 of our airport adventures  :-(First, even after reading other reviews, we intended to use the strap to transport our daughter from the car to the gate. Meaning, I needed to attach the car seat to our carry-on, not larger luggage, which was not recommended by other reviewers.  I should also mention that my daughter is still a lap child, so I never intended to use the car seat on the plane.My daughter LOVED riding in her seat around our house and through the airport... BUT, after we strolled her from car to check in, detached and reattached for security and were 1/2 way to our gate I noticed that the wheels of our small carry-on luggage were vibrating badly & had become very hot!  Issues on our end: we have relatively cheap luggage, a heavy toddler (35 lbs) and I walk very fast... that being said, the wheels on our carry-on may be ruined after using this for only a short time.  We did not reattach the car seat to the carry-on after we landed or for our return flight.  (The strap did end up making a nice handle, and keeping the LATCH straps out of my way when I attached everything around the front... but not the intended use)Helpful hints from other reviews: Practicing attaching and detaching well before your trip  (It's difficult, but not impossible... don't plan on using this if you're on your own with a child - she would have wondered away by the time I got it all back together).  Having your luggage packed FULL is also a must for a secure fit.In the end, would I recommend this to a friend??  Ultimately it depends on their needs - but probably not.  If you are planning to use it with very sturdy luggage and / or a very light child - it might not be so bad.  If you are a casual traveler like myself - either check the car seat and figure out how to carry your child through the airport or get a different product. Yes this is a cheap alternative, but in the end we may end up with new luggage because of it.	
- 1	Our Summer Infant Best View (no longer in production) finally stopped working.  We had a tough time finding a replacement product that had all of the same features we loved: good range, quality picture in both light and dark, remote pan, portable handheld monitor, and good parent reviews were a few of our top priorities.  The description of the Graco True Focus, along with the price and reviews seemed to fit the bill with the one exception of remote pan, which we could live without to save the extra $70 it would cost to get that feature on another model.Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations and we ended up returning it.  The biggest drawbacks for us were the night vision picture, and the limited range, which came in nowhere close to the claims on the box and the website.  After having other video monitors work well in our house - both our Summer monitor as well as visiting friends' other brands, we were very disappointed at the constant Linking error that would come up regularly when we were a mere 50 feet away (again, nowhere close to the 1000 ft claim on the box).Pros:- Price for the features claimed- Daytime picture clearer than other video monitors I've seenCons:- Effective range of less than 50 ft. compared with well over 200-300 feet with other monitors (we were able to walk a few houses away with the old monitor, and still have a reliable signal)- Night vision picture required constant fiddling with brightness settings - sometimes appeared to just be a big white screen, with little definition of what was on camera.  I could have lived with this if the range had lived up to claims.Luckily Amazon took the return after we tried it out for a little over a week - desperately hoping that it would somehow begin to link more consistently.  We definitely wanted it to live up to expectations, but unfortunately it did not.	
- 1	I'm sad to say that I am not impressed with the performance of this cup. I have been using two of these cups pretty exclusively for over a week and they both leak. If they stay upright and never get thrown about they are great, however, little hands tend to drop or even throw down objects, and when that happens all bets are off. I have been wiping up milk and water off the floor, off hands, and off the table and I am pretty close to retiring these guys (or using them exclusively for water). Honestly, its a shame because these are super cute cups, a good design as far as drinking goes, and they are insulated.	
1. 	This has been a life saver with our newborn who is very specific about what kind of white noise she likes if she's fussy. We keep this larger one attached to her crib so that when we lay her down in the crib we can flick this on to one of the sound settings and let it play for 23 or 45 mins, we always leave it on 45 minutes to play the longest it can. Four sounds come with the giraffe (which looks so cute in her safari themed nursery).Sleep - sounds like rushing water.Relax - Bubbling stream with occasional quiet nature sounds like tweeting birds.Calm - Slightly louder nature sounds like insects, birds tweeting and an occasional growl over low quiet drum beats.Play - More rapid fun drum beat with some jazzy insect noises and a ribbiting frog.It's very cute and effective, we switch between sleep and relax when she's napping and I know as she gets older the Calm and Play sounds will be fun for her! I also love that it attaches securely to the outside of the crib with a very strong velcro strap!	
1. 	My daughter is now 16 months, have had this since day 1. I love the contoured pad, very comfortable for baby and mom. Straps are very helpful, although they can be difficult to access if you have a changer cover on. Contoured edge makes it very easy to keep the baby in place. Holds its shape incredibly well; virtually no wear on it after 16 months of use.	
- 1	we love this brand but these are bottles with MEDIUM flow nipples and are not suitable to newborns. they also require drop in liners by ziploc that are not sold in stores.	
1. 	I love this!  It is the only thing that helped my baby learn to sleep at night.  Fisher price is a wonderful company also.  After I was done using this  put it in storage where the seat padding and headrest got damaged.  I was able to buy a replacement for only $12 so thankful for that and that I did not have to buy a brand new one for baby number 2!	
- 1	May end up returning. Battery only lasted about 20 minutes the first time we unplugged it after being plugged in about 36 hours. The sound and picture are kinda weird too. We also don't like that it shuts off the video after 4 minutes when run on battery. It still has sound, but you have to push a button to get the video back for another 4 minutes. We bought this because we needed a second monitor for the new baby and liked the idea of the pan/tilt from the parent control. The pan/tilt is great. We really like that. I wish that the Infant Optics monitor had that option. We have the Infant Optics DXR-5 for our other kid and prefer that one over this. If we return it, we will get a second Infant Optics and just have to have 2 hand consoles to watch each kid in their rooms so that we can have constant coverage of both rooms.	
- 1	I am surprised at how bad this protection is! I only washed it twice in the washing machine when i realized it had teared on the sides. I washed it on gentle cycle.I bought sealy since i am used to the brand, but this time it was really a let down.	
1. 	it is very useful, i took it outside when my girl and me went outside, i put the diasper inside and throw away, very feasible and clean.	
1. 	I have to be honest. I bought these in yellow because they were cheaper than the others.  I am glad I did. They stand out against the hangers and clothes so I can see them.  I am thinking about buying another set because we have a closet organizer and I had to pick which racks I could use them.  Good problem to have.	
- 1	The item was cute, which is why I purchased it but I was sooo close to just returning it. I followed people's reviews and went up a size (to the 3-6 months) even though I have a 2 month old. I'm glad I did, this DOES fit him, but the sleeves were super wide in comparison to the rest of the item and yet somehow it was difficult to put on my baby. Maybe I'm just used to Carters and other brands of baby clothes that seem to slip easily over baby's head and allow easy insertion of arms etc... but this was a struggle. By the time I got it on my baby he was so fussy... and like I said, I wasn't that thrilled with the fit, the arms are huge in comparison to the rest of the outfit. My boyfriend came out and saw him in it and asked why we had dressed our son like a monk...	
1. 	I was going to buy a few Avent disposable bottles for travel, but having to buy separate nipples made it a waste of money.  Then Avent came out with these!I like how you can use the regular nipples and these are cheap enough you can just toss them (especially great when you find it two weeks later until the seat).  :c)Also get the extra refill pack.  You can use these all of the time.  I also have the regular bottles, too, for home.	
1. 	Works great. Does it's job. Fits into the wall just fine. Snug enough that my daughter can't pull it off herself, but not too snug that I can't pull it off when I need to use that outlet.	
1. 	This seems like it may be unnecessary but they truly are a great baby tool. I found that nose suckers only work when there is congestion and moisture but usually my baby just woke up with boogies. These made it much easier to keep her comfortable and clean. the tips are rounded so your little one doesn't get poked. It is also more sanitary as you can quickly wash them with soap or alcohol. good quality, good tool.	
- 1	After reading the good reviews, I decided to try these. My first complaint is that you can't write on the tab with a regular pen. You need a sharpie. Then a handful (10 or so) bags leaked on me. It can be pretty uspetting, even though I know it's probably some temporary snafu in the production. I threw those out and finished the box. I won't be using these again. Going back to Lansinoh, which are medical grade and sterile.	
- 1	Honestly, I can't speak to how well these hold up over time or whether they leak, because we only used them once. They're a pain to put together, but that isn't the main problem. They are ridiculously hard to drink out of. My husband and I both tried it and we can get liquid out of it, but it's difficult and makes drinking unpleasant. They're going to go straight in the trash.	
- 1	First i thought i was getting 16 cases. But from reading the reviews i came to understand i was getting 12 hard cases. I then found the one honest review from a few days ago, too little too late. I have just received my case- 1 hard sided case, i was expecting 12 or even 16. On top of that it took a long time to arrive. very disappointed.	
- 1	quality is not good, it had a little hole on it and I just unpacked in the the bathroom and use it right it way there.	
- 1	These are by far and away the worst baby wipes I have ever encountered.  The baby poop smells better than the wipe.  It's nauseating.  And, they are thin and kind of dry, but that would be fine if there smell weren't so awful.  I'm getting a sense from the other reviews that this might be a cilantro type thing-doesn't bother most people but some may just have a terrible reaction.	
- 1	I really wanted to like this bottle. Customer service was great they emailed me twice or more about how to use the bottle which is why I put an extra star but no matter how many time I follow the instruction the bottle leaked. I love the idea of how they want the bottle to be used but it leak. Leaking my breastmilk is a no no in my book, and the bottom piece I have no idea why it's even there it just falls off.  I think maybe they need a liner like the plastic circle things blenders have at the bottom so they won't leak, or something. My problem with it is that it leaks A lot.	
1. 	I bought one for my daughter and myself since I watch my grandchild a lot.  We love this booster seat!  The reviews for booster seat products helped a lot in making my choice.  It's great for parents without a lot of room for a regular highchair and for grandparents who need to store a highchair when not in use.  No tools are required to assemble, the booster height is adjustable and it sits securely on our dining chairs.  I like that the trays are dishwasher safe.  When he no longer needs the highchair it's still a great booster for sitting at the table.  We've had no trouble with the way the tray attaches or detaches as I've read in some of the reviews and we feel he sits safe and secure in the seat.	
1. 	best bottles for your money these old school bottles are not expensive and work better than plastic all the time	
1. 	Love them. I use these when I have to pump a bottle for travel. They are handy, easy to use and I love that you use them and then toss them right in the trash. Good price for the amount.	
- 1	Very sharp and too much hassle. Can be taken off by couple month old baby (thereby becoming dangerous). I prefer to stick with plain prefolds in BumGenius diapers or with All-in-ones.	
1. 	We love this on the go bottle warmer.  All you do is bend a small piece of metal within the plastic bag filled with fluid, and a reaction hardens the fluid and it becomes warm.  To use again just boil the bag for 15 minutes and use it over and over again.  I am giving it a 4 star rating because it isn't easy to find additional warming bags. We found Dex Products has a similar warming bag at diapers.com, but haven't purchased it yet.	
- 1	The item was packaged very poorly. They fold the hat in four and stuffed in an envelop. Since it's a fome-board like material, it never bent back like it shown in the picture. You get what you paid for.	
1. 	I was very hesitant to spend $53 on a pillow but once I decided to buy it, it has made all the difference!  I've now had it since last September and I still use it every day!  Once I found out I was pregnant, I tried to transition from a back/stomach sleeper to a side sleeper and I had a VERY hard time.  I couldn't get into a deep sleep at all.  With the snoogle, my head rests comfortably on the C end and I put the J end between my legs.  My hands usually end up hugging the pillow and I switch off on sleeping on my right and left sides.  Since I use it every day, it has gotten flatter over time, but it still works and I start my 39th week tomorrow!  My only critique is that its difficult to turn from side to side during the night.  Still, it has been the best financial investment during my pregnancy!	
1. 	&#34;Take and toss&#34; sums it up perfectly -- these are perfect for toddlers who are more interested in tool use than actually eating, and more to the point, toddlers who count &#34;spear throwing&#34; as &#34;tool use&#34;!PROS* Bumpy, squeezy handles make for easy gripping* Fun, mix-and-match colors* Good valueCONS* For actually coming into contact with food, the softish plastic concerns me somewhat. I will NOT be giving these to my toddler to use with warm foods or even for regular meals. Instead, I'm reserving them for picnics/outings and this specific stage at which she's just playing with her food (not much eating it).	
1. 	My child actually likes sitting on this so I assume it's comfortable. Haven't personally tried it myself! Easy to dump and keep clean so it's a winner in our book.	
1. 	These were perfect for me when I first started pumping, however, after a week to two I was pumping more than these bottles could hold. They were great for feeding my babe when he was first home and only eating small amounts.	
1. 	These worked perfectly in my son's car to block the sun from their new baby's face and is still being used because we got another grandbaby at the end of last year. Very easy to use and are effective.	
- 1	This product is easier to use than the miracle blanket, but unfortunately also easy for the baby to break out of. She was napping in it once and I found her with it up around her nose & mouth, which was a bit alarming. We stopped using it after that and stuck with the miracle blankets. That being said, this is probably fine for a very young baby who can't break out of it, or fine if you are watching the baby constantly (e.g. if they are napping in a swing in the living room).	
- 1	I guess you get what you pay for, but I was hoping this would be a little nicer.  It comes with a lot of accessories, but it is soo cheap!  I worried that it wouldn't hold up.  In my opinion it's worth it to spend a little more and have something that will last.	
- 1	These bibs only lasted me a month or two.  The &#34;loop&#34; side of the velcro wore out completely, and now the bibs won't stay on.  Unfortunately, the &#34;hook&#34; side still works, and sticks to EVERYTHING in the laundry....tearing at the stitching of other clothes.  Don't waste your money here.  Get some with snaps or velcro that will last!	
- 1	The pros: easy to transport, decent size (holds 2-3 days of diapers), nice print that hasn't fadedBUT...there has got to be something better out there for cloth diapers!Please go and look at the washing instructions on their website:[...]Please note that you are not supposed to wash this wet bag with your diapers (unless of course you wash your diapers on warm/cold setting which would be unsanitary.)You should not use a high speed washer on a vigorous spin cycle.Also, water pools in the bag and has to drip out. As their site states, You can squeeze the water out. You may want to wash the bag again, as dirty water could have been trapped inside and may cause odors, as well.The website says that it can tumble dry on low heat. During the first couple of months I line-dried the wet bag. I tried to dry this in the drier, on low, once. It became misshapen and has never been the same since.Lastly, the attitude on their washing instructions page is very 'self-centered', reminding the reader at least seven times of the situations when warranty does not cover and when they are not responsible. Although they must view this as necessary, this makes me uncomfortable to buy their products again.It is probable that since I do cloth diapering I would like to conserve as much energy as possible. Washing a wet bag, twice, in a load by itself in lukewarm water is not what I think of as ideal when I am already doing many loads of diapers	
1. 	This sheet fits my travel basinett's mattress perfectly. I know other's have claimed that it is too small, but it is supposed to be snug.  The material is thin and was a bit scratchy before washing, but we are several washes in, and it has held up great.  We have several....I just wish thee were more color options.	
- 1	I bought this in Nitron (orange) and absolutely loved the color and look of the car seat.  It was affordable, plus the added benefit of being able to use this seat for quite some time with my son was appealing.  But we were highly disappointed when we received the seat and returned it.The bad:- Plastic is thin and cheap feeling all over.  The base, the harness latch, recline lever, etc is all plastic and feels cheap like it could break at any time.  I honestly would not trust it in a serious car wreck.-Seat fabric is a little rougher than I expected and not padded very well.-We had it fully reclined and my 4 month old was still slumped over in the seat.  It looked so uncomfortable and we could not get him in the right position no matter what we did.-Yes, it's large but we already knew that before buying it which didn't bother us too much.-My car seat was shipped directly from the manufacturer (Cosco/Safety 1st)...it arrived in the box without any cushioning or plastic wrap over the main body of it...plus the box was crushed on one side.  Very disappointing to receive the car seat in this manner.The good:-Great concept, design, and colors...just poor manufacturing.-Harness was easy to buckle my son in.-Fit fine in our extended cab truckI would suggest seeing the variety of car seats in person at a store...touching and feeling them to make sure it is of the standard you want your child to be in.  In my opinion, the affordable price is not worth the risk of being in a poor quality car seat during a wreck.  There are better options out there.	
- 1	i bought this product expecting that it would have an option to keep the gate open when you go in and out of a room quickly, instead it swings shut immediately and you have to use both hands to open the gate again. for that reason i wouldn't buy this product again.	
1. 	sturdy, good quality, nice design. Buyer be aware that it is kind of short, not tall enough for my 3-yr to watch her hands in the bathroom sink, , but good for getting on the toilet to potty.	
1. 	At first my 7 month old could not initiate the vibrating on her own. However after only a day or two she figured it out and seems to enjoy it but still seems to prefer Sophie over anything else. Actually her favorite thing to chew on (she's just now getting her first tooth) is my little coach wallet- I guess she likes the leather or something but she is quite obsessed with it! This massaging teether does keep her busy in the car seat though.	
- 1	Good concept but since it doesn't work on many surfaces, it was hard for us to use this when we're at restaurants. It was hard to unroll as well.  Well you could unroll but it just doesn't stay unrolled, which just makes it easy for kids to peel off.	
1. 	Just absolutely awesome--I love the choice of three different colors and the stars across the ceiling are such a cool, mellow way to see at night.  I spent weeks shopping for a night light and ended up with this turtle instead--I am so glad!  I would completely recommend this for parents, little kids and big kids too! (And easily portable, too!)	
- 1	Thin, poor stitching, not big enough to swaddle. Buy gerber instead. Cute colors but not worth it. Gerber blankets seem to be the best in it's price class.	
- 1	After trying many bum genius diapers I have decided the elemental is my favorite. With the freetime considering the attached flaps... The washer couldn't clean it well enough and it started a urine smell build up. My washer had a hard time agitating the diaper so it never seemed as clean as other diapers.also 4.0 dries faster since the insert is removable.	
- 1	This is a good idea but there are two things I didn't like about this and was the reason I returned it. First is the water reservoir. There is no way to tell if its clean. I'm sure I can clean it every so often with vinegar but its just not good enough. I have to be able to see for myself if there is possible mold or hard water deposit forming and there is no way to tell because you can't see inside it. Second issue is that there is so much water used during the cooking process. I used it to cook butternut squash. I followed the amount your suppose to use for it and seemed like the squash was being boiled in a lot of water. I don't like that the food was this watered down and yes I can pour the excess water out before pureeing but all the nutrients will be lost in the cooking water. Plus, I want to be in control of how much liquid goes into the baby food. I'm just going to buy a small processor and use my steamer and then transfer. Its just one extra step and I feel better about the food i'm giving my baby.	
1. 	These food cube trays have worked well for my family.  We have a few different varieties and these trays are the ones I always use first.  Easy to use, convenient lid, easy to transfer cold food cubes to ziploc storage bag.	
1. 	I wish I had gotten these sooner! I have 2 children both under age 3 and these have been wonderful! I ended up spending lots of time and money trying to clean my fabric seats. Between bottles and sippys leaking or being dropped and snacks being lost I had my work cut out for me. Since installing these under the carseats clean up has been quick and easy. They also protect my seats from the indents caused by carseats. The pockets on the front have come in handy for storing smaller items that we carry in the car, like kleenex packs and headphones.These are well worth the money spent.

1. 	LOVE this brand, really the whole line is great- the style is so refreshing no goofy cartoony stuff! Quality, softness, size, style are all A+ in my book.  These receiving blankets are also swaddles, and can triple as a lightweight stroller blanket, many uses for them- I have 4 different colors!	
1. 	The best travel solution if you don't want to bring a whole bunch of little baby brushes. My son loved it! The only trouble we had was that he'd occasionally bite my finger but that has nothing to do with the product ;)	
1. 	i bought the Safari Open Top Take Along Swing when my baby was born because the price was cheaper. i didn't take into consideration about the entertainment. so, my baby didn't like sitting in that swing. so now i bought this aquarium swing and my 12 weeks old baby loves to be in there. it's very expensive so i thought about it many times before i actually bought it.  she looks and coos to the toys, lights and music. she stays so calm in the swing for more than half an hour. the only draw back is the music doesn't last long. i have to reset it every few minutes.	
- 1	really want to like it since we desperately need a good bottle warmer, but this one unfortunately is not good.the switch is on the back!! terrible design if u ask me.power is turned back on if u forget to turn off the switch. and the problem is that you cannot tell since power does turn off for a while, and u can easily forget to turn off the switch. quite a few times the switch was left on and water was boiled dry. we were very lucky that nothing happened but it could happen!!my mom, my husbband and i hate this product; and we'd rather just put bottles in a bowl of hot water.Very disappointed with this product, and also it is priced too high. there is no advanced technology with this product at all.	
- 1	I was disappointed in the quality of this changing pad. It is made of very thin, flimsy material - definitely not &#34;ultra plush&#34;. It also fits my standard size contoured changing pad loosely, making it look unattractive as well due to the loose material. Not what I was expecting at all from the description and great reviews of this item.	
1. 	This toy is so pretty!  Even I like to sit and listen to the music with my baby :) My only complaint is that it is too loud.  I got it when my baby was about 3 months old and he was scared of it's lound music at first.  But now at almost seven months he really enjoys it.  I have to put it against the couch though becauce it slide on the carpet and he falls when he holds on to it for support.	
1. 	Hang this above your changing table and watch your baby transform from fussy to totally calm. This awesome mobile is the finest I've ever encountered. Keeps baby engaged and stimulated. After watching the power this mobile has over diaper change disasters, I purchased a second one to hang over the play yard. My twins love it!Tip: Think twice before hanging this over the crib. It's stimulating for babies; thus, they might have problems falling asleep with this above their heads. I've found it's far more suitable for awake time.	
1. 	I ended up purchasing the Safer Bather when our daugther was born. It was super soft and worked well in the sink.  However as she grew it seemed as though the Safer Bather quickly became too small. My neighbor had the Sure Comfort NB-to-Toddler tub and the sling feature worked so nicely! Our baby is really long and the sling had more than enough room for her stretch out.But after we didnt need to use the sling the tub itself was lacking for her as she got bigger. She seemed so uncomfortable and proped up in an uncomfortable position.I would still recommend this item just for the sling feature and the tub is designed to sit atop your kitchen sink which also makes for easy fill/empty.	
1. 	These are great. My daughter is teething and she loves a piece of popsicle or watermelon in the bag. I think they are easy to clean as long as you flip it inside out and rinse it right away. Highly recommend!	
- 1	This sound machine has lovely white noise that my baby needs to sleep, and beautiful turning light pictures projected on the ceiling. So after 2 months when the motor burned out and stopped moving the projection, we immediately purchased another one (the first was a gift off amazon, the second was from babies r us). And then, within 2 weeks, the SAME THING HAPPENED. We only even ran the projections at night. After reading up about these machines, this seems to be a common problem. Very disappointed	
- 1	I've had this for 7 months and I totally regret buying this. It stays up for a day or two but will eventually fall down. It also doesn't hold much. I have the Big Foam Letters and Animals from One Step Ahead,Foam Bath Toy Letters and Animals for Kidsand it only holds about half the letters comfortably. If you're looking for something that will hold all your bath toys, this is not it! I had to get another organizer to fit the remaining bath toys we have and now my shower feels cluttered. Also this isn't very convenient to use. Since the opening is narrow you can't use it for bigger toys. It can only be used for small or thin bath toys. If the toys are too wide, it will not fit through the opening. It also makes getting the toys at the bottom very difficult. You have to dig out everything. The cheap white net organizer that came with the foam alphabets stays up much better, holds a lot more and has a wide opening so I don't have to dig everything out!	
- 1	I purchased this Temporal Thermometer as a present for my wife, who is an ER RN is the Los Angeles area. We had been looking for about a week for a dependable and consistent thermometer for our child when I broke down a few days from her birthday and got this.When she saw the device she was pretty unhappy about it as she had been forced for over a week to use these devices at her work, which proved to be more trouble and a larger headache in the institutional setting then they were worth. All of the Temporal Thermometers were tossed into a box and collected up and either most likely returned for a credit or tossed. Time is of the essence.But I was intrigued and opened the package anyway and we experimented and test-ran this thermometer for about a month side by side with another thermometer, theBraun Thermoscan. I saw exactly the same results that she dealt with at her work. Here are some examples of the inconsistency:1. Have a temperature or a fever? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings by more than one-point-five and sometime two-point-five degrees, which is huge.2. Moisture on forehead ... from the fever ...? Error results or repeated inaccurate readings.3. Head angle and forehead shape will dictate whether or not the device will even work.4. Different degrees register on different portions of the same forehead.5. Different degrees register with darker skin(!) That's the first time for that one.Some of the reviews tell you that you need to practice with the device and develop a technique, which is absolutely absurd. What? You're supposed to go around the neighborhood interfering with other parents when their kids are sick to work on your 'technique'? Gimme a break, please. It's a thermometer , it should work and work consistently. Unfortunately it doesn't do what it's supposed to do and therefore Exergen should take this product back to the drawing board and also remove the labeling on the front about how it's the most accurate, which it is very clearly not.I openly suspect a lot of these positive five-star reviews of this product have been placed by people directly related with this company as an ad effort. And coming from a long-time review on Amazon, this kind of thing is more rampant than you might think.Don't buy this, getting your money back will be harder then taking a temp.... ...	
- 1	I bought this & the greenish circle rattle by Sassy as well.  I thought it was a good toy until I noticed mold growing inside of the clear ball!  I yanked it out of my baby's hand - who was biting it.  I did handwash it from time to time (not in the dishwasher) since it's plastic.  I wish Sassy's quality control is better.  I would've exchanged for another, but I also noticed that my little one sometimes would hit her own head with the ball by accident when she waves her hands around while holding the toy.  So I returned it.	
1. 	Hi. Love this sling. Tip: when facing baby out, you can put a bib through the arm holes and have it drape over the top. Easy to change out and give baby a fresh place to drool. We put my son in after he eats. He usually burps and it helps with the acid reflux to have him upright. He enjoys going out for walks in it as he can touch and feel the flowers and objects I bring close to him. Good idea to have an umbrella handy for walks as there is not the shade that strollers provide. It can also turn into a baby OVEN fairly quickly, so I use the stroller when it's warm out. Another tip, when baby is in the sling, I eat or do things in front of a large mirror. It keeps him entertained.	
1. 	I really like this bottle brush. I have gone through a few brands but this is by far my favorite. I do not use the nipple part as my son no longer uses bottles but they are great for his sippy cups and even my cups. Easy to sanitize through the dishwasher. Love this and if I have another child this will definitely be my go to brand.	
1. 	The material is not too soft but I would say safe for a toddler to bite or bump his head on. Its sturdy. Its big but I think choosing an 8 panel yard serve its purpose. More space for the toddler to play on. The parent can stay inside as well and play with the toddler. I think its a great play yard. Good buy!	
1. 	It has the oddest flat little spoon. We never use it. But the rest of this is PERFECT and we use it for on the go meals (when we don't think that we will be eating somewhere healthy enough for our 11 month old) or when they go to grandma's house and stay overnight. Perfect. It fits right inside our LLBean lunchbag and stays nice and cool. The separate containers allow me to heat up what needs to be heated and keep things like fruit cold. Great product. I have NO PROBLEMS with the lids staying on or getting them on and off. I also have no leaking issues. These work great and I get tons of compliments!	
1. 	We purchased this bottle warmer for travel use. We have the full sized Dr. Brown bottle warmer but it's too big to carry along on short trips and vacations.PROS:Inexpensive but not cheap. It's hard to find a functional bottle warmer in this price.Sized perfectly for travel. Great to use in hotels and or if you'll be staying with relatives.It will accommodate wide neck bottles. We had no problem warming Dr. Brown's wide neck 8 oz bottles and Similac's odd shaped bottles.Heats up fast. Average warming time for an 8 oz bottle with 5 oz formula is around 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 minutes depending if it's room temperature or chilled.CONS:Outside of bottles gets really hot to touch. Be careful in lifting your bottles with your bare hands.No built in water reservoir. Water has to be measured and poured with every use.Warmer needs a cool down period of at least 10 minutes with every use. It is not designed to warm multiple bottles.	
- 1	I purchased this item thinking it was BPA and phthalate free but it is not. It's never a good sign when there isn't even a recycling symbol on the item. We're trying to be as plastic free as possible so I returned it same day and plan to buy the Eurobath as a replacement. I will say that Diapers.com was exceptionally nice with the return. They provided a prepaid shipping label within minutes of my phone call to customer service.	
- 1	I have 2 kids, ages 10 months and almost 4. All and all I do like the stroller, I have not used it a ton in the few months I have had it but when I do use it, it works fine. I had a single BOB and the BOB is STROLLER HEAVEN. Phil and teds quality does not even come close to the BOB quality. The BOB is a real rugged, tough, smooth as a dream (with built in suspension), comfy seats, nice hood, nice storage, etc... My friends and I had our BOBs for 4 years (my friend is a exercise nut and a jogger and hiker and uses hers daily). Not once did we have to replace a single tire or anything at all, everything still works and functions like it did the day we bought it. I can already see that the Phil and Ted quality is not going to stand the test of time. Even though the Phil and ted costs more, it is more cheaply made. I wish BOB would make a tandem double!!!!The pros...It fits 2 kids but is the size of a singleI like the rear seat recline, it gets a good enough angle for my baby to nap.I like the foot brake, it is easy to engage and is strong.I like the follow the sun hood (though I prefer an oversized hood that comes all the way down to cover your kid like the BOB.Cons....My kids are large in size, around 95th percentile each, and they fit okay in the stroller (they could have more room, but it is not awful). My oldest's legs and cramped in the front seat, and he would have been too big for the back seat by 1 1/2. My youngest is tall and lean... and his legs in the back are already cramped. But, it is not AWFUL, they could just use more leg room. And I worry my youngest's head will hang off the back seat in another 6 months. And he only has about another 5 lbs before he hits the weight limit... so he will probably outgrow it before age 2.No shocks, so the ride is bumpy and not very smooth. It does not handle or turn as well as even the HUGE and heavy double BOB.NO STORAGE AT ALL. You are lucky in you can fit a water bottle in the storage basket... and this is with a 10 month old in the back seat.The quality could be better... something about it screams cheaply made in China and I know I will have problems with it sooner than later.Another HUGE annoyance... the front seat pad slips down over 12 inches and bunches up behind your child EVERY time then get in... the liner is not snapped or attached to the seat, it just sits in there over the hard plastic... so you always have to pull it up after your kid gets in.Also for 700 dollars, they need to have a longer and better warranty!!! If you pay that much money on a stroller, you should have the product guaranteed for at least 2-3 years!!! Phil and Teds... what is wrong with you??? Give your customers at LEAST a 2 year warranty and STAND BY your product!!! I have paid $30 on toasters with better customer service and a better warranty.It does NOT fold with the doubles seat, I called phil and teds directly and only the vibe and verve do this.All in all, there are better strollers on the market.UPDATE: I purchased the stroller from Along Comes a Baby around 3 months ago and already had to go in for the warranty. So I decided to sell it after getting it fixed and decided to get something better. I was right in my opinion that it would not last and was not rugged and able to take regular use.	
1. 	Love! Easily adjustable and looks very comfortable for baby. She falls asleep instantly when carried in it. My husband loves it and wears it for hours with no stress on his back.	
- 1	Our baby was too small for the Ergo carrier we purchased so we got this. It was $30, but is basically just a fancy pillow to sit on. The wrap-around part provided no head support. The instructions said it should be used up to four months, but we were able to put our average-sized baby in the Ergo without it at around 10 weeks. It was a total waste of money.	
- 1	My now 2 month old was able to wiggle her arms out of both the bottom and the top of this every night because the material is so stretchy and does not do a good job holding her arms down. One time when she wiggled her arms out of the bottom opening, the small velcro tabs got pushed up to her chin/jaw line since she was bringing her hands to face and she got scratched pretty badly from turning her head side to side and rubbing on rough velcro! I wish I could upload the picture! Not a happy mom when I saw that in the morning!!	
1. 	My baby falls asleep quickly and he is very comfortable in it. The only thing i don't like is that it is not very sturdy.	
- 1	Everyone told me how wonderful this blanket was and I saw great reviews for it on Amazon and elsewhere, so we purchased it.  For our purposes, it simply didn't do the trick.  Our daughter was too wiggly, and too unhappy about being wrapped up for the blanket to work.  We ended up going with the Halo sleepsacks with wings -- all we had to do was velro close those suckers and it was lights out for the little one; they required way less effort for us and obviously at 3 a.m. I'm a bit lazy.	
- 1	Quality of this is not as good as I expected.  After using it just for 6 weeks, the sponge in the front of the brush started tearing off. However I like the small nipple brush that comes along with it.	
1. 	When I went shopping for a diaper pail, I did my research because I did not want a pail that was complicated or smelly.  This diaper pail is wonderful!  In the months that we have had it, we have never had a problem with smell.  It fits MANY diapers as well--I find that we have to change it only once every 4-5 days.  The refill pack comes with three refills and each refill lasts us about 2 months.  There is no complicated stuffing and twisting like there is with the other diaper pails (that I have heard from friends do not work as well with keeping smell out of the nursery--ie. Diaper Champ and Diaper Genie).  Using it is as simple as pressing the foot pedal and dropping in the diaper.  I do have to admit that when the pail gets a little full, we tend to pack the diapers down so that the bags will last longer, but I have never had a problem with getting anything on my hands.  The only issue I have with this is that I have it on carpet, and it can be difficult to use the foot pedal because of this (wants to sink into the carpet).  But all I do is simply lift up the lid and drop the diaper in--no problems!  It is very nice looking as well--does not look like a diaper pail, so it could be used as a garbage can in the future (the top diaper drop part comes out so that it can be used for just this reason).  The refills are also very easy to use--just open the lid, drop one in, and pull the bag down and tie a knot.  Very simple.  I would recommend this diaper pail to anyone!	
- 1	I am not impressed with these and the main reason is the plastic piece that extends down into the pouch. It allows the littlest chunks of food (tiny chunks of carrots or tiny bits of blueberry skins the size of a mustard seed or large grains of sand) to get clogged and it frustrates my daughter (and myself). They are rather expensive for being disposable and wasteful (not environmentally friendly at all). I agree with other reviewers that the caps should be sold separately that would lower the cost. Right now they average to about $.30 a pouch and by the time you add food its pretty close to the store brand pouches. The time it takes to make the food and fill these adds opportunity cost making these not really a savings at all. That leaves the only real advantage to these pouches as being able to feed your child a bigger variety of food and knowing what exactly is in their food. I tried another similar pouch with cute animal designs and they are way better. Even my four year old loves those. They are easier to clean and allow me to make thicker consistency purees.	
1. 	These bibs are nice and big, stay on, clean up easily, and you can put them in the washer.  Perfect.	
1. 	This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys! The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to keep it all in if you know what I mean! =) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore! We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all. This one is truly THE BEST. Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up. It's also a really good size bowl, some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in. AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!	
- 1	My son even at almost two years old is just not mature enough for this yet. He needs a leak proof sippy cup. Maybe would work for other people's children but not for mine.	
- 1	these are very badly stained and nothing I try is helping. this color shows everything. I do like how the snaps are though.	
1. 	I received this mobile as a hand-me-down and it has been great so far.  I really like the sound quality of the music and animal noises.  I also like the light projection of the stars and moons on the underneath of the mobile on the night setting; it can even be seen during the day with the blinds and curtains closed in the room.  My 10 week old son seems very interested in this mobile and helps soothe him to sleep when other methods are not cutting it.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet.  The mobile is detachable for when babies start pulling up but you can still use the base.  I know my friend's daughter enjoyed the music on the base as she grew older and could hit the buttons herself.  Also, the remote will turn the mobile both on and off.	
1. 	We think this is a great seat.  We had the cadillac of high chairs before we bought this seat and sold it once this arrived.  We like that it doesn't take up any additional space in your eating area because it sits on one of your existing chairs.  Our baby was so happy to be seated at the table with us and her siblings instead of in a separate high chair.Also, it's portable.  We bring the seat with us when we eat out and our daughter doesn't have to sit in a restaurant high chair that doesn't fit her.  Plus, you have the tray so your baby and eat or just play with toys.This seat is very easy to clean and doesn't have any spaces where food or messes can get trapped.  I have nothing negative to say about this seat.	
1. 	We've had this plastic banister guard for several months now, and it works incredibly well. Sure, it's a little noisy when my toddler bangs on it like a drum. And it does show fingerprints. But it's much better than the alternative--having a little one get stuck between banister rails or even fall through.The plastic is also stiff and sturdy enough to use as a cat door. Ordinarily, our cats would not have been able to get up or down the stairs when this plastic covers the rails and the safety gate at the top of the stairs is closed. However, we cut a cat-sized hole in the bottom of this plastic, between 2 rails. It's much too small for a baby or toddler to get through, but provides an easy way for the cats to enter and leave as they please. This banister guard keeps everyone in our family safe and happy...kids and cats included.	
- 1	I ordered this because I had an older Evenflo gate that I really liked. Well, when I got this one it was different. The changes aren't good. It's difficult to adjust and just doesn't work the way it should. I gave it two stars because it's getting the job done, but I only use it in me spot because it's so annoying to adjust.	
- 1	These wipes are soft, absorbent, and perfectly sized BUT...the beautiful rainbow colored threading began to unravel with the very first wash. So if you're getting them for the lovely color, think twice. Without the threads, you can probably get a cheaper flannel wipe that is just as good.Too bad.  I would have bought more.	
1. 	This is one product that delivers exactly what it promises.  It works quickly and well.I have used it daily to sterilize not only my isis breast pump... but also a hospital grade rented pump, too.  I am happy to say that neither of us has suffered from thrush or any infection.It's also wonderful for pacifiers and bottles.  I use the avent bottles which fit perfectly... but also have mendela bottles that fit wonderfully, too.I would highly recommend.	
- 1	The suction cups ripped out of the fabric of this thing within 2 weeks of use.  The over the top section (it comes in two parts) is more or less useless and doesn't offer elbow/forearm support like the picture implies.  That being said, the kneeler itself is great and doesn't slide, but you can buy a less expensive kneeler that does the same!	
1. 	Perfect for babyproofing. Much better than others I had used in the past because they are more difficult to remove (for my kids, not for me.)	
1. 	This is just the right size for the porta crib I boughtWe have a new baby granddaughter coming so it will be at our house when she is here	
- 1	This seat is TINY! I opened up the box, put it together and thought, oh, is this one of the play doll seats? Oops, I thought it was for a baby! My daughter isnt all that big, she barely fits in it. She looks ridiculous sitting in it. It looks like a giant baby sitting in a dollhouse seat :) The backrest barely goes to the middle of her back. She is 16 months old, 30, I dont think you could fit a toddler in it. Its best for 6 months and under IF your baby is small for their size and can sit by themselves. Yes, its inexpensive, like they always say, you get what you pay for!  I will keep it to take to restaurants, and get a regular sized one for the kitchen table. Also, the toy that attaches just easily pops right off, so, it gets tossed to the floor right away! No suprise, though, there is a giant baby sitting in the seat!!!	
- 1	I bought this to try with my cloth wipes. I did not like it at all. I made up the first batch and threw it away, I didnt even put it on my wipes. It was way too oily for me, I didnt want to put it on my kids! I also didnt like the smell at all. I just threw the bottle away. I think it's really just a matter of preference, but I went back to using my lil outlaw's rump solution.	
- 1	I found that this seat pinched my child's legs/hind area on the sides where the seat unfolded. It also has some foam on the backend  (I assume so it doesn't slip on a toilet seat) that just didn't seem to get clean when I would try to sanitize the seat. I ended up throwing it away.	
- 1	This pad works well , but beware it has that California 117 flame retardant material that is in question.  I use it for my grandson when he comes to visit.	
1. 	This is a great product! The tub is well-designed and comfortably keeps my 5 month-old baby in place while I'm washing him.  Our son loves to kick and splash in it.We originally had the Fisher-Price Aquarium Tub, which was great for our newborn - 4 months.  After that, it became really uncomfortable for our son.	
- 1	While the sheet serves its purpose, it's rough material and I am concerned it may irritate my son's sensitive skin. I'll give it a few more washes to see if it softens up a bit. Very low priced so I guess I get what I paid for.	
1. 	This item is great for on-the-go feeding. Plus I figure when he's done with formula, we can use it for cereal or another small travel snack. Very pleased with this purchase, especially because we got lucky on the colors and got the green and blue shown for our little boy!	
- 1	I use these with my medela Pump In Style.  I originally posted a question about the standard adaptor and how you could get it to work with a medela pump because at first I could not get my pump to get any suction with the adaptor.  I figured out that you cannot tightly screw the adaptor onto the pump part because it somehow prevents the pump from getting any suction.  However, if you loosen the adaptor a bit, you can get suction and it will work.  Someone responded to my post and said that apparently Kiinde is now making a different standard adaptor that has a longer neck, which solves this problem.  Well, I haven't had a chance to contact Kiinde to obtain the new standard adaptor.  And, as a result, I've had to use the adaptor loosely screwed onto my pump part....can you see where this is going?  Twice now I've lost an entire bag of milk b/c the adaptor disengages from the pump part and falls to the floor.  You know what that's like right?  To lose milk that you've just pumped?  HORRIBLE, AWFUL, TRAUMATIC.  So, I am giving these bags two stars with the standard adaptor that comes with the system.  I will repost this on the adaptors as well.  And I guess I&#34;ll contact Kiinde about the adaptor that actually works.	
1. 	These come in a set of 2.  I ordered because I was sick of washing the duo that I had and wanted a spare set, works perfectly, no problems!	
- 1	I gave it 2 stars instead of one, just for the design. The bottle is poorly many, can't believe Foogo made this. The bottle leaks if not in standing position. Not what I was expected at all.	
- 1	I like the size, shape, and material of this bag.  It has never leaked and I wash my diapers every other day.  My only compliant is that by laundry day the odor of the diapers is not contained by this bag.  I thought this had a draw string closure, but it's always open at the top.  It's nice to be able to hang this and save some floor space, but even putting essential oil on the fabric tab (which is located at the very bottom on the bag, so once a few diapers are in there I don't want to dig for the tab to reapply oil!) didn't really change the odor.  I wonder if other moms are desensitized to dirty diaper smells after doing cloth for so long?  I may just use this to line a pail with a lid instead.  This would make a nice large size wet bag for a whole family's bathing suits in the summer time.	
1. 	There isn't enough room for me to describe why I love these better than any other brand! I have read the reviews on multiple bottles and have been buying bottles for over 20 years. These recommendations I find are very personally fit. It's hard to determine sometimes!	
- 1	Update: Audio doesn't work at all.  Power plus only works half the time.  Motorola's customer service has never been helpful.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different monitor.For the first ~2 years we had this monitor, I thought it was great.  Video quality is great in daylight, decent enough at night.  Audio is so sensitive that we always leave it on the lowest setting.  Pan/tilt is wonderful.  Battery life isn't great but adequate since we plug it in overnight anyway.About two years in we had a problem with the audio on our parent unit.  It was so quiet that we had to turn it up to the max setting and even then we mostly got white noise.  But, strangely, after a short time this issue resolved itself.  Perhaps there's a loose soldering job somewhere in there.More troubling though is that now that it's gone through almost 2.5yrs in our home the power plug won't stay in firmly enough to charge without some fiddling around.  If I push hard or up or lay the cord on my night table just so there's no problem.  But if the monitor is accidentally moved by an inch, the blue light goes off and it runs off battery.  That wouldn't be so bad except that the battery is inadequate for a whole night, so I'm awoken by a loud beeping at 3am.Now we're looking to have a two-camera system and I'm strongly debating whether to stick with the Motorola or start with a new one entirely.	
1. 	Nice cheap alternative for stars...(you can not see stars in city...:()I also enjoyed this with my baby...Some of the lights are not as bright as others...but still works.Also have moon in there :)Don't really give baby to play with it...Looking directly into hole is little painful as light is bright inside :D So we keep it away from baby.	
1. 	I have had these bibs for about 3 years now.  I have 4 of the Bumkins bibs total, (one I bought on it's own and then the 3 pack here).  I left one bib at my parents house for when my daughter eats there, and the other 3 have been cycled through at our house for almost 3 years now.  My daughter is 3 now, so she started using these when she started eating at around 6 months old.  She now just uses them occasionally if she is eating something really messy (she hates to make a mess of her pretty dresses).  These bibs really look great and show no signs of wear.  Sometimes I've wiped them clean but other times I've thrown them through the washer.  A couple of times they have accidentally been tossed into the dryer as well and I have had no issues with them.  The Velcro is great and they cover a substantial amount of space on my daughter.  The material is great because they are soft but easily wipe-able.  I also love the little pocket for collecting food.  I don't feel the need to try any other bibs because these are so wonderful. The price isn't bad either for how much use you will be able to get out of them.  You really can't go wrong with these bibs.	
- 1	My son sticks his hand down the red tube to get the balls and gets stuck. The balls take a long time pushing the car for them to come out the back like they are supposed to. I thought they would pop out of the top. He pushes it around occasionally, but I'm not a fan.	
- 1	It doesn't fit our spout, so all the water just gets pooled inside. It's a good idea, I just think it should be more versatile and fit more than one specific type of spout.	
1. 	Does its duty -- my 10-month old has been grasping at this and sucking his thumb since infancy.  I like the smaller, single-textured blankies, too, but it's kind of cool that this one has two tactile surfaces.  I like its neutral colors.  Very easy to wash, too.	
- 1	My son can't keep this paci in his mouth.  He sucks on it if I hold it in his mouth, but he can't get enough suction to keep it there himself.  I bought it for him when he was about 3 months old, but I think he may have already been ready for a bigger size.  He loves his Nuk orthodontic paci, so we might just stick with those.	
1. 	I read many reviews on this and installed it carefully, though I understand that it still may not work for everyone. We have a basic cheap one-piece tub in the kid's bathroom, with the vinyl or plastic wall. I used the tape for installation. Cleaned it thoroughly with soap and water, then rubbed vigorously with alcohol and let it dry for half an hour. I put the tape on and held in place as long as my arms could take it. Then we put a space heater in the bathroom and had it set to 75 for about 30 hours. It wasn't really cold, but I wanted to make sure it stayed warm, especially over night, and also dry out the air. We didn't put toys in it or get it wet for 2 more days. What a procedure! But it has been installed now for about a year and it's been perfect.The biggest downside for us was the price...30 bucks for a toy holder. Yikes. Not a necessity, but very nice to have. We lucked out and found it half price on clearance at a store. Yay!	
- 1	We tried this cup and when my daughter bangs it on something hard it leaks. Furthermore, the suction valve is so tight my daughter inverts the silicone top while drinking because she sucks so hard, and then the top is all folded over and she can't drink at all! I am always undoing the lid to release the suction. We have another Nuby cup that has the same problem. You can fix the problem by opening up the valve a little with a sharp knife or blade, but then it leaks more. My daughter's favorite use of her sippy cup is painting with water on the bedsheets using her sippy cup. Much to our dismay! We've tried two Nuby cups and won't ever buy NUBY again.	
1. 	The negative comments on these gates have a few points I don't understand:Child tips it over.  I've sat on the edge of this thing when a 1-gate ring.  No problems.Child drags the gate all over.  Unless you mount it to a wall, any gate is going to be moveable.Gate has trouble folding.  Yep, it is hard to fold.  this is a GOOD THING in that you don't want your child folding it on his/herself.Gate cracks.  I have three of these.  No problems.  Really must be lemons for this to be an issue.We actually made one giant ring out of three of these and although we need to zigzag the longest wall so that it stands up without falling over (one long straight wall is not going to be sturdy without sideways support no matter what you build it out of), it is just right for our purposes.  The kid might not love it, but she now has a TON of space to play.Our child with a propensity for getting stuck in things has yet to get stuck in it (yay!) nor has she found a way out of it yet.  I love this thing.	
1. 	It's easily inflated and my baby has a blast sitting in this thing.  Some reviews mention a slippery bottom but we haven't had any problems with it.  And on the rare occasion when my baby accidentally bumps her bead on the side, well, it's all soft and bouncy so she never hurt herself.	
1. 	Got this for our new mini crib. Fits the mattress just fine and is so very very soft. We will be getting more in other colors :)	
- 1	My 11 month old can pull the drawer so fast that she pops the safety latch out of its holder and then the drawer is open. Really? She's 11 months old- her arms are like little weak sausages.	
- 1	As a first time mom I used a nipple shield after the first week of breastfeeding. These came in small medium and large at my local target. My mom got the medium which is equal to the 24 mm and it was too big and I had to go back and get the 21mm small. This was before I was pumping so I ordered the 21mm shields to be prepared and they are too small. Just be aware that the sizing is not equal. Product is same quality that I would expect	
1. 	I got this for my kids for Christmas. They are ages 6,4,2,and 6 months. They love it! I have even tried it in my room and the stars are just the right dimness. As an adult night lights are too bright for me, but these had the perfect amount of dimness. I also like how it turns off after a while. This was a very good buy.	
- 1	Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk.  If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time.  Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell.  Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip.	
- 1	Just as everyone says:Cons:-There are three temperature settings but the instructions really only tell you to use the highest one. What's the point of the three then?-There's no on/off switch, you have to unplug it to turn it off. And when you have a hungry crying baby sometimes you even forget until you smell it burning all the water to nothing.-There is NO AUTO SHUT OFF. This means that if you don't unplug it after you're done it'll evaporate the water and could burn out. This is our biggest compliant by far.This was just a horrible bottle warmer, Dr. Brown's is so much more amazing and my #1 choice.	
- 1	I bought this item because the go mama go brand that I bought for the main front rail had been back ordered and my son was trying to eat his crib for lunch.  They are not very well padded and so when my son hit his head on them he still hurt himself.  The real dangerous part is that the thing is held on primarily by one long strip of standard velcro.  It goes over the vertical slats of the crib and velcros on in the gaps between slats.  Because it is not a strong enough bond and because my son was easily able to get his hands under it on the inside crib slats and then pull the velcro apart he slipped because the rail cover that he was holding onto for support gave way and he smacked his head incredibly hard on the rail of the crib.  Shame on this company for making a piss poor product, Leachco you have lost my trust as a consumer and you could have seriously injured my child.	
- 1	We really like Dr. Brown's design.  We don't see any bubbles in the milk and the nipple is slow enough that our LO doesn't choke on it like other brand.We decided to get the standard model after finding out its wide-neck are made in china.  Sadly, our LO won't take to the narrower nipple and design.  The narrower neck also means harder mixing (if you are using powder)	
1. 	Baby loves this! So glad it comes in large as my 4 month old needs swaddling to sleep. Also keeps her warm through the night without lose covers. Velcro keeps her snug. Roomy enough to allow hip movement.	
- 1	I was really excited to use this bottle, because I wanted a good anti-colic system which didn't require the many parts of Dr. Brown bottles.  However, I ended up abandoning it for the Similac SimplySmart bottle.  Here's why:1.  The cap is impossible to open.  I thought it would loosen with use, but I couldn't stand to wait a significant amount of time.  I once asked my husband to open one for me, and he almost instantly went to get a flat-topped screwdriver.  There is no other bottle I've tried that has this problem, and I find it inexcusable.  This was the most significant reason I hated this bottle.2.  There are no 1 ounce markings on the bottle, which is difficult for newborns.  Our baby required accurate monitoring of how much he was taking at first due to medical issues, and I found it frustrating not to be able to see anything less than 2 ounces.3.  The bottle is opaque, which makes it hard to see the line when filling the bottle or the markings when checking to see how much the baby drank.  This is especially true at night, when I had the lighting on low.  Very annoying--there is a reason most of the bottles out there are clear.4.  Water leaks out of the bottom.  I never had a real formula leak, but water would somehow get trapped in the sealing ring at the bottom, and I would get wet when I shook the bottle to mix it.  This would always make me panic that I had placed it incorrectly and that formula was leaking.  I was never sure that it wasn't formula, though, in the middle of the night when I was groggy.	
- 1	I had thought by reading the reviews that this would be a good mirror for our little one in the back seat.  I was pretty disappointed to see that it distorts the reflection quite a bit so you have to have it perfectly angled so that the babies head isn't looking 12 inches longer than normal.  It also is very sensitive to movement and I'm finding myself constantly adjusting it.  I unfortunately purchased this months in advance so it'll have to work.	
1. 	I just LOVE this Snuzzler. Keeps your newborn warm and cozy - not to mention a better fit in their carseats. My daughter who's only 2 weeks old, looks very comfortable in her car seat. Without it, she was hunched over - her neck wobbling around. I didn't feel she was safely in her carseat. She only weighed 6 pounds so the carseat was too big for her. I do recommend this product to new parents. You won't regret it! Plus you can also use this in your stroller and/or bouncers!	
- 1	Only one of the washcloths has a design. The washcloths are not super soft as the product description says. they are soft enough, but not SUPER soft. they are cheaply made and thin. OK though for a baby bath.	
1. 	I love this!  It is the only thing that helped my baby learn to sleep at night.  Fisher price is a wonderful company also.  After I was done using this  put it in storage where the seat padding and headrest got damaged.  I was able to buy a replacement for only $12 so thankful for that and that I did not have to buy a brand new one for baby number 2!	
1. 	Did not know about these initially when I registered for my first baby.  Had one during her first year.  Now having a second baby and ordered three more!  They have made nights when the baby got sick so much easier!  Our first one did pill on the cloth side but baby doesn't mind and it still serves it's purpose.	
- 1	Overall I'm happy with this product. It delivers good video and audio. It has quirks. I don't use the auto on/off feature based on sound because you have to calibrte the sensitivity on the camera. Great if you want to mess around with it, get it perfect, then never move or bump the camera and risk screwing it up. Also, the GUI design needs some attention. It's just not very user friendly. With all that said, great picture and audio.*2013 Update*This worked well until it broke (the main unit, not the camera). Luckily my Amex covered it as it was just out of the 1yr warranty. I used it the money form Amex to buy the new (2013) model thinking it would work with the old camera, so I'd have two. It doesn't, AND the 2013 model has less features (no temp, for example, not that the old one ever told the right temp). Normally I like Samsung products but these just seem to be designed to give me a headache. I'd keep looking.	
1. 	Love this product! Keeps my son's arms swaddled much better than other products. I struggled a product that would keep his arms secure because he was around the 70th percentile when he was 4 months old and most products were too big around or too short.	
1. 	I own the Original Bundle me and bought this new Urban bundle me for my cousin's baby.  The Original Bundle Me seems to be warmer with the faux sheepskin on the inside instead of the micro-fleece on the inside of the Urban version.  The faux sheepskin seems to be cozier for baby, too.  When it is super cold outside, you have to add your own blankets inside either bundleme, but having the bundle me definitely helps keep the blankets where you put them.One aspect of the Urban version that I liked better is that the nylon exterior of the Urban picks up less debris than the fleece exterior of the Original.  The fleece seems to attract hair, dirt, etc.  The nylon Urban is also rain/water resistant.  The Original fleece one never seemed to get wet even though it doesn't make the claim that it is water resistant.Another point to make is that I bought the Bundle Me Lite for the spring and fall months, but didn't really use it all that much.  Unless you live in an area where the spring and fall months are cool for an extended period of time, I would just stick with the Original or Urban version.  Here I guess the weather goes straight from Summer to Winter!The whole line of BundleMe products is an AMAZING god-send if you have ever had to put a baby into a coat or snowsuit and then tried to put the car seat straps around them.  I can't tell you which one will suit your needs more, just trying to help make your selection process more successful!!  Whichever one you choose will definitely make your life SOOO much easier!This is a link to the Bundle Me Urban that I Purchased as a Gift:JJ Cole Urban BundleMe Ice	
- 1	I bought the item in spite of the bad reviews. At first, it works well, but it stops working only after 2 weeks.  I know it is a cheap item, but still I think it should work more than 2 weeks. My advice: don't waste money on this mixer.	
1. 	I went from a 36B to 40D during pregnancy. I used the M shields that came with pump and thought they were fine. I did notice my areola was being sucked in too. I decided to try the S. even though the M didn't hurt, the S is more comfy and I'm getting more milk. I had a hard time buying the S bc u figured with my 40D boobs, a S was crazy. But it's based on nipple size.	
- 1	I have twin daughters. They started eating &#34;solid&#34; food (by which I mean they were spoon-fed purees) around 5 months of age. By about 8 months of age they were able to self-feed small bits of food. By 10.5 months they were able to feed themselves their entire meal. The Nibbler is indicated for children 10 months and up. I tried it earlier based on recommendations from others and my girls both hated it. By the time they reached the designated 10-month point, I tried again several times, but once again, both girls did not want to eat from the Nibbler. At that point, I gave up -- if a baby can self-feed using their fingers why would they need this gimmick?Perhaps your experience will be different if your child isn't self-feeding at 10 months. But, don't buy this product ahead of time presuming it's essential. It's not.	
- 1	I have a lot of wetbags and I have been anal about washing and drying them as per the company's stated guidelines. Two of my IR bags have completely fallen apart after 3 washes. The inside seams just unglued themselves. These things ain't cheap. And FYI I lined dried them! I do have a message into the company, and will update this review if they do write back and fix this.	
- 1	I know, it's only four dollars, but I still feel it wasn't worth it.  One of the straps is already frayed, and one of the snaps doesn't close well at all.  The blurb states it's adjustable to two lengths; all that really happens is you choose a different snap - and for me this created a larger loop through which my son stuck his hand, twisted, and got it wound pretty tightly.  The ring of the toy to which it was attached could have made an effective tourniquet had I not been watching.  This product was poorly designed and poorly manufactured.	
1. 	We love most all Haba toys.  This is one of my daughter's favorites.  She loves to shake it to music.	
1. 	MUCH easier to use than the plastic shields that you plug into the outlet.  Those are always a huge pain to pry out so you can use the outlet.  With this you simply slide the spring-loaded cover over and plug in your appliance.  When the cord is removed, it springs back into place to cover the outlet.  Simple, easy, effective.  Just wish they were a less expensive as spending $24 on a half dozen of these is awefully rich.	
- 1	My daughter does not like these cups, so I don't like them.  It's too hard on her mouth and too hard to get any liquid out. They also don't click when screwing the lid on, unless you're extremely muscly.  She is 15 months old, who knows, maybe she will use them when she is older.  She did much better with the NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, 10-Ounce, when going from bottle to cup.	
- 1	The material used is not strong and sturdy. Within a few days of use, the dispenser wont lock and would open on its own rolling down the diaper refill bags. Not recommended at all. Don't go for this just because this is cheap.	
- 1	all of the dispensers are too big to even get into a medicine bottle nevermind my newborn sons mouth. maybe meant for toddlers.	
- 1	Don't recommend this product -- very expensive, basic umbrella stroller.  While it is lightweight, the canopy is a joke -- way too small to provide sun protection for my granddaughter and it doesn't recline at all.  There are a lot of better strollers out there. Keep looking!!!	
- 1	I purchased this product because it said that it helps position, babies with reflux, to make them feel comfortable. I was really hoping it would work because my baby has a hard time in strollers/car seat due to reflux.After using this positioner my baby seemed more uncomfortable as her head keeps bobbing forward by the neck/shoulder support. She fusses even more with it :(I also think its priced too high, would have been worth it if it worked.	
- 1	This is the most poorly made baby bath I have ever used. It is impossible to get folded and unfolded. When you do get that figured out then you get to deal with the stupid sling. My baby kept slipping down and her ears would get under water. She is now to big for the sling, but to small to sit up in the ring. I gave it a fair try, but I had to go out and buy another bath. It seems like a great concept, but it is really just a waste of [money].	
- 1	This product was too small to fit my playard. It also shrank in the dryer after the first was, so I use it as a cover for my changing pad. It works great for that but does not work at all for its intended purpose. It made of good quality fabric and is very cute but did not fit my playard. I was disappointed because it was the perfect color and design for my son's playard but no dice.	
- 1	we thought these would be the best bottles. but they are leaky, no matter how hard you tighten them. we bought these from amazon and from toysrus. both leak. I even stopped shacking the bottles to mix the milk, and instead used a spoon. still did not help.My sister bought the same bottle design, also avent, from france. Those bottles were transparent ( do not have the honey colored hue of our bottles) and never leaked. She paid even less and they are BPA -free.	
1. 	This is a great starter set for a new baby. I think these bottles work just as well as other more expensive bottles. You can hear the air venting from the bottle when baby eats.Pros:Prevents baby from swallowing a lot of airInexpensiveDishwasher safeAngled bottleCons:Lots of parts to put together/take apart and wash (bottle body, bottle bottom, bottom vent cover, ring, nipple, cover)Leaks- Sometimes they leak from the bottom	
- 1	I cant even explain to you how upset I was with this product. It kept falling off the wall in the bathroom.And this is kind of a purpose of it, no?	
- 1	I used prefolds and covers a lot, but this one tended to move every time. Couldn't keep the prefold in straight and so then we would have to change entire ensemble every time. One of the reasons I liked prefolds and covers was the ability to change the prefold and use the cover several times. Not the case with this one. Had to change cover every time.	
- 1	I bought this for my baby boy's room because he is such a light sleeper. There is only ONE sound that is even remotely soothing; all the others just made him toss and turn. I kept the machine because really, one is all you need. Well, after a few nights, I could hear a slight ringing sound in the background. It wasn't much and honestly, as a full time working mom, I didn't have time to call First Year's customer service and mess with a return and such. Now the ringing is so loud that you can BARELY hear the actual white noise and it is with all the sounds, not just the one I use! I'm worried it is hurting his little ears so I've turned it off and use the fan instead. When I looked at the box for the customer service number, I found out that the warranty is only 90 days! yikes, that sucks. I'm now at 99 days...what a bummer that I just missed out on returing this piece of poo. How sad that the company will only back up their product for 90 days...to me, that says they don't expect it to last either. Don't waste your money!!!	
1. 	My guy love's his sleepsacks. I was excited to find that they make bigger sizes so my man can keep using these. The fabric is so soft on this one. I really like the subtle design and unique color.	
1. 	It works and it's easy to hook up. I love being able to see my kid and she loves being able to see me!	
1. 	My child is two years old and above-average height.  As such, the regular Halo sleepsacks no longer fit her.  We tried using blankets but had two problems with blankets: 1) she was used to and liked her sleepsack so she was not a big fan of the blankets; 2) she's a tosser and turner at night so the blankets would get all tangled up and leave her uncovered.  So, I bought one of these big-kid sacks and it is great.  She immediately felt comfortable in it and we don't have to worry that she's too cold because, unlike the blankets, this will stay on her.  So then we bought another.  A couple of notes.  I bought the 2/3t size and it fits her well.  It's a little bulky because she's on the thin side but the height is good.  She'll be able to use it for many more months.  Also, this sack is made of micro-fleece.  If you are looking for something cotton, this is not it. This is definitely for the cold-weather months.	
1. 	My son is only 10 months old. I think he'll like this more when he's older (when he's taller so it doesn't crowd him in his high chair. What I do like is that it catches liquids like water and pureed food well since it's not a flimsy cloth bib. It's also easy to put on, although my little one does sometimes like to chew on the bib right beneath his mouth.Pros: catches food well including liquids because it's not flimsy and it's easy to cleanCons: it's hard silicone so it doesn't fit well on a high chair if your baby isn't tall enough to clear the tray.If you're looking for other feeding items I recommend, visit my website, AllMomsArePerfect. In the post about baby registry items from 3-9 months I talk about some great things my little one loved when it came to feeding.	
1. 	Pros: felt soo much better sleeping with this than just stacks of random pillows.Cons:1) we had a full/queen bed and between myself and this pillow my poor husband had virtually no space. he was a trooper though and never complained!2) By the end of my pregnancy I felt that I had flattened the head portion to the point it wasn't helping very much. For this it gets 4 stars. It is promoted to be more firm of a pillow than the Boppy or other competing brands. It started out that way for sure but I smothered it to death, and now it is limp. For a lot of people they may not feel this way or be as picky as me but I LOVE extra firm pillows. So if you are like me you may keep this in mind.3) Removing the case and washing it is a giant pain in the behind. That was a battle I was determined to win because clean linens are my happy place.All in all, it was still worth the purchase and gave me MANY good nights sleep. Just be aware, it may not last to your firm standards or leave space for your partner in the bed. I would buy it again, and just might have to with another pregnancy to keep the firmness I prefer.	
1. 	We bought these trucks for our 15 mo. old daughter and 4 mo. old son- We love them!  They are nesting which is fun for our daughter to look underneath the trucks to find the next one or they can stack one on top of the other to make a tower.  Perfect first trucks!  And they aren't too big- a perfect size!	
1. 	I was given a set of bumpkins bibs like this for my son when he was born. Couldn't wait to get this set when I found out I was pregnant with a girl! They've ended up being the only bibs we've ever used! They are durable and can stand the test of time. I use one for every meal. After, I rinse it in the sink then I throw the bib right into the washer and air dry. My son is 20 mo old and we've only ever used the three bumpkins bibs! They still look new! They are a perfectly waterproof without feeling like plastic. I just can't give enough praise for these bibs!	
1. 	I snipped the end off the net so the balls would fall thru and it became extra fun! Suction cups hold great. Only downfall is the balls have a tiny hole in them so water gets in and becomes moldy. But other balls I had fit and work good too.	
1. 	This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!	
1. 	This is our second booster/highchair seat.  The other one we have is The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat.  The First Years seat is good for when your child is first learning to eat and can't quite sit up well because it reclines.  However, it's not good for travel because it doesn't fold up nicely.  We really like the Fisher Price booster for the following reasons:- Folds up nicely - we keep it in our car to use when we're out.- The set-up is easy and user-friendly - we didn't need an instruction manul to figure it out.- Clean up is simple - there are no crevices in the seat for food to get caught in (the First Years has small crevises along the seat) and the top tray pops off for easy cleaning.  We usually wipe down the primary seat with a wet towel and leave it in the car and take the tray and cover off for washing in the dishwasher between uses.- A better alternative to public high chairs - we used to use a highchair cover at restaurants, but our son would still find a way to chew on the dirty highchair.  And, because most public highchairs don't have a tray, we'd have to clear a large area on the table in front of him since he likes to grab everything and throw it on the ground.	
1. 	I realized very early on that I was receiving so many different sized clothes for my new baby girl that I couldn't keep track of how many pieces of clothing I had in each size. I purchased these dividers thinking I was being silly to go to this extent of organization! But as soon as I received them and put them in the closet I realized how much easier it was to keep track of what I had in each size. I probably never would have noticed otherwise that I was desperately short of newborn sized clothing before it was too late! I had previously just been looking at the total amount in the closet and thinking I was doing good on the clothing supply. Because I received so many larger sized clothes from recent new mom friends and shower gifts I was running out of room for smaller sizes so my next purchase is a closet doubler (see my link).Organize It All 1346W Closet Doubler, ChromeI think these two products will compliment each other very well! Only complaint is that if you use these in a closet with a shelf above the bar they may not fit completely as the tops of the dividers are very high.	
1. 	For the price, it was a great buy.  But it is difficult to get onto and off of tables.  If we just left this at home, it would be great, but we take it with us when eating out or visiting family, and it can be a pain.  Comfy for baby, a great space saver, but the buckle for the harness seems cheap and may not last long.  Overall, a decent purchase.After much more use, I'm upping this to 4 stars.  While it still is a bit of a pita, it's gotten much easier to handle after much practice.  We take it with us to almost all restaurants and I'd say it will fit on 65% of the tables.	
- 1	I bought these to help with leaks during engorgement after giving birth. My nipples were raw, sore and a little bloody. Even though I coated my nipples with lanolin after every feeding the pads would still stick to my nipples.  My breasts and nipples already hurt so to have to peel these pads off every two hours was torture.  To make things worse little strands of cotton would dry themselves onto the cracked bleeding parts. Ouch! I found the smooth, cool lycra of my bras was better. A waste of money!	
- 1	I ordered this to transition my baby from a bottle to a zippy cup...needless to say this one did not do or work very well! The handles are too close together and my child can't grasp it and drink at the same time...it would be better if the handles were more far apart. Also, my little girl did not like the nubby nipples. I guess they were too big for her and she just didn't like it. Going to try another brand!	
1. 	This is cute.  The foot stamp is difficult to use but at least the baby stays clean.  Overall nice amount of pages.	
1. 	These bottles work very well as long as all parts are totally dry.  I've had them leak several times but it's been because I haven't let the latex valve on the base air dry completely.  I use them at home but would not be confident traveling with them.	
1. 	When my 9 month old started outgrowing her infant seat I did extensive research.  I needed a seat that could be rear-facing but that also could be used as my child grows.  I concluded that the Marathon was the car seat for us.  I love the fact that we will be able to use this car seat much longer than most of the others available that only go up to 40 lbs.The Britax fabrics are adorable and fun, very plush and soft and extremely easy to clean.  This seat installs very quickly and easily in any vehicle, LATCH equipped or not.  My daughter is very comfortable in it and the sides come out enough to keep her head somewhat upright when sleeping, but still allow her to see out the side windows.What I also liked was that unlike other car seats, the tether can be used when the seat is rear-facing.  No other seat I've seen has this feature.I know that other seats like the Alpha Omega do function as a shoulder harness booster after 40 pounds, but my hope is that my daughter will be used to the 5-point harness car seat and that I will be able to keep her in a 5-point harness as long as possible!  Also, some people have balked at the $250 price tag, but consider that if you buy a high-rated car seat that goes up to 40 lbs and then have to invest in a booster (I would get one with a back) that you would likely spend about as much.I highly recommend this car seat!	
1. 	This base fit perfectly with our car seat model. It definitely did the job.HOWEVER, before purchasing, definitely look into which models fit with this base.	
1. 	First off, don't pay $75 for this -- I found it for about $40 on this site. Bought this for my nine month-old who is now ten months old; she loves it and plays with it every day. I worried after reading a review that a child fell on one and required stitches so I put it away for a bit. My mom (a retired kindergarten teacher of more than 25 years) told me I was being ridiculous and dragged it back out one day for my daughter. She said you would have to jump off something and land on the cube, or really be horsing around and fall hard on this to hurt yourself badly -- and she's right. All the edges are rounded and the top is covered with rubber covered wire that beads are on. A kid can get hurt on anything, and this toy is no worse than any other. The cube is so busy that it holds babies attention without loud annoying sounds or flashing lights. It's a nice quiet toy that is educational and fun, and if you ask me, there are precious few of those around these days. I highly recommend it. It's also built very well -- it looks like a toy from yesteryear, carefully and lovingly crafted with hand-painted images. My mom as an early childhood educator thinks this toy is great. Well worth the money.	
1. 	it's very cute and useful - from getting the straps into my baby's chubby neck since he has very sensitive skin!  i was worried it would be too hot for him, but it's not that bad.	
- 1	I'm not saying that the quality of the item is to blame, just the concept. If you need to swaddle your baby, use a swaddle blanket. This serves no purpose after you no longer need to swaddle your baby. A blanket still is a blanket!	
1. 	This is definitely a nice-to-have baby item, not a must-have. Though all families are different, we have gotten good use out of our Diaper Genie II. We only use it for dirty diapers, as we throw plain wet ones out with the regular trash. It contains the smell (except for a momentary whiff when you open the lid) and isn't an eyesore. Since we only use it for the dirty diapers, it doesn't fill up as quickly as it would if we used it for all diapers. The benefit to this practice is also that the liners last a LONG TIME.The lid took me awhile to get used to doing 1-handed. At first I had to use both hands, but I've finally figured out where the sweet spot is to push when I open it. Also, you really need to be sure to empty it before it overfills- or you will be squeezing everything to get the next diaper in, and may end up with a mess... if you know what I mean.All in all, I do recommend this product to new moms. I'm not sure if the new version, the Diaper Genie Elite II (with the foot pedal to open the lid) is any good, but I can vouch for this product!	
- 1	I have been using my pump 5 times a day every day for 4 months.  I thought pumps were made for moms who couldn't nurse, but apparently this pump cannot perform as often as I need it.  We had a strong storm, so I will give the pump the benefit of the doubt and blame the storm for blowing it.  However, my Medela from 1998 also endured being plugged in during power surges and did not blow out.  This Medela model was my favorite.  I loved the easy let down and gentler pumping.  Too bad I WASTED my money on the new model.  Four months of use and now nothing.  It is not even coming on.  AT ALL.  I didn't buy it off Amazon, but I figured I could at least review it here since this is such a trusted site.  I had read that Medela no longer makes the cut as one of the best pumps.  Now I know why.  The machine that is 15 years old still works, and my brand new model doesn't.  I do not recommend this pump.  If you do buy it, plug it into a storm strip and not directly in the wall.  I hope your luck and $260 is better spent than mine.	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
- 1	This hamper is super-cute and went perfectly with the monkey/jungle decor in our baby's room.  However, this is a case of &#34;you get what you paid for&#34; in terms of quality.  I didn't expect it to handle industrial level use, but within the first couple of days the little plastic tubes that are used to give the hamper structure pushed through the ends and now the hamper won't stand up.  I was surprised that there was no reinforcement at the ends where the support pieces were supposed to go.  Oh well, I haven't thrown it out yet, I'm still working on a way to upcycle it into some sort of decorative item.	
1. 	My son is 7 months old.  We use these everyday.  We haven't moved to solids so I haven't used these for the practical purposes of catching food but these clean very easily which is a huge plus and the velcro has worked after numerous washing.  Plus I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss.  They are super cute and we always get compliments on these bibs.  I've boughten other Bumkin bibs and I am a huge fan now.  Also, they don't fade like some of the other feeding bibs I've used.	
1. 	I love this!  I bought it after owning the baby bond which really wasn't as discreet as I wanted in very crowded settings i.e. restaurants. This works very well and you can see your baby which is great.  Although if you're at a restaurant and the waiter is standing over you they can also see your baby along with other things.  It looses a star for me because the material is not very breathable and baby and I both get hot using it at times in Cali weather.	
1. 	It is what it is. The depot keeps everything you need to primp your baby in one small space. This had been very convenient for us, as we much prefer everything at hands reach. We can keep anywhere from 12-14 Pampers swaddlers diapers stacked on one side, and two 64 packs of pampers sensitive wipes on the other. The wipe warmer stays stocked with warmed huggies thick wipes for wiping baby down when a bath isn't necessary. The side storage hold his aveeno wash&shampoo, powder, desitin, comb, etc. The depot is worth the buy!	
1. 	We use these BPA-free caps to cover our toddler's Klean Kanteen sippy. If you are looking for a cover to keep the sippy clean, these are fantastic and fit the Klean Kanteen perfectly. Great solution that allows us to use the steel, safe sippys with the Avent system.	
- 1	We had a previous iteration of this product that we really loved. But, this updated version has a tendency to leak. They are too messy for us. We won't be getting them again.	
1. 	The color it really pretty and exactly what I was expecting.  Very soft and cleans well when thrown in the washer	
- 1	I want to love this product, but soon after we took it out of the packaging and tried it out, the camera broke right off of the base! We hardly handled it at all, and it just popped right off. Now the camera is hanging by wires, and every minute or so it beeps and says Out of Range, even when the receiver is in the same room as the camera.I am wondering if we simply got a faulty one? I know other reviewers have mentioned how sturdy it is, but ours was totally flimsy.Aside from the unit totally breaking, the picture is really nice and clear (seems quite a bit better than ourGraco True Focus Digital Video Monitor's picture); the night vision is great; I LOVE that it tells you the room temperature; the two-way sound is awesome for comforting baby, and the sound is nice and clear; and the lullaby feature is nice. As long as your monitor isn't flimsy like ours, this really has the potential to be a great product.	
1. 	I had one of these with my two year old daughter when she was an infant, and just bought a new one for the baby I'm pregnant with. I  LOVE this thing. They are great to use in the sink or bathtub. They're so much better than hard plastic baby tubs.The only thing is that you have to ring them it out well to prevent mildew from forming, and find a place to hang it up.This thing is so affordable too. Best baby item, must have for me.	
1. 	This is the best for me. It is very simple to use, even when you are a first mum and are giving baby his first bath, and convenient according to baby's age.	
- 1	Thought of trying a different brand after being loyal to johnson nursing pads for a while. This doesnot have the sticky tape and also confuses which side is the inner curve. i am back to johnson brand and will highly recommend it.	
- 1	My newborn can't keep this in his mouth very well. It keeps falling out. He can latch onto the Nuk ones a lot better and actually keep it in his mouth. Would not recommend.	
- 1	We registered and recieved the Baby Einstein Center thinking that we were getting the most edicational product for our child--atleast for stationary entertainers.  We were wrong.  You can't understand the spanish and quite frankly it is boring.  A friend had bought the Exersaucer (new model) for her son and my daughter fell in love with it (even at 4 months).  So, we packed up the Baby Einstein and took it back and came home with the Exersaucer.  Yes it is more money, but it is also more fun and you can buy different toys to stitch in and out.  Invest in fun---being a kid is not all learning spanish and english but also learning what fun is as well as cause and effect!!	
- 1	I searched amazon for an organic soft toy for my baby and ended up choosing this bear. It is cute, but kind of stiff and just not really fun or snuggly for baby. I think adults like it more than babies.	
1. 	A couple years ago, we bought a lot (probably more than we really needed) of baby bottles that all offered different options.  We ended up using all of them so we didn't have to wash them as often, but I have to say the Playtex bottles were the best as they help prevent gas and colic.  We plan on using these more than any of the other types with the next baby as they make things a lot easier.  Although the shape of the bottle has that slight tilt to it, I don't think it really makes it any more difficult to dry on one of those special racks.  The only down side is there was occasionally a couple drips of milk coming out of the bottom of the bottle (not sure if I did something wrong to allow or if something can be done to prevent that).Comparing Playtex bottles to the others we tried, I have to say the Playtex bottles are one of the few bottles out there that are trying to prevent colic and gas.  The only other brand I can think of that does this is Dr. Brown.  Slight dripping isn't entirely unusual with other bottles, as the glass bottles we got would actually drip where the nipple would screw on.  We didn't experience any drips with Medela, but they are plain bottles and do nothing to address the colic/gas issue.  So I would definitely recommend the Playtex bottles and they make a great gift for expecting parents.	
1. 	I LOVE bumbkins bibs.  They are super easy to clean.  They stay nice.  I can even throw them in the washing machine for a good washing.  I loved having 3 so I really wash down the one she was using and worry about her bib being wet for her next meal.  The elastic did come loose on one but I just stitched it back on.  The other 2 were fine.	
1. 	At six weeks, our son started kicking more and wanting a little independence. We pulled out the rainforest that was a gift from an aunt and found that he loved it. He can spend an hour in the rainforest just as happy as he can be. He only kicked the toys until he was ten weeks and then started using his hands. It was necessary to move the toys around to make them accessible to him. He now at fourteen weeks has both hands and both feet hitting something at the same time. It is entertaining to watch and good exercise for him. We did add a few toys since all of the loops weren't used, which was a nice option. We also felt that the music and lights were too much for him until he was ten weeks old. It truly entertains him, and I highly recommend it.	
- 1	The headband that I thought might be a great solution proved not so much!  My baby wears headbands and hats all the time and she was not a fan!  I also bought the more traditional type and she liked them!	
1. 	This was the first &#34;teether&#34; my baby would use (at about 4 months).  She is now 10 mos. and still loves to chew on it.  The only problem I see is that I decided to purchase the clear one, which is sometimes hard to find amidst her toys.	
- 1	I've had to come back and edit this review because I was a bit emotional about how badly this monitor functions.This monitor has a range of about 20 feet, unless there is a piece of furniture or wall in the way, in which case it is much less.  Basically, if you can hear the baby with your own ears, then it will be in range.When it goes out of range it emits an incessant annoying beeping until you step back into range.  Where you can hear the baby anyway and don't need it.Please don't waste your money on this, as I did with mine.	
1. 	I liked this gate. It was sturdy and I liked that it was solid. The handle to release the gate was easy to use...but not too easy for my toddler.	
- 1	I prefer the medela brand. I think this one is messier when trying to get the pumps in and out and I always spilled. Also my zipper broke after just a few months.	
1. 	best shields around	
- 1	My almost two year old daughter is not always good at holding hands, so I thought I would give this a try.  I had another brand that was not stretchy, and she tolerated it.  However, there was no give, so she would sometimes fall down when it ran out of length.  The Safety 1st has nice stretchy material, so the child can tell when there is no more give and not fall down.  My daughter did not like the material around her wrist, and within a few minutes asked to have it removed.  I have read a recommendation to tie the strap to pant belt loops which is a great idea.  Unfortunately, my daughter does not have pants that have belt loops, so we will work on holding hands and I have ordered a carrier.	
- 1	I really love the design of this changer but am extremely disappointed in the quality. The wood is painted a black brown espresso color, and sloppily done. Globs of paint, and uneven coverage. The glue on the joints is exposed. The only wood on this unit is the structural legs and drawer glide. Everything else is fiberboard, with the exception of the triangle shelves, which are paperboard, and arrived bent and damaged. These boards are covered in a simulated wood grain paper. Much like contact paper.  The chemical smell off gassing from the wood paint, glue,or mdf is horrendous. I have had it airing out, with the windows open, for 6 hours now, and it still smells so bad that it is like sticking my nose in a paint can. The changing pad is very flimsy, smelly, and oddly shaped, with a triangular shape at the corner. The pad cover is a thin terry. Doesn't look like it will hold up. The canvas bins are a natural canvas color and are not very sturdy. My canvas bins from a big box retailer are far stronger. Super dissapointed. I really like the design, but they failed to meet even minimal quality standards.	
- 1	There is a hook at the foot of the base of this seat, that makes it feel dangerous to get the seat in and out of it. I only leave this seat in the care because of it.	
1. 	I really like these trays. They are perfect for storing home made food in the freezer. You can use a normal ice cube tray, but these have a lid, so the can easily stack, not spill, and protect a little from frost bite. Now if only they were cheaper. lol. But they are not too bad, so no complaints.	
1. 	I love these bags- they smell good and create a nice barrier for stinky diapers while bringing to the trash outside. I also use them when on the go and just double or triple bag so that nobody if offended by the smell.	
- 1	These are fine, but super tiny and stiff. I prefer the larger Kushies if you are covering your changing pad. These might be OK for travel. Otherwise, not sure how you would use them.	
1. 	got to use at baby's grandparent's. saved our niece from the dog that got out. sets up well. a bit hard to open and close, but, hey, saved the baby!	
1. 	This changing pad cover works great on the Especially for Baby Contour Changing Pad. I have one in white and one in green (the green matches my Malawi bedding really well.) I washed and dried them many times. All of the stains came out and they stayed soft and didn't shrink much. I did have to stretch them a bit to get them on, but once in place they fit perfectly. The straps on the pad I have are attached at the bottom so I didn't need to cut any holes in the cover in order to be able to use the straps. I also use small changing pads so that I don't have to change and wash the cover that often. I like that I can put my baby on something soft and warm instead of the cold plastic pad. I definitely recommend getting these.	
1. 	They really don't spill when dropped, unless you lose the plastic insert. Then they spill EVERYWHERE... I wish they sent an extra plastic piece with the set.	
- 1	This product is worthless! I had to try and lightly press my daughters foot into the plaster no less than 9 times and each time it barely made an indentation.  We tried everything, from rolling the plaster a little thicker for more cushion while pushing, pressing her foot a little harder and nothing worked.  We could have thrown our $30 for this product out the car window and gotten more satisfaction and a better memory than this piece of junk will provide.  We ended up with a very faint, almost unreconizable imprint that will most likely be replaced with an ink impression if we can find it soon enough.  Save your money and buy something else if you really want a true memory of your child's foot or hand.**UPDATE: I emailed the manufacturer Pearhead, after receiving this product.  They sent another plaster packet out and we tried it again.  We followed the directions as noted and it still did not work.  We again were left with a horrible, barely there print.  This product truley is a waste of money.  We ended up ordering the Inkless print kit from another company for much cheaper, worked great and we got the keepsake this product/company could not deliver on.	
- 1	My triplets just turned three, and one of the recently got into the habit of slamming doors. In doing so, he smashed his brothers fingers in the jam, so we purchased these in the hopes that wouldn't happen again. Instead, when he went to slam the door, these finger guards slammed into the door jam, and the wood split the door frame. Hands may have been saved, but now we have to pay to fix the damage in our rental. There has to be a better option out there...	
1. 	My daughter has been using these for the last (6) weeks and loves them.  They are easy to use and clean, and the nipple really seems perfect for moms who are breastfeeding.The baby has not had any gas issues while using these. Now purchased them in (2) sizes....5 STARS	
- 1	The adjustments don't stay in place very securely, like others have said, require daily/frequent tweaking.  I am trying to install the mirror in a new car and after an hour of trying to adjust it, am giving up.  Not only that, it is already cracked and I've used it for only a few months.  Save your money and the headache and look elsewhere.	
- 1	i got this for socks but it didn't hold much. it was a waste of money for me. also shriveled up in the wash and was a pain to not lose.	
- 1	annoying that they put this on the outside as you hit it on doors all the time so of course it broke	
1. 	My three month old daughter loves this toy. She likes the dangling bone and loves the crackling of the ears.  The barking sound that the dog makes is a sound catcher.	
- 1	I purchased these after my daughter had diaper rash and I read a bunch of reviews suggesting them.  Perhaps I wasn't using them right, but they weren't particularly helpful for me.  They didn't clean well enough that I was comfortable using them alone, and they didn't stay soft after multiple washes.  I ended up just going directly to bath time after a poo and otherwise rinsing her under the sink upon changing.	
- 1	This ink pad arrived in a plastic bag, and was also wrapped in cellophane, but even with these precautions, it was completely dried out - I couldn't even get a smudge of ink to show up on my finger. I tried adding a little bit of water to the pad to re-wet the ink, which didn't work. This was really a complete waste of money and I will be asking for my money back.	
1. 	I bought these to entertain my 16 month old daughter with breakfast snacks while we commute in the AM (long commute).  They work perfectly for that but....the top has enough give that she can shake the container upside down and toss snacks all over the back seat (cheerios, etc.).  Other than that - love them.	
1. 	This chair travels every where with us. We take it on picnics at the park and even packed it in our bags when we flew over seas. Small and compact when folded, yet study. My daughter just loves it! She now has a chair of her own.	
1. 	No spillage.  Great for low amount of milk storage.  fit easily in freezer.  Price is also reasonable.  Will recommend it.	
- 1	The shape of the pads is very awkward. The pad (inside portion) is slightly larger than the outer, so that the pad actually curves away from you instead of cupping. If there were some darts sewn into the circle it could conform to the natural shape of a woman. Even in a sports bra you can see the raised edges of the pad. On top of the shape, the lining sticks to my skin and borders on pain when peeling it away from my skin. The idea of this pad is great, the execution not so much.	
1. 	These worked great for my daughter, she did  have accidents at night time but these were fine for daytime use.	
- 1	I wish mine were counterfeit. That way I could return this torture device.Unfortunately it is authentic and I'm stuck with it.I registered for this item on my baby registry and received it at my shower. When the time came to try it on with my baby, it was too late to return it.The product itself is a high quality item. The problem is just that it doesn't fit my (average height and weight) body. All of baby's weight is either on my bladder or my low back, depending on how I adjust all the straps. While those things are super fun reminders of being pregnant, it's just not what I'm looking for in a baby carrier.I'm holding out hope that when baby is a bit bigger the back-carry option will be good for us.Also, the side-carry feature... is that a joke? The strap goes exactly across your throat!	
- 1	Liked the idea...but it didn't work for our door.  :(	
- 1	We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on.  It's too loud.  We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it.  It has voice activation.  So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise.	
1. 	We've been using this (and several other Mustela products) on our twins since they were born and never had any reaction to it (they're 18 months). A little goes a long way. It's mild and i have never been bothered by the scent.	
1. 	If you have any reason to take formula powder or powdered milk for a baby or a toddler along with you anywhere, this is a delightful thing. Once you're spilled sticky powder all over your well-packed diaper bag, you'll appreciate it a lot more. It's the right size, the lid stays on, and it's perfectly designed to pour into a baby bottle without making a mess. You don't NEED one, but it sure is nice to have. Particularly wonderful on long plane flights.	
1. 	My 1-yr old finally has 2 teeth so I wanted to get in the habit of brushing every night. This cleaner had great reviews so i purchased it. My child LOVES the taste and is always pointing for me to put more of this on her toothbrush.	
1. 	I got this as a gift from my sister-in-law and she loves it.  She said her daughter plays with it all the time in the car	
1. 	Nice and softlike it says, kind of like cashmere. Definitely easy to wash stains come out easy and looks like great quality because it is.	
- 1	I bought this for my 8 month old but it is extremely narrow. She can barely fit when she is all the way on the backrest without feeling too crowded. Also the table doesn t easily fix so the only position I can make it stay it's the maximum so the baby is even more crowded. I wouldn t recommended this product	
1. 	My five-month-old loves this ExerSaucer. He will play in it for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. I love the fact that it will grow with him and that he can bounce in it. The toys are great, with many that he can pull into his mouth. The toys can be changed out with Switch-a-Roos (available at baby-Wise). Plus with only one electronic toy (which is pretty quiet), it's not annoying the adults in the room. Evenflo got it right with this one!	
1. 	We just used this for the first time over the weekend with our 7-month old.  It was fantastic.  It is so easy to carry and fits to any kind of chair (we ate at several different locations and didn't have a problem attaching this seat to any of those chairs).  My son loved having his own little tray and I loved that I could just detach the entire tray and wash it off.FYI, the back of the chair is removable so that this will eventually just be a booster seat for an older child.  I did not realize that when I bought it, so it was an added bonus when I read that in the manual.I am very happy with this purchase and will recommend it to all of my mommy friends.	
1. 	It looks nice and it's been working ok so far for about 3 months. The wood seems to be light and cheap material, and it gets very easily scratched. I know it can be converted to a full size bed but I don't think I want to use it as a full size bed at the rate it's getting scratched.	
1. 	These are new nipples for the playtex standard ventaire bottles, and they are fast flow. Exactly what I wanted and they were brand new when I got them. They worked perfectly.	
- 1	I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children.  I assumed her kids liked this toy and that's why she'd given us one (I hadn't requested it on our registry).  Unfortunately, our baby has never been interested in this toy.  I'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things.  However, I can understand why she's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother.  Personally, I don't find that there's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional, moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium (my daughter's very favorite crib toy).  Moreover, the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud.  When we first used this toy (at night), my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that's how loud and grating the sound was.  We figured out, however, that it's simply the noise of the pictures turning.  Unfortunately, to cover up that horrible noise, we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes.  Overall, I wish I'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could.	
1. 	I love these bags- they smell good and create a nice barrier for stinky diapers while bringing to the trash outside. I also use them when on the go and just double or triple bag so that nobody if offended by the smell.	
1. 	We had the last model with our first child and got this one for the cost and ease of use. One thing to know is that it almost always takes the &#34;max&#34; amount to heat up a bottle adequately, but note our son likes his bottle on the warmer side. For the money it's great.	
1. 	We have tried many good brands, but this one is amazingly better . It makes my toddler's hair much smoother than all other brands we got.	
1. 	I was a little apprehensive when I saw reviews saying these bags didn't work properly.  They work perfectly with my Medela electric pump.  They'll come in so handy when I'm traveling so I can pump and store right away without having to transfer the milk afterwards.  These are awesome.	
- 1	Ok who designed this piece of junk? First of all there is no dangling fish like in the photo, and no lights like the description states. It is a hard plastic thing with fabric fish. It cannot be hooked to a crib so my baby can only play with it on the floor. When you press the fish there are 3 options. Classical music- but it only plays ONE SONG over and over, a tactile tune- again ONE sound for each fish, and a silly sound- and yes again ONE SOUND. The textures are stupid. The only one worth anything is the furry fish. The others aren't overdone enough for the baby to get any satisfaction from touching it. There is a tiny crinkly fin, bumpy fabric, a felt fin, and rubber fish. It is too big and bulky for baby to pick up, and the fish are too hard for babies to push. My daughter is 8 months so well over the recommended age- she should be able to push them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Get something that your baby can pick up and feel, transfer from hand to hand, chew... etc.	
1. 	I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.  Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.  He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.  He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.  So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.  my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.	
- 1	Pros:lids are interchangeablethey come in 4 colorscan use the cups without the lidthey are plasticThey make great plugs for bathtub drainsdaughter likes playing with them in the bathCons:have to be careful how you screw the lids on or they will leak.its hard to get liquid out of them. my daughter stops trying after a few seconds.stick together if stackedsuppose to be spill proof but are not.We do continue to use them, however, i used a knife and cut off the top of the spout. now it free-flows but can't be taken anywhere. My daughter will drink out of the sippy lids i've done this to. she wont drink out of the ones I haven't cut.	
1. 	If your child is tall enough to reach them, it doesn't take much force to pry them from the Velcro, and totally defeat the system.  However, I got around this by tilting the lower window (of a double-hung) in, and applying the wedge to the outside.  Since I don't think our child knows how to tilt in the window, nor is strong enough to pull the catches, this solution should work.  You just need to be careful.  Defiantly not a useful option for any child over 5 or 6.  You'd probably need something requiring a key at that point.  (and of course, you'd need a key accessible in the event of an emergency)	
- 1	So, first of all these say on amazon that they are made buy Hawaii Medical. When I got them, the packaging said they came from another maker. Besides that, these just weren't great pacifiers. My baby couldn't hold them in her mouth and kept accidently spitting them out. Also, the round shape really isn't good for breast feeding babies and could definitely cause some nipple confusion. I went back to using the MAM brand.	
1. 	When we were over my moms my daughter didn't have any place other than my lap to eat. My mom doesn't have the space for a big high chair so I ordered this one for her. My daughter loves it and really enjoys eating her food there. Didn't give it 5 stars because my 10 month was able to remove the top tray without a problem, so now she thinks its a game. So we have to remove to top tray since if we don't she removes it with food on it and it gets every where.	
1. 	Bought this for my 2 yr old - she loves it. The stars project in a clear way - no blurriness and they fill her whole room, including ceiling and walls with stars and a moon. The controls are simple and work as they should. I love the automatic turn off feature after 45 minutes. Comes with batteries already and mine has been working with the original batteries for over 2 months (we turn it on every night).	
1. 	I'm a first-time mom of a 2-month-old, and we live in a 3-story house.  I LOVE this monitor.  My daughter often whimpers or full out cries in her sleep, and this monitor saves me from running up and down the stairs over and over only to see that she's completely asleep and fine.  The monitor works great in daylight or in the dark, and has a solid range.  I get great reception no matter where I am in the house--an old house with brick walls.  It even works if I step outside for a moment to take out the trash, grab the mail, etc.  It's also very light and easy to use.  We chose not to mount it to the wall since for now she's sleeping in a bassinet in our room.  It took me a while (probably a month!) to even be okay with leaving her alone in a room with a monitor, but once I took the plunge I was so grateful to be able to see her constantly if I wanted to.  If you can afford it, or convince someone else to buy it as a gift, it is well worth the money.	
1. 	This item was a lifesaver. My baby wouldn't sleep in the co sleeper b/c that matress is hard and he just looked so uncomfortable all swaddeled and his head would lean back when I put him down. Once I bought this, it made him so comfortable he falls asleep. I also use it in his Moses basket. He did spit up some gas medicine on it and it's stained, so that isn't good and he does slide down but I don't know if that is the products fault or the babies. It's a good product, I wish it was a little less $$ so I could buy more. Overall, great buy.	
- 1	This booster chair never made its way out of the box.  Its chemical smell was too noxious to warrant even a peekaboo.  Even the best designed chair fails miserably when you can't stand to get near it for the fumes.  My search continues....	
1. 	It is fast and works great!  It is much faster than the old fashioned way of warming bottles, and it is portable.  We've taken it out of town several times.  Plus, it doesn't leak!	
- 1	I ran a test--I put a new Medela brand membrane on one pump valve and one of these membranes on the other.  The suction on the side with the generic brand membrane was much weaker.  I will be tossing these and purchasing the name brand membranes from now on.  I only give it two stars because it does work, but not as well as the original.  Not worth it to save a few bucks!	
1. 	I know I can live without this stroller but I am so glad I baught it!  Light weight, sturdy, easy folding!  What's not to love!  It takes up less room in my trunk than a stroller with a seat!  I love using this for those quick in and out runs.  Just snap in the car seat and go! Definately will use for any future children!	
1. 	This sun shade is awesome.  Most strollers have useless sunshades.  I should know, I have 5 strollers and only the Quinny Buzz has a relatively decent sunshade.  But even the Buzz isn't great for a sun phobe like me.  I used to drape a blanket on the shade to provide ample protection, but as Baby got older, he didn't really like not being able to see out the stroller so would pull the blanket down.Enter Protect A Bub.  Ties onto the Buzz easily and forms a super sunshade.  I have no concerns taking my kid out with this thing.  Gives great protection (even down to his toes!) and it still lets him see out and feel like part of the action.I got the black one and it took 2 months to receive, so that was a bummer.  But hopefully Amazon got the supply figured out and you will not have to wait so long.	
- 1	the top part is thin hard plastic..  husband and I was afraid it'll hurt baby's gum ,.. when your baby reaches 4 months they put anything in their mouth.. they won't know how to put it the right way.. or when you help them put it in .. obviously it won't stay put.. they take it out and they love to examine what it is and the texture of it.. so therefore they put it back in their mouth but sometimes it just does't always end up the right way.. so the hard plastic that we're afraid of, might hurt baby's growing teeth and his gums.. so we didn't really like it.. but the glow in the dark was pretty alright..	
- 1	OK, this thing took about 7 minutes to assemble and did not require the instructions. It's that easy. The problem - unlike many other walkers, the wheels are small and have little clearance. When on a carpet, they just don't move that well.  On a hard floor, they're perfect. The baby can hardly move on the carpet, and the slightest threshold stops the walker in it's tracks.It has height adjustments (the accordion looking supports) that double as the bouncer. Only not that well. A real bouncer works much better.  This also leans forward when bouncing and moves around.  Tried it once as a bouncer and never again.  Yea, it has a cute factor.  If you're not going to use this on carpets, and don't plan on using the bouncer feature, then it's OK.Quality - So so.  The windshield pops off easily, and the entire thing feels pretty flimsy.  NOT worth the money - at all!	
1. 	What can I say about a potty seat. It fits, his butt fits it, he likes the characters on it, it's easy to clean. Buy it.	
- 1	I purchased these after a lot of research. I was so unhappy with the plastic bottles, they leak, and for the price I paid, they should have been the best. I would not recommend them to anyone.	
- 1	Got water in the clear ball part the very first time I washed them. Like, a lot of water. I'm not giving my baby a toy without washing it first, especially not one that's made in china, and what good is a toy filled with water that's just waiting to grow mold. I guess maybe it's good after all, teaches me a lesson not to buy cheap made in china crap.	
- 1	Okay, not my favorite teething product but not worth my time to return either. I would keep looking if I were you.	
- 1	I bought these for my 2 year old. I got these 10 oz ones, and the smaller ones with handles... both kinds are impossible to suck the liquid out! My daughter was getting frustrated with it, so i tried to see what the problem was.... and even when I tried to suck/chew with all my might to get the drink out... I couldn't get more than a few drops. I tried to poke the spout with a toothpick to see if it was just fused together or something, but nothing worked to make these darn cups work... waste of money!	
- 1	Good concept but as others say the actual food cup is small.  It only fits a baby carrot.	
1. 	The unit is about 4 feet away from the crib and every sound the baby makes can be clearly heard. It even picks up the sound of the a/c unit. I can remain sitting in the chair that's 12 feet away from the unit, nursing the baby and ask my sons in the living room, where the parent unit is located, to bring me a glass a water. I love that the parent unit can be used without batteries.	
- 1	I wanted to block off a wider area that leads to my kitchen so I bought this extra wide span gate. I own the shorter Regalo gate and really liked it. This is basically the same gate but includes extensions. The problem here is that the extensions don't work very well. They are linked by metal rods that are very weak. My toddler can just truck through this gate like the Incredible Hulk and it'll separate at the links. Regalo should just make a larger one-piece gate for those needing a wider solution.	
- 1	Of all the bath toys we bought for our son, this set was the most susceptible to develop mold for some reason. It also feels not as well-made.	
1. 	I can't rate on how easy it was to put together as someone got this as a gift for my baby already assembled:)how thoughtful! What I can say is this dresser is pretty good quality for the price. I know there are alot of reviews on other brands of dressers that say its made of flimsy cheap material; this dresser is not the case. Its heavy and stable. I got the cherry color and it is absoutely gorgeous! The only thing I am questionable about on the dresser are the drawers catch. I was told this is a safety feautre, but I am not sure if that is accurate or not. This dresser even comes with some extra doodads so that you can attach your dresser to the wall-great safety feature. Overall I love this dresser and am planning on getting the 5 drawer soon!	
- 1	I bought these because I wanted very badly to breastfeed my daughter but we were having latch-on problems.  I was told that nipple shields could be helpful for this.I went with the Avent because overall, I am super impressed with their products.  I only use their bottles and pacifiers and have been a happy customer in the past.I don't really recommend these specific nipple shields.  I can't get them to stay in place and they are really akward.  My daughter dislikes using them and I can't get her to nurse with these.If you are in the market for a nipple shield, go with the Medela brand ones.  Those are much easier to use and less akward for baby.	
1. 	This seat is great. It wipes off easily. It's very lightweight. It doesn't slide around when my kid climbs up into it. The one problem we have is that the back is too short. In my experience, kids will lean back whenever they can. Using this seat means I constantly have to tell my kid to sit up straight, which I really don't enjoy repeating 20 times a meal...	
1. 	This chair works as described in the write-up & keeps my 2 yr old grt neice in her seat as it should during meals and such. It is very easy to unfold to use, pls make sure you have fastened this chair to main table chair to ensure the child's saftey while they sit in it. It is also easy to clean after use and to foldup to be stored after use. The chair also works well to be used as a child's chair to watch TV or play games. I would highly recommend it!	
1. 	I bought these to shake the bottles and to put on the bottle to prevent them leaking in the diaper bag. They never leak and they can be sterilized over and over. I use the Dr. Brown's steam sterilizer. Great product...worth every penny!	
- 1	This rocker is great as it has different recline positions. However, it is noisy. When my son is asleep and he moves, it makes creaking noises that wakes him up, which is a problem for me when I'm trying to get things done around the house as he naps. I have to stop and put him back to sleep.	
1. 	Love these pads.  Was sceptical at first because of the lace on one side, but they are less visible through a shirt than ones without lace on the outside.  They ar small, yet absorbant.  I have had them leak but only when they got really wet.  I like that there are 3 pair, but if you order them you might want to order 2 sets.  Don't forget to use the included back when you wash them, they tend to get lost in pants legs and in the washing machine abys.	
1. 	These work so well and don't look intrusive. Had to make a template before installing. The best locks I have found for sliding glass doors leading out to pool area.	
1. 	This little gem fits my faucet perfectly. It doesn't go all the way to the wall as displayed but it doesn't need to. It's tight and the water comes out softly. You can put bubble bath in the trunk. It's super cool. I was a little jealous of my son's bath looking so fun!	
1. 	We love these bags!  We didn't buy a diaper pail, but instead stuff as many diapers as we can in to each of these bags and then tie closed.  It keeps our son's nursery smell free!  He is 8 months old now and we can fit 4-5 diapers into the bag.	
- 1	I am kind of disappointed... This tubeside seat is not as efficient as it seems to be.. Not adapted to every kind of bathtubs.	
- 1	I agree with all the other reviewers that this seller is way overpriced. I made the mistake of thinking I was getting a bulk product but received only one package. What a rip off!	
1. 	I LOVE these bibs!  We've used these and two other types and these are far better.  They're the right balance of water repellent and flexible.  I dont like the cheap plastic Gerber ones because as my daughter moves, they're all over the place.  These stay put like a t-shirt.  Also, they're easily washed.  I threw them in the wash and they even accidentally made it through the dryer too... while I wouldnt recommend drying them, they seemed to survive.Our daughter at 10 months though has figured out how to pull on them to unvelcro them from her neck...so I may end up modifying them to use a snap.  But it doest take quite a bit of effort on her part to get them off.	
- 1	I see babies with these pacifiers and im not sure how are they able to hold on to them.My three months old are having a difficult time holding it.The pacifier is extremely heawy!!!!May be it will work when he is older?!	
- 1	This is cute to look at, but that's about all. It does not function at all in my car. At first I had my carseat behind the passenger seat, and I couldn't fit it around my back seat's headrest at all. I recently moved the carseat to the middle where it's safest. And the middle seat does not have a headrest and it is impossible to attach it to any part of the seat. My car is a 2010 so you would think this mirror would be compatable with newer cars...but it's not at all. I can't imagine this working in anyone's car, no matter what the year or model. Don't waste your money!	
1. 	I just received this bib in pink for my daughter's first birthday. All I can say is I wish I would have bought it myself six months ago when she started eating solids! I absolutely love this bib. It catches everything she drops in the pouch. The neck is soft and ajustable. It doesn't get any easier to clean, just rinse with soap and water and toss in the dishwasher once in a while. It won't tear, stain, or hold food smells. The best part is after my daughter finishes everything on her high chair tray, she reaches into the bib pouch and eats all the stuff that fell in! Save yourself tons of money and buy this bib!!! It would make a great baby shower present, too!	
1. 	Great tub!! This tub was great for spong baths because it comes with a sling so the first baths are a lot easier then having to hold a wet squrimy baby. Once we could give her a real bath the tub held her great. Bath time is one of her favorite times, she just loves splashing around in it!	
1. 	I have used these trays to freeze pureed baby food for my daughter.  I love that this product has a lid.  I haven't had any problems with freezer burn, but I take the food out once it's thawed and put it in a freezer bag so I can reuse the trays.  My only complaint is that the trays are a little bit small for the amount my daughter eats now.  They would have been great for when she was smaller, but she eats more now.  I thaw the cubes overnight in another container, and two cubes won't fit in the other containers that I use.  That's not the fault of this product, just of my system, but it would be nice if the cubes were a little larger.  Overall, though, great product!	
1. 	I got the Lion pillow.  It is not too big and not too small, just right for my 5.5 month old (who is on the big side being 90+ percentile)- fits him now and I can imagine it fitting for more months to come if not years.  Although the material is polyester, it is very soft all around with no noticeable odors. My son loves to use it when he is riding in one of his strollers.  It's a little tight when used on his Recaro ProRide carseat but it still works as it provides him the needed cushioning for viewing out the window without straining and curling his neck to gain a view which he did prior to this pillow.He looks very comfortable using this in both of his strollers, Chicco Cortina and the BumbleRide.The only complaint, minor, is that when the pillow is centered the lion head sometimes covers part of his left face, but easily remedied by pulling the pillow downwards to his left to get the lion head sitting on his shoulder instead of on his face.Would love it even more and willing to pay more if this pillow was made of organic cotton with corn fill.  But all in all very happy with this purchase.	
1. 	I LOVE this bassinet. It has great music and vibration settings, a night light, and it is super cute. You can store little toys (or whatever) underneath. However, my daughter is not a big fan. She will sleep in it, but some nights she is not having it. I would still recommend though because it is a great bassinet and should get a great review even though it is not my daughter's favorite. The only reason i gave four stars is because it is a little difficult to move, but not bad at all. Oh, and it only took about 30-60 minutes to set up.	
1. 	I bought this months ago, and never rated it. 5*'s all the way.It holds in the smell which is why I love it. Even the nasty nose-hair-singe-ing ammonia smell of baby boy urine. blech. When laundry day rolls around I just take the entire top off and upend it straight into the washing machine. And yes, I DO hold my breath. Because baby poo smells about as bad as normal human-sized poo. It'll hold about 15 each of prefolds and covers loosely before you have to start stuffing them in. Sooo about 2-3 days worth, depending. I've gotten away with 5 before.Wouldn't recommend for anything else really. Bags don't really fit in it because of the shape. It's barely too big for a target grocery bag, and just too small for those 'bathroom' sized trash bags on a roll. But it works great for me!!	
- 1	The case material is soft, but it doesn't look very nice once on the pillow. the opening is very loose looking - would be nice if it overlapped - looks sloppy and cheap	
- 1	The baby set seems needed, but it is so stiff that it is hard for my little one to get in and out of it. She has to keep her legs stiff in ofer to get in and that is a process, then the straps connect within the seat and that too is hard to manuever. My 6 month old daughter doesn't like the hard confinement the chair offers. I'm looking forward to her growing a bit so we can try it with straps only and not the baby set.	
1. 	These are great toys not just for the bath, but whenever you need noiseless toys for a baby (when someone in the house is still sleeping at 6 AM, for example). I got a laugh out of the octupus--he has SIX tentacles!	
1. 	Teeth cleaning gel is great but the rubbery finger toothbrush is not great for the finger in it when the infant bites down. It's soft for their gums but I found that for my children I needed to use a soft bristle toothbrush to avoid getting my cover bit through the rubber fiver tooth brush.	
1. 	This is the perfect mat for my Car.  Has compartments for every toy.  Great quality and very heavy duty.  Provides good protection for my seats.	
1. 	My 5-month old son started using this toy about a month ago. It took him a few days to figure it out, but now he really enjoys it. He loves the toys on it and gets so excited spinning around in the seat and kicking his legs! My only complaint is that it took a while to assemble. Also, I haven't be able to get one of the toys on (the one with the bar).	
- 1	This item was missing a toy but most importantly it doesn't go Hugh enough, my some is tall, great for shorter babies Nader 30 in	
- 1	We bought this for our second child in hopes we could move off bottles faster. Tried it at 4 months and flow was entirely too fast. Tried again at 6 months and flow is still too fast for her. Since this is meant for beginning drinkers the flow should be regulated like a slow flow nipple.	
1. 	We were looking for something to cover the catwalk at the top of our staircase/hallway, but we wanted something that wasn't an eye sore!  And, this was it.  It was very easy to use/install.  My husband just measured, cut and hung it up with zip ties.  Nobody can even see it!  We also made a cover for the fireplace, which we used with some strong Velcro-like stuff we got at the drug store.  And, we did the same with our glass shelved entertainment center to keep our little guy out of the electronics.  He still likes to get up there and bang on the plastic, but it's harmless.  This product is awesome and I've recommended it to a couple other people I know who are in the baby proofing stage.	
- 1	This does NOT fit the City Mini GT as previous posts say it does.  Being sent back.  Mad I wasted the time and money trusting other purchaser's reviews to be truthful.	
1. 	I started using this when my daughter was 10 months old and now she's 14 months old.  I don't spend alot of time making sure all the velcro is attached and I never use the seat belt since my daughter is not a wiggler and I never leave her unattended.  I love the 2 little tabs where toys can clip on.  I have 2 special toys that I only let her play with while we're shopping, so she'll fiddle with them during the whole shopping trip.  Almost every trip she'll lean over to put her mouth on the cart, but she has to chew on the cart cover instead!  I've washed this several times and its still in great condition.	
1. 	I love that you can unzip these from the bottom and perform a diaper change at night without having to completely undress the baby.  The fleece blankets are great to layer over footie pjs in the winter to keep baby toasty warm.Good quality material and zipper.	
1. 	I do in-home child care.  I bought one for the hallway on our main floor to block off the bedrooms to the kids.  This product is high quality.  I like it so much, I bought a second for our lower level to put at the bottom of the stairs.	
- 1	We got half a dozen of these to secure the kitchen cabinet doors from a 1 year old. The adhesive is good and so far it has stayed on. The lock is also practically impossible for infants/toddlers to open. My problem has been that 2 of these are already broken. The plastic strap broke right off the connecter and there is no way to fix it. It just snapped and came off. The plastic is a bit rigid and hence it's breaking off easily. In my opinion the design is good and they could have gone with a less rigid plastic strap, even a rubber/fabric strap would've worked.Feb 2013 - Update 1: I had ordered more to replace the broken plastic straps and then just keep breaking. Great product ruined by poor quality material.Jun 2013 - Update 2: Now after being tired of replacing it every time the plastic strap broke I've found a workaround. I used extra shoe laces that were lying around and just folded them into two, cut them in right length and used them in place of the plastic straps. You have to use a filler (any tape) or tie a knot to hold it in place inside the connector. Works great and no fear of it breaking, ever!	
1. 	These are efficient and super easy to clean. I just wash and rinse them on the sink and they are dry after 5 minutes. Love it!	
- 1	I had bought a pack of 3 Kushies wash clothes from a boutique a month or so ago, and absolutely loved them.  I thought these would be the same quality as the others I had bought.  Sadly they are not.  They roll and have a surged edge instead of a nice border like the others I had previously bought.  Don't buy these they are not the same.	
1. 	she loves massaging her gum with this all the time. wished it was more pink than purple.	
- 1	My 11 month daughter has it for 3 minutes and manages to unscrew these.  The valve is too tight, so I often have to remove so she gets enough water, which of course means she is soaked.  Even with the valve, all Lifefactory baby bottles leak if not upright.  I wasn't impressed with Lifefactory baby bottle nipple tops either.	
- 1	cheap and doesn't stay on my baby's head. she hates it. plus you can't fully shampoo her head with it on because it covers up part of her head/hair. it was worth a shot i guess.	
1. 	This warmer is so awsome we bought a second one for our basement because that's were we spend most of our time.  It's true that our son loves warm wipes, when we use the cold ones he usually is very startled and throws his arms out, he also is more likely to pee during a change, which isn't fun either.  We use huggies wipes and don't mind opening the whole lid (it's not difficult) and water doesn't go out like some other parents comented, but the water does go back down to the bottom, which is nice.  Otherwise you have to add additional water.  We just resoak the pad once a week to keep from having brown wipes, and we haven't had one at all.  We will be purchasing the travel warmer because we travel to the inlaws frequently.	
1. 	We bought several swaddles through the 5 months my daughter was swaddled and loved the swaddleme the best, but even the large was too small for her when she hit around 4- 4 1/2 months.  But the small and the large were perfect when they fit DD.  I love the swaddle so much though.  it stayed tight, washed well and was super cute and stylish.  It was nice because you could just put it over the babies clothing.  And our friends were shocked how fast DD fell asleep when we wrapped her up.  She really never got out of this until she got older.  Its a must have for a baby that won't stop moving their hands!!	
- 1	I bought these along with a friend, we went in halves to check them out for our 2 year olds who did not enjoy using a traditional toothbrush.  These are very foul smelling and I would guess tasting as well.  I ended up discarding them.	
1. 	I love the Playtex nursers. They are so easy to use and maintain sterile conditions. You simply drop a new liner into the bottle and attach and clean nipple and it is ready to go.  You can mix the formula right in the bottle, shake it up, and press all the air out by pushing up on the bottom of the liner until the formula squirts out the top. This makes it so the baby doesn't get a lot of gas in his/her tummy.	
1. 	My eight-month-old son likes this one better than any of his friends'!  He got it from grandparents at four months when he was able to sit up alone, and he still plays in it.  His favorite toys are the rolling cyliders, which each make a different sound, though the book's pages are a little hard for him to turn.  The whole thing will rock like crazy when he gets excited (that's a good thing).  Just don't hit the cow button!  It terrifies him.	
- 1	Our 2 year old can literally pull these off the doorknob with just 15 seconds of trying.  They slow him down enough to hear what he's trying to do (which usually allows us to catch him), but they don't stop him from getting the door open.  I wouldn't recommend these if your child is mischievous or smart/mechanical.	
1. 	We bought Playtex bottles for the first 2 kids, and just in time for the new baby, we received this set free from Amazon. My wife is a Family Nurse Practitioner and she considers this type of bottles the best for our kids. The main reason? When the baby drinks her milk out of the bottle, pressure builds up inside. With regular bottles, it is very easy for the silicone/plastic nipple to contract so it makes up for the milk that was taken out. That in turn makes it hard for the baby to continue drinking. One solution would be to constantly turn the regular bottle or just take it out and pull the nipple out once in a while. With this Playtex set, you do not have to worry about it. It is very convenient and the nipple does not get stuck to the bottle. The only potential downside is having more pieces to clean - as each bottle has 2 extra pieces to help with the pressure flow on the bottom. This is definitely recommended. For kids 1-year and older, we prefer thePlaytex 3 Pack BPA Free Ventaire Crystal Clear Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce, as they have a smaller diameter and easier to hold.	
1. 	This thing is a must have for all new moms! They may be a bit pricey, but they are worth every cent and then some!Its of the highest quality also, this I know for a fact. The one I use for my son, was actually my nieces. She used it 5 years ago and  my friend used it for her son 3 years ago. So mine is a little more than 5 years old, has been through 3 babies and after putting it threw the wash it still looks brand new! I plan on saving it for my next baby! =)	
- 1	My daughter loved the sound button and the handles were helpful but the padded part wouldn't stay on the plastic part and pee was constantly underneath it. Don't know if it was the shape or the padded seat moving too much while in use... I got another seat for my daughter and we haven't had any issues with it.	
1. 	My son sleeps with this turtle every night and he turns it on and off by himself (2yrs old) which is good for me so I dont have to keep doing it lol.  The blue turtle glows very brightly on the ceiling and amazons price when I bought it was hands down the cheapest I found it for.	
1. 	I live in a trailer and we have super tiny rooms. This pail is a life saver. Since I'm a stay at home mom just about all the poops go in here but you can never tell there's a poop in the tiny room because it keeps the smell in so well! Just hold your breath when you go to throw another in and do it fast! When my husband takes the trash out at night he apologizes to me for having to deal with that smell. I let him think that I dealt with that smell all day but really my baby's room is always clean and fresh smelling! Just a tip: if you have small rooms or just don't want any bad smell in the room, take the pail else where or even outside to tie off the bag. The pail is super lightweight and the bags last a while!	
1. 	I bought this stool to use while giving my infant a bath. It helps that it has 2 different heights but I found it difficult to use by my bath tub - not because the stool is inefficient but because I have shower doors instead of a shower curtain. I do find that I use it when I sit down on a chair/couch as a foot stool. I haven't used it to store items in it yet because I don't want it to get heavy. Glad I bought it!	
- 1	I'm thinking this pail should be used for babies with diapers under #4.  Anything bigger/heavier and you can't fill it half way without the lid putting up a fight to close which causes the gears to strip past themselves which are what are to close the bag at the top.  We'd love to replace it, but it looks like NO ONE makes anything better.  We gave up on the backing soda dispenser on the top, and bought some A&H; pucks and stuck them under the bag.  This actually seems to have helped with the smell somewhat.  I've gone as far as cleaning the thing with bleach.I wish someone would make one out of metal.  If this design was made with some solid metal gearing it would cost considerably more, but it'd last for years.Good design idea, BAD execution.EDIT: OK someone emailed me about one made by Ubbi that's METAL!!!  OMG it rocks!  So far (2 weeks) and the room is relatively poop smell free.  Our son is 20 months old and MAN do his diapers smell.  Not cheap, but WORTH IT!  Check them out peeps!	
- 1	At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them.	
1. 	First try I bought her pacifiers, I bought these at the grocery store and ever since she will spit out or throw any other pacifiers, but these. More than half the time she'll go right to sleep when I give her her pacifier or she'll calm down. I don't give a crap about color because its not like my daughter cares right now anyways, as long as these do their job and help my daughter stay calm or go to sleep is ALL I care about.	
1. 	This perfect for cleaning bottles. The nipple brush you do have to be careful with it or you can easily poke through the nipple since the metal is exposed that holds the bristles. I use the bottle brush to clean the nipples and have zero issues with it.	
1. 	It said colors may vary but I got the same as shown.  Nothing exciting and does the same function, made well, but looks dull, very dull.... Wish you can pick out your own but these will do for now.	
- 1	I really wanted this to work out because of the price but everything seems to fall off from this. It clips on to anything just fine but it is hard for the stuff to stay in the shelves. Not worth at all	
- 1	I have many Aden and Anais products - swaddle blankets, dream blankets, bibs, wash cloths.  I love these products.  So I had high expectations of this sleep sack.  Very dissapointed to say the least.  It is very thin.  I knew that it was a single layer of muslin; however, it seems thinner than a swaddle blanket, almost see through.  The quality is not what I expect from these products.  I ended up purchasing a Halo sleep sack instead.	
1. 	Very useful, convenient, and has a pretty pattern. It could use a strap of some sort to hold the entire thing shut. Velcro is not great.	
- 1	Me and my 3 babies have tried out 3 playmats (Precious Planet and Rainforest 1-2-3 Musical Gym) and this is the least favorite.I don't like it because quite honestly, it's ugly.  Certainly not something I liked having in my living room.  We actually have some of the other Rainforest products and they are much more attractive.More importantly, the bars are flimsy and don't stay in place.  After only a few minutes the bars lean to one side or the other (despite being held together at the top) and the entire set-up looks like a very large person sat on it.I thought this would be a great mat because there are lights at the top where the bars connect. My son seemed to like this and the music, but I couldn't stand having to fix the bars every ten minutes.Most of the toys that come along with this seem cheap and uninteresting to my babies. (As opposed to the Precious Planet Playmat, which came with higher-quality toys). I ended up tossing them and using other toys to hang.We had this in our house for barely a month before I gave it away. We'll stick with the Precious Planet Playmat.	
- 1	I read the glowing positive reviews of this carrier and decided this was what I was looking for: a flexible carrier without buckles and straps or long yardages of fabric at a reasonable price. It took me a while to decide on ordering the small (I am 5'5). I did have some misgivings about the sizing of this item as it didn't seem like it would fit my husband and I really didn't want to get a separate carrier for him. But we figured since I would be the main person using it, we would try my size first.I read the enclosed instructions carefully and managed to get the K'tan on, albeit with some difficulty. I do realize that this is something that would likely get easier with practice. My stumbling block really came when I tried to put my baby in this carrier. It was very difficult, very awkward and I suspect very uncomfortable for her because she cried every time I attempted to use this. When I finally was able to situate her in this sling her face was mashed up against my chest; when I repositioned her to free up her face, her shoulder ended up being cramped instead. I probably tried to use this carrier about five or six times - not once did my baby like it and not once did I feel comfortable with it. She also got very sweaty every time she was in it so I'd probably opt for the mesh version if it is something you are bent on getting. I ended up returning this.	
- 1	I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money.  Dr. Brown's is the way to go!	
1. 	We have a one year who has been wearing these bibs since her 8th week...  got a bunch of them as hand me downs, along with the usual outfit coordinated bibs (which always seem tiny) and have exclusively used these over all the others.  The colors match every shade of pink in her wardrobe, and the other colors match when you don't want so much pink.  Stains come right out with Shout for food matter, and never had an issue tossing in the dryer on low heat.  Since we got them without the original packaging, never knee they were hang dry recommended.  Still, as long as the velcro ends are matched up, they don'get stuck to other items.  And the velcro is such a great, strong one that our daughter can't rip these off like she does the wimpy decorative ones.  And they are the perfext thickness for using with the Playtex Binky tethers--clip on easily and remove easily without marring the bib material.  I swear, these are the only bibs anyone needs.  Buying more because a few have gotten misplaced at daycare (aka put in another kid's cubby and the parents didn't want to return them because they're that good!).  May buy the boys colors too for even more color matching potential to outfits.	
1. 	these are wonderful, they were recomended by a friend of mine and i have no regrets. no other bottle compites with avent!	
- 1	After purchasing these i saw another brand wirh smaller rings in a set this id sort of big for a baby mouth	
1. 	We love this on the go bottle warmer.  All you do is bend a small piece of metal within the plastic bag filled with fluid, and a reaction hardens the fluid and it becomes warm.  To use again just boil the bag for 15 minutes and use it over and over again.  I am giving it a 4 star rating because it isn't easy to find additional warming bags. We found Dex Products has a similar warming bag at diapers.com, but haven't purchased it yet.	
- 1	I couldn't find any comparative reviews on different brands of nipple shields when I was trying to decide which one to purchase. I ended up buying the Medela Nipple Shield (20mm), the Philips Avent Nipple Protector and the Tommee Tippee Nipple Shield. Here are my reviews and pictures of the 3 different brand:Medela Contact Nipple Shield (20mm)This is the brand recommended by my lactation consultant. It's made of the thinnest silicone of the 3 brands and sticks the best. The height of the nipple part is a little too high for me and baby often makes a choking sound when trying to latch in the beginning. I LOVE how the Medela brand makes these in two sizes: 20mm and 24mm. It comes with just one shield, which makes it the most expensive of the 3.Philips Avent Standard Nipple ProtectorI purchased this based on looking at the product pictures, hoping that it would not be as high. Unfortunately, it is just as high as the Medela Nipple Shield, but also wider and thicker, making it difficult to stay in place and get baby to latch. Comes with 2 shields.Tommee Tippee Nipple ShieldThis nipple height was the least of the three brands. In theory, the extra cut outs along the side of the nipple part is supposed to promote more skin to skin contact, but as another reviewer stated, all it did was making my nipples sore because it would get sucked through the holes. Comes with 2 shieldsTake a look at the pictures to see the differences side by side. I hope this is helpful to those in search of nipple shields.	
1. 	The hospital that I gave birth in had this stool in all of its rooms.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon when searching for something to make nursing in our new rocker more comfortable - I am quite short, so I needed something for my feet to rest on.  I use this stool every night in the middle of the night while nursing and rocking our baby.	
1. 	Revived this has a gift for our daughter, loved them so much, I purchased sets for two other people.  Both sides are cloth with the plastic in the middle	
1. 	During my first pregnancy, I used a Boppy pillow because it was smaller and took up less room in my bed.  That pillow worked ok but for my second pregnancy I wanted something that would support me better.  I researched this pillow and was very impressed by how comfortable it was.  I bought this during my 4th month and I was able to sleep restfully each night!  I was very impressed.  The reason I am giving this four stars is because into my 8th month I thought it was getting a little flat and I did not feel it held up as well as it should of - after only using it for four months.  Of course, by this time in my pregnancy I was uncomfortable a lot (not just when I was sleeping) so this may be a factor too. I still did not sleep without it!  As far as the size - it is bigger especially since I was used to a Bobby sleep pillow which was half the size but I am 5' 8 and and the length of it worked for me!	
- 1	This wipe solution has good essential oils and smells nice, but it is way too expensive!  You might as well use disposable wipes, because you won't save any money with cloth wipes if you use a solution like this every time.  After I went through a bottle of this, I decided to save money by mixing my own solutions.  There are a lot of recipes out there or you can make your own, save a lot of $$, and fill your child's individual needs.  I personally just use a tablespoon of baby wash and a tablespoon of coconut oil mixed with 2 cups of hot water.  This makes enough wipes to last three or more days, and it costs barely anything.  The coconut oil helps heal or prevent any rashes while the wash cleanses.  The wipe solution won't do either.	
1. 	Since this mirror mounts to the headrest above baby, you don't have to worry about suction cups failing to stay on the glass (so it's safer and far less frustrating). And the swivel joint is sturdy enough to STAY IN PLACE once you set it where you want it. Mirror does not jiggle too much either. And it's plenty large enough to see almost all of my little guy, but small enough that it DOES NOT OBSTRUCT my view.	
- 1	Not sure this is really necessary. The same could be accomplished by placing the bottle and blue insert in dishwasher. For the nipple and cream colored part we use Madela microwave sterilization bags. Didn't think the dr browns basket cleaned the nipples well ...the water doesn't get well in there	
- 1	it was super tight for my 3 month old and she cried every time we tried to put it on her so we stretched it out by leaving it on something wide but then we tried it on to our self realized that you can hear everything from outside even the small TV sounds. I don't see why it is named protector earmuffs. We can't even use it for going movies with my baby. It is total wast and want money back!!	
1. 	It is so easy to use. You never have to change any cartridges and you can use an ordinary garbage bag. I love it and we have never had any smell escape from it.	
1. 	Oh the diapers are not really a stinky issue if your baby is young and you breastfeed him or her. But just you wait until you introduce those solids. Phew!!! I suggest you get one of these right off the bat and go straight to using the green liners for toddler diapers. They are thicker and hold the stench at bay way better than the wimpy blue liners. Just remember to empty that sucker out every other day or even the Diaper Genie will abandon you to the Smell Genie.	
- 1	I like the scent but if only i was a litle stronger tocarry all around the room, youhave to place like one on each cornerwhen you walk into the room youwon't smell it unless you actually sniff it	
1. 	My son uses this style of nipple. It really helps with him inhaling air while he eats. Since we switched to the wide nipples his gas, tummy aches, and projectile vomiting has stopped.	
1. 	Our little girl is now 9 weeks and she's been sleeping in this since we brought her home at 48 hours.	
1. 	We have tried many good brands, but this one is amazingly better . It makes my toddler's hair much smoother than all other brands we got.	
- 1	Got this swing months before my son was born. Everything worked great at first and the lights were adorable. Has many options for swing speeds, options of having music off or music on with lights or not at all. The swing adjustment is great, my son preferred the side to side swinging. My son loved it and put him right to sleep in the side to side position My baby used it a total of 5 times, FIVE TIMES. And now the only thing that works is the swinging motion. The lights nor the music no the mobile will turn on! I noticed the music and lights lagged to turn on, but it finally gave out. and it only took 5 times. I will be calling to see if its recalled or they have a replacement part they could send me. HUGELY disappointing!!	
1. 	Amazing product, my LO loves it for teething.  We freeze breastmilk or food and give it to him and he loves it.  It's like a ice cream for him	
- 1	We have been using these for a few months now.  I bought my first set at a big box store and loved them.  We had no issue with the durability of the spout.  I thought I would buy some replacements online from amazon.  The spout on the cup that amazon sells is awful (it's the same nuby no spill cup, same size, same everything - except the valve design).  The older version has an X on the silicone top to prevent too much vacuum/suction from building up.  It worked great.  This new model has a round valve in it's place, and it doesn't work at all to prevent too much of a vacuum from the suction building up in the cup.  The spout was completely inverted when I took it out of my daughters mouth and I has to loosen the top to get it to go back to normal.  I tried manually pushing the valve in, no luck. I took the top off and fiddled with the valve in hopes that it was just stuck together because it's new, no luck.  Not loving these, and will have to hunt for the older model.  Which also came with a handy cover, and these don't.	
- 1	The little characters are really cute and my son loves them. However, most of the characters are hard to squirt and pretty much impossible to get all of the water out. My son also couldn't really push the characters together to link them. I had bought this at a store and didn't see the reviews until I was looking for a new bath toys :(The two stars are for being cute and having the hanging bag, which could be reuse for other bath toys.	
- 1	This crib rail guard did stop by toddler from chewing on the wood rails of her crib. It stuck on well enough, and fit well over the wood of the front of the crib too, but the plastic has a sticky feel to it (even the upright side that isn't supposed to stick to anything). I noticed when putting the baby in the crib, her blanket or clothes would sometimes stick to it. I ended up buying the cloth crib rail guards which look better and can be put in the washing machine. I'd recommend the cloth tie-on rail guards over this one.	
- 1	The first product photo doesn't show the actual labels.  Click on the second photo to see what a label really looks like.  Each label is branded with the company's name, which I find really annoying.  They also look like a really low-quality printer made each label.  I'm just not very impressed with these.That said, they work well.  I just wish they looked a little nicer.	
1. 	This is just fantastic. We previously were using the lulaby bear but the darn thing kept messing up. We went through three of them before finding this. Here is the break down:Good1. Can have it play all night or use the automatic shut off.2. Tons of sounds to choose from3. Small, fits in our playards little rack where we keep diapers and such. Also easy to pack when staying somewhere overnight.4. Has the option to plug in to save money instead of wasting batteries, but the battery option is nice to have two since you do not always have an outlet everywhere.5. Can program it to play one sound, play two sounds at the same time (such as rain w/ thunder), or you can choose the option for it to play sounds at random.6. Easy Easy Easy to use. I never even read the instruction manual.Bad:1. It does not go real real loud.To give an example of how loud it goes. If we turn it up to full volume and close the bedroom door we can hear it (it is on the far side of the room away from the door, our room is an average master bedroom) if there is not another sound going on. But if the T.V, dishwasher, dogs, or shower is running anywhere in the house we cannot hear it. That is more than enough for us, especially since it is right next to our babies crib and as long as he hears it we are happy. Also when we go to bed and all things are off in the house we have to turn it down to its lowest volume otherwise it is too loud. I hope that helps!!	
- 1	I have no idea how this cup is so highly rated, because it is honestly the worst cup I've ever bought. It leaks so horribly, I had to change my son's clothes the first time I gave it to him. Yes, it was perfectly closed, but it just leaks, from the straw and the sides and all over.I have a Playtex one and was upset because it leaked when my son would shake it but after buying this one here, I think the other one is great.	
1. 	Personally I like it, easy to install and use. But I had to return because it didn't work on the shape of my toilet.	
1. 	We used these when our daughter was little so we wanted to get them for our son when he reached an age where he could be trusted with a snack but not without a lid!  Unfortunately, you have no control over what colors come so our son received a purple and pink one and a green and blue one.  Again, not a huge deal but I would have given it five stars if you could pick the color.  The product itself is great.  The lid stays on very tightly even with little hands constantly reaching in for snacks and it holds up well over many trips through the dishwasher.	
- 1	at first, I was so happy with this.However, someone gave me a real cloud b turtle and then I noticed that this looked like an imitation.To make things worse, I discovered another seller at a local market that sells an imitation for half the price of this one.The real cloud b turtle is of good quality.	
1. 	I love these bottles. They are not my favorite kind, but I am very pleased with them. I only gave it 4 stars because the nipples it came with were no good and had to be replaced, but other than that I am satisfied.	
- 1	Only in the very loosest sense is this a piano toy.  The three keys are all connected, making one big key, and the two sharp/flat keys aren't keys at all--they're they light-up part and are fixed in place.The worthwhile part of this toy is the spinner on top, which is fun for the very young, but it's also easy to find similar spinners on better toys.  The handle is a nice touch, but the size of the toy makes it hard for infants to hold.  And when they're able to hold it and move around (young toddlers love carrying toys with them, just because they can), the toy itself has long since ceased to be interesting.The other good thing about this toy is that it isn't too loud.  I wish there were more positive things about this toy.  It's a cute idea and ven the very young would love the cause and effect learning of being able to press separate keys to make different tones (or, at least, activate a different song for each key).Bottom line:  Skip it.  There are better spinners (Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle, for instance) and better smallish musical toys (Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes, for instance) for young and old babies alike.	
1. 	We recently bought a pack of these and they are the best cups out there. When dropped, the rubber valves stay in place. They are very easy to drink from and have a small spout which is easier for little mouths. The cars designs are so cute. They almost look 3-D with cute race track back grounds. Lightening McQueen is pictured on both cups. Can't go wrong with these cups. Highly recommended. Easy to clean too.	
1. 	This boppy is a must have for breastfeeding and tummy time! Highly recommend it!	
1. 	We found this book at a rummage sale and found it to be so useful, especially when several people are helping with the baby (ex: visiting family, etc.)  We loved it so much that I've bought another one and have almost filled that one too.  I like having the room to write things about our baby's day and development, plus use the Notes section to write some story, etc.  It also helps Dad see what has happened that day and feels more connected.  I will be buying another one soon!	
1. 	I was a little hesitant about getting this but I am really glad I did! My little girl (2) is terrified of those huge public bathroom seats and cries every time! I wasn't sure how this seat would work on them but I am grateful that they do! Make sure the seat is positioned on the BACK of the toilet for support. It seems to be of pretty good construction and materials and my girl loves that it's padded! It comes with a carrying case which my daughter now calls her potty purse and is happy to go to the bathroom. That is a big breakthrough during the potty training stage! Would recommend, and even if it doesn't last more than 6 months at a time I will still buy another. It's cheaper than pull ups and now that she uses the public bathrooms we can go out in normal big girl underwear!	
1. 	I really like this tub. I first bought the Summer Infant bath with the spray,and while I still really miss the spray, this tub is MUCH MUCH better and makes bath time less stressful. I bought it after my son was a newborn, so I didn't get to use the sling feaure. Right now he is using the sling as a back rest and sits up in the seat. WOW that makes all the difference! He can sit upright and I can bathe him much better than before. I can use both hands, too. The toys that come with it are a great little addition, it helps with washing hair and getting baby clean.(but the toy that attaches to the side is kinda useless!) The drawbacks are that it doesn't look like it will truly hold a toddler but we will see. It's hard to wash the back of it b/c of it's shape, but that is minor. Also, the plug doesn't drain the water at all, you have to hold it up to get it out. Other than that,it's a great tub that doesn't take up much space. And it really does look cute. I would reccommend this over what I used to have b/c you can sit the baby up. that makes so much of a difference! It's a little too expensive but pretty well worth it.	
- 1	I didn't realise how small this set is when I ordered it. Nothing really fits, other than to use it as a plate for snacks. Also the two attachable smaller parts never stay on, and keep falling off/spilling. Not worth it at all!!	
- 1	I thought this would be great for my teething baby, but the vibration freaks him out.  He wants nothing to do with it.  =(  It might be a wonderful product for other babies, though!  It appears to be well-made.	
1. 	Excellent product.  Simple to install and effectively ends all worries about my son accidentally choking on the rubber end of a typical door stop.	
- 1	I use an electric double pump and returned to work a few weeks ago. I bought this manual hand pump in case i was traveling or somewhere and couldn't use my electric pump. The first time I used it was after a wedding and it seemed to work fine. It was very efficient and I was impressed with how much milk I got considering it was manual. The pump was a bit loud but it worked. However, I used it again the other day and my experience was not so great. I forgot a part to my electric pump at home and remembered i had this one in my car. I decided to use it instead of driving home to get my parts. I figured it would take longer to pump but would still be effective. Unfortunately it was very painful and i had to stop pumping. I usually pump 3 times at work and could only do one regular length and one really short time. I'm still sore and raw the next day and its painful when my son nurses. I'm disappointed. It was the first time it actually hurt to pump. The pain I'm feeling is not worth using this pump again. Next time I'll drive home to get my parts!	
- 1	My little guy loves drinking out of cups.  I thought these would be perfect for him while learning.  They make just as much mess as an open cup though.  I was pretty disappointed because I love Avent products.  I still have them in the cupboard though just in case.	
1. 	This stroller frame is easy to use, light, folds nicely, has a big storage basket and navigates well.  I highly recommend getting this to use with your infant carrier vs. a travel system.	
- 1	Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.  But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations.I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.  After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my diapering diapers for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!	
1. 	I absolutely love ALL Avent products... their bottles, bottle-warmer, pacifiers, etc.Both of my boy used the Avent bottles, and the ones my first-born used are still being used by my second one. Yes, sometimes there is a slight leak when shaking... I found that is from formula powder getting stuck between the nipple and the bottle, and breaking the seal. So, when it happens I just wipe the rim of the bottle, take the nipple out of the ring, rinse the nipple and ring, and then the problem's gone. These bottle seem virtually indestructible to me, and haven't discolored with age of anything. (Although, old nipples do discolor.)It's hard to believe my mom gave me bottles with little bags in side... what a pain and mess that must have been!!!	
1. 	My kids love this little turtle. I love that it does not change color by itself or spin, like others, that was a little dizzying. This one is nice, and the kids like it a lot. They use it as a nightlight and something to look at while falling asleep. Great buy.	
1. 	I purchased my first boppy when my middle child was born. Hes now 2 and I purchased this one for my now 5 month old.Well first things are first, it IS a breastfeeding pillow, but its also MUCH more!*  First of all, breast feeding with the boppy isnt IDEAL, but it works. I am able to sit comfortably, with my son quite comfortable. I have heard that the brest friend is better for this, but since the boppy has more uses, I prefer it.*  Same with bottle feeding, you can have the baby feel like hes nursing, so dads, you wont be left out!*  When its tummy time, you can use the boppy to prop up your baby. Niether of my boys would stay on their tummies without the boppy with them.*  I used this (and still do) to prop up the boys for sitting up. My baby can sit up unnasisted, but he still prefers to do so with the boppy.*  I also loved that my toddler (and 4 1/2 year old!) likes to use the pillow to watch T.V on, and its GREAT for doing arts and crafts on (on the floor).*  I tend to use it on long car rides, its great neck support and really makes me feel comfortable. I also steal them when I sleep!*  The kids find many things to do with the boppys, including pillow fighting with them, using them as a desk while sitting on the couch, wearing it as a headband, using it as a headrest while watching T.V on thier backs, and making a boppy circle (you will need two, facing eachother forming a circle) and sitting in it!*  I also like that the boppy can be used outside with the vinyl cover. It protects your boppy, and also makes it GREAT when the kids are doing arts and crafts on the floor, they are leaning on your favorite pillow, and its okay!*  As far as washing your boppy, you can throw the WHOLE THING into the washing machine. When you throw it in the drier, throw in a tennis ball too, all of the smells, stains, and other things will soon dissapear after boppy is washed. It also doesnt fade all that much.As of now, the boppy has proven to be a source of endless fun, and is very useful! I fully anticipate keeping the boppy way after my baby becomes older... thats how great it is!	
- 1	Overall the camera is great when we got it.  Was impressed by the range, sound, and picture.  About 8 months after the first one the night vision stopped working.  Got lucky and when I bought it Amazon had a one year return on it.  Explained what happened and their great customer service exchanged it for me.  Now this time it has only been 5 months and the night vision went out again.  It was a brand new unit.  So it was not just a one time issue.  If you don't care about the night vision I would recommend this camera.  If it is one of the reason you are purchasing the unit I would go with another model.	
1. 	This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.	
- 1	I wanted to like this tray since it got such good reviews.  It was pricey for what you get but I thought I would try it.  I had a hard time removing the frozen food without letting the container partially though.  This was not an ideal solution for me.  I prefer the Baby Sprout containers.	
- 1	This is a very cute cover and I love that it folds up into a small bag so it's easy to carry with me in my diaper bag. I just don't like the fabric. It makes keeping it in place impossible without slipping. I also wish the harness was higher or 5-point so my son couldn't easily get out of it. I'll probably be getting a different kind in the near future. This was not worth the money.Edit: After using this cover a little more often I've really started to not like it and decided to change my review to 1 star. It does slip but the hardest thing about it is it doesn't fit all carts. I'd say it fit about 50% of the time... so in my opinion, what's the point? It's definitely worth getting a different, more realistic cover, not this one.	
1. 	I also purchased this exact item from Babies R Us for $16.99 only, so I would not recommend buying it for the $39.99 price. It seems like Amazon sells it for $13.99 only, but is currently out of stock, so if you can, wait for it to come back in stock or go to BRU instead!Like others have mentioned, my wedge is only one piece, not 2 with a cover and zipper or whatnot. There's nothing else that comes with the one wedge, and it does look exactly like the picture above. My son has only slept on it for a little while, so I can't say for sure if it's doing anything yet, but with his reflux and constant burping/spitting up even up to 1-2 hours after a nap, I don't think any sort of incline can hurt him at this point. I also use rolled up blankets to secure him in place, so he doesn't slide downwards, and it works just great.The wedge is a really sturdy piece of foam, and it almost matches the firmness of my son's crib mattress too, theColgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White, which is kind of nice. Overall, no complaints about this wedge. Not 100% sure if it works well yet, but for the price, I'm happy to try it out if it can do anything for my son's sleep.	
- 1	As soon as I got this I tried it on the pack n' play mat.  It fit perfectly and I wondered why the other reviews said it was too small.  It wasn't until I washed it once that I saw what they were talking about.  After one wash, the sheet shrunk to the point where I can't use it.  I should have spent a few extra dollars and got the name brand sheet.  I will buy the name brand sheets in the future.	
- 1	I ordered this bc of the 'airyness' of the product. I thought it looked sporty and would be great for walks bc it gets so hot in the summer. I was disappointed bc 1) the material is very stiff and was cutting into my baby's leg, 2) the fit was so much different from the babybjorn miracle organic. The organic gave so much more support. I usually walk about 40mins with the baby in the miracle organic but after 10 minutes with the airy I had to go home bc my back was hurting... I don't recommend this. I gave it a 2 star only bc the look is cool.	
- 1	Im a man and I can hardly tighten the straps.  My wife cannot pull the strap to tighten the straps.  The plastic clip across the chest does not snap well and this is only 3 months old	
1. 	Love these bibs. They clean up so easily. They are great for first foods when it's pretty liquid and just slides down the front of the bib. Our baby loves to suck his food off of the bib. It's a really nice texture for babies. I always just wash it off, wring it out, and strap it onto the high chair to dry out. Works great and is always dry by the next time we need it.	
- 1	I do not reccommend this product, I accidentally knocked this over one day and the white part cracked and fell entirely off after owning it one week. Two weeks later the clear piece that is on the inside of the rim fell off as well.On top of that this is TINY !! I can't believe how small it is.	
1. 	Igot this product on time. Was exactly what we needed for their changing table. The color fits well with their bedroom and it's good quality as well. I've washed it so many times and it still has it softness and color! Great!	
- 1	My son actually loves this cup and wanted to carry it around with him everywhere. Unfortunately he also loved chewing on the straw which ripped open at the top after just a few days of use. I'll admit that my son is a chewer but I think if the quality of the straw material had been made more durable, it would have taken him much longer to wear it down. Aside from the straw issue, the logo on the cup began rubbing off after just one hand washing. One other thing that bugged me was that the hourglass shape of the cup actually interferes with how the weighted straw works. When the weighted part of the straw slides backward as the cup is tipped, it can actually get hung up in the middle of the cup where that indentation is, making it difficult for the straw bottom to reach the pool of liquid. So, I'm pretty disappointed and will be trying the Zoli cup.	
1. 	My son would just pull these off the table.  I did better with the plastic ones that stick.	
1. 	Works really well! Easy to use. Easy to clean. The top is nice and secure so I'm not afraid it will spill. Will work well as a snack cup when my daughter is a little older. Very happy with my purchase.	
1. 	About 5 months into my pregnancy I was really having trouble getting comfortable at night.  Regular pillows as barriers, did not work well. I looked into several pillows and purchased this one because it was a total body pillow.  It's been so nice because I can put it behind me and between my legs, which keeps me from rolling on my back (I'm 5'2, and feel like I have more pillow than I need, which tells me it would work for a taller person).**I recommend purchasing a cover for this pillow**  I thought I would just use the white cover that it comes with, but found out I really needed a pillow case!  Still worth absolutely EVERY PENNY!!**Also, there was a paper included with the pillow that showed 8 different ways to use the pillow including nursing positions, which I found very helpful (because I won't need to purchase another pillow for nursing later).Update:-I did purchase a boppy pillow for nursing.  I found that for a chair or couch, this pillow is just too big and bulky.  It would probably be great if you are staying in bed to nurse, though.-We have a queen sized bed and I had enough room.-Still so glad I had this pillow during pregnancy!	
- 1	I have not been able to measure the temperature with this device. I tried it on myself, my spouse, and my baby. Each time the temperature reading was different and completely off from a normal temperature when all three of us were healthy. I can't imagine using it when the baby is actually sick.	
- 1	I've been disappointed with every Munchkin sippy cup I've purchased.  This one is no exception.  Liquid collects outside of the valve where the liquid comes out and once tipped over it sprays everywhere.  It's definitely not spill/nor leak proof as stated.  It's fine for using outdoors with water so we'll continue to do that, but in the house I'll have to rely on something better.	
1. 	I have two car seats for my 9 month old, this seat and the Evenflo Triumph 5 which everyone just raves about.  This seat, I'll admit, is not the easiest to install rear-facing.  However, I take my seats to the fire station down the street and have them do it and avoid the hassle.  They have pool noodles and anything else they might need there to install properly.  This seat took a large and small pool noodle to fit well in my Honda CRV (middle rear seat).What I love about this seat:- it will last my child a LONG time, up to 100 lbs.- the harness straps are easily adjustable with the red handles at the top, no rethreading.  (you do have to unthread and rethread to get the infant head rest off though, we never used that.  I did find that to be simple though).  There are quite a few levels of harness height, more than just the three that many carseats have.- The chest clip does not have huge pointy things on it like the Evenflo.  It is easy for an adult to clip and unclip.  The Evenflo's I often have to refasten then try to unfasten again, it catches funny.  The pointy things on the Evenflo I have poked my baby's face with accidently more than a few times while trying to get his squirmy self strapped in.  I LOVE the fastener on the Alpha-Omega by far.- Baby does not like the chest clip on the Evenflo much, it is bulky and he fusses big time when I try to get it at armpit level...the flatness of the clip on the Alpha Omega is a plus, he lets me slide it right up to his chest, in the safest position.- The crotch fastener is SUPER-EASY on the Alpha-Omega, practically one step.  You line up the magnetic ends of the harness straps which fit together easily then put in the buckle.  I hate how I have to put two buckles in the Evenflo, the Alpha-Omega has made this so much easier.- The Evenflo has a memory strap system which I hate...two straps that you have to thread both arms through, the Alpha-Omega only has one.  I can reach the Alpha-Omega's strap adjuster easily, even rear-facing.  You're not supposed to adjust the recline in the rear-position, it's supposed to stay fully reclined (in rear-facing) all the time according to the instruction manual.- My baby falls asleep easily in both carseats.  He fusses some while I put him in the Evenflo because it takes so long to get him fastened in and he would rather get moving. :)- Both carseats appear comfy.  The Evenflo maybe more so.  I like the way the Evenflo has the bicycle foam, that's one area the Alpha Omega could improve on.  Both are rated safe by Comsumer reports in crashes.In my opinion, the installation issues (how often are you going to install it? once, twice?) for this carseat are small in comparision to the everyday convenience of the strap system and buckles.  I can have my son buckled in in less than 10-15 seconds.  I do have issues with the buckles on the straps getting twisted, but not enough to make me dislike the carseat, everything else just works so smoothly with it.	
1. 	I wrote a review the other day as i was ordering more of the 8oz standard dr browns bottles and advised how wonderful i thought those were. i did not know there were wide neck versions of dr browns until i saw them online that day. i decided not to order them at that time because there were some bad reviews about the nipple and leaking, etc.  well i really liked the design of the wide neck bottle and decided to try them anyway a few days later. i am glad i did, i am so happy with them that i exchanged the 8 oz standard bottles for 8 oz wide neck bottles. my baby has an easier time with this nipple and is finishing more formula faster than with the standard size. the wider nipple base keeps her from putting the whole thing in her mouth and she is spilling less out the sides of her mouth. the wide neck bottles fit in the diaper bag better and its easier to pour formula into them. i have not had any problems with leaks (read the directions that come with the bottles). i recommend both styles of dr browns bottles as they truly do eliminate the gas and colic, you just have to try both styles to see which nipple works best for your baby. i used the standard ones for 2 months and cannot complain, but i do like the wide ones better now having tried them.	
- 1	Difficult if not impossible to fit on spout, has no hole for shower pull. The paint was also already wearing off ontop the hippos head, like it might have already been used?	
- 1	A friend of a friend installed these on all her windows thinking she made her blinds safe.  Two month later, her 2 year old son was able to get the cord out of the cord windup device.  He ended up hanging himself on the cords and died.  He was supposed to be taking a nap.  It is safer to spend the money and go CORDLESS!!!  But if you must keep your corded blinds, get the Fashion Wand (approved by PFWBS).  Go to Parents for Window Blind Safety (PFWBS) website and read all the testimonials of kids who died or were severely injured by blind cords.  Watch the videos they have of kids bypassing or breaking safety devices on cords in less than 30 seconds.  And then decide if you want to install a safety kit or remove the danger altogether.  If she could go back 1 year ago, she would take down every corded blind in her home so she'd still have her son with her.	
- 1	I had high hopes for this activity gym. It changes position so a baby can by lying down or sitting or standing to play with it. But. Ours broke. My son is only 7 months. We have had this for probably only 4 months. He is sitting and standing up on things now but I can't change the position it is in!! It is stuck in the lying down position. Now I have changed the position many times before so it is not user error. The little teal/blue buttons that you press to release it are no longer functional.	
1. 	The HALO sleepsacks have been really great products, and we have used them from birth to almost a year, so far.  Most other reviews talk about the awesomeness of the sleepsacks, so I just want to mention one thing- the sleepsacks come in lots of different materials, with different warmth ratings.  These tog warmth ratings are available on halo's website- there are actually even warmer sleepsacks than this one, for instance, like the ones made of valboa. We used the warmer ones in the winter, and the difference between the micro-fleece and valboa ones was actually very large.  Our cold apartment was not a problem when my daughter was wearing the valboa sleep sack, but the micro-fleece one was a better choice for the early fall, the spring, and the summer.	
1. 	This SleepSack is great. It swaddles perfectly. As it turns out my son hates to be swaddled, so we'll be giving this away and replacing it with a wearable blanket.The fleece is super soft and warm, perfect for winter nights.The zipper zips down, rather than up, making for really easy diaper changes at all hours while keeping the baby warm.The only downside is the sound the velcro makes opening. Its startling to my son, but honestly the velcro does seem quieter than some I've used, and I don't know how else this would give such a secure swaddle.For reference, my son was born at 9 pounds even and is 20.5 inches long. The newborn size fits him well right now, but would likely need to be replaced with a bigger size in a month or two.	
1. 	These are way better than those bulky plugs my son tried to take these out but he couldn't. I totally approve of these.	
1. 	I was a little skeptical at first.  But this cube is a lot of fun! There are instruments on each side that can be turned on and off while contributing to the main song.  You can have a piano solo, and then add other instruments on top.  Well built cube, should last a long time!	
1. 	I registered for this tub after reading the reviews on this site, and I couldn't be happier. It is perfect for newborns because of the sling, and has plenty of room for a growing baby. I would strongly recommend getting a thermometer that shows the actual temperature of the water instead of relying on items to change color when the water is too hot.	
- 1	We have the twig accessory and I definitely recommend that over this one.  I can't get anything (bottle parts, pacifiers, or teething rings) to fit on the petals because they are so close together and too wide, and the stamens can't support much weight.  We primarily use Avent bottles and the only part that works on here is the ring that goes in the collars, but you can only put a few on the stamens because of the spacing and the weight.  I wind up just using them for smaller nipples (Dr. Brown's, Medela) but even then I can barely get three on there (the bases run into each other) and it doesn't really save much space.	
- 1	It arrived broken.  Total waste of time. We also tried the portable model.  It stopped working after 2 weeks.  If I could I would give -5 stars for both models.	
- 1	I've never had a problem cutting my baby's nails with other nail clippers but I thought the magnifying glass would make it easier. I actually cut her finger trying to use the magnifying glass. It's difficult to use and pretty useless. I won't be using it again.	
1. 	My little one loves these bottles. The size is perfect and the design makes it easy for her to hold.  The drop-ins make clean up easy!	
- 1	I thought the fabric on this felt cheap and the black &#34;leather&#34; parts were very obvious that they were plastic (and cheap thin plastic at that).  All in all, I was very disappointed with this product and returned it.	
1. 	I would've given this 5 stars, only I'm not sure if it was the blanket or just a coincidence?  I used the blanket for 2 days without much observance of any huge improvement in my 3 month old son's sleeping...but then again I left his arms out during those 2 days because I am trying not to swaddle him too often.  However, on the 3rd day, I swaddled him the correct way and he slept for a 7 hour stretch for the first time!  On the second night I swaddled him properly, he slept 6.5 hours.  So I'm guessing it was the miracle blanket, or it could be that he just turned 12 weeks and is starting to sleep longer stretches.  But so far, I have no complaints about this blanket!  Definitely worth a try.	
1. 	The play yard gate system works well.  It is a little taller than I expected.  The design is good that my daughter can't stick her hands or feet in the openings so I don't have to worry about her climbing out.  I can open and close it with one hand which is nice.  I would recommend this product.  Good value.	
1. 	I own 3 of these and so glad I do.  They definitely do the job and then some.  I wouldn't put a car seat in my car without one of these.  Grey blends in well with our honda grey leather seats.	
- 1	This is well made but the wings that wrap around create 3 layers of very thick fleece that was far too hot for our house - I would even say in most circumstances it would be dangerous.  We cut our wings right off and used as a regular sleep sack. We keep our thermostat on 68 at night and live in Maine so I'm not sure who would be using this.	
1. 	We purchased this about 9 months ago and it has worked great. The wipes stay warm and they haven't dried out. It's VERY important to rinse out the pad inside every week or else it gets crusty and dirty. I've replaced the pad every few months. I would have given 5 stars but after about 8 months the lid stopped shutting and we were putting a tissue box on top to keep the lid down. I returned it to Amazon, free return shipping and they replaced the product- the lid seems to work much better on this one. It's one of those not necessary products but we found it really useful to have warm wipes with an infant who was born in the winter. Also we keep something in front of the green indicator light because it does glow quite a bit- might be good to find your way in a dark room but I didn't like it lighting up our nursery.	
1. 	I don't have much time to go out shopping for things we need with a new baby. The playtex bottles are easy since there's no real cleaning everyday - the liners just pop in and out! The price here is just as good as walmart but it comes right to my door without the walmart craziness :) Would recommend for sure! No problems with leaking or anything...	
1. 	I used to live in an apartment basement with NO WINDOWS and this 'stroke of genius' diaper champ did not smell at all! I ended up not even having to wash out the inside until 4mnths later! Sounds gross I know but that's how awesome it really is! AND it's super easy to use and you don't have to buy bag refills. Need I say more?	
1. 	I have twin boys, I bought 2 of these they are great. I love them. They really like the vibration. I would totally tell friends to buy this.	
1. 	My baby loves to be bundled when she sleepsso I love this safe alternitive to a blanket they can get tangled in.	
- 1	Basically you get what you pay for with this toy, that is, very little. It looked promising when I opened it up, but within just a few days through normal use (hanging on our son's car seat handle), the mirror got completely scratched up. We're not sure how it happened, it wasn't even in use most of the time, but now my son can't even see himself in the mirror because it's all cloudy. Not worth the money.	
- 1	I used dr browns.bottles for two weeks after my lo was born. However although they claim dishwasher safe after 4 washings ( top rack) and there were 4 other types of bottles in the dishwasher, they came oyt with the awful smell of burning plastic. No other bottle kept that smell, it permeated my home for days!!! I contacted the company as i had over 30 bottles and was told i did something wrong, they even sent me a copy of their instructions and told me to send all thebottles back. I asked what they were goimg to do and they offered me a 3 pack of their bottles in exchange for my 30. It was offensive and disgraceful. Their rep was condescending and rude and after we hung up she emailed me the same offensive info. Disgraceful company. Thank god my child didnt drink from these as he could have gotten sick. The smell in the air was awful enough!!	
1. 	This has been my go to for my scheduling of my twins. They are four months old now and I have their care givers fill this in when they can. That way I have an idea of the schedule they are developing. I highly recommend this!	
1. 	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.It's the ONLY product I've purchased (or tried out in the store) that truly requires only ONE hand!  With my 8 month old on my shoulder, I drop this bag into the cart seat, I unzip it flip the 'diaper pocket' over the back, pull the generous, elastic edged cover up and over the cart handle and that's just about it.Additionally, the Buggy Bag is among the few that covers the whole cart, and (uniquely) adds further protection from germs with 2 separate belts: one to go around your child's waist, the other to secure it to the cart.Not to be forgotten: the Buggy Bag comfortable (apparently!), has simple convenient storage options and stores itself w/ ease!On the other hand, I tried one imitation in a popular Baby store and not only did it not open with one hand (a necessity with a baby on your hip in a grocery store parking lot!) but I could NOT get it back into its 'carrying' shape with two hands!!  I hid it on the shelf and moved away quickly.  eek.  Another product I purchased online came in two pieces and had so many clips and belts wrapping it together, that I could barely attach it with both hands and help from passersby. While it had 'shoulder straps unlike any other, they dont work in most carts that put an advertising placard on the back of the cart seat.  Finally adjusted, that product (the Shop'n'Dine) didnt cover most of the cart. (on its debut shopping trip) I threw it back in the car and went home, too tired to shop.Finally, there are lots of imitators out there, dont be suckered in by similar names, better price points or preferred fabric choices:  the Buggy Bag will preserve your sanity and, perhaps, your child's health.	
- 1	I would recommend in the strongest possible way no one ever buy this product. The other reviews of this product are all too kind and they say so in their descriptions. All of them point out that the product does not work smoothly or seem to do anything magically different, they also seem to give 3+ stars without comparing the product to anything else. I have compared the product to something else...a regular trash can...and the regular trash can was better. And the regular trash can didn't even have a lid on it. A family friend also purchased this thing and has the exact same complaints. Namely that the lid gets stuck, that you have to hunch over and shove the diapers into the pail, and that you have to buy replacement bags every month or few weeks. In the end this thing is a waste of money and is simply worse than a regular old trash can. Detailed descriptions below...The Munchkin:1) There are major issues with the lid. The lid is supposed to keep out odors while sprinkling a tiny (really tiny) amount of baking soda as you close it and initiating a mechanical twist of the bag to further seal off the odors. However, the lid is constantly fighting with the mechanics that twist the bag creating, starting when then bag gets about half full, a series of sounds reminiscent of small arms fire. Crack...crack crack...crack...  You will live in constant fear of a late night gun battle playing out in the child's room leading to a screaming sleepy cranky baby. Closing the lid twists the top part of the bag in a ring of rubber shark-like teeth thereby closing off the bag as well. However, the lid will often simply get stuck open because these rubber teeth put too much pressure on the mechanics of the lid. This forces you to stick your hand into the pail itself and move the bag around to relieve the pressure so the lid will close. Think about it...you have to stick your hand into the very closure intended to keep odors out. Very often you have to decide between fixing the lid or picking up a now grumpy baby.2) The rubber teeth are a pain. Often the rubber teeth create to much counter pressure to the closing of the lid and the entire process comes to a plastic cracking halt. Even if the lid works correctly you still have to shove the diaper through the rubber teeth. You can not just drop a diaper in, instead you have to jam it through the teeth. Every time you change a diaper you have to bend down and shove your hand through a set of rubber teeth two feet off the floor. And two feet off the floor is correct. This thing barely comes up to my kneecaps. Think about it...even when working 100% correctly you have to bend over two feet and jam your fist partially through a set of rubber teeth. How is that better than dropping a diaper into a bucket?3) What's the deal with the bags? I mean..for serious? A bag lasts you maybe 4 days at a max and more like 48 hours. Munchkin wants you to fork out whatever bucks a month for replacement bags? I think this is the entire reason for the mechanical twisting of the bags and not to keep in smells. The tops of the bags have plastic ring you set into the top of the pail and which then snaps into place. The replacement bags are only 5-10 bucks a box but it seems like a real scam. I have tried two things. A) I wondered what would happen if I re-used one of the Munchkin bags. Nothing bad happened at all. I dumped the diapers into the outside trash and put the bag back. No smells, no nastiness, nothing bad happened at all. I used the same bag for two weeks rather than two days. After two weeks of us there were still no smells. B) I then decided to try a regular trash bag. It worked fine. You just have to leave a bit of the bag sticking out beyond the lid to make sure the rubber teeth don't pull the thing completely into the pail when you close the lid.4) The baking soda does nothing. A novel idea sure. But, like the twisting of the bags, it seems like a gimmick. The level of baking soda dropped into the bag when you close the lid is minor and the baking soda compartment is totally closed off. I do not see how either is doing much to absorb odors.Alternatives:The only alternative I have used is an old plastic trash can with an open bag in it and no lid. I dropped diapers in it for 5 days without emptying it. No smells whatsoever. Half the time it was nice out and we had the windows open. The other half of the time it was 90 degrees and the air conditioning was on. In both cases it worked out fine. No smells.Conclusions:Do not buy this munchkin monstrosity. Every time you use it you will wonder if the lid will close or start making cracking noises as it struggles to twist the bag. Buy a trashcan with a lid. Maybe one with a step lid. And if your kid makes a smelly one. Empty the trash can. Why would you want to keep that stuff inside a nursery anyway? The munchkin is a gimmicky thing and not worth it at all. It seems like a great idea but in actuality the thing does not work!	
- 1	The nipple pours too fast for my 2 month old. I should have researched to see if these bottles had slow flow nipples before buying, however, I found that the Tommy Tippee website doesn't have any information about the flow of their nipples or if they even offer a slow flow.  Very disappointed as now I cannot return the bottles since I've used one of them.	
1. 	my 8 mo old has loved these since he was 5 mos or so, his favorite is the crab and the turtle as they are easiest to hold and chew on	
1. 	This was my favorite bottle bag for my son.  It will hold six bottles with the ice pack going on top of the bottles.  I usually only put five in at one time so that I could use additional ice packs.  The storage on the top is small, but will fit two Gerber baby food containers, spoon and bib.  I used this to take his bottles to daycare and on all-day trips.  For short trips (to daycare), one ice pack would work.  For all day trips, we used additional ice packs.	
- 1	From the moment I assembled and installed this bed rail, it felt flimsy. I'd purchased a foldaway rail thinking it would make it easier to make my daughter's bed, but was wrong. The rail was so difficult to fold under that it wasn't worth folding it away; I'd just pull the bed away from the wall instead. Any attempt at folding it down would result in the cheap metal wheels that guide the rail popping off the cheap metal track. In less than six months, my two year old daughter had the rail bent and finally snapped the cheap wheel right off the rail itself. Despite installing it correctly, my daughter would still manage to push it away from the bed enough that she could have fallen through. This thing just ended up in the trash, what a waste of money.Save yourself the headache. If you have to have a safety rail, just get a rail that is solid and doesn't fold away or purchase a less expensive bolster that fits under the sheets. This one is crap.	
1. 	Love these. For some reason, most other bibs I've tried had uncoated fabric edging, which means you can't just wipe food off the trim, however easily it wipes off the main portion of the bib. That means you either send it through the wash (and most of them say not to machine wash them), or slowly build up nasty, unremovable crusties along the trim and piping until the bib is so gross you just throw it out. These are not like that. Food rinses easily off the entire thing, front and back, main part, pocket, and trim. So great! Even if you forget and find the bib a few hours later, it rinses right off with just warm water. They're also soft and flexible enough that my toddler doesn't pull or complain about it until she's done with her meal. First bib I can say that about. I threw all her old bibs away after getting these.	
- 1	These prefolds are too thin. There are better product on amazon...something like indian cotton prefold diapers...dont remember the ones with blue edges	
- 1	We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter...  It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it.  All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat.  It does not stay flat -  Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles.  Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying.  Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess.  It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.	
- 1	I wanted to love these because my favorite brand of pads, FuzziBunz, is no longer making overnight (super) pads. But I don't. They seem to slip more, bunch more, and although they are pleasantly thin, they absolutely hold a LOT less and lead to leaking - a problem I haven't had with other brands. These are are not even my second-favorite brand. I'll use them as backups or panty-liners, but I'm disappointed.	
1. 	I bought this in pink for my 3 year old girl - she loves to sit on it, and knows that it's hers. It's a great height, she doesn't hit her legs under the table, and it gives her a perfect boost. This truly is a great product and I'm happy that I spent the $ on it.*Do wash it pretty soon after food/liquid spillage - it's a slightly textured material where you have to scrub to get milk or anything dried off of it unless you wipe it up shortly after it was spilled.	
- 1	Sorry for the negative review but here goes... The Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision is very very basic.  You get a night vision camera, a night light on the camera, lullabies and sound activated screen and that is it.  The resolution is not high res like Philips says, at best it is standard res.  The battery life is said to be seven hours but I have only managed about four.  The range is said to be 30 meters through walls but it is about half that.  The only adjustments you can make are the volume and the screen brightness.We have a V-Tech baby monitor that is about half the price but is has much better resolution, twice the screen size, the ability to remote talk, the ability to add multiple camera, vibration alert option, temperature reading and much better range plus the nigh vision sound activated screen and the lullaby features.  The Phillips has the advantage on camera size though.  Even with the battery back-up the camera is very compact.  Also the sound activated screen works better than the V-Tech but you cannot adjust the sensitivity in anyway.  If this camera was $100 or less it would be an ok buy, but even then there are several cameras near that price point that have more features. If was less that $80 I could recommend it but it's not so I can't.	
- 1	My average sized 10 month old could not even touch the ground on the shortest of the settings. And from reading the reviews on a couple websites this seems to be a common problem. Save yourself the hassle and disappointment, go with another brand.	
1. 	These bottles are great to use when traveling because you don't have to pack a bunch of bottles, just slip the drop in pouches in the diaper bag, with 1 bottle and several nipples and go!  However,  to use them everyday would cost more than washing bottles, and it is something else that ends up in the landfill.The refills are roughly $8.00 for 100 which is an expense you don't incur with regular wash and use bottles.  Just a thought.The insert collapses as the baby drinks, so there is less air in the bottle for the baby to swallow.	
1. 	Great, sturdy, colorful, and easy to arrange.	
- 1	My son just chewed off the top of the silicone spout right away, so the cup became useless.  Otherwise it works fine.	
- 1	My baby never liked this teether.  Maybe it was because he never used a pacifier, but he never liked putting this in his mouth, which was too bad because he started teething early and I thought this would be helpful.  Maybe it would work better for babies who use pacifiers, but he just never seemed to understand how to use it.	
1. 	I have cats.. and they like to get a hold of the nipples when I leave a bottle out so I need to keep buying these. They work perfect for a few different bottles I use & are in expensive!	
1. 	These are fantastic. We have twin boys and we use these sleep sacks every night. I use them for bed with a long sleeve onesie, they sleep comfortably and warm.	
1. 	These sippy cups are very good spill proof cups. My 11 month old son drink well out of them. We have used them since 5 months to start practicing but i had to remove the valve to make it easier for him to drink from. This of course eliminated the spill proof factor but now that he is older and has a stronger suck we put the valve back in and use them to their full potential! They say they are 7 ounce but i can put a full 8 ounces in them no problem.	
1. 	Very easy to install keeps my little one safe. Will buy another for my other fireplace. I would recommend to anyone with little tots.	
1. 	I was starting to wake up from bad back pain in the beginning of my third trimester.  I bought this pillow and it's been great.  I can sleep longer without waking up from back aches.  I also plan on using it for nursing.  I like that I can sleep on either side without having to adjust the pillow.  Some reviewers complained about the seam digging into their shoulders.  I did not have this problem.  I'm 5'2 and found that the size of the pillow was fine for me.  Seems pricey for a pillow but the comfort is well worth it.	
1. 	Great!!!! BibsEasy to clean after feeding my toddler and dry's fast too. I would recommend these bibs to any mom.	
1. 	I love this product.  I put it in my baby's bassinet and it keeps him right in the middle of the bassinet.  Plus it's a little softer than than the thin cushion my bassinet came with.	
- 1	Only 3 of the suction cups would ever stay on at a time.  It was also a bit big for our car windows, so it would sag and not block much sun.  We wound up returning this and are looking for a replacement now.	
- 1	The product works as described but you're going to need at least 2 for each toy because they are very short. For example, I attached a toy to the high chair and with just one strap the toy couldn't even reach across the tray.	
- 1	I have found these bibs good, but after 4 months of use they began to go moldy in the seams. I always wash or wipe them after use and then hang them to dry so I am surprised that this has happened. They are now too gross to use so back to the search for the perfect bib!	
- 1	When my first child was born in 2009, I started using my Pump in Style with the Medela bags for about a year and regularly used the Medela pump & save bags on the market at the time. I didn't really have any issues and was overall a loyal Medela customer, happy with various products. Fast forward 3 years and I bought them again for my second child. I didn't notice the easy-connect adapter until I got home, and when I did, I was excited to check it out. First, getting it into the hole wasn't smooth sailing. Second, I didn't like the angle at which the bag was hanging and that wasn't something I could change since the adapter screws in and that's that. In the end, pumping itself went fine (double, hands-free more or less), until I wanted to pull everything off. They sure don't stand nicely on the counter, in fact I was worried they'd fall over. In the end they didn't tilt over, but I can totally see an easy spill happening. Next, I noticed right away that it was difficult to get an accurate read of how many ounces were in the bag, so I had to fill it into one of the bottles... that's when the biggest problem occurred... pouring milk out of those bags, GRRR. The way you would normally pour something out of a bag like that makes it impossible because of the adapter's holes, so you have to instead pour it out one of the corners, which is just flimsy and milk just EASILY SPILLS either out the hole because you aren't careful enough or just over the ledge of the bottle because it's going too fast. I also attempted to very carefully pour it out of the hole thinking that may be wise, BZZZT, that's when I spilled milk too even though I was being careful. So annoying. I won't be buying this product again, in fact I may even throw the rest out and buy another brand (or stick with bottles) since I don't want to risk my daycare spilling milk either. I can't believe the design changed for the worst in just a couple years.	
- 1	This is singlehandedly the worst piece of furniture I have ever purchased. It is beyond cheap. I would never put my baby on it. As I tried assembling it ( a million screws and parts) the wood split from the dowels immediately. In more than one place. The quality of the fabric on the drawers was horrible as well. The whole thing was a mess. I am returning it.	
- 1	We have a tile shower.  I cannot get these suction cups to stick.  Two seem okay but the other keeps falling off.  I finally just gave up.  Good size net, though.	
- 1	I want to give these a good review, I really do. They're very effective for a few days or weeks, but I've had to replace them twice because they burst open and leak gel. The second set I bought I sealed in a ziplock baggie to prevent leaks, but at least two 'cells' have flattened as they empty their contents. Not great quality. I won't buy these again and would not recommend them unless you are looking for one-time use.	
1. 	I know I can live without this stroller but I am so glad I baught it!  Light weight, sturdy, easy folding!  What's not to love!  It takes up less room in my trunk than a stroller with a seat!  I love using this for those quick in and out runs.  Just snap in the car seat and go! Definately will use for any future children!	
- 1	These swaddle blankets run very small and will only swaddle a brand newborn. I use them rolled up as head supports in the car seat or as burp rags now.	
1. 	Love this potty.  I highly recommend this potty.  It works well and I can't imagine anything better.  I can definitely recommend it.	
- 1	I thought this would work to keep my little one in place in his car seat and be a pillow for him when he wanted to sleep.  It was awkward. He was not comfortable at all.	
- 1	I have a 2011 Ford Edge and it does NOT work to roll down the window with the shade on.  i properly installed it, and it gets all caught up.  Currently my baby is just 3 months, so we won't be rolling down the window back there anytime soon, but still.  I haven't tried another one so i can't give another recommendation unfortunatly.	
- 1	I got a very gently used one from a friend. It had been used for 2 babies, so about 6-7 months total, and my baby is now almost 6 weeks. The cloth platform that the mattress rests on is sagging like mad and lets my baby slide towards the open side. That is absolutely unsafe as there is no mesh there and she could suffocate. It was never stored, it was just closed up and left in the front hall closet, so it's not like it was exposed to extreme temperature changes or abuse.There's also a gap between it and the bed. Due to the gap there's really no simple way to reach over and pull the baby in; you still have to sit up or at least prop yourself up on an elbow and be kind of unsteady while you pick the baby up. Plus, to be honest, you have to change baby before and/or after a feeding, so honestly, you're getting up anyway.So, I guess if you're only going to use this for one baby for a few months... and have a ton of money to burn, this is a great item.If you're going to use it for multiple babies, I cannot recommend it.It's not really portable up and down stairs, either. It's not hard to set up but it's time consuming, but it's nothing you'd lug around the house with you all day. If you have a one story with a fairly open floor plan, this would probably be fine, but in a real house with rooms and hallways, it's not convenient.	
1. 	This nursing shawl is the best! Whether it is Summer or Winter, whether I am outdoors or indoors, this nursing shawl provides the best coverage and in incredibly convenient to grab out of the diaper bag or purse,  put it on for the nursing session (I find the ones with hoops  to be much more of a hassle), pack it up again very compact and toss it in the washer whenever the need arises. It is so lightweight it is perfect for warm weather and I do not have to worry about the sun getring into baby's eyes. In the winter it works just as well. I take it everywhere and would be so lost without it. Not only is it functional and incredibly versatile,  it is also very beautiful. I don't know how many complements I have received from other women and even men on how pretty it is. I am now pregnant with our second baby whom I plan on nursing as well and I cannot wait to continue to use this great item for many yeats to come. I really hope to buy another in a different color also.	
1. 	I was surprised by the number of mediocre to negative reviews of these after I sent a friend here to buy them for her grandson. I get what people are saying and why they wrote negative reviews, but they did however, work for us and I will buy more now that my daughter can reach the knobs.First off, regarding melting, presently we have a range - nothing below to generate heat, so no issue there. However we did have a freestanding stove and didn't have a melting problem probably because of both the angle of our control panel and the fact that we have small children and we would never leave our oven open, even cracked.Yes, my son eventually learned how to open these up once he was tall enough to see what he was doing. Prior to this we never gave him a chance to learn how to open them up - if he was fiddling around with them at the stove he was told no and removed.My knobs don't easily come off, so the whole thing coming off wasn't an issue for us. Removing the knobs is a great option - if you don't have a husband like mine who would never ever remember where I put them. ;-)I liked these if anything, for me. On two occasions I came in and dropped loads of groceries on every surface - including the stovetop - and bumped a knob and accidentally turned a burner on. (I won't have that problem now with my gas range.) But it was enough to make me think about buying knob covers for my clumsiness.	
- 1	I have 6 week old twin grandsons.  I thought this looked interesting and wouldn't take up too much space, important when there are two plus an older brother.  I first found it to be a bit challenging to put together.  There are those heavy plastic ties that need to be clipped to remove it from the packaging and just scissors won't do it. The music box was attached to the packaging by plastic strips and tape.  The tape left a sticky residue on the bottom.  Once everything is out of the box, you need to snap the red discs that hold the arch into the holes on the sides.  That wasn't easy to accomplish.  At least once they are in, I don't think they will be coming out.  It also said to push the ends of the arch all the way into the holders.  That also is a bit challenging because the arch is a soft foam covered in fabric and it is hard to slide in.  I also think the pictured item must have the arch just barely put into the holders because mine doesn't have that high an arch when I follow directions and pushed it all the way in. The triangle is made from rigid plastic.  You can change the position of the arch, but not the height of the triangle.The accessories that come with this are not of the highest quality.  The music box needs 2 AA batteries, which are NOT included.  It does have a low, off, high switch and, depending on how many times you press the button on the top, will play for 1, 5, or 10 minutes.  The light flashes in time to the music.  There are 3 songs - Hickory Dickory Dock, Three Blind Mice, and Baa Baa Black Sheep.  The quality of the sound is not great, in fact, pretty tinny.  I think 10 minutes of these 3 songs over and over would be pretty annoying.  It's a separate unit and doesn't provide any activity for the baby during tummy time, so I am not real sure why this is included.  Guess it allows a justification of the price. The mirror is one of those soft plastic fun house mirrors.  There is a label on the mirror that says, in 7 languages, to remove.  When I removed it, there was a nick left where I pealed up a corner to get it off.  There is also a rectangle left from the label that I have no clue how to remove.  The crinkle bee is okay, but, again, not the highest quality.The one good thing about this item is the cover can be removed and machine washed.  It does say to not use bleach or fabric softener or to dry in the dryer or iron.  For those who want this information, the box does say it is made in China.ETA:  The 6 week olds are now almost 4 months.  This has spent more time on the fireplace than being used by either baby. It just isn't worth the space it takes up - even if it is less space than other baby items.	
- 1	Strange, I read all the reviews yesterday night and wanted to write this review but was too tired, so I do it now. And there were like 20 negative feedback (1-2 stars), today I see 2 negative feedback !!!Are they removing them?? It seems like that.I bought this item for may baby due in 3 weeks.We couldn't put it together, screws don't match with holes etc... I'm so sad about that.I sent an email about replacement parts, got an answer today:  Sorry, we don't have replacement parts for this item until July.Just great.But all in all this item is so cheaply made and terrible, I don't recommend buying this. Color was coming off even without touching the dressing table.. First time in my life I see something so badly made..Anyway, yesterday I saw many negative reviews, today I see only 2.. That's too bad.. you can't trust amazon anymore??OMG, i just checked 1-star reviews.. 1 is from 2009, another 1 from 2010. I am the only one person in two years with 1 star.. yeah, right..	
- 1	I have this chair but in a different color.  I registered for it before I had a baby, so I didn't know much about anything.  No, my son is 8 months, and I've had time to form an opinion.  The following are some things to note:-This chair only has one vibration strength- other chairs have several.-The chair only play music if you pull the center elephant-Your baby won't be able to pull on said elephant for several months-This means, you must keep pulling the elephant-In fact, baby won't be able to play with any of the dangly toys for a while (my son probably didn't reach for them until about 6 months)-By 6 months, we weren't using this chair much because my son seemed to want to climb out.-The rocking position is only for kids that can stand up and have legs that reach the ground-The toy bar comes off- if you are lazy (like me) and want to slip baby in with the toy bar on, you are likely to bump baby on the head-Baby will not enjoy said head pump.  This makes mama feel terrible for being lazy.So, I used this chair a ton in the first 3 months while I showered or cooked.  It worked out okay.  My baby never fell asleep in it.  My parents and my sister had different vibrating chairs.  My baby tried those out, too.  I have to say, he liked those so much more.  He was always falling asleep in the one at my parent's house.  Theirs had ocean/water sounds and a cool ocean scene to watch that seemed to relax him.  My sister's offered a stronger vibration which he also seemed to like more than what this seat had to offer.In the future, I will see how he liked the seat as a toddler.  Until then, it's a dust collector in the corner.	
1. 	My daughter doesn't sleep well without them. She will startle herself awake if she's not swaddled in this brand. The material it is made out of, the microfleece, is sturdy and keeps her in there. Any other kind of material is too stretchy and she can get her arms out and will then wake herself up. I tried to get other brands, and nothing else has worked but these ones. They're wonderful. Hold up very well in the washer/dryer. I had to get multiple though so that she could have ones every night. We started off with one or two and it was just too hard to wash them and have them ready that night for bed, so I broke down and purchased a few of them. The only thing that I dislike is really just because my daughter sweats in her sleep, so she does get a bit warm in these... but it hasn't seemed to bother her yet. She doesn't wake up because of it or anything... I just notice it when I get her up in the morning.	
1. 	These little containers are just the best thing, ever!  I use one for formula and the other for cereal for quick fixes when on the road.  Just pre-measure what you need and away you go!  The lid fits tightly and I have never experienced any spillage.  I actually bought mine from Walgreen's (I was in a hurry), and I was kinda bummed they only had blue (I have a girl), but these little things are real time-savers.When making up the formula (I use Isomil Advance), I place two four ounce servings in one half of the container, and then a six and an eight in the other two sections.Very handy!  I love it.  I just wish there were more color selections, but function over form works for me!	
- 1	These blankets are big and the fabric is soft.  That's why they get two stars.  The bad?  They are too big to be functional swaddlers (my baby loves being swaddled, but not with these, this is baby #3 so I am a good swaddler, too).  The price is crazy for what they are (sheets of muslin fabric). I bought several sets of these while pregnant with this baby.  Since she is our last, I wanted to spoil her and myself.  Given all the rave reviews, I thought these would be so great.  They just aren't our thing.  We use Halo sleep sacks, the miracle blanket, and the baby morgan blankets we had from before (bright future, jc penney).  All those work better and make her and me happier.  I do highly recommend Aden and Anais's other product--the burpy bib.  Those have been absolute lifesavers for me.  Buy those for yourself today.  But if you want a fancy high end blanket that actually swaddles, buy a miracle blanket.  Good luck!  I hope you find the blanket that makes baby and you smile.	
- 1	I bought this unit with high hopes.  I did a lot of looking and research and thought this was a reasonable choice.  Since I have had the unit it has gone through three power supplies.  The company will send out a new supply but they are located in California while I am on the East coast, so it takes a few days to get somebody from the company to talk to you, then a couple of days for them to ship the item, then a week or so traveling through the mail.  So for almost two weeks you are stuck without the unit and not able to use it!  This has happened three times now.  I thought I was being smart and actually purchased a back up power supply for the next time.  Well the next time happened last night, so I plugged in my back up supply and it doesn't work.  So now I'm thinking maybe this time it's the unit itself that has stopped working.  Unless I got a bad power supply when I ordered the back up.  I guess I should have checked it out and not assumed anything.  So now I'm waiting for them to call me back and start this entire process over again but in the meantime I don't have a working monitor for my daughter.  I would look at another company.  I know as soon as I can afford to buy another one I will be moving on to one of the other ones.	
1. 	I bought this monitor and even though my baby will still arrive in July, I have already tested a lot and it works just fine! It films even without any lights at all! I think I would be worried about leaving my baby sleeping by herself (my first!) but now I feel more secure as I don't need to go to her room all the time to check on her.Baby monitor without video are worthless, in my opinion! If the baby is right in the border of your bed - for example - it won't make any different sound until he falls. But with the video you can see and save him before the accident happen!	
1. 	I love this system because it's so easy. Rather that washing the bottle you can just change the liner and wash the nipple. I use store brand non-drop-ins because theyre cheaper and the regular bag liner colapses easier.I agree with other reveiwers, the slow flow nipples that come with the bottle are worthless. My 1 month old gets frusterated that nothing is coming out. We tried the tri-cut and again he got frusterated so i ripped the cut a little bigger and that works so I went and got the fast flow.	
1. 	After searching online and in many retail stores at malls, Target, Babies and Toys 'R Us and Walmart, I was only finding these gauze type cloth diapers.  I was appalled that these were considered soft enough or absorbent at all to be put close to my baby!So, after no success, I came on to Amazon and found the many incredible reviews of this product using them as burp cloths.  I decided to order one package and when they arrived I was thrilled at how soft they were and looked forward to using them with my new baby.  They absorb a great amount of formula since my son is quite a dribbler and they wash wondefully.  In fact, I think they have even gotten softer.  We were so happy with this product that we purchased another package within the first few days that we used them.So, if you are looking to use them the way we did and find that the gauze type found in most stores to be unacceptable, then get these!!!  You won't regret it!	
- 1	Pro:-Spongy holding around your baby to create more safety if bathing baby in ceramic sink.Con:-Always need 2 adult to bath your baby. One holding baby's head up so water won't get into baby's ears, and the other person give the actual bath to the baby.-The mildew smell(I try to hang it dry over night in the bathroom cause it soaks lots of water and keep dripping. Than remove to somewhere under the sunlight during the day time, to get it complete dry out for next bath. However, without drying under the sunlight(when its cloudy day....it has mildew smell)After 3 month usage, the spongy getting flat...and the whole thing keeps sinking(the head part used to be higher...but now about 2 inches flatter)...my husband now has to hold the baby's head plus holding up the hook towards outside the sink... it's totally useless now and I'll have to buy something else...	
1. 	This is a great toy. My son eventually learnedto push the button himself while traveling inthe car. He loved it. Other children were drawn to it as well.We only used it in his newborn carrier until hewas about 6 months old. The drawbacks I experienced with thisitem were that it was too close to baby's head where it could be attached to carrier. It was difficultto remove or place baby in carrier for fear of hitting his head.I think it's a great toy but could be better if theyfound a better way to attach to carrier.	
1. 	The design of these spoons is really great - the handle is perfect for hands that are still learning accuracy of motion. Our son began feeding himself with this spoon after just a couple of feedings. Really worked great!	
1. 	This sling is the best! I have 2 of them and I use both all the time. I have been using it since my son was 3 months old. He is now 6 months old. I can put him in it in multiple positions and breast feed him in it when walking around. I get lots of compliments and people askng me where I got it. If its raining out I put him in the sling and the umbrella keeps us both dry and baby warm. I can't say enough good things about this sling.	
- 1	While cute, its quality and aesthetics don't really live up to the picture online. We registered for it without seeing it in person, but it's going back, because:- It's made in China. Amazon listing read imported without further specification when we registered for it. US has standards for materials up to a point; we don't yet regulate imported fabric products based on chemicals used to treat them. This means you run a decent risk that it's 100% cotton treated with stuff you wouldn't want near yourself, much less your baby, and since we're given virtually no information as consumers, we can't know if the chemicals wash out during the first wash. (Always prewash all your baby apparel/towels/cloths.) Either way, I wouldn't want to add nasty chemicals to the water system if they did wash out. I don't boycott imports, but in terms of safety concerns, Chinese products are the worst offenders (although there are some bonafide certified organic factories in China, however rare). My rule used to be don't lick it, if it's from China, but you breathe in emissions and micro-particles from things around you (thus indoor pollution). While you can't protect yourself or anyone from all sketchy substances, I can try to reduce the number of questionable products I expose myself and baby to on a regular basis to minimize bio-accumulation. Choosing another towel set, to me, is a reasonable attempt.- Reviewers who wrote that the fabric is rough have a point. This set is not soft or plush.- It just doesn't look durable.- It's actually a lot cuter online than in-person.	
- 1	This is a good product for those free spirits who are organized enough to use it.  Maybe I  am too prudish, but I felt so stupid walking around with these things on that I cringed every time my husband walked into the room.  I have a friend that found this a Godsend, especially when she returned to work and had to pump.  Just not for me.	
- 1	The kneeler is not very sturdy.  I was not comfortable kneeling on it, and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion.  If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning, I'm not impressed.  I might as well kneel on a folded towel.  I was hoping for something that would be soft.  Also, the construction of the item is not very sturdy.  It is made of plastic, and it does not seem at all durable.  The elbow &quot;cushion&quot; is also not very soft.  It is not secure, either.  When I leaned against it to test it, it slid right off.  If I'd been busy bathing my baby, I would have tumbled into the tub with him.  I don't recommend this product.	
- 1	All of my Carter's textiles have done the same exact thing within a year's time.  The elastic gives out.  This changing pad cover does not even have the slightest bit of stretch left, so I have to tuck it under the pad, and it comes off all the time.  I do not wash them abnormally frequently--only when very soiled, with is not often.  I think it averages out to washing each cover once every 6 weeks.I really cannot understand how this gets a 5-star rating.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  And since I have multiple other Carter bedding items and they have all done the same thing, I know I don't have a fluke.  My other branded textiles have not done this, as they are still stretchy after 3 years of continual use.Invest in higher quality if you need it to last over a year.  I know this is the only negative review so far, but please know that I am being as honest and accurate as I can.	
1. 	Not much to add to this one.  It is a toothbrush as described.  It is the right size and shape for my 2 year old.	
- 1	This was my favorite bag until the zipper broke off!! We had it about 6 months before it happened and I really don't want to pay another 20bucks for it to happen again. It was the perfect size and masked all odor. I am very disappointed to say goodbye to this one!	
- 1	I selected this changing pad purely based on price (it was the cheapest at the time).  It serves its purpose, but I wouldn't purchase it again - I'd go back to the Skip Hop Pronto Changer.  The mesh pouches that hold the diapers and wipes are very small and open on the inside (so when the baby is actually on the mat, it takes some manuevering to get the diapers/wipes out of the pouches).	
- 1	this bag is not waterproof.  water leaks out from the bottom where the zipper is.  also the top does not close so smell does escape from the top.	
- 1	I wanted to like this seat.  But I hate it for many reasons.1.  Pee guard.  I understand the need for one but does it have to be so huge?  It is so large that underpants have to be essentially around my kids ankles to get her legs wide enough to sit around it.  I also have to lift her on the potty seat cuz its freaking huge.  Think the size of a baseball.2. It doesn't clip on or hook to anything.  Fine once the kid is on but getting on it is anyone's guess.  It moves around like crazy and half the time ends up half on the potty and I have to adjust both baby and seat.  Annoying.The only pro is its easy to clean (the top) because its all molded as one piece.  The bottom has lots of grooves and is kinda a pain thoough.	
- 1	This was a waste of money purchase. I have the Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator and it works very well. Used on a 4 month old baby.	
- 1	I have five children ranging in age from 17 all the way to 1.  With all of my children, I used a traditional &#34;sound&#34; baby monitor and never had an issues.  When my twins were born three years ago we received a very nice Sony &#34;traditional&#34; monitor and it has worked flawlessly for three years.  I have always been intrigued by the video monitors, so I was excited to try this monitor out.  Well, the setup of this monitor took me over an hour, but when I finally got it set up, it worked really well - for one night.  A thunderstorm caused our power to go out for a few minutes, and when it came back on, the monitor wouldn't connect to the iBaby network.  I waited until the next day and it finally connected, and worked fine, for about an hour.  I called customer service and I was told that their network was down.  I asked if this was a common occurrence, and I was told &#34;sometimes.&#34;  Since that time, I have noticed that the network is &#34;down&#34; more than it is up.  I am not sure if iBaby has a &#34;national&#34; network, or a regional network, so that even if their network is down in one area, maybe it is still up in others.  However, when the network is up, and the monitor is working properly, it is a nice monitor.  The picture quality is ok, as is the sound quality.  However, it is so unreliable that I would not feel comfortable using it as my sole monitor.  Additionally, if your household, like ours, only has one Apple device (an iPhone) then only the person with that device and see the baby.  Therefore, if we were to leave the kids with a sitter, I would need to leave my phone behind so that the monitor could be seen.In short, this monitor is an expensive &#34;novelty&#34; - I would never use this as my sole monitor because it is not reliable enough.	
- 1	My brother gave this to me when my son was born back in 2010. The good news? It's still going strong after three years and two babies. The bad news? By &#34;going strong,&#34; I mean randomly triggering itself with astonishing frequency. We had it packed in a box in the hall closet. The music would go off when the front door opened. We moved it to the attic, and would hear echoes of the music on windy nights. If it falls on the floor, it will chime when someone walks across the room.So, bottom line:- loud music may disturb child- music triggers at the slightest movement- suction cup does not stay affixed to surface- toy does not stay secure in suction cup base- your brother might be so amused by these stories that it will become his mission to find ever-louder, more annoying toys for his nephew (see also: Fisher Price Bubble Mower, B Whee-Mote RC Car)	
1. 	I am still hoping my son will &#34;catch on&#34; with this toy.  It is a bit &#34;big&#34; for a little one - probably best for a 6+ month old baby.	
1. 	I bought these for my daughter 3 yrs ago when she started eating solids and bought again for my son who's now starting.  I think the material is actually better than before.  A little stiffer which is good for keeping its shape.	
1. 	Better than I expected, get this one - no others compare, I've had cheap bouncers and regular swings, all not great - this is all you need and I'm so happy with it. It's nice and big too, very comfy, soft. Love it!!	
- 1	I returned these as I just could not bear to see them on my crib. I'm sure they probably do their job, but they certainly didn't look nice. They were a lot bigger than I was anticipating. I ordered the natural fleece ones. Perhaps another color would have been nicer, but they were just so large. I ended up wrapping my baby's crib rails in satin ribbon instead. It looks much better and she doesn't seem to like biting it as much as the wood.	
- 1	I rarely review products, but I love aden + anais, and this did not meet my expectations at all. I tried to double check the description and didn't find anything about it being a lightweight version... The sleep sak we received as a gift (with the frog pattern) is much thicker, has a sturdy zipper and has an overall better quality than this one.  This one will likely be used for summer, since it is so lightweight -- but that is only if it holds up.  The material and the zipper are so flimsy that the whole thing is already wearing out after 2 washes. Part of me wonders if it's counterfeit!	
- 1	The size of the nipple seemed too small for the likes of my child. The plastic composing the nipple also seemed too inflexible and unnatural.	
- 1	Cute and easy to put together, but the light and sound bar did not work when I received the item.  I would have returned it, but honestly, it wasn't worth my time with a newborn.  It will serve its purpose for now, but I wouldn't recommend this item.	
- 1	Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought the tie on cloth cover for the front rail of the crib, and decided to try to save some money on a cover for the side rails.  It didn't even stay on for a day.  Money down the drain, since I now have to replace it with a cloth cover.	
1. 	I didn't realize the colored pieces were not solid, and it's hard to tell from the photos. They aren't loose enough to pinch little fingers, but still add an additional element to the toy. The sound is nice when rattled, and the colors are bright and cheery. The simple design is perfect for my baby who gets over stimulated eaily. It's pleasant sound has a calming effect. This is the best little teether I've found.	
1. 	My LO doesn't mind sitting on this at 7 months (we're starting EC) with a toy or a book and we're good to go. Has great support. She was a little hesitant on day 1 but now does not mind at all although I still hold on to her. Easy clean up and very durable. I'm tempted to get one for downstairs for convenience sake.	
- 1	i do not like this bib. i actually just bought new ones to replace it. it is too short so food gets all over the bottom half of my baby's shirt. and the pocket flops closed so most everything ends up on baby's lap and in the high chair. waste of money. the only upside is that it fits good around the neck so food and drink doesn't get on the collar of baby's shirt.	
1. 	These are adorable and soft enough to keep baby comfortable as well as entertained in the car ... I bought these in the pink bunny option also!	
1. 	since we began using this, 4 month old sleeps much better through the night with less spit ups. she has acid reflux. only con is that is moves around under the sheet. wish it had some Velcro or something to let it attach to the mattress....	
- 1	I purchased this item for my daughter. I had planned on using it to put over her underwear as she sleeps (she's currently potty training). However when it arrived a few of the snaps were broken. I tried using it but it didn't work. Very unimpressed.	
- 1	Mobi advertises that you can use this system as a security camera since you can view it from any internet browser. Turns out you only get 2 hrs of viewing time a month. You have to pay $10/ month for unlimited. As for a babay monitor, it's okay. Not as clear as I would have liked. Also, the set-up for the internet viewing is not clear cut. Needless to say, we are very frustrated with this and are debating whether or not to return it.	
- 1	Got this bouncer at the baby shower last summer. While we are still using it (my son is 6 months old but has the size of a one year old child), we had to remove the toy bar when he was about 3-4 months old since he managed to grab both ends end remove it himself, almost injuring his eyes!!! I duck-taped it for a while but that makes it kind of hard to put the baby in or take it out! It it should not be the solution anyway!I reported this already to consumer safety, unfortunately Combi, the manufacturer, does not give you the option to write an email but just to call - and only between certain hours :-(, which makes it kind of hard to reach them!!!What I liked about it was the modern design, the fact that it is not made entirely of plastic and at least in theory the possibility of using it with your iPod - which never worked for us :-(. The music it comes with is OK, the sound average and the vibration fine for a young baby - at 3-4 months, my son got pretty bored of it.We ended up using it in front of the door, where I can put him in for a few seconds until I put my shoes on when we go for a walk....I would not recommend this product first of all because of the very easy to remove toy bar!!!	
1. 	We bought this as a play mat for our new baby... but her big sister loved it so much that she &#34;borrowed&#34; it before her sister was born and has not slept without it since (almost 6 months ago).  Highly recommend and will probably buy another.	
1. 	I love all the toys on this one and the different music options. My twin girls love it too and can be entertained by it for hours. It has plenty of room for both girls and great bright colors. I'm really glad I purchased it has comeand would buy it again as a gift.	
1. 	This is a great product, just know its a little hard to get out of the outlet, so be careful when pulling out.	
- 1	I love OXO products, as they are great quality and sturdy.  But my little one refused to have anything to do with the hard spout on this sippy cup.  Too expensive not to use it, but he never would touch it because of the spout.	
- 1	This item was on my baby registry and a friend bought the 0-3 month SOOTHIE pacifier for me.  That's what my baby likes, so I decided to order another set.  I went back to the same page that was linked to from my registry and I again ordered the 0-3 month Soothie pacifier (Amazon even said on the page that this was a repeat order from my registry).  However, I was sent the 3+ months SUPER SOOTHIE.  I just went back to look at the page and it is definitely for the 0-3 month Soothie.  There must be something messed up with Amazon's ordering system because when I click on the link to read and write reviews, it then says 3+ months, but then when I click on the link to go back to the item page, it goes back to saying 0-3 months.  Make sure when you put this in your cart that you are ordering the correct product.  I am going to return these and then go buy the pacifiers I want from a brick and mortar store so that I know I'm getting what I want.  This was very disappointing.	
- 1	I bought these diaper sacks in preparation for my baby and I returned these IMMEDIATELY and here's why: I could smell the artificial powder smell before I even opened the package. Once I did, I was overwhelmed by the nauseating smell and realized this would stink up the nursery and diaper bag in a second. If you are sensitive to smells, this is not the product for you. A better alternative would be ordering unscented dog poop bags.	
- 1	Liked the idea...but it didn't work for our door.  :(	
- 1	When this package arrived, I was very disappointed to see not for use with Single Deluxe or Freestyle breast pumps written in very small print on the front of the package.  I assumed that because the product was made by Medela and claimed to be compatible with ALL Medela breast pumps, it would be compatible with my Medela Freestyle Breast pump.	
1. 	We have owned these sheets for 4 years and have used them for both our children.  They are so well-made, sturdy, and very padded and soft.  I wish they made some in queen size.  :)  I highly recommend these to any parents.  Enjoy as much as I have!	
- 1	This item came apart at the seams after a gentle wash cycle. I wasn't sure if this was an isolated event until I read the other reviews of it happening to others as well. It's a pretty sheet and it actually fits the bassinet unlike other brands but it is frustrating that the item failed quality control. Back to the drawing board in finding a decent bassinet sheet.	
1. 	It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse. Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is. I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years. When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three. Just keep the smaller stature in mind.	
- 1	I bottle feed my infant son, but I've been very particular about not using any bottles that aren't glass.  Even without the BPA, you never know what other plastic still in use will later be discovered to have unforeseen long-term harmful effects.I had heard that these bottles came in glass, but these don't -theseare what I should have gotten.  So if you're as particular about not feeding from plastic bottles as I am, make sure you're getting the right product.	
1. 	This item is perfect for sitting next to the tub while I bath my daughter.  It's easier on your back & knees.  It's also great for holding her bath things.  We love it!	
- 1	Not user friendly.  Don't waste your money.  Grasping the door knob, squeezing, and turning, is not easily done.  More difficult if you have little hands.	
1. 	I bought this bath to use with my infant when he was about 8 or 9 weeks old. Prior to that, we were holding him (making bathing a two person job -- one to hold the baby in the bath and one to wash him). He got too heavy for me to hold the entire time while bathing him and I needed a way to wash him by myself when my husband was at work. This seat works very well. I put the seat inside a small plastic baby bath tub and fill the water about half way (so that when I put him in the water level doesn't rise too high on him). I think this bath is better for a baby that's a bit older (I wouldn't have used this with him when he was a tiny newborn). It was perfect for my son at 8 or 9 weeks because he could recline and have a nice soak while I washed him without needing a second set of hands. He's 13 weeks old now and loves sitting in it and kicking his legs. Once he's able to sit up independently, we'll just let him sit in the baby bath tub without this seat.	
1. 	We have two of these that we rotate and they work just fine for us. We also have the contoured changing pad by Simmons. True, they do seem a little small straight out of the dryer (the cover stretches straight across the top of the pad), but after one changing our baby's weight shapes it right into place. That's really never bothered me. And considering how often they are washed, they are really holding up well.My only complaint (and why I didn't give it five stars) is that they could be a little softer.	
1. 	Highly recommend use with mattress.  Bed still remains firm but makes the bed so much more cozy and I wouldn't have a baby mattress without the waterproof cover.	
1. 	I needed to hang a toy net over part of the room that cannot use a corner (or the closet door won't open). the other nets I tried were too small, didn't stretch, and the hardware that came with them was a joke, consisting of picture nails (the really tiny ones) rather than hooks... HELLO? THat will NOT hold a net of any shape or size!So I ordered the  Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock. I ordered two, actually, and whip stitched them together at the longest side. That way, I was able to hook two corners of the (now square) hammock to the wall, and two corners to the ceiling. Each hammock is SOOOOO stretchy, and huge! We were able to fit ALL the stuffed animals in there, including very large bears, and several pillow pets. It is very string, well, made, and there is plenty of room for more toys. My daughter loves having them all with in reach of the top bunk. I love haveing the room neat and tidy, for a change!I am seriously considering replacing another toy net (in another room) with this one!	
- 1	The nipple on here is weird. My daughter wouldn't use it. Also I don't think the plastic is high grade. I like the Avent ones as they feel a bit heavier as far as the thickness and sturdiness of the bottle.We're not fans. Love this company but not this bottle.	
1. 	As a mother to a little Houdini, I tried just about every swaddle I could think of to keep my baby girl from hitting herself in the face while sleeping and waking up. This is, by far, the best I have found. We have been using this blanket for two weeks now, both for naps and at night, and the little one is finally starting to warm up to the idea of being swaddled. She typically falls asleep quickly and sleeps longer when wrapped in her miracle blanket. It has also been great for soothing her during the more fussy nighttime hours. The only downside is, if you have a little Houdini on your hands, handling him/her too much while swaddled can loosen the blanket just enough for those little arms to find their way out. Otherwise I have no complaints whatsoever!	
1. 	Although it would be nice to just zip the baby up in one of the zipper front swaddles none of them can hold a candle to the secure wrap this swaddle provides. I have tried various types of swaddle including the Woombie which I really wanted to love&#8230;but both my babies could get their little hands up and out of the neck of those swaddles with little effort. The Miracle Blanket is so snug that if wrapped properly the babies cannot get their arms out and sleep much more peacefully while on their backs. I wouldn't waste any more money on any other type of swaddle again.	
- 1	I was excited to get this after reading all the positive reviews, but after I washed it according to instructions, it was positively COVERED in fuzz. Velcro-like, stringy clumps of linty fuzz.  I hoped that tumbling it on low would remove them, but no.  So I tried washing it again -- no luck.  Those stringy lint balls are stuck all over like velcro, but they like to come off in bits on anything else that touches it now and then -- like the sheets I washed it with, or my clothes as I folded it.Other than that, this is a thin, flat pad that feels like a piece of plastic encased in thin linty material that has some sort of embossed print that makes it slightly quilted.  It fits on the Pack 'n Play mattress board, leaving some space around the edges, and is thin enough that it's easy to stretch a sheet over top.	
1. 	Perfect for organizing what you need on your changing table. It is not huge which was great for me because our nursery is not huge either. It held our wipe warmer (which was a little big on top but it staid in place), diapers, and the two side containers held creams, nail clippers, etc. It is strong plastic and hung perfectly on the side of our ikea changing table.	
- 1	My daughters are 2 and 4. We've had bath crayon's before so we know to try and keep them out of the water for the most part but lets be realistic. They are kids and the crayons get dropped in the water. They begin dissolving immediately. I doubt they will last more than 4 baths. These are junk in my opinion.	
1. 	My son is 14 weeks and has been playing on this mat since he was about 4 weeks old.  Now he can bat at the toys and he kicks the arches which makes the music and lights go on.  He gets so excited when he sees the lights and hears the music.  I hestitated about registering for this mat, but I'm so glad we got it.  It's his favorite toy!	
1. 	I have this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it! It keeps her busy in the car and in the stroller or if she gets bored with her swing I clip it on that sometimes too. The clips are a little hard to get to work you really have to just use two hands to open them up and push down hard. But it's worth it, in the car when you go over bumps the turtle will play it's little jingle. She loves grabbing the little animals on it.	
- 1	I thought I would see for myself on this one, shouldn't have wasted my time. Spend the extra money and get a better one.  It was constructed of cheap materials, the seams were not complete in 2 places and the sun shade was not centered. I returned for a refund and ordered one from one step ahead instead.	
- 1	My baby would gag and choke on the amount of milk that flows out of this nipple. I learned from a lactation consultant that a real slow flow nipple will drip one drop about every second when turned upside down, this is much faster than that. I'm convinced this nipple affected my ability to breastfeed as baby got used to getting milk quickly from a bottle and would get frustrated nursing, if you want a real slow flow and want to avoid bottle preference, I recommend dr. Browns level 1 nipple.	
1. 	We use this for cloth diapering. It is better than the diaper genie at keeping smell in - and we don't even use a scent thing in the top. It's in our bedroom where the changing table is. NEVER smells unless we open it and, hello people, whether we all like it or not, smell comes out when we open a diaper pail. But when it's closed, the smell stays in and doesn't leak at all. The only issue I have is it's a bit small, but we have 2 girls in cloth diapers, and we wash every 2 days, and it fits 2 days of 2 kids diapers easily. So I guess it's not that small. We line it with a PUL lined bag or a trash bag, and the lid still works well. Just make sure you snap the lid on right.	
1. 	I ordered these and they are perfect for a baby room. I use one of them for diapers, another for laundry, and the third one holds all of the headbands for my daughter.	
- 1	I ordered this seat so my daughter would have something fun to sit in while I did my hair in the bathroom - I am not fond of this chair.First of all, it has a distinctly cheap feel to it as you assemble it; it's not an expensive item so take that for what it's worth.Secondly, the seat straps are ridiculously located so it is very challenging to get them secured around your wiggling child.Lastly, although the circular tray does move, it takes a fair amount of force and it is not remotely smooth in operation.I ended up ordering the following seat by the same brand but a significantly better design that will work in multiple situations:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JVXZF2/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1	
- 1	I purchased this bib after seeing my nephew with it.  He wasn't able to put it into his mouth like soft bibs.  However when I received it the bib wouldn't fit around my son's neck comfortably.  The string of balls that's suppose to wrap around and clip into 1 side wasn't long enough.  I don't understand how this is possible when my son is only 7 months and is lean and tall...not chubby.  I wish they made this bib in different sizes since it's wonderful in theory but just didn't fit.	
1. 	The only problem I really have with this brush is that the nipple cleaner doesn't really seem to clean bottle nipples very well, it takes a bit of work to get them clean with it.I was glad to fing out, however, that this brush also works great forMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 80ml Bottlesthat I was so tired of trying to clean without a dishwasher but were the only bottles I could pump into before I bought the Avent pump conversion kit to use my Avent bottles with my Medela pump.	
- 1	I got this as a gift for someone and I was embarrassed to give it.  The frame is cheap and the material for the prints isn't great either.  I found a similar product at the discovery store that was way better.  It is not worth the money.	
1. 	This is a great gate for stairs!  We live in a 4 level split, and it allows us to keep our toddler in the upper level only and be safe.  The push-and-turn opening mechanism is very easy to use, but kids can't figure it out.  It swings in both directions (if you choose to set it up that way), and opens as easy as turning a doorknob.  The best thing about this gate is that when you're holding a kid in your arms, you just swing the gate closed, and it locks automatically when it's in place.  Also, if baby is sleeping, you can QUIETLY click the gate closed.  Very important!  We're very happy with this.	
1. 	I'm not sure what seam other reviewers are talking about - perhaps the design has changed because I don't notice any annoying seam at all.  This pillow is so comfy!  I'm 6 months pregnant and 5' 10.  I feel like the length works perfect for me, and it fits me well under the head, where I hug it, and also where I put it between my knees.  I'm sleeping like a dream with this pillow, hence the 5 star rating, though I do have a few issues.  First, why the light color cover?  I really don't want it to get dingy, so I took another reviewers advice and am using a pillowcase cut open at the end to slip onto the pillow at the head.  Also, I don't feel like the u shape really offers that much back support.  I had hoped that it would help keep me on my side, but I still find myself easily turning onto my back several times during the night.  However, I was way more into the huggable aspect of this pillow, so the back support isn't my top priority.  It's a bit cumbersome to get into and out of this pillow when you're getting up to use the bathroom multiple times a night, but it's nice to have the option of two arms of the pillow so you have something to snuggle if you switch sides.  My husband is totally envious of my pillow - I'm leaving town for a long weekend and I know he will be poaching it the whole time.UPDATE 2/15/14: I am just about to the end of my pregnancy and wanted to update my review.  I have slept comfortably the entire time and really think this pillow is amazing.  Granted, I have had a generally comfortable pregnancy with minimal back pain and no hip pain.  Nevertheless, I am SO happy with this purchase, and credit it with many nights of peaceful slumber.	
1. 	This bib is absolutely adorable and covers my daughter's entire top half, which is nice when you want to protect clothing from messy, cloth staining foods!I like the velcro closing in the back and the pocket in the front really does end up catching dropped food. Great buy!	
- 1	Another reviewer mentioned it as well -- this mobile is top-heavy when using the arm to attach to anything!  I've attached it to our Arms Reach Co-sleeper bassinet (making sure I put it in a section where there's a bar & not on something soft) and screwed it as tight as it would go. Within a minute the arm slowly starts to lean forward due to the heaviness of the mobile.  You can probably only use this if you're NOT using the arm (ie. using velcro strap to attach to infant carrier).  If you're not paying close attention, the mobile will fall on your baby when you're using the arm.I'm really surprised by the number of 5-star ratings this item received.  I returned the item.	
1. 	just make sure to use a thin bath towel under the baby to keep them from sliding so much, only issue I've had is that the piece for the leg split is too wide on the baby side, at four months my daughter still has a hard time having to sit there with her legs that wide apart...  it is just short of 4 wide on the baby side and not shaped for her legs to go over it either.	
1. 	my son never wanted to be in his stroller. so i purchased this when he was 2 months old... he loved it . i used until he was 6 months old , by then he was just too heavy and would kill my back. so i purchaed the hip hammock . also great product	
- 1	I am well aware of all the hype surrounding bumpers and I respectfully disagree.These &#34; breathable&#34; ones are super flimsy and didn't even fit our crib- they were loose and bulky- yes we have a standard crib. Also once you witness your baby hitting their head on these- you'll go right back to the regular bumpers! Just monitor your baby and they will be fine.	
1. 	Good diaper cloths! Been using it with my first born and now with my 1 month old baby.Will help you prevent diaper rash. Tiring to change everytime the baby wets the cloth though and time consuming to wash but worth it than having problems with diaper rash. It is really hard to use cloth diapers for the whole day so use cloth during day time and then disposable at night for longer sleep.	
- 1	I ordered these cups for my 13 month old and was disappointed in them. They leak from the top if they are sideways for any length of time (defeating the purpose of a sippy cup!) and she is easily able to use them to paint with the liquid inside. The only thing they really work for is in the car where she's only using them for short drinks	
1. 	I love these pad covers! The fabric is so soft and feels great to the touch. We just found that putting a small muti-use absorbant pad under the diaper area saves a lot of time and hassle. We keep plently on hand and just replace one when it gets soiled. That way the plush cover stays fresher longer and you dont have to remove and clean it so much. Washes and tumble dries easily.	
- 1	I hung this in my doorways. Even on the highest setting it is too close to the ground.  My son is in the 3rd percentile for high so I'm not sure why this thing is so low. Beware if you have lower doorways. This won't work.	
- 1	I purchased this to replace a Baby Bjorn potty seat. Mostly to save money. The Baby Bjorn last us through 2 kids so about 4 years. It finally got a cracked handle so it was time to junk it.My son is 3. He knows how to use the potty all by himself. This includes putting the potty seat down, climbing up and down on his own, etc etc.This seat comes with two plastic pieces that slide onto the seat to adjust to the size of your toilet seat. They are extremely loose and when I tried to adjust it to the proper setting to keep the seat stable the plastic pieces moved to the next setting.I came to the reviews and read that you have to squeeze it to get it on but this would not work for my son. He has past the age of needing help with the potty so I shouldn't have to go into the bathroom each time he needs to go to put the seat on the toilet.I also read the review about the plastic piece getting stuck in the toilet! You seriously would never consider this to be an issue unless you have had to replace a toilet because something was stuck. We have and it isn't fun or cheap! When I saw how loose the pieces were I was really concerned that my son would drop one into the toilet and flush and we'd have to buy ANOTHER replacement toilet.So I sucked it up, returned this one, and paid the extra for the Baby Bjorn. It has no loose pieces. It has a dial that you can adjust to the size of the toilet. Plus it has a handle that is perfect for hanging. I recommend the Baby Bjorn over this seat!	
- 1	inconvenient and thus useless -- i used it once (it was irritating to put on) -- i removed after the sun was no longer shining through the window (so that my kid can see better) and it was difficult to store and then got dirty and i never used it again.useless!	
- 1	Sent it back. Didn't work for me at all. Baby couldn't suck milk. Not a good product at all. Thankful that Amazon returns are easy.	
1. 	I got this multiple pack of toys so that I could keep a couple for my daughter and use a couple as shower gift decorations.  One of them in particular sounds like a cat toy, but my daughter loves it.  Glad that I was able to get 4 in a box... made it way more cost effective than if I would have had to buy separate toys.	
1. 	This was very helpful for the first few weeks, especially since I did not know how to wrap the blanket.  Once I started getting the hang of motherhood, I no longer needed it.  My baby was also not fussy and didn't seem to have any particular preference to being swaddled.	
- 1	My biggest complaint about this product is that after washing, they take a very long time to dry. The material that holds liquid is a thick section made of natural fiber, encased in synthetic fiber. I have to turn this part of the pant inside out to help it dry faster, and still, with a normal load of drying, it isn't completely dry.My secondary complaint is that it does such a good job of absorbing that my baby doesn't feel wet. I've tried Blueberry training pants and plain underwear and am having better luck with those options. This Grovia Trainer is well made but I agree with other reviewers that it is a bit trim -- my child is small and only 20 months as we are using it and it feels perfect for her size-wise. Unfortunately it isn't performing as I need it to, so I can't recommend it.	
- 1	I returned this car seat shortly after we purchased it. It was difficult to align the seat belt buckles together before latching in and I crushed my baby's finger! The seat belt holders was not convient or easy to use. It was about the same size as the maxi cosi we ended up puchasing. The brown wasn't as deep as I was expecting either.	
1. 	I only use these to put ice chips in when my little guy's teeth are hurting him. He loves it. I literally get screamed at when I take it away to refill(he's only 7 months, so I will let him slide on that). I tried teething rings and other teething toys, they helped but not half as well as these.	
1. 	I really like the Snoogle. I got it when I was around 5 months and starting to get uncomfortable at night. Now I'm almost 7 months and it definitely provides the support I need. Plus it's a nice barrier to keep my husband from kicking me in the shins in his sleep, but that's another story. My only complaint is the cover is scratchy and hard to put back on after washing. I've been contemplating making my own slipcover for it so it will be more comfortable. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.Edit - I'm now 33 weeks and probably couldn't sleep without this thing. I may be sleeping a little too soundly because when I wake up and try to roll over or get up I can barely move. But at least I'm sleeping!	
1. 	Both of my kids have loved this during the teething stage.  The one complaint I have is that they have to really bite down hard to get it to vibrate so I often found myself squeezing it for them as they pulled it to their mouths	
- 1	These look so cute, but they are not practical.  After washing once or twice, they become stiff and non absorbent.  These sit in the bottom of my burp cloth pile and do not get used.  Very disappointed.	
1. 	I wish I would have known that the only difference between these spouts and the ones for younger children is the color and the fact that these are made of hard plastic and the others are soft.  Otherwise, no difference.  I do like the Avent spouts in general as they are about as leak proof as a sippy cup spout can be.	
1. 	Love this! Carried all the essential gear to change my little one on the go. Converts any bag into a diaper bag, husband was willing to carry it, detachable and washable pad was a nice feature, great shape to cover flip down diaper stations. Minus one star as I would reverse the net pocket and the zippered pocket, I have a long baby and would rest his head where the zippered pocket is, so I kept the diapers there so it was soft instead of a hard wipes container or ointment. We are more minimalist now so this lives in the car to turn the back of our station wagon into a change station.	
1. 	Easy to track feeding, playtime, changes, naps etc.  Very helpful when nursing and even when you move on to a bottle. I work F/T so it's great to come home and peruse his day (feeding schedule, play time)  as a secondary account after talking to nanny. Would highly recommend for those Type-A personas.	
- 1	Dont like the fact that when baby pulls on the mirror or butterfly or handle the whole thing comes on her face. Then its too close she cant see and she starts crying... If i put it farther out so it doesn't fall on her face, its too far and she cant reach..	
- 1	I liked this at first. I admit I bought it because it was cheap. I did tons of research on baby carriers. I wanted something that did front carry (facing in and facing out) and back carry. I added the Beco Baby Gemini to my Amazon baby registry, but no one bought it. So try to save money, I bought this thinking it would be comparable. It is not.I've only used it as front carry, facing in. You have to wait until your baby has head/neck control before you can switch him/her to facing out. My baby has been at that point for a while now, but I barely use the Infantino Flip because it is painful to me and seems uncomfortable to my daughter. The padding near the top clip actually rubs/digs into her cheek. If I make the straps on that clip looser, she seems insecure. After wearing it for 10 minutes, my shoulder is killing me. The padding leaves a lot to be desired.I found I could easily put this on though; clip the back piece then dive into the carrier (put your head in, then put each arm in). It was much faster than the Moby Wrap a friend gave me. It beats lugging the carseat into stores. My baby plus my carseat (Graco snug ride 35) is just too heavy now that she's getting older (and she's only 14 lbs).I broke down and bought the Beco Baby Gemini. I tried a Ergo Baby (original) on in the baby box store. The straps on it were amazing, but I really want to be able to have the option to wear my baby facing outward (the Ergo baby carriers do not allow for this). I can always bring her back facing inward if she is overwhelmed, tired, wants to nurse, etc.You really do get what you pay for. If you don't plan on babywearing, or don't plan on baby wearing very long, this will do. If you want to wear your baby often, spend the money on something better; don't waste it on this.	
- 1	We got this mat for our 9 month old so while she was playing the surface wouldn't be as slippery..  It smells after 2 months of use everyday so I'm disappointed.	
1. 	I purchased these to make burp cloths. I washed them, then sewed fabric to the center piece to customize them. We used the burp cloths for months!
